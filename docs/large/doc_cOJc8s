[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for &quot;friend&quot;.]]
People with extreme hearing loss may communicate through [[Sign language|sign languages]].  Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. &quot;Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sign Language|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|website=NIDCD|access-date=17 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115163913/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|archive-date=15 November 2016|date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deaf culture]] refers to a tight-knit [[cultural group]] of people whose [[primary language]] is [[Sign language|signed]], and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who &quot;identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;book22&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Charlotte|title=American Sign Language: A Look at Its Story, Structure and Community|author2=Carol Padden|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being [[Child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]] with normal hearing ability.  It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use [[Sign language|sign languages]] as the main means of communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;padden20053&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Padden|first1=Carol A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2B4XWIFPgowC&amp;q=Deaf&amp;pg=PA1|title=Inside Deaf Culture|last2=Humphries|first2=Tom (Tom L.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-674-01506-7|location=Cambridge, MA|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bigD3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Berke|date=9 February 2010|title=Deaf Culture - Big D Small D|url=http://deafness.about.com/cs/culturefeatures1/a/bigdorsmalld.htm|accessdate=22 November 2013|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a [[disability]] or [[disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ladd20032&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladd|first=Paddy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PRLjkES83oC|title=Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2003|isbn=978-1-85359-545-5|page=502|authorlink=Paddy Ladd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lane20112&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Harlan L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KySGdskgT9EC&amp;pg=PA1|title=The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry|author2=Richard Pillard|author3=Ulf Hedberg|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-975929-3|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word ''deaf'' is often written with a capital ''D'' and referred to as &quot;big&amp;nbsp;D Deaf&quot; in speech and sign.

== Research ==

===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===
A 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-style = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain. A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting [[ATOH1|Atoh1]] can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice. Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gubbels SP, Woessner DW, Mitchell JC, Ricci AJ, Brigande JV | title = Functional auditory hair cells produced in the mammalian cochlea by in utero gene transfer | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7212 | pages = 537–41 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18754012 | pmc = 2925035 | doi = 10.1038/nature07265 | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..537G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audition===
Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson, N. R. 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Carlson NR | date = 2010 | title = Physiology of behavior | edition = 11th | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jargon''' is the specialized [[terminology]] associated with a particular field or area of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Neil|title=Writing Essays in English Language and Linguistics: Principles, Tips and Strategies for Undergraduates|year=2012|isbn=9780521111195|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyoifO5vqAAC|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jargon is normally employed in a particular [[Context (language use)|communicative context]] and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, [[vernacular]], or academic field), but any [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] can have jargon. The main trait that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is special vocabulary—including some words specific to it, and often different [[word sense|senses]] or meanings of words, that outgroups would tend to take in another sense—therefore misunderstanding that communication attempt. Jargon is sometimes understood as a form of technical [[slang]] and then distinguished from the official terminology used in a particular field of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polskaya|first=Svetlana|chapter=Differentiating between various categories of special vocabulary (on the material of a professionals speech of English-speaking stock exchange brokers)|editor-last=Raţă|editor-first=Georgeta|title=Academic Days of Timişoara: Language Education Today|year=2011|isbn=9781443833165|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBorBwAAQBAJ|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''jargon'', ''slang'', and ''[[argot]]'' are not consistently differentiated in the literature; different authors interpret these concepts in varying ways. According to one definition, jargon differs from slang in being secretive in nature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piekot|first=Tomasz|title=Język w grupie społecznej: wprowadzenie do analizy socjolektu|year=2008|isbn=9788388425387|location=Wałbrzych|publisher=Wydawnictwo Państwowej Wyższej Szkoły Zawodowej im. Angelusa Silesiusa|oclc=297524942|page=28|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to another understanding, it is specifically associated with professional and technical circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outsmarting Your Competitors: Techniques of Sales Excellence to Build Profitable Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kqqeox-tlAC|page=88|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2007|isbn=9789812614483|language=en|first=Patrick|last=Forsyth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources, however, treat these terms as synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jan|last=Grzenia|url=https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/gwara-a-zargon;6208.html|title=gwara a żargon|date=2005-04-25|access-date=2019-04-26|work=Poradnia PWN|publisher=sjp.pwn.pl|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page =385|last =Mistrík |first =Jozef|title =Encyklopédia jazykovedy|year=1993|isbn=8021502509|edition =1|location =Bratislava |publisher =Obzor|oclc=29200758|language =sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian linguistics, jargon is classified as an expressive [[variety (linguistics)|form of language]], while [[cryptolect|secret languages]] are referred to as ''[[argot]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=29–38|last=Kortas|first=Jan|language=pl|title=Terminy &quot;argot&quot;, &quot;argotyzm&quot; w polskiej nomenklaturze językoznawczej|year=2003|volume=2003|journal= Poradnik Językowy|issue=7|publisher=Wydawnictwa Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego|issn=0551-5343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifics==
Jargon is &quot;the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group&quot;.&lt;ref name=m-w&gt;{{cite web |title=Jargon |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jargon |work=Merriam Webster |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=29 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405125946/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jargon |archivedate=5 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most jargon is ''technical terminology'' (''technical terms''), involving ''terms of art''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''industry terms'', with particular meaning within a specific industry. A main driving force in the creation of technical jargon is precision and [[wikt:concise#Adjective|efficiency of communication]], when a discussion must easily range from general themes to specific, finely differentiated details without [[circumlocution]]. Jargon enriches everyday vocabulary with meaningful content and can potentially become a [[wikt:catchword|catchword]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wodak |first1=Ruth |title=Language, Power and Ideology: Studies in political discourse |date=1989 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027286055 |pages=1–288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-pFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While jargon allows greater efficiency in communication among those familiar with it, a side-effect is that it raises the threshold of comprehensibility for outsiders. This is usually accepted as an unavoidable [[trade-off]], but it may also be used as a means of [[social exclusion]] (reinforcing [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup–outgroup]] barriers) or social aspiration (when introduced as a way of showing off). Some academics promote the use of jargon-free language, as an audience may be alienated or confused by the technical terminology, and thus lose track of a speaker or writer's broader and more important arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Steven |title=Jargon and the Crisis of Readability: Methodology, Language, and the Future of Film History |journal=Cinema Journal |date=2014 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=130–133 |jstor=3661180 |doi=10.1353/cj.2004.0052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The French word is believed to have been derived from the Latin word {{lang|la|gaggire}}, meaning &quot;to chatter&quot;, which was used to describe [[speech]] that the listener did not understand.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jargon|title=Jargon|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also come from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|jargon}} meaning &quot;chatter of birds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline&quot; /&gt; Middle English also has the verb {{lang|enm|jargounen}} meaning &quot;to chatter,&quot; or &quot;twittering,&quot; deriving from Old French.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History of Jargon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martinuzzi |first1=Bruna |title=The History of Jargon |url=https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/the-history-of-jargon/ |website=American Express |publisher=American Express Company |accessdate=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the word dates back to the usage of the word in [[The Canterbury Tales]] written by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] between 1387 and 1400. Chaucer referred to jargon as the utterance of birds or sounds resembling birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History of Jargon&quot;/&gt;

In colonial history, jargon was seen as a device of communication to bridge the gap between two speakers who did not speak the same tongue. Jargon was synonymous with [[pidgin]] in naming specific language usages. Jargon then began to have a negative connotation with lacking coherent grammar, or gibberish as it was seen as a &quot;broken&quot; language of many different languages with no full community to call their own. In the 1980s, linguists began restricting this usage of jargon to keep the word to more commonly define a technical or specialized language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mufwene |first1=Salikoko Sangol |title=Jargon {{!}} linguistics |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/jargon-linguistics |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=22 February 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields using the term===
The term is used, often interchangeably, with the term [[buzzword]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ9UAQAAQBAJ | title=Management Fads and Buzzwords: Critical-Practical Perspectives| isbn=9781136295089| last1=Collins| first1=David| date=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; when examining [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. and Frost, P., 2011.

Sociology of Organizations: Structures and relationships, 315.&lt;/ref&gt; In linguistics, it is used to mean &quot;specialist language,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Keith|title=The English Language and Linguistics Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tppMDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2017|isbn=978-1-349-92395-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term also seen as closely related to [[slang]], [[argot]] and [[cant (language)|cant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Xdv4FTyXfkC&amp;pg=PP7 | title=Slang: The People's Poetry| isbn=9780199986538| last1=Adams| first1=Michael| date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various kinds of language peculiar to ingroups can be named across a [[semantic field]]. [[Slang]] can be either culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. [[Argot]] is slang or jargon [[obfuscation|purposely used to obscure meaning]] to outsiders. Conversely, a [[lingua franca]] is used for the opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are [[pidgin]]s and [[creole language]]s. For example, the [[Chinook Jargon]] was a pidgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/jargon-linguistics | title=Jargon &amp;#124; linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although technical jargon's primary purpose is to aid [[technical communication]], not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with [[shibboleth]]s. For example, medieval [[guild]]s could use this as one means of informal [[protectionism]]. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms ''[[bit]], [[byte]],'' and ''[[hexadecimal]]'' (which are [[glossary of computer terms|terms from computing jargon]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866| title=Buzzwords– bang * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-12-31| publisher=Criminal Brief|work=Don Martin School of Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are now recognized by many people outside [[computer science]].

===Referenced===
The philosopher [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] observed in 1782 that &quot;every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas&quot;. As a rationalist member of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], he continued: &quot;It seems that one ought to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing, and the language remains to be composed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Fernand Braudel]], in discussing the origins of ''[[Capital (economics)|capital]]'', ''[[capitalism]]'', in ''The Wheels of Commerce'', vol. II of ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Century'', 1979:234. Originally found in Condillac's work [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/Condillac/Commerce.html ''Le Commerce et le gouvernement considérés relativement l'un à l'autre'' (1776)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry term==
&quot;An industry term... is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning in a specific industry. It implies that a word or phrase is a typical one in a particular industry and people working in the respective industry or business will be familiar with and use the term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4061994981/challenges-and-perspectives-in-teaching-specialised |last1=Peterlicean |first1=Andrea |title=Challenges and perspectives in teaching specialised languages|journal=The Journal of Linguistic and Intercultural Education|date=2015|volume=8|pages=149–162 |doi=10.29302/jolie.2015.8.10 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognized, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to [[slang]]. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term ''[[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]'' (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more widespread and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Monografias.com |first1=jaimemontoya |title=Technical Terminology - Monografias.com |url=https://www.monografias.com/trabajos43/technical-terminology/technical-terminology.shtml |website=www.monografias.com |accessdate=22 February 2019 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity, but often has the effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties as, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jirtle |first1=James |title=Words in English :: Usage |url=https://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words04/usage/index.html |website=www.ruf.rice.edu |publisher=2003, James Jirtle |accessdate=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In practice ===
Jargon may serve the purpose of a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; in conversation, signaling who is allowed into certain forms of conversation. Jargon may serve this function by dictating to which direction or depth a conversation about or within the context of a certain field or profession will go.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|chapter=Jargon|date=2014-01-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t2072529|title=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a conversation between two professionals in which one person has little previous interaction or knowledge of the other person could go one of at least two possible ways. One of the professionals (who the other professional does not know) does not use, or does not correctly use the jargon of their respective field, and is little regarded or remembered beyond small talk or fairly insignificant in this conversation. Or, if the person does use particular jargon (showing their knowledge in the field to be legitimate, educated, or of particular significance) the other professional then opens the conversation up in an in-depth or professional manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;

== Positivity ==
[[Ethos]] is used to create an appeal to authority. It is one of three pillars of persuasion created by [[Aristotle]] to create a logical argument. Ethos uses credibility to back up arguments. It can indicate to the audience that a speaker is an insider with using specialized terms in the field to make an argument based on authority and credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethos |url=https://philosophyterms.com/ethos/ |website=Philosophy Terms |date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jargon can be used to convey meaningful information and [[discourse]] in a convenient way within communities. A subject expert may wish to avoid jargon when explaining something to a layperson. Jargon may help communicate contextual information optimally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boggs |first1=Colleen Glenney |title=In Defense of Jargon |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/colleen-glenney-boggs/jargon_b_2200413.html |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a football coach talking to their team or a doctor working with nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dodge |first1=Amanda |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Jargon |url=https://www.copypress.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-jargon/ |website=Copypress |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accessibility and criticism ==
With the rise of the [[self-advocacy]] movement within the disability movement, &quot;jargonized&quot; language has been much objected to by advocates and self-advocates. Jargon is largely present in everyday language, in newspapers, government documents, and official forms. Several advocacy organizations work on influencing public agents to offer accessible information in different formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northampton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/info/200041/equality_and_diversity/1309/jargon_buster| title=Jargon buster – Accessible Information * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2013-04-05| publisher=Northampton Borough Council|work=Northampton Borough Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; One accessible format that offers an alternative to jargonised language is &quot;[[easy read]]&quot;, which consists of a combination of plain English and images.

The criticism against jargon can be found in certain fields when responding to specific information. In a study done by analyzing 58 patients and 10 [[radiation therapist]]s, they diagnosed and explained the treatment of a disease to a patient with the use of jargon. It was found that using jargon in the [[medical field]] is not the best in communicating the terminology and concepts. Patients tend to be confused about what were the treatments and the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnitzler |first1=Lena |display-authors=et al |title=Communication during radiation therapy education sessions: The role of medical jargon and emotional support in clarifying patient confusion |journal=Patient Education and Counseling |date=9 August 2016 |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=112–120 |doi=10.1016/j.pec.2016.08.006 |pmid=27542311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are resources that include online glossaries of technical jargon, also known as a &quot;jargon busters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;involve&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invo.org.uk/resource-centre/jargon-buster/| title=Jargon buster – Involve * splat !| last=Lundin |first=Leigh| date=2013-04-05|work=Involve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of jargon exist because of its use among specialists and subcultures alike. In the professional world, those who are in the business of filmmaking may use words like &quot;vorkapich&quot; to refer to a montage when talking to colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/filmterms20.html|title=Cinematic Terms – A FilmMaking Glossary|work=filmsite.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rhetoric, rhetoricians use words like &quot;arete&quot; to refer to a person of power's character when speaking with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/arete|title=Dictionary.com - Find the Meanings and Definitions of Words at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bay of Biscay map.svg|300px|thumb|right|Map of the Bay of Biscay]]

The '''Bay of Biscay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪ|s|k|eɪ|,_|-|k|i}}; {{lang-fr|Golfe de Gascogne}}, {{lang-es|Golfo de Vizcaya}}, {{lang-oc|Golf de Gasconha}}, {{lang-br|Pleg-mor Gwaskogn}}, {{lang-eu|Bizkaiko Golkoa}}) is a [[Bay|gulf]] of the northeast [[Atlantic Ocean]] located south of the [[Celtic Sea]]. It lies along the western coast of [[France]] from [[Point Penmarc'h]] to the [[Spain|Spanish]] border, and the northern coast of Spain west to [[Cape Ortegal]].

The south area of the Bay of Biscay washes over the northern coast of Spain and is known as the [[Cantabrian Sea]].

The average depth is {{cvt|1744|m|ft}} and the greatest depth is {{cvt|4735|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay of Biscay |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150448/ |publisher=Eoearth.org |accessdate=2015-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720203133/https://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150448/ |archivedate=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Bay of Biscay is named (for English speakers) after [[Biscay]] on the northern Spanish coast, probably standing for the [[Biscayne (ethnonym)|western Basque districts]] (''Biscay'' up to the early 19th century). Its name in other languages is:
* {{lang-ast|golfu de Biscaya}}
* {{lang-eu|Bizkaiko golkoa}}
* {{lang-br|pleg-mor Gwaskogn}}
* {{lang-fr|golfe de Gascogne}} (named after [[Gascony]], France)
* {{lang-gl|golfo de Biscaia}}
* {{lang-oc|golf de Gasconha}}
* {{lang-la|Sinus Biscaiensis}} ({{small|[[Classical Latin|Classical]]:}} ''Cantabricus, Cantabrorum, Gallaecum'')
* {{lang-es|Golfo de Vizcaya}} (''mar Cantábrico'' for the ocean area closer to the Spanish coast, the [[Cantabrian Sea]])

==Geography==
[[Image:Acantilados Vizcaya.JPG|thumb|right|Basque coast along the Bay of Biscay]]
[[Image:Biarritz Phare et Grande Plage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biarritz]] Beach ([[French Basque Country]])]]

Parts of the [[continental shelf]] extend far into the bay, resulting in fairly shallow waters in many areas and thus the rough seas for which the region is known. Large storms occur in the bay, especially during the winter months. The Bay of Biscay is home to some of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]'s fiercest [[weather]]; abnormally high waves occur there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0ErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;q=%22bay%20of%20biscay%22%20%22gulf%20stream%22 |quote=The Gulf Steam off Cape Hatteras, the Gulf of Alaska, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay are some of the other areas where storms and current combine to produce abnormally high, steep waves. |title=A Summary of Wave Data Needs and Availability: A Report |year=1979 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until recent years it was a regular occurrence for merchant vessels to founder in Biscay storms.

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Bay of Biscay as &quot;a line joining [[Cape Ortegal Lighthouse|Cap Ortegal]] ({{Coord|43|46|N|7|52|W|display=inline}}) to [[Point Penmarc'h|Penmarch Point]] ({{Coord|47|48|N|4|22|W|display=inline}})&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition + corrections|year=1971|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=6 February 2010|page=42 [corrections to page 13]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008191433/http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|archive-date=8 October 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southernmost portion is the [[Cantabrian Sea]].

===Rivers===
The main rivers that empty into the Bay of Biscay are [[Loire River|Loire]], [[Charente River|Charente]], [[Garonne]], [[Dordogne River|Dordogne]], [[Adour]], [[Nivelle River|Nivelle]], [[Bidasoa]], [[Oiartzun River|Oiartzun]], [[Urumea]], [[Oria River|Oria]], [[Urola]], [[Deba River|Deba]], [[Artibai]], [[Lea river (Biscay)|Lea]], [[Oka River (Spain)|Oka]], [[Nervión]], [[Agüera (river)|Agüera]], [[Asón]], [[Miera (river)|Miera]], [[Pas River|Pas]], [[Saja (river)|Saja]], [[Nansa]], [[Deva (river)|Deva]], [[Sella River|Sella]], [[Nalón River|Nalón]], [[Navia river|Navia]], [[Esva River|Esva]], [[Eo River|Eo]], [[Landro (Galicia)|Landro]] and [[Sor Mañón|Sor]].

===Climate===
In late spring and early summer a large fog triangle fills the southwestern half of the bay, covering just a few kilometres inland.

[[Polish Home Army]] (''Armia Krajowa'', ''AK'') [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] was vital to locating and destroying (18 August 1943) the German rocket facility at [[Peenemünde]] and to gathering information about Germany's [[V-1 flying bomb]] and [[V-2 rocket]].  The Home Army delivered to the United Kingdom key V-2 parts after a rocket, fired on 30 May 1944, crashed near a German test facility at [[Sarnaki]] on the [[Bug River]] and was recovered by the Home Army.  On the night of 25–26 July 1944 the crucial parts were flown from occupied Poland to the United Kingdom in an [[RAF]] plane, along with detailed drawings of parts too large to fit in the plane (see ''[[Home Army and V1 and V2]]'').  Analysis of the German rocket became vital to improving Allied anti-V-2 defenses (see [[Operation Most III]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;operation&quot;/&gt;

Polish agents also provided reports on the German war production, morale and troop movements, including information on German submarine operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kochanski20123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ney-Krwawicz2001-98&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtohAQAAIAAJ|title=Polish Home Army, 1939–1945|author=Marek Ney-Krwawicz|publisher=PUMST|year=2001|isbn=978-0-9501348-9-5|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish intelligence network also extended beyond Poland to Germany (olish network ais reported to aave hd two agents in German high command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kochanski20123&quot; /&gt;) and other occupied countries (for example, French and Italian naval bases), and even Europe; for example the intelligence network organized by [[Mieczysław Zygfryd Słowikowski]] in North Africa has been described as &quot;the only allied... network in North Africa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kochanski20123&quot; /&gt; In July 1941 Mieczysław Słowikowski (codenamed &quot;''Rygor''{{-&quot;}}—Polish for &quot;Rigor&quot;) set up &quot;[[Agency Africa]]&quot;, one of World War II's most successful intelligence organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;intelligence&quot;/&gt; His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt.

These were the first large-scale Allied landings of the war, and their success in turn paved the way for the Allies' [[Italy|Italian]] campaign.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Some Poles also served in other Allied intelligence services, including the celebrated [[Krystyna Skarbek]] (&quot;[[Christine Granville]]&quot;) in the United Kingdom's [[Special Operations Executive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulley2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EIh-pdIu9MC|title=The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville|author=Clare Mulley|date=2013|publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-250-03033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

After the country's defeat in the 1939 campaign, the [[Polish government in exile, 1939-1990|Polish government in exile]] quickly organized in France [[Sikorski's Army|a new army]] of about 75,000 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga1982-15&quot;/&gt; In 1940 a [[Polish Highland Brigade]] took part in the [[Battle of Narvik]] (Norway), and two Polish [[division (military)|divisions]] ([[First Grenadier Division]], and [[Second Infantry Fusiliers Division]]) took part in the [[Battle of France|defense of France]], while a Polish motorized [[brigade]] and two infantry divisions were in process of forming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koskodan2009&quot;/&gt; A [[Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade]] was formed in [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate Syria]], to which many Polish troops had escaped from [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hempel2005&quot;/&gt; The [[Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain|Polish Air Force in France]] had 86 aircraft with one and a half of the squadrons fully operational, and the remaining two and a half in various stages of training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hempel2005&quot;/&gt;

By the fall of France, numerous Polish personnel had died in the fighting (some {{formatnum:6000}}) or had been interned in [[Switzerland]] (some {{formatnum:13000}}). Nevertheless, about 19,000 Polish—about 25% of which were aircrew—were evacuated from France, most alongside other troops [[Operation Ariel|transported from western France]] to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga1982-15&quot;/&gt; In 1941, following an agreement between the [[Polish government in exile]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] released Polish citizens, from whom a 75,000-strong army was formed in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] under General [[Władysław Anders]]. Without any support from the Soviets to train, equip and maintain this army, the [[Polish government in exile]] followed Anders' advice for a transfer of some {{formatnum:80000}} (and around {{formatnum:20000}} civilians), in March and August 1942, across the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Iran]] permitting Soviet divisions in occupation there to be released for action.&lt;ref name=&quot;zaloga&quot;/&gt; In the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], this &quot;[[Anders' Army]]&quot; joined the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], where it formed [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wladyslaw&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Winston Churchill reviewing Polish troops in England.PNG|thumb|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] reviewing Polish troops in England, 1943.]]

The [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] fought under British command and numbered 195,000 in March 1944 and 165,000 at the end of that year, including about 20,000 personnel in the [[Polish Air Force]] and 3,000 in the [[Polish Navy]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Polish Armed Forces]] in the west numbered 195,000 and by July 1945 had increased to 228,000, most of the newcomers being released [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and ex-[[labor camp]] inmates.

===Air force===
{{further|Polish Air Force order of battle in 1939|Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain}}

The [[Polish Air Force]] first fought in the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]]. Significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active up to the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt; The ''Luftwaffe'' lost, to all operational causes, 285 aircraft, with 279 more damaged, while the Poles lost 333 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;/&gt;

After the fall of Poland many Polish pilots escaped via Hungary to France. The [[Polish Air Force]] fought in the [[Battle of France]] as one fighter squadron GC 1/145, several small units detached to French squadrons, and numerous flights of industry defence (in total, 133 pilots, who achieved 53–57 victories for a loss of 8 men in combat, what was 7.93% of allied victories).&lt;ref name=&quot;cynk&quot;/&gt;

Later, Polish pilots fought in the [[Battle of Britain]], where the [[Polish 303 Fighter Squadron]] claimed the highest number of kills of any Allied squadron. From the very beginning of the war, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) had welcomed foreign pilots to supplement the dwindling pool of British pilots. On 11 June 1940, the [[Polish Government in Exile]] signed an agreement with the British Government to form a Polish Army and Polish Air Force in the United Kingdom. The first two (of an eventual ten) Polish fighter squadrons went into action in August 1940.  Four Polish squadrons eventually took part in the Battle of Britain ([[No. 300 Polish Bomber Squadron|300]] and [[No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron|301]] Bomber Squadrons; [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron|302]] and [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron|303]] Fighter Squadrons), with 89 Polish pilots. Together with more than 50 Poles fighting in British squadrons, a total of 145 Polish pilots defended British skies. Polish pilots were among the most experienced in the battle, most of them having already fought in the 1939 September Campaign in Poland and the 1940 Battle of France.  Additionally, prewar Poland had set a very high standard of pilot training.  The 303 Squadron, named after the Polish–American hero, General [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], claimed the highest number of kills (126) of all fighter squadrons engaged in the Battle of Britain, even though it only joined the combat on August 30, 1940&lt;ref name=&quot;overestimated&quot;/&gt; These Polish pilots, constituting 5% of the pilots active during the Battle of Britain, were responsible for 12% of total victories in the Battle.

The [[Polish Air Force]] also fought in 1943 in [[Tunisia]]—the [[Polish Fighting Team]] (nicknamed &quot;Skalski's Circus&quot;)—and in raids on Germany (1940–45). In the second half of 1941 and early 1942, Polish bomber squadrons formed a sixth of the forces available to [[RAF Bomber Command]] but later they suffered heavy losses, with little replenishment possibilities. Polish aircrew losses serving with Bomber Command from 1940 to 1945 were 929 killed.
Ultimately eight Polish fighter squadrons were formed within the RAF and had claimed 629 Axis aircraft destroyed by May 1945. By the end of the war, around 19,400 Poles were serving in the RAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

===Navy===
Just on the eve of war, three destroyers—representing most of the major [[Polish Navy]] ships—had been sent for safety to the United Kingdom ([[Peking Plan|Operation Peking]]). There they fought alongside the [[Royal Navy]]. At various stages of the war, the Polish Navy comprised two cruisers and a large number of smaller ships. The Polish navy was given a number of British ships and submarines which would otherwise have been unused due to the lack of trained British crews. The Polish Navy fought with great distinction alongside the other Allied navies in many important and successful operations, including those conducted against the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN&quot;/&gt; During the war the Polish Navy, which comprised a total of 27 ships (2 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 5 submarines and 11 torpedo boats), sailed a total of 1.2 million nautical miles, escorted 787 convoys, conducted 1,162 patrols and combat operations, sank 12 enemy ships (including 5 submarines) and 41 merchant vessels, damaged 24 more (including 8 submarines) and shot down 20 aircraft. 450 seamen out of the over 4,000 who served with the Navy lost their lives in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;86 years&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PolNavy&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Polish government-in-exile]] organized the ''[[Anders Army]]'' in 1941 in the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the [[Operation Barbarossa]] and evacuated it to the West, Polish communists sought to create a new army, under communist control, out of the many ethnic Poles that remained in the Soviet Union.  These were primarily citizens of the prewar [[Second Polish Republic]] that had been deported and often imprisoned by the Soviets following the Soviet annexation of [[Kresy|Poland's eastern territories]], as per the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]].  The Soviet Union created the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] (ZPP) in 1943, a communist Polish organization intended to represent the interest of Poles on Soviet soil and organize this new army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyklopedia PWN/B&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZalogaLWP&quot; /&gt;  The relocated Poles, along with numbers of Byelorussians, Ukrainians, and Polish Jews, were organized into a division, the nucleus of a force known as the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Polish People's Army]] (''Ludowe Wojsko Polskie'', LWP) but colloquially known as the ''[[Berling Army]]'' after its first commander, [[Zygmunt Berling]].  The division made its combat debut in October 1943 at the [[Battle of Lenino]].  Afterwards, it was rapidly expanded into the 1st Polish Corps, which in turn grew by 1944 into the [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]].  In 1945, [[Polish Second Army|2nd Polish Army]] was added to the LWP.  By the end of the war, the LWP numbered about 200,000 front-line soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZalogaLWP&quot; /&gt;  The Polish communist guerilla force, the [[Armia Ludowa]], was integrated with the Polish People's Army in January 1944.

The Polish First Army was integrated in the [[1st Belorussian Front]] with which it entered Poland from Soviet territory in 1944.  During the [[Warsaw Uprising|1944 Warsaw Uprising]] it liberated the suburb of Praga, but otherwise sat out most of the battle, aside from a series of unsuccessful crossings of the Vistula in mid-September.  It took part in battles for [[Bydgoszcz]] (Bromberg), [[Kolobrzeg]] (Kolberg), [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig) and [[Gdynia]], losing about 17,500 killed in action over the course of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZalogaLWP&quot; /&gt;  In April–May 1945 the 1st Army fought in the [[Battle of Berlin|final capture of Berlin]].  The Polish Second Army fought as part of the Soviet [[1st Ukrainian Front]] and took part in the [[Prague Offensive]].  In the final operations of the war the casualties of the two armies of the LWP amounted to approximately 67,000.

==Poles in the German Armed Forces==
{{main|Poles in the Wehrmacht}}
Hundreds of thousands of former Polish citizens, particularly residents of [[Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|parts of Poland annexed to Germany]], were conscripted into the German Armed Forces. Also, a number of former Polish citizens, especially members of the prewar [[German minority in Poland]] (see ''[[Volksliste]]''), volunteered for service in the German Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4CgCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Poles+in+Wehrmacht+500%2C000&amp;pg=PT48|title=Belonging to the Nation|last=Kulczycki|first=John J.|date=2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-96953-7|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The German Occupation of Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], German military personnel of Polish ethnicity, held in [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s, became a substantial source of manpower for the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]. Nearly 90,000 former German military personnel were eventually recruited into the Polish Armed Forces in the West. By [[Victory Day (9 May)]] in 1945, a third of Polish service members in the West were former members of the German Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Gundlach periscope.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV|360 degree tank periscope]] of Polish inventor [[Rudolf Gundlach]] was first used in Polish [[7TP]] tank.]]
[[File:TillyBUC.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polish mine detector]] of [[Józef Kosacki]] being used close to a [[Universal Carrier]] that has been destroyed by a mine, [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]], France (June 1944)]]
* [[Józef Kosacki]] invented the [[Polish mine detector]], which would be used by the Allies throughout the war.
* The [[Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV]] was invented by [[engineering|engineer]] [[Rudolf Gundlach]] and patented in 1936 as the ''Gundlach Peryskop obrotowy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2130006.pdf|title=Periscope for armored vehicles|website=www.freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was mounted in Polish tanks such as the [[7TP]] and [[TKS]]. Subsequently, the design patent was bought by the British and used in most [[tank]]s of World War II, including the Soviet ''[[T-34]]'', the British [[Crusader tank|Crusader]], [[Churchill tank|Churchill]], [[Valentine tank|Valentine]] and [[Cromwell tank]]s, and the American [[M4 Sherman]]. The main advantage of the periscope was that the tank commander no longer had to turn his head in order to look backwards. The design was also later used extensively by the Germans.
* [[Vis pistol|pistolet wz. 35 Vis]], often simply called the &quot;Radom&quot; in English sources, is a 9&amp;nbsp;mm caliber, single-action, semi-automatic pistol. It was adopted in 1935 as the standard handgun of the Polish Army. The design was appropriated by the Germans and from 1939 to 1945, 312,000–380,000 VIS pistols were produced and used by the German paratroopers and police as the 9&amp;nbsp;mm ''Pistole 35(p)''.
* [[PZL.37 Łoś]] was a Polish twin-engine medium bomber designed in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by [[Jerzy Dąbrowski]], and used operationally in the Invasion of Poland in 1939. Thanks to the laminar-flow wing it was one of the most modern bombers in the world before World War II.
* [[Swiatecki bomb slip]], a bomb-release system was invented by [[Władysław Świątecki (inventor)|Władysław Świątecki]] in 1925 and patented in the 1926 in Poland and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;publications&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wydawnictwa&quot;/&gt; Some components was used in the pre-war Polish [[PZL.37 Łoś]] (''Elk'') bomber. In 1940 Świątecki's invention was taken over by the British, who used it in the Avro Lancaster bomber. In 1943, an updated version was created by [[Jerzy Rudlicki]] for the American [[B-17 Flying Fortress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aircraft&quot;/&gt;
* [[Wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]], 7.92&amp;nbsp;mm [[anti-tank rifle]] developed in secret and used by the [[Polish Army]] during the [[invasion of Poland]] invented by [[Józef Maroszek]]. The rifle was development of the [[Mauser rifle]] with its own [[DS 7.92|special 7.92 mm cartridge]] with a [[muzzle velocity]] of over 1,000 meters per second. With a range of 300 metres it was very effective against all German tanks of the period (the [[Panzer I]], [[Panzer II|II]] and [[Panzer III|III]], as well as the Czech-made [[LT-35]] and [[LT-38]]) at 100 meters.
* In World War II, there was an important need to take bearings on the high frequency radio transmissions used by the German Kriegsmarine. The engineering of such high frequency direction finding systems for operation on ships presented severe technical problems, mainly due to the effects of the superstructure on the wavefront of arriving radio signals. However, solutions to these problems were proposed by the Polish engineer Waclaw Struszynski, who also led the team which developed the first practical system at the [[Admiralty Signal Establishment]], England.  These systems were installed on convoy escort ships, and were very effective against the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;xs4all&quot;/&gt;  The father of [[Wacław Struszyński]] was Professor [[Marceli Struszyński]], a member of the Polish resistance, who analysed the fuel used in the V2 rocket, the formula being subsequently sent to England.
* A [[rubber]] [[windshield wiper]] was invented by the Polish [[piano|pianist]] [[Józef Hofmann]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
* [[Henryk Magnuski]], a Polish engineer working for [[Motorola]], co-designed the [[SCR-300]] radio in 1940. It was the first small radio receiver/transmitter to have manually set frequencies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It was used extensively by the American Army and was nicknamed the ''[[walkie-talkie]]''.

===Weapons===
Polish engineers who escaped German occupied Poland contributed to weapon developments during the war. A Polish/Czech/British team brought the [[20 mm Polsten]] to fruition as a simpler and cheaper to produce but as effective derivative of the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&amp;nbsp;mm Oerlikon gun]].

The Polish Home Army was probably the only World War II resistance movement to manufacture large &lt;!--numbers, numbers--&gt; quantities of weaponry and munitions. In addition to production of pre-war designs they developed and produced during the war the [[Błyskawica submachine gun]], [[Bechowiec]], [[KIS (weapon)|KIS]] and [[Polski Sten]] [[machine pistols]] as well as the [[filipinka]] and [[sidolówka]] [[hand grenade]]s. During the [[Warsaw Uprising]] Polish engineers built several [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], such as the [[Kubuś]], which also took part in the fighting.
The KIS was designed and made in the [[Jan Piwnik]]'s &quot;Ponury&quot; (&quot;Grim&quot;) guerrilla unit that was operating in Holy Cross Mountains region. It was probably the only kind of modern firearm that could be manufactured in the forest without the need for sophisticated tools and factory equipment during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Notes==
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Numerous sources state that Polish Army was the fourth biggest Allied fighting contingent. [[Steven J. Zaloga]] wrote that &quot;by the war's end the Polish Army was the fourth largest contingent of the Allied coalition after the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZalogaHook1982&quot;/&gt; [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]] writes &quot;All in all, the Polish units, although divided and controlled by different political orientation, constituted the fourth largest Allied force, after the American, British and Soviet Armies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lerski1996&quot;/&gt; [[M. K. Dziewanowski]] has noted that &quot;if Polish forces fighting in the east and west were added to the resistance fighters, Poland had the fourth largest Allied army in the war (after the USSR, the U.S. and Britain)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walters1988&quot;/&gt;

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II. As the war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger—and others diminished. Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944–1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces in Poland (although the [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. For example, [[Norman Davies]] wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;/&gt; [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote &quot;Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;/&gt; [[Mark Wyman]] wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt; Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance until the German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941. After that point, the numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] grew rapidly. The number of [[Soviet partisans]] quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiographical&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vukšić2003&quot;/&gt; The number of Tito's [[Yugoslav partisans]] were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;Vukšić2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Velimir Vukšić|title=Tito's partisans 1941–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLix5hc4WRgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-675-1|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ac&quot;/&gt;

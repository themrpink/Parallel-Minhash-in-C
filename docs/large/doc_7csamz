'''''The Hunting of the Snark (An Agony in 8 Fits)''''' is a poem written by English writer [[Lewis Carroll]]. It is typically categorised&lt;!-- Discussed on talkpage as a way to encompass other views. Please discuss before removing; thank you. :) --&gt; as a [[nonsense verse|nonsense poem]]. Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight [[portmanteau word]]s from Carroll's earlier poem &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot; in his children's novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871).

The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young [[Gertrude Chataway]], whom Carroll met at the English seaside town [[Sandown]] in the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious [[Tract (literature)|tract]], ''An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves &quot;Alice&quot;''.

''The Hunting of the Snark'' was published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in the United Kingdom in late March 1876, with illustrations by [[Henry Holiday]]. It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange. The first printing of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem; however, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an [[allegory]] for the search for happiness. Henry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, considered the poem a &quot;tragedy&quot;.{{efn|Holiday's handwritten note on a letter from C. L. Dodgson: &quot;L.C. has forgotten that ‘the Snark’ is a tragedy…&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Lot 646: Carroll, Lewis [Charles Lutwidge Dodgson] The Hunting Of The Snark: An Agony In Eight Fits.

''The Hunting of the Snark'' has been alluded to in various works and has been adapted for musicals, opera, plays, and music.

==Plot==

===Setting===
''The Hunting of the Snark'' shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll's earlier poem &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot; published in his children's novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871).{{sfn|Lennon|1962|p=176}} Eight nonsense words from &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; appear in ''The Hunting of the Snark'': [[bandersnatch]], beamish, frumious, galumphing, [[jubjub bird|jubjub]], mimsiest (which previously appeared as mimsy in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;), outgrabe and uffish.{{sfn|Lennon|1962|p=242}} In a letter to the mother of his young friend [[Gertrude Chataway]], Carroll described the domain of the Snark as &quot;an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatch—no doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain.&quot;{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=7}}

===Characters===
The crew consists of ten members, whose descriptions all begin with the letter B:{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=67}} a [[Town crier|Bellman]], the leader; a [[Shoeshiner|&quot;Boots&quot;]], who is the only member of the crew without an illustration;{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=17}} a maker of [[Bonnet (headgear)|Bonnet]]s and Hoods; a [[Barrister]], who settles arguments among the crew; a [[Appraiser|Broker]], who can appraise the goods of the crew; a [[Billiards|Billiard]]-marker, who is greatly skilled; a [[Banker]], who possesses all of the crew's money; a [[Butcher]], who can only kill beavers; a [[Beaver]], who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times; and a [[Baker]], who can only bake wedding cake, forgets his belongings and his name, but possesses courage.{{sfn|Carroll|1898|pp=8–14}}

[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|right|Henry Holiday's illustration of the hunt]]

After crossing the sea guided by the Bellman's map of the Ocean (a blank sheet of paper) the hunting party arrives in a strange land, and the Bellman tells them the five signs by which a [[Snark (Lewis Carroll)|Snark]]{{efn|As for the word &quot;Snark&quot;, Carroll did not give it any meaning. The word &quot;snarking&quot; had been used in 1866 to describe a sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Anonymous | title=Sermons in Stones | journal=Notes and Queries | date=29 September 1866 | series=series 3 | volume= 10 | issue=248 | page= 248 | url=https://archive.org/stream/s3notesqueries10londuoft#page/247/mode/1up | doi=10.1093/nq/s3-X.248.248-f }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;snarky&quot; was used to mean &quot;crotchety or snappish&quot; in the early part of the 20th century, but that usage was later replaced by its current meaning of &quot;sarcastic, impertinent or irreverent&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/snarky#etymology|title=Definition of Snarky|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; that adjective in turn has been back-formed to the noun &quot;snark&quot;, meaning &quot;an attitude or expression of mocking irreverence and sarcasm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/snark|title=Definition of Snark|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;snark meaning&quot;}} can be identified. The Bellman warns them that some Snarks are highly dangerous Boojums; on hearing this, the Baker faints. Once revived, the Baker recalls that his uncle warned him that if the Snark turns out to be a Boojum, the hunter will &quot;softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again.&quot;{{sfn|Carroll|1898|p=23}} The Baker confesses that this possibility terrifies him.

The hunt begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;
They threatened its life with a [[Railway Mania|railway-share]];
They charmed it with smiles and soap.{{sfn|Carroll|1876|p=79}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Along the way, the Butcher and Beaver, previously mutually wary, become fast friends after they hear the cry of a [[Jubjub bird]] and the Butcher ends up giving the Beaver a lesson on maths and zoology. The Barrister, meanwhile, sleeps, and dreams of witnessing a court trial of a pig accused of deserting its [[sty]], with a Snark as its defence lawyer.

During the hunt, the Banker is attacked by a [[Bandersnatch]], and loses his sanity after trying to bribe the creature.

The Baker rushes ahead of the party and calls out that he has found a Snark, but when the others arrive, he has mysteriously disappeared.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
Not a button, or feather, or mark,
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away—
For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.{{sfn|Carroll|1876|p=83}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development==
Two explanations of which event in Carroll's life gave rise to ''The Hunting of the Snark'' have been offered. Biographer [[Morton N. Cohen]] connects the creation of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' with the illness of Carroll's cousin and [[Godparent|godson]], the twenty-two-year-old Charlie Wilcox.{{sfn|Cohen|1995|p=403}} On 17 July 1874, Carroll travelled to [[Guildford]], Surrey, to care for him for six weeks, while the young man struggled with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Cohen|1995|pp=403–404}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Lewis Carroll Observed|editor=Guilano, Edward|author=Cohen, Morton N.|year=1976|chapter=Hark the Snark|publisher=Clarkson N. Potter, Inc|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lewiscarrollobse00guil/page/92 92–110]|isbn=0-517-52497-X|oclc=|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/lewiscarrollobse00guil/page/92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, while taking a walk in the morning after only a few hours of sleep, Carroll thought of the poem's final line: &quot;For the Snark ''was'' a Boojum, you see.&quot;{{sfn|Cohen|1995|p=404}}

Fuller Torrey and Judy Miller suggest that the event that inspired the poem was the sudden death of Carroll's beloved uncle, [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge]], caused by a patient in 1873 during Lutwidge's time as an inspector of lunatic asylums. They support their analysis with parts of the poem, such as the Baker's uncle's advice to seek the Snark with thimbles, forks, and soap, which, according to Torrey and Miller, were all items the lunatic asylum inspectors checked during their visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Invisible Plague: The Rise of Mental Illness from 1750 to the Present | author1=E. Fuller Torrey | author2=Judy Miller | location=New Brunswick | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] | year=2001 | isbn=0-8135-3003-2 | pages=91–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holiday and Carroll had some disagreements on the artwork. Carroll initially objected to Holiday's [[personification]] of hope and care, but agreed to the change, when Holiday explained that he had only intended to add another layer of meaning to the word &quot;with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Holiday excerpts&quot;/&gt; However, Carroll refused his illustration of the Boojum, preferring that the creature go without a depiction,{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=196–97}} and made him change his initial portrayal of the Broker, as it could have been perceived as [[anti-semitic]].{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=17}}

When finally published, the poem comprised 141&amp;nbsp;stanzas of four lines each,{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=22}} with [[internal rhyme]]s in the first and third lines of irregular stanzas appearing in the poem from the second fit onwards.{{sfn|Lennon|1962|pp=240–5}} Martin Gardner{{sfn|Gardner|2006|loc=annotation 58}} annotated to ''The Hunting of the Snark'' that [[Elizabeth Sewell (writer)|Elizabeth Sewell]] pointed out in ''The Field of Nonsense'' (1973) that a line in Carroll's poem has a similarity to a line in a limerick (&quot;There was an old man of Port Grigor...&quot;) by Edward Lear.

===Illustrations===
To illustrate the poem Carroll chose [[Henry Holiday]], whom he had met in 1869&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Holiday excerpts&quot;/&gt; or 1870.{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=196–7}} At the time Carroll approached him to ask if he could create three illustrations for the poem, Carroll had three 'fits', as he called the parts of his poem—fit can mean either [[canto]] or convulsion{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=11}}—completed: &quot;The Landing&quot;, &quot;The Hunting&quot;, and &quot;The Vanishing&quot;.{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=196–7}} He intended to title it ''The Boojum'' and include it in his fantasy novel ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', which was unfinished at the time.{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=196–7}} However, in late October 1875, Carroll thought about having it published during [[Christmas]]; this proved impossible, as the wood engraving for the illustrations needed three months to be complete.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=xxx}} By the time Holiday had completed the sketches and sent them to Carroll, Carroll had already created a new fit requiring an illustration. They worked this way until Holiday had created nine illustrations as well as the front cover and the back cover of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry Holiday excerpts&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Annotated Hunting of the Snark: The Definitive Edition|author=Holiday, Henry|chapter=Excerpts from Henry Holiday's ''Reminiscences of My Life''|editor=Gardner, Martin|location=New York|publisher=W.

The assumption is that the &quot;Ocean Chart&quot; (aka &quot;The Bellman's Map&quot;) has been arranged by Carroll.

There is no depiction of the Snark, nor of Boots. However, based on a draft&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipernity.com/doc/goetzkluge/32765945 shows a redrawn image from a concept draft by C.&amp;nbsp;L. Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll). The drawing was part of a lot consisting of an 1876 edition of the &quot;Hunting of the Snark&quot; and a letter (dated 1876-01-04) by Dodgson to Henry Holiday. The lot was auctioned by Doyle New York (Rare Books, Autographs &amp; Photographs – Sale 13BP04 – Lot 553) offered in November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; by Carroll, the Snark was allowed to show up in an illustration by Holiday, where it appeared in a dream of the Barrister.

The illustration to the chapter ''The Banker's Fate'' might contain pictorial references to the etching ''The Image Breakers'' by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder]], to [[William Sidney Mount]]'s painting ''The Bone Player'' and to a photograph by [[Duchenne de Boulogne|Benjamin Duchenne]] used for a drawing in [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] 1872 book ''[[The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnightLetter99&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kluge, Goetz | title=Nose Is a Nose Is a Nose | url=https://archive.org/services/img/knightletterno9929lewi | journal=Knight Letter | date=December 2017 | series=Number 99 | page= 30~31 | issn=0193-886X}} ([https://snrk.de/knight-letter-links/kl-fall2017 Author's page])&lt;/ref&gt;

Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask
The tale he loves to tell.

&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Rude spirits of the seething outer strife,
Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
Deem, if you list, such hours a waste of life
Empty of all delight!

Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy
Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled.
Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy,
The heart-love of a child!

Away fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!
Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days—
Albeit bright memories of that sunlit short
Yet haunt my dreaming gaze! &lt;/poem&gt;{{hidden end}}

Upon the printing of the book on 29 March 1876, Carroll gave away eighty signed copies to his favourite young friends; in a typical fashion, he signed them with short poems, many of them [[acrostic]]s of the child's name.{{Sfn|Gardner|2006|p=xxx}} He dedicated ''The Hunting of the Snark'' to [[Gertrude Chataway]], whom he had befriended in summer 1875 at the English seaside town [[Sandown]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=5}} He finished the dedication a month after befriending her, a double [[acrostic]] poem that not only spelled out her name, but contained a [[syllable]] of her name in the first line of each stanza.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|pp=5–6}} The stanza of his first draft concluded &quot;''Rest on a friendly knee, the tale to ask / That he delights to tell.''&quot;{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=7}} The poem was printed in ''The Hunting of the Snark'' with permission from Chataway's mother.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=7}}

Included with many copies of the first edition of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' was Carroll's three-page, religious [[Tract (literature)|tract]] to his young readers, ''An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves &quot;Alice&quot;''.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=73}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Carroll: [http://www.snrk.de/snarkhunt/#easter An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves &quot;Alice&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Largely written on 5 February 1876, ''An Easter Greeting'' explores the concept of innocence and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] through biblical [[allusions]] and literary allusions to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers [[William Blake]] and [[William Wordsworth]].{{sfn|Cohen|1995|p=403}}{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=73}} Gardner suggests that Carroll included the tract as a way of balancing the dark tone of the poem.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=73}} Scholar Selwyn Goodacre speculates that, as many copies of first-edition of the poem contain the tract, there is a possibility that all first editions originally had a copy of ''An Easter Greeting''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Listing &amp; Translations&quot;/&gt;

The first printing of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' consisted of 10,000 copies.{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=198–9}} By the conclusion of 1876, it had seen two reprints, with a total of 18,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgson handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Sidney Herbert|last2=Madan|first2=Falconer|title=Handbook of the literature of the Rev. C.L. Dodgson|location=[[Folkestone, England]]|publisher=Dawson|date=1979|page=[https://archive.org/details/lewiscarrollhand00will_0/page/68 68]|isbn=9780712909068|oclc=5754676|url=https://archive.org/details/lewiscarrollhand00will_0/page/68}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 19,000 copies circulating.{{sfn|Clark|1979|pp=198–9}} In total, the poem was reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgson handbook&quot;/&gt;

''The Hunting of the Snark'' received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]''{{'}}s [[Andrew Lang]] criticised Carroll's decision to use poetry instead of prose and its too appealing title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' described it as &quot;the most bewildering of modern poetry,&quot; wondering &quot;if he has merely been inspired to reduce to idiotcy as many readers and more especially reviewers, as possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; According to ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Carroll's work had progressively worsened after ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865), with ''The Hunting of the Snark'' being the worst of his works and &quot;not worthy [of] the name of nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; While ''[[The Spectator]]''  wrote that the poem's final line had the potential to become a [[proverb]], it criticised the poem as &quot;a failure&quot; that might have succeeded with more work from the author.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'' wrote that the poem offered &quot;endless speculation&quot; as to the true identity of the Snark, although the unnamed reviewer felt that the familiar nature of Carroll's nonsense weakened its effect for the reader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt; Conversely, ''[[The Graphic]]'' praised the poem as a welcome departure from the ''Alice'' books, and called it &quot;a glorious piece of nonsense,&quot; that could appeal to all ''Alice'' fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hark the Snark&quot;/&gt;

&quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; has in common some elements with Carroll's other works. It shares its author's love of puns on the word 'fit' with ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'',{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=12}} and mentions of &quot;candle-ends&quot; and &quot;toasted cheese&quot; with his supernatural poem ''[[Phantasmagoria (poem)|Phantasmagoria]]''.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=22}} Additionally all three works include the number &quot;42&quot;.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=37}} Another of Carroll's children's novels, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno Concluded]]'' (1893) makes a reference to the Boojum.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|page=34}}

Other illustrators of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' include [[Peter Newell]] (1903), Edward A. Wilson (1932), [[Mervyn Peake]] (1941), Aldren Watson (1952), [[Tove Jansson]] (1959), [[Helen Oxenbury]] (1970), Byron Sewell (1974), John Minnion (1974), [[Harold Jones (artist)|Harold Jones]] (1975), [[Ralph Steadman]] (1975), [[Quentin Blake]] (1976), [[Frank Hinder]] (1989) and Brian Puttock (1997).&lt;ref name=&quot;Listing &amp; Translations&quot;/&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:Fit the Eigth - The Vanishing.png|thumb|left|alt=|In Holiday's illustration to the final ''fit'' of ''The Hunting of the Snark'', the Baker's hidden face and some part of the Boojum can be seen, according to some scholars.{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=67}}{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=70}}]]
Various themes have been suggested by scholars. According to biographer Florence Becker Lennon, the poem's &quot;[[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of loss of name or identity&quot; is typical of Carroll's work.{{sfn|Lennon|1962|p=243}} Richard Kelly writes that the poem contains a &quot;theme of annihilation.&quot;{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=27}}&lt;!-- page number needed for &quot;[[Martin Gardner]] writes that the inadequacy of language, meaning, and symbol is a recurring theme in ''The Hunting of the Snark''.&quot;{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=}}--&gt; Furthermore, Edward Guiliano feels that the ''Snark'' is within the nonsense tradition of [[Thomas Hood]] and, especially, [[W. S. Gilbert]], the librettist of the famous [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] team. According to him, a case can be made for a direct influence of Gilbert's [[Bab Ballads]] on ''The Hunting of the Snark'', based on the fact that Carroll was well-acquainted with the comic writing and the theatre of his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Guiliano|chapter=Lewis Carroll, Laughter and Despair, and the Hunting of the Snark|title=Lewis Carroll|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/lewiscarroll00bloo|chapter-url-access=registration|editor=Harold Bloom|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|date=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/lewiscarroll00bloo/page/124 124]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to various letters asking for the meaning of the poem, Carroll often replied that he did not know.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=xxxvii}} However, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an [[allegory]] for the search for happiness.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=xxxviii}}

Widely varying interpretations of ''The Hunting of the Snark'' have been suggested: an allegory for tuberculosis,{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=xxiv}} a mockery of the [[Tichborne case]], a satire of the controversies between religion and science, the repression of Carroll's sexuality, and a piece against vivisection, among others.{{sfn|Cohen|1995|pages=410}} According to Cohen, the poem represents a &quot;voyage of life&quot;, with the Baker's disappearance caused by his violation of the laws of nature by hoping to unravel its mysteries.{{sfn|Cohen|1995|pp=400–1}} Lennon sees ''The Hunting of the Snark'' as &quot;a tragedy of frustration and bafflement,&quot; comparable to British actor [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s early comedies.{{sfn|Lennon|1962|p=241}}

According to Kelly, ''The Hunting of the Snark'' is &quot;Carroll's comic rendition of his fears of disorder and chaos, with the comedy serving as a psychological defense against the devastating idea of personal annihilation.&quot;{{sfn|Kelly|1990|pp=66–7}} Kelly writes that the Bellman's Rule of Three and starting each character's name with the letter&amp;nbsp;'''B''' are &quot;notable attempts to create a sense of order and meaning out of chaos.&quot;{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=67}}

[[F. C. S. Schiller]], writing under the pseudonym &quot;Snarkophilus Snobbs&quot;, interprets the poem as an allegory of Man's attempt to understand &quot;the Absolute&quot;, and the members of the crew as representing different cultural approaches to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Commentary on the ''Snark''&quot;, reprinted in ''The Annotated Hunting of the Snark, the Definitive Edition''&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretation of the Sixth Fit, &quot;The Barrister's Dream&quot; is particularly notable: he reads the trial of the pig for deserting its sty as symbolizing the ethical debate about whether [[suicide]] should be condemned as an immoral or culpable action. The pig who deserts its sty represents the suicidal person who abandons life. (Like the pig, he's guilty – but being dead, is not punishable.)

[[Martin Gardner]] sees the poem as dealing with [[Existential angst#Angst|existential angst]],{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=xxxvi}} and states that the Baker may be Carroll's satire of himself, pointing to the fact that the Baker was named after a beloved uncle, as was Carroll, and that the two were around the same age at the time of the writing of the poem.{{sfn|Gardner|2006|pp=37–8}} Alternatively, Larry Shaw of the [[fan magazine]] ''Inside and Science Fiction Advertiser'' suggests that the Boots, being the Snark, actually murdered the Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shaw, Larry|title=The Baker Murder Case|journal=Inside and Science Fiction Advertiser|date=September 1956|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gardner|2006|p=69}}

Also references to religious issues had been suggested, like the Baker's 42 boxes being a reference to [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s ''Forty-Two Articles'' with a focus on the last article on eternal damnation,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheCarrollian31&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gardiner, Karen| title=Life, Eternity, and Everything: Hidden Eschatology in the Works of Lewis Carroll | journal=The Carrollian | date=July 2018 | series=Number 31 | page= 25~41 | issn=1462-6519}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Holiday's illustration to the last chapter containing a pictorial allusion to  Cranmer's burning.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnightLetter100&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kluge, Goetz | title=Burning the Baker | url=https://archive.org/details/knightletterno10030lewi | journal=Knight Letter | date=July 2018 | series=Number 100 | page= 55~56 | issn=0193-886X}} ([https://snrk.de/knight-letter-links/kl-spring2018 Author's page])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseph Papp's ''Pirates''==
[[File:Pirates-of-penzance-DVDcover.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Rex Smith|Smith]], [[Linda Ronstadt|Ronstadt]] and [[Kevin Kline|Kline]] at the [[Delacorte Theatre]]]]
In 1980, [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[Public Theater]] of New York City produced a new version of ''Pirates'', directed by [[Wilford Leach]] and choreographed by [[Graciela Daniele]], at the [[Delacorte Theatre]] in [[Central Park]], as a [[Shakespeare in the Park]] summer event. Musical direction and arrangements were by William Elliott. The show played for 10 previews and 35 performances. It then transferred to Broadway, opening on 8 January 1981 for a run of 20 previews and 787 regular performances at the [[George Gershwin Theatre|Uris]] and [[Minskoff Theatre|Minskoff]] Theatres, the longest run for any Gilbert and Sullivan production in history.&lt;ref name=Bradley76&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; This take on ''Pirates'' earned enthusiastic reviews&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Rich|Rich, Frank]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/09/theater/stage-pirates-of-penzance-on-broadway.html?scp=1&amp;sq=papp%20%22Pirates%20of%20penzance%22&amp;st=cse &quot;Stage: ''Pirates of Penzance'' on Broadway&quot;]. ''The New York Times'', 9 January 1981, accessed 2 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and seven [[Tony Award]] nominations, winning three, including the award for [[Tony Award for Best Revival|Best Revival]] and for Leach as director. It was also nominated for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s, winning five, including [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical|Outstanding Musical]] and director.&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=4088 &quot;Awards: ''The Pirates of Penzance''&quot;], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with traditional productions of the opera, Papp's ''Pirates'' featured a more swashbuckling Pirate King and Frederic, and a broader, more [[musical comedy]] style of singing and humour. It did not significantly change the libretto, but it used a new orchestration and arrangements that changed some keys, added repeats, lengthened dance music and made other minor changes in the score. The &quot;Matter Patter&quot; trio from ''[[Ruddigore]]'' and &quot;Sorry her lot&quot; from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', two other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, were interpolated into the show.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt; The production also restored Gilbert and Sullivan's original New York ending, with a reprise of the Major-General's song in the Act II finale. [[Linda Ronstadt]] starred as Mabel, [[Rex Smith]] as Frederic, [[Kevin Kline]] as the Pirate King, [[Patricia Routledge]] as Ruth (replaced by [[Estelle Parsons]] for the Broadway transfer), [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] as the Major-General, and [[Tony Azito]] as the Sergeant of Police. Kline won a Tony Award for his performance. Smith won a [[Theatre World Award]], and Kline and Azito won Drama Desk Awards. Notable replacements during the Broadway run included [[Karla DeVito]], [[Maureen McGovern]] and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mabel; [[Robby Benson]], [[Patrick Cassidy (actor)|Patrick Cassidy]] and [[Peter Noone]] as Frederic; [[Treat Williams]], [[Gary Sandy]], [[James Belushi]] and [[Wally Kurth]] as the Pirate King; [[David Garrison]] as the Sergeant; [[George S. Irving]] as the Major-General; and [[Kaye Ballard]] as Ruth. The Los Angeles cast of the production featured [[Barry Bostwick]] as the Pirate King, [[Jo Anne Worley]] as Ruth, [[Clive Revill]] as the Major-General, Dawber as Mabel, [[Paxton Whitehead]] as the Sergeant, [[Caroline Peyton]] as Edith and [[Andy Gibb]] as Frederic.&lt;ref name=IBDB/&gt;

[[File:Opera Australia's Pirates of Penzance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Opera Australia]]'s 2007 touring production of ''Pirates'', with [[Anthony Warlow]] as the Pirate King]]
The production opened at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, on 26 May 1982, to generally warm reviews, for a run of 601 performances, earning an [[Olivier Award]] nomination as Outstanding Musical and another for Curry. Notable among the cast were [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] and [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] as the Major-General; [[Pamela Stephenson]] as Mabel; [[Michael Praed]] and Peter Noone as Frederic; [[Tim Curry]], [[Timothy Bentinck]], [[Oliver Tobias]] and [[Paul Nicholas]] as the Pirate King; [[Chris Langham]] as the Sergeant of Police; [[Annie Ross]] as Ruth; [[Bonnie Langford]] as Kate; and [[Louise Gold]] as Isabel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theatre Record]]'', 19 May 1982 to 2 June 1982, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian production opened in Melbourne in January 1984, opening the new [[Victorian Arts Centre]], directed by John Feraro. It starred [[Jon English]] as the Pirate King, [[Simon Gallaher]] as Frederic, [[June Bronhill]] as Ruth, [[David Atkins]] as the Sergeant of Police and [[Marina Prior]] as Mabel. The six-week limited season was followed by an Australian national tour from 1984 to 1986 and another tour with same cast in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=Bradley76/&gt; In 1985, Papp's ''Pirates'' opened the new [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]] in Brisbane, setting attendance records that were not surpassed until many years later by ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Gallaher's [[Essgee Entertainment]] version of ''Pirates'' was inspired by the Papp version.&lt;ref name=Bradley76/&gt; The Papp version also inspired foreign-language productions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt;

The Papp production was turned into [[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|a film in 1983]], with the original Broadway principal cast reprising their roles, except that [[Angela Lansbury]] replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. The film has been shown occasionally on television. Another film based loosely on the opera and inspired by the success of the Papp version, ''[[The Pirate Movie]]'', was released during the Broadway run.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narrfilm.htm &quot;The G&amp;S Operas on Film&quot;]. ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 3 September 2008, accessed 2 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&quot;[Papp's version] has been regularly revived on both sides of the Atlantic – a British revival in 2000 transferred from the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, to the Open Air Theatre in Regents' Park – and has also become well established in the repertoire of amateur student societies. No other production has had as much lasting impact or influence. ... It also helped to promote G&amp;S in places where it has been little performed and bring it to the attention of a much wider and younger audience&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bradley76/&gt;}}

The Papp production design has been widely imitated in later productions of ''Pirates'', even where traditional orchestration and the standard score are used.&lt;ref name=Bradley76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Papp-style production played at the Savoy Theatre in 2004. See [http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/piratesofpenzance.html &quot;''The Pirates of Penzance'' – 2004&quot;], ThisIsTheatre.com, accessed 17 November 2020. This production, directed by Steven Dexter and presented by Raymond Gubbay, used a new musical arrangement, because Papp's designs and musical arrangements created for the Papp production are protected by copyright; an unlicensed 1982 production mounted in Dublin in advance of Papp's own London production was enjoined from transferring to London by a successful lawsuit. See Bennetts, Leslie. [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/movies/pirating-of-the-pirates-of-penzance.html &quot;Pirating of ''The Pirates of Penzance''&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 18 August 1982, accessed 11 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern productions are also influenced by the Disney film franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', combining aspects of the Papp production with the Disney design concepts. Not all of these revivals have generated the same enthusiasm as Papp's 1980s productions. A 1999 UK touring production received this critique: &quot;No doubt when Papp first staged this show in New York and London it had some quality of cheek or chutzpah or pizzazz or irony or something that accounted for its success. But all that's left now ... is a crass Broadway-style musical arrangement ground out by a seven-piece band, and the worst kind of smutty send-up of a historic piece of art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, Joyce.

==Recordings==
''The Pirates of Penzance'' has been recorded many times, and the critical consensus is that it has fared well on record.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]]. &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, ''Gramophone'', November 1993, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete recording of the score was in 1921, under the direction of [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], but with established recording singers rather than D'Oyly Carte Opera Company performers.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' said of a new set with a mainly D'Oyly Carte cast, &quot;This new recording represents the high-water mark so far as Gilbert and Sullivan opera is concerned. In each of the previous Savoy albums there have been occasional lapses which prevented one from awarding them unqualified praise; but with the ''Pirates'' it is happily otherwise; from first to last, and in every bar, a simply delightful production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gramophone'', September 1929, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Of later recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1968 recording (with complete dialogue) is highly regarded: The online ''Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' says, &quot;This recording is one of the best D'Oyly Carte sets of all time, and certainly the best ''Pirates''&quot;,&lt;ref name=disco&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/pir1968.htm &quot;The 1968 D'Oyly Carte ''Pirates''&quot;]. ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 7 September 2008, accessed 30 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc'' also recommends it.&lt;ref&gt;March (1993), pp. 437–38&lt;/ref&gt; So too does the ''Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music'', alongside the 1993 [[Charles Mackerras|Mackerras]] recording.&lt;ref&gt;March (2007), p. 1338&lt;/ref&gt; The opera critic [[Alan Blyth]] recommended the D'Oyly Carte recording of 1990: &quot;a performance full of the kind of life that can only come from the experience of stage performances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The online ''Discography'' site also mentions the 1981 Papp recording as &quot;excellent&quot;, despite its inauthentic 1980 re-orchestrations that &quot;changed some of the timbres so as to appeal to a rock-oriented public&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Of the available commercial videos, the ''Discography'' site considers the Brent Walker better than the Papp version.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Other notable instances of references to ''Pirates'' include a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on 29 February 1940, memorialising that Frederic was finally out of his [[indenture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1940/02/29/archives/frederic-goes-free.html?sq=%2522Pirates%2520of%2520Penzance%2522%25201940&amp;scp=3&amp;st=cse &quot;Frederic Goes Free&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 29 February 1940, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Six years previously, the arms granted to the [[Penzance|municipal borough of Penzance]] in 1934 contain a pirate dressed in Gilbert's original costuming, and Penzance had a rugby team called the Penzance Pirates, which is now called the [[Cornish Pirates]]. In 1980, [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote a short story called &quot;The Year of the Action&quot;, concerning whether the action of ''Pirates'' took place on 1 March 1873, or 1 March 1877 (depending on whether Gilbert took into account the fact that 1900 was not a leap year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book303.html &quot;The Year of the Action&quot;] in ''[[Banquets of the Black Widowers]]'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of [[Laurie R.

The music from the chorus of &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;, which begins &quot;Come, friends, who plough the sea,&quot; was used in the popular American song, &quot;[[Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here]].&quot; &quot;With cat-like tread&quot; is also part of the soundtrack, along with other Gilbert and Sullivan songs, in the 1981 film, ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', and it was pastiched in the &quot;HMS Yakko&quot; episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' in a song about surfing a whale.&lt;ref name=MUGSS&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061013163848/http://www.mugss.org/society/gands/culture/ &quot;G&amp;S Pop culture references&quot;], Manchester Universities Gilbert and Sullivan Society, accessed 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constantine VIII Porphyrogenitus''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντῖνος Η΄ Πορφυρογέννητος}}, ''Kōnstantinos&amp;nbsp;VIII Porphyrogénnetos''; 960&amp;nbsp;– 11 November 1028) was ''[[de jure]]'' [[Byzantine Emperor]] from 962 until his death. He was the younger son of Emperor [[Romanos II]] and Empress [[Theophano (born Anastaso)|Theophano]]. He was nominal co-emperor for 63 years, successively with his father; stepfather, [[Nikephoros II Phokas]]; uncle, [[John I Tzimiskes]]; and brother, [[Basil II]].

Basil II died childless on 15 December 1025 and thus left the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in Constantine's hands. Constantine had no interest in politics, statecraft or the military. His brief reign is said to have been &quot;an unmitigated disaster&quot;, sparking &quot;a collapse of the military power of the Empire&quot;. Constantine had no sons, so shortly before his death he married his daughter [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoë]] to his chosen successor, [[Romanos Argyros]].

==Family==
{{stack|[[Image:GoldHistamenonZoeAndTheodora1042.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Gold ''[[histamenon]]'' of Constantine's daughters Zoë and Theodora]]
}}
Constantine's father, [[Romanos II]], was the sixth Byzantine emperor of the [[Macedonian dynasty]]. After the death of his first wife, Bertha (who took the name Eudocia), daughter of [[Hugh of Arles]], he fell in love with and married an innkeeper's daughter from the Peloponnese, Theophano. Contemporaries called Theophano the most beautiful woman in Christendom as well as ambitious, an inveterate schemer and utterly amoral. She bore Romanos four children, including Constantine, born in 960, and his elder brother [[Basil II|Basil]], born in 958.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=174}} His sister [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]]'s hand was considered such a prize that [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] converted to Christianity in order to marry her.{{sfn|SkylitzesWortley|2010|p=319 (footnote)}} Aged eight, Constantine was engaged to a daughter of Emperor [[Boris II of Bulgaria]] but in the end he married a Byzantine aristocrat, [[Helena, daughter of Alypius]]. By Helena he had three daughters: Eudokia, who became a nun; [[Zoë Porphyrogenita|Zoë]], who was empress for 22 years; and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]], who reigned for 18 months and was the last of the Macedonian line.{{sfn|Garland|1999|pp=165–66}}

Romanos died in 963, amidst rumours that Theophano had poisoned him; Constantine was three years old. Constantine and his brother had been crowned co-emperors by their father in March 962.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|last=Brand|first=Charles M.|last2=Cutler|first2=Anthony|title=Constantine VIII|pages=503–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widowed Theophano installed herself as regent for her sons and promptly purged the [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|imperial government]], appointing her own men. Passing over a bevy of suitors among Constantinople's courtiers, she made an alliance with [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]. Nikephoros, a physically repulsive ascetic twice her age, was the greatest military hero of the Empire. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. Nikephoros entered Constantinople three months after Romanos' death, breaking the resistance of [[Joseph Bringas]], a eunuch palace official who had been Romanos' chief counsellor, in street fighting.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=284}} Nikephoros was crowned emperor in the presence of his nominal co-emperors, Constantine and Basil. A month later he married their mother.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=174–75, 183–190}}

Six years later, Nikephoros was murdered at Theophano's instigation and her lover and co-conspirator [[John Tzimiskes]] was acclaimed emperor. Tzimiskes proposed to marry Theophano but the Empress had by then been too damaged by gossip and rumours, many of them accurate. [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuktos]] refused to perform the coronation unless Tzimiskes removed the &quot;scarlet empress&quot; from the court. Tzimiskes calculated that his legitimacy would be better enhanced by church approval than betrothal to the unpopular empress and acceded to the Patriarch's demands. Theophano was sent into exile and Tzimiskes was crowned, again with Constantine and Basil as co-emperors.{{sfn|Ash|1995|p=248}}{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=240}} He married [[Theodora, daughter of Constantine VII|Theodora]], Constantine's aunt.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=261}}

===Adulthood===
Following the death of Tzimiskes in January 976, Basil and Constantine took power. Although the sixteen year old Constantine was nominally co-emperor it was clear that Basil was senior emperor as ''Basileus'' Basil II.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=264}} Constantine as a young man was tall and graceful, he was a superb horseman and trained his own horses. He competed in athletic and wrestling competitions, which he brought back into fashion. He had an excellent speaking voice and a good grasp of rhetoric. He was a gourmet and a gourmand.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=267, 269}} He had no interest in politics, statecraft or the military and never developed any.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=231}} Constantine led troops alongside his brother in 989; the campaign ended without any combat and Constantine was not appointed to military command again.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=242–43}}

===Emperor===
[[File:Histamenon nomisma-Constantine VIII-sb1776.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Histamenon]]'' of Constantine VIII. On the reverse is an image of [[Christ]].]]

Basil II had an illustrious reign, earning the sobriquet &quot;Bulgar-slayer&quot; (Bulgaroktonus). He died childless on 15 December 1025 and Constantine, a sixty-five-year-old widower, became sole emperor as Constantine VIII. He had been a co-emperor for sixty-three years but had always been content to enjoy the privileges of imperial status, without concerning himself with state affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|last=Brand|first=Charles M.|last2=Cutler|first2=Anthony|title=Constantine VIII|pages=503–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his life in the search of pleasure and entertainment, or amusing himself with riding and hunting. He was &quot;of frivolous disposition, he desired nothing more than to pass his life wallowing in extravagant pleasures.&quot;{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=265}} Constantine as emperor carried on as he always had – hunting, feasting, and enjoying life – and avoided state business as much as possible.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=265}}

By the time he became emperor he had chronic gout and could hardly walk. He met challenges with impulsive cruelty, persecuting the nobility and ordering an orgy of torture; [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinding]] was a favoured punishment for crimes real or imagined. He filled the senior court and state positions with nonentities. Within months the land laws of Basil&amp;nbsp;II were dropped, under pressure from the [[Anatolia]]n aristocracy. &quot;Devoid of any semblance of moral fibre&quot;{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=268}} he would grant any concession.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=268}} Favouritism failed to win him friends and he persecuted the nobility when he felt threatened by conspiracy. The start of the decline of the Byzantine Empire has been linked to Constantine's accession to the throne.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=283}} His reign has been described as &quot;an unmitigated disaster&quot;, &quot;a break up of the system&quot; and causing &quot;a collapse of the military power of the Empire&quot;.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=283, 268}}{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=264}}

He ruled for less than three years before his death on 11 November 1028. On his deathbed, and without a male heir, Constantine recalled the senior aristocrat [[Constantine Dalassenos (duke of Antioch)|Constantine Dalessenos, Duke of Antioch]], to the capital in order to marry his daughter Zoë. The Dalassenus were one of the few powerful patrician families who had been unswervingly loyal to the Macedonian dynasty.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=269}} Constantine Dalassenos set out from his estates in the [[Armeniac Theme]], but before reaching [[Constantinople]] the situation changed: the emperor's advisors preferred a weak ruler whom they could control, and, typically, Constantine was persuaded. He choose [[Romanos III Argyros|Romanos Argyros]] instead, forcing him to divorce his wife and marry Zoë. The wedding took place only three days before Constantine died on 11 November 1028. Romanos was crowned Romanos III ({{reign|1028|1034}}) four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patlagean|2007|pp=131–132}}; {{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=584}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=322}}

{{History of Wales}}
{{Culture of Wales}}

The '''history of Wales'''  begins with the arrival of [[human beings]] in the region thousands of years ago. [[Neanderthal]]s lived in what is now [[Wales]], or ''Cymru'' in the [[Welsh language]], at least 230,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J ''A History of Wales'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' arrived by about 31,000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2752538 | pmid=19706482 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0903821106 | volume=106 | issue=38 | title=Out of Africa: modern human origins special feature: isotopic evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans | date=September 2009 | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=16034–9 | last1 = Richards | first1 = MP | last2 = Trinkaus | first2 = E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]. During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] the region, like all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was dominated by the [[Celtic Britons]] and the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KochBritons&quot;&gt;Koch, pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who began their [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the [[Deceangli]], and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the [[Ordovices]] in 79. The Romans [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departed from Britain]] in the 5th century, opening the door for the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]]. Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed. The [[Welsh people]] were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking peoples after the 11th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;KochBritons&quot;/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s he continued studies on news diffusion. In reviewing some major studies (DeFleur, 1988), he found that despite emerging technology, [[word of mouth]] is still important, and major events that concern a broader population will travel further and faster. His research lead to the creation of the [[Media Systems Dependency Theory]] with Sandra Ball-Rokeach in 1976.

DeFleur cites his idea (formed with Timothy Plax) of the [[language]]-shaping function of the media as one of four theories on how media shape messages, and what that means for social conduct (DeFleur &amp; Ball-Rokeach, 1989). The other three are the meaning-construction function of the press;&lt;ref&gt;(Lippmann, 1920s)&lt;/ref&gt; [[cultivation theory]];&lt;ref&gt;(Gerbner)&lt;/ref&gt; the agenda setting function of the press.&lt;ref&gt;(Shaw and McCombs)&lt;/ref&gt; His transition from &quot;pure&quot; social psychology to mass communication mirrors the growth of this field. His theories, are widely cited in mass communication studies and in general theoretical surveys.

He is on the Executive Board of the Center for Global Media Studies at [[Washington State University]], an organization whose motto, &quot;Global Media Cover the World ... We Cover Global Media,&quot; connects with the focus of his recent work studying the accuracy of audience recall of news media in a cross-cultural vein (Faccoro &amp; DeFleur, 1993).

The '''Independent Media Center''' (also known as '''Indymedia''' or '''IMC''') is an [[open publishing]] network of activist journalist collectives that report on political and social issues. Beginnings were made in London and Sydney during the 1999 [[Carnival Against Capital]] then the first Indymedia Media Center was founded to report on the protests against the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|World Trade Organisational Ministerial Conference]] in Seattle. Indymedia became closely associated with the [[global justice movement]], which criticized [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and its associated institutions.

In the early 2000s, the Indymedia network extended rapidly across the globe. Volunteer-run centers were set up all using the same software (which had been developed in Sydney), so the websites all shared a format which included an open publishing newswire and use of columns. Centers later developed their own software to suit local needs. In the 2010s, the number of centers declined. Reasons for the decline included the growth of corporate social networking sites, the institutionalisation of the global justice movement and state repression. Several centers have been raided by law enforcement in the United Kingdom, United States, Italy and Germany. A slogan of the network was &quot;Don't Hate the Media, Become the Media!&quot;

==Aims==
According to the [[umbrella organization|umbrella]] homepage, &quot;Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml|title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i )))|access-date=September 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181036/http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml|archive-date=September 11, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to be an alternative to government and [[corporate media]], and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.{{r|&quot;Hanni&quot;}}

==History==
[[Image:Indymedia Edinburgh DSC04943.JPG|300px|thumb|Temporary IMC in [[Edinburgh]] covering protests at the [[31st G8 summit|2005 G8 summit]]]]
===Rise===
The origins of Indymedia can be traced to the [[global justice movement|global justice]] protest [[Carnival Against Capital]], which took place in over forty countries on June 18, 1999.{{r|Ainger}} Activists had networked globally using the internet, and had seen its publishing potential. Events could be reported as they happened, unmediated and without the need for the traditional news outlets. Plans came together for an Independent Media Centre to cover the upcoming [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO meeting]] in November 1999. The [[open publishing]] software used by the centre was developed from that used to report the carnival in London and Sydney.{{r|chat}}{{r|j18sydney}}{{r|dissent}}

In late November 1999, the first dedicated Indymedia project was ready to cover the protests in [[Seattle]], Washington. The first post was made on November 24.{{r|&quot;Pickard&quot;}} It read:
{{Quote
|text=The resistance is global ... The web dramatically alters the balance between multinational and activist media. With just a bit of coding and some cheap equipment, we can set up a live automated website that rivals the corporates'. Prepare to be swamped by the tide of activist media makers on the ground in Seattle and around the world, telling the real story behind the World Trade Agreement.
|author=Maffew &amp; Manse
|source={{r|&quot;Pickard&quot;}}
}} 
When the protests began, one hundred videographers were on the streets filming, joined by photographers and journalists, all working as volunteers.{{r|Downing|p=251}} The center acted as an alternative news source publishing up-to-the-minute reports on the protest days. Additionally it produced a newspaper and five documentaries.{{r|first}}{{r|dissent}}{{r|seattle}} Alongside other groups, the center produced ''[[Showdown in Seattle]]''.

After Seattle, the network spread rapidly. Local collectives were formed, which were run autonomously, with common rules including openness, inclusiveness and diversity.{{r|principles}} Local political context determined to a great degree the focus of the individual centers, which were each situated in differing socio-cultural milieus.{{r|&quot;Pickard&quot;}} However, it was a core theme that centers would have both an open publishing structure to which anyone could contribute and an open archive.{{r|Downing|p=252}} Editorial policies, locally chosen by any Indymedia collectives often involved removing articles which are believed to promote [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[hate speech]], and [[homophobia]].{{r|principles}} A clearly stated editorial policy is expected to be available on collectives' websites.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

Centers tended to be set up in response to meetings of groups such as the [[World Bank]] or [[G8]], to world forum events, or to party conventions, such as Democrat or Republican meetings in the US.{{r|Downing|p=243}} By 2002, there were 90 Indymedia websites, mainly in the US, Canada and Western Europe but also Australia, New Zealand and Latin America.{{r|Downing|p=243}} There was also a [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] center.{{r|n2002}} The number of centers continued growing, especially in Europe, reaching 142 in 2004 and 175 by 2010.{{r|radpar|p=426}}

===Decline===
The Indymedia movement reached its peak in the mid-2000s.{{r|radpar|p=423}} Centers in the United States began to atrophy around 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glaser |first1=April |title=Another Network is Possible |journal=Logic |date=Summer 2019 |issue=8 |pages=155–169 |issn=2573-4504 |url=https://logicmag.io/bodies/another-network-is-possible/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2014, the global network had declined significantly, with the number of active sites down to 68.{{r|radpar|p=426}} A number of reasons for the decline have been put forward. In February 2013, Ceasefire magazine had noted a decline in the use of Nottingham Indymedia, stating that activist usage of commercial social media had increased. The poverty of activist collectives to invest in resources was contrasted with the massive investments made by corporations such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Ceasefire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/indymedia-its-time-move/|title=Indymedia: It's time to move on|date=17 February 2013|publisher=Ceasfire Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180339/https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/indymedia-its-time-move/|archivedate=9 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published by the journal ''[[Convergence (journal)|Convergence]]'' Eva Giraud summarised some of the different arguments that had been made by academics and activists, which included [[flat organization|informal hierarchy]], [[bureaucracy]], security issues including [[IP address]] logging, lack of regional engagement, lack of [[social class|class]] politics, increase in [[web 2.0]] social media use, website underdevelopment, decline in volunteers and decline in the global justice movement.{{r|radpar}}

The events calendar, Alternative Bristol, pointed to security reasons for the decline. It stated that since server seizures, Indymedia UK had been used less and less, with on average only one new posting per week. It added activists were moving to other alternative media content providers and more secure methods since the Snowden leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativebristol.com/events/indymedia-uk-has-closed-meeting-to-discuss-a-replacement/|title=Indymedia UK has closed. Meeting to discuss a replacement|date=June 23, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corporate Watch]] saw the rise of social media sites and the normalization of 'open publishing' as recommodifying Indymedia's key innovations for the cultural industry.{{r|Corpwatch}}

On the 20th anniversary of Indymedia, April Glaser reflected on the movement in an article for ''Logic'' magazine. In the article, Glaser suggests that factors such as volunteer burnout, lack of resources, lack of centralized accountability, lack of leadership development, and the waning of the [[anti-globalization movement]] all contributed to the decline of Indymedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser2019&quot;/&gt;

==Police and legal action against IMCs==

===United Kingdom===
====Bristol server seizure 2005====
[[Image:Bristol indymedia.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Graffiti|Graffito]] in Bristol, United Kingdom advertising the local chapter of Indymedia with the slogan &quot;Read it, write it, your site, your news&quot;]]
Servers in the UK were seized by police in June 2005. An [[anonymous post]] on the [[Bristol Indymedia]] server came to police attention for suggesting an &quot;action&quot; against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year's Gleneagles G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;John Leyden, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/ Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server]'', The Register, June 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed that the poster broke the law by &quot;incitement to criminal damage&quot;, and sought access logs from the server operators. Despite being warned by lawyers that the servers were &quot;journalistic equipment&quot; and subject to special laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/06/314798.html ''PRESS RELEASE : Bristol Indymedia Server Threatened''], Bristol IMC press release, June 24, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the police proceeded with the seizure and a member of the Bristol Indymedia group was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/4629399.stm ''Indymedia server seized in raid''], BBC News, June 28, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Indymedia was supported in this matter by the [[National Union of Journalists]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]],{{r|bbc2005}} and [[Privacy International]], along with others. This incident ended several months later with no charges being brought by the police and the equipment returned.{{r|bristol688390}}

Prior to the original server being returned, Bristol Indymedia was donated a replacement server by local IT co-operative, Bristol Wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bristol|first=Wireless|title=Indymedia Returns! :)|url=http://www.bristolwireless.net/2005/07/indymedia-returns/|publisher=Bristol Wireless|accessdate=3 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927122908/http://www.bristolwireless.net/2005/07/indymedia-returns/|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bristol server seizure 2014====
In August 2014, Bristol Indymedia's servers were again seized by police after arsonists used the site to claim responsibility for a fire at a firearms training centre.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/anarchist-website-bristol-indymedia-close/story-22848036-detail/story.html|title=Anarchist website Bristol Indymedia to close following police raid|date=August 29, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015153857/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Anarchist-website-Bristol-Indymedia-close/story-22848036-detail/story.html|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol Indymedia stated that they would not cooperate with the authorities and that they &quot;do not intend to voluntarily hand over information to the police as they have requested&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/28/indymedia_server_seizure_bristol/|title=Legal row after police seize Bristol Indymedia server|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2000, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] temporarily shut down the satellite uplink and production studio of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center on its first night of [[Democratic National Convention]] coverage, claiming explosives were in a van in the adjacent parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lists.indymedia.org/imc-nyc/2000-August/000130.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527121316/http://archives.lists.indymedia.org/imc-nyc/2000-August/000130.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 27, 2011|title=[IMC-NYC] LAPD BLOCKS SATELLITE FEED OF INDYMEDIA COVERAGE OF DNC IN LOS ANGELES|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seizure of servers by the FBI 2004====
On October 7, 2004, the [[FBI]] took possession of several [[Server (computing)|server]] hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by US-based [[Rackspace]] Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected, including the website of a [[Linux distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/08/1097089554894.html FBI seizes Indymedia servers], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]], 2004-10-08&lt;/ref&gt; No reasons were given at first by the FBI and Rackspace for the seizure; in particular IMC was not informed. Rackspace claimed that it was banned from giving further information about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml|title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i )))|access-date=January 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613160400/https://indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The documents revealed that the only action requested by the government was to surrender server log files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/08/02|title=Secret Documents About Indymedia Server Disappearance Unsealed|date=August 2, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lettice, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/03/indymedia_texas_docs_unsealed/ ''US court files reveal Italian link to Indymedia server grab''], The Register, August 3, 2005, Retrieved August 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement by Rackspace&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml ''FBI Seizes IMC Servers in the UK''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613160400/https://indymedia.org/en/2004/10/111999.shtml |date=June 13, 2018 }}, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the company had been forced to comply with a court order under the procedures laid out by the [[Mutual legal assistance treaty]], which governs international police co-operation on &quot;international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering&quot;. The investigation that led to the court order was said to have arisen outside of the U.S. Rackspace stated that they were prohibited on giving further detail. [[Agence France-Presse]] reported FBI spokesman Joe Parris, who said the incident was not an FBI operation, but that the [[subpoena]] had been issued at the request of the Italian and the Swiss governments. Again, no further details on specific allegations were given. UK involvement was denied in an answer given to a parliamentary question posed by Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 MP Richard Allan's website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219152906/http://www.richardallan.org.uk/?m=200410 |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indymedia pointed out that they were not contacted by the FBI and that no specific information was released on the reasons for seizing the servers. Indymedia also sees the incident in the context of &quot;numerous attacks on independent media by the US Federal Government&quot;, including a subpoena to obtain IP logs from Indymedia at the occasion of the Republican National Conference,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11476prs20040830.html American Civil Liberties Union : Statement of Brian Szymanski Regarding Secret Service Investigation of Indymedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008184935/http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11476prs20040830.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the shut-down of several community radio stations in the US by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and a request by the FBI to remove a post on Nantes IMC containing a photograph of alleged undercover Swiss police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi|title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i )))|access-date=January 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613184358/https://indymedia.org/en/static/fbi|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was condemned by the [[International Federation of Journalists]], who stated that &quot;The way this has been done smacks more of intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting&quot; and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/more-intimidation-than-crime-busting-says-ifj-as-police-target-independent-media-network ''&quot;More Intimidation Than Crime-Busting&quot; Says IFJ As Police Target Independent Media Network''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206025407/http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/more-intimidation-than-crime-busting-says-ifj-as-police-target-independent-media-network |date=February 6, 2009 }}, IFJ press release, October 8, 2004, Retrieved August 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was also voiced by European civil liberties organisation [[Statewatch]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2004/oct/04uk-usa-indymedia.htm ''Was the seizure of Indymedia's servers in London unlawful or did the UK government collude?

====Subpoena for IP addresses====
On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana|Southern District of Indiana]] federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all &quot;[[IP address]]es, times, and any other identifying information&quot; for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation [https://www.eff.org/wp/anatomy-bogus-subpoena-indymedia &quot;Anatomy of a Bogus Subpoena&quot;], Retrieved on 2009-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena also included a [[gag order]] that stated that the recipient is &quot;not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] determined that there was no legal basis for the gag order, and that the subpoena request &quot;violated the [[Stored Communications Act|SCA's]] restrictions on what types of data the government could obtain using a subpoena.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;subpoena&quot; /&gt; Under [[Reporter's privilege#Department of Justice guidelines (United States)|Justice Department guidelines]], subpoenas to news media must have the authorization of the attorney general. According to a CBS News blog, the subpoena of indymedia.us was never submitted to the Attorney General for review.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;Declan McCullagh [http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/09/taking_liberties/entry5595506.shtml &quot;Justice Dept.

===Italy===
In July, 2001 at the [[27th G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]], Italian police assaulted Indymedia journalists at the Armando Diaz School where Indymedia had set up a temporary office and radio station. Twenty-nine police officers were indicted for beating people, planting evidence and wrongful arrest during the night-time raid. Thirteen were convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Arens  | first = Marianne  | title = Italy: Judgement in G8 police raid trial  | work = World Socialist Web Site  | date = November 24, 2008  | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/ital-n24.shtml  | accessdate =June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =  Campaigners fear Italy G8 trouble  |work=BBC News  | date = December 5, 2008  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7767412.stm  | accessdate =June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the federal prosecutor of Bologna Marina Plazzi confirmed that an investigation against Indymedia had been opened because of suspected &quot;support of terrorism&quot;, in the context of Italian troops in the Iraqi city of [[Nasiriyah]]. The investigation was triggered after 17 members of the coalition government belonging to the right-wing [[National Alliance (Italy)|Alleanza Nazionale]], including [[Alessandra Mussolini]], demanded that Indymedia be shut down. A senior party member and government official had announced co-operation with US authorities, and party spokesman Mario Landolfi welcomed the FBI's seizure of the Indymedia servers. Left-wing Italian politicians denounced the move and called for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Damiano Valgolio, ''The Censorers Trace leads to Rome and Zurich'', Junge Welt, October 11, 2004, cited at [http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml ''Indymedia to U.S., U.K., Swiss and Italian Authorities: &quot;Hands Off Our Websites&quot;''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020151638/http://www.indymedia.org/en/2004/10/112083.shtml |date=October 20, 2004 }}, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the aftermath of the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit]] protests, the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]] banned a chapter of the network called Linksunten. This had been set up in 2008, in southwestern Germany.{{r|&quot;NYT17&quot;}} The ministry described the network as &quot;the central communications platform among far-left extremists prone to violence&quot; and stated that it was used to spread information about violent protest tactics.{{r|&quot;BBC2017&quot;}} German [[internet service provider]]s were ordered to block communication to the website, on which police were referred to as &quot;pigs&quot; and &quot;murderers&quot; and instructions for making [[Molotov cocktails]] could be found.{{r|&quot;NYT17&quot;}}{{r|&quot;BBC2017&quot;}} The German police also raided the home addresses of several activists in the [[Baden-Württemberg]] region, seizing computers and weapons.{{r|&quot;BBC2017&quot;}}

On October 27, 2006, New York–based journalist and Indymedia volunteer [[Bradley Roland Will]] was killed along with two Mexican protesters in the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]]. People had been demonstrating in the city since May as part of an [[2006 Oaxaca protests|uprising]] prompted by a teachers strike. Lizbeth Cana, attorney general of Oaxaca, claimed the conflict was caused by the protesters and that the gunmen who engaged them were upset residents from the area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, [[Tony Garza]], however, claimed the men may have been local police.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Reporters Without Borders condemned the actions of the Mexican government in allowing the accused to go free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/Two-suspects-in-cameraman-Brad.html ''Two suspects in cameraman Brad Will's murder freed for lack of evidence''] {{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, RSF press release, December 5, 2006, Retrieved August 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Active (software)|Active software]] that was used as the basis for the first Indymedia centers' websites was written for Active Sydney. It went live in January 1999 featuring open publishing, calendars, events and contacts. In March, around one hundred Sydney organisations were listed.{{r|future}} The Active software consisted of a number of scripts and used the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] software stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.active.org.au/sydney/about/#howorg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422050446/http://www.active.org.au/sydney/about/#howorg|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 22, 2006|title=active-sydney – about us|date=April 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=future&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LHKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|title=Future Active: Media Activism and the Internet|first=Graham|last=Meikle|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|isbn=9781136727016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1999, the software's [[news feed]] feature was used to published stories, pictures and videos from the Carnival Against Capitalism.{{r|chat}}{{r|j18sydney}} The Active software was then further developed by an international collective of activists that included personnel from Active Sydney and [[Free Speech TV]].

==Distribution==
Indymedia collectives distribute print, audio, photographic, and video media. They run open publishing websites which allow anyone to upload news articles. The content of an Indymedia collectives is determined by its participants, both the users who post content, and members of the local collective who administer the site. Centres worldwide are run autonomously, however they all provide [[copyleft]] content. This rule means content on Indymedia sites can be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190906/https://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/PrinciplesOfUnity|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 3, 2016|title=PrinciplesOfUnity &lt; Global &lt; Foswiki|date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Indymedia centres themselves came out of protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in [[corporate media]] reporting. The first Indymedia node, attached as it was to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by [[activists]] as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519093045/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991223&amp;slug=A19991224010135 | url-status=live | archive-date=2011-05-19 | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991218&amp;slug=3002212&quot;Independent+Media+Center&quot; | work=The Seattle Times | title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/22220_gag09.shtml | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=Media center fighting FBI over Web data | date=August 5, 2001}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/19980_security24.shtml | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Paul | last1=Shukovsky | title=FBI raids media center | date=April 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seattle|first=National Lawyers Guild WTO Legal Group|title=Waging War on Dissent|url=http://www.ratical.org/co-globalize/NLG-REPORT.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports between 1999 and 2001 tended to focus on up-to-the-minute coverage of protests, from local [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s to [[Summit (meeting)|summit]]s where [[anti-globalization movement]] protests were occurring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In 2007, protest coverage was still being published.{{r|cc2007}} Indymedia also ran a global radio project which aggregated audio RSS feeds from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.indymedia.org/|title= Radio Indymedia| publisher=radio.indymedia.org|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slogan was &quot;Don't Hate the Media, Become the Media!&quot;{{r|Downing|p=254}}

==Criticism==
The Swiss edition of Indymedia was accused of anti-Semitism by [[Aktion Kinder des Holocaust]] in 2002, which unsuccessfully sued them for publishing a [[Carlos Latuff]] cartoon of a Jewish boy in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] saying &quot;I am Palestinian&quot;. This was criticized by IMC as an attempt to stifle criticism of Israel in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Schärer: [http://www.akdh.ch/ps/woz040402.htm Linke und Antisemitismus: Der Indymedia-Streit&amp;nbsp;– Aufpassen, was im Kübel landet], ''Die Wochenzeitung'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Junge Welt]]: [http://www.akdh.ch/indymedia4.htm Ärger im Internet: Wegen antisemitischer Beiträge hat Indymedia Schweiz den Betrieb gestoppt], February 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aktion Kinder des Holocaust: [http://www.akdh.ch/latuff2.htm Is this cartoon by Latuff, published at indymedia-switzerland, anti-Semitic?

Google temporarily stopped including some IMCs in [[Google News]] searches in 2003, due to the use of the term &quot;zionazi&quot;. [[Marissa Mayer]], at the time the product manager of Google News, explained the removal by describing the term as a &quot;degrading, hateful slur&quot; and refused to index the [[San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center|Bay Area IMC]] because it had appeared there. While SF Bay Area Indymedia agreed that it &quot;could be considered [[hate speech]]&quot;, they considered this a double standard due to Google News indexing articles using language they considered racist and defamatory against Arabs and Muslims, such as the term &quot;[[Islamofascism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2003/09/03/16398621.php|title=Google News Bans SF Bay Area Indymedia Over Israel/Palestine Controversy : Indybay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

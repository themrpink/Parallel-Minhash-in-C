A '''line matrix''' printer is a [[computer printer]] that is a compromise between a [[lineprinter|line printer]] and a [[dot matrix printer]].  Basically, it prints a page-wide line of dots. It builds up a line of text by printing lines of dots.

==Applications==
Line matrix printers are used for high-speed printing applications in industries such as manufacturing, banking, supply chain and [[back office]] environments. In these high-volume printing industries, line matrix printers are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels.

Line matrix printers can print text, bar codes and graphics. Line matrix printers were originally popularized by the mini-computer craze and continued its growth as a [[Barcode printer|bar code printer]]. Today they are sold in virtually every corner of the world and while they print as rapidly as [[line printer]]s, they can print bar codes and other graphics as well. When implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page.

==How It Works==
Often considered the &quot;backbone&quot; of many industrial and back-office systems, there are several types of line matrix printers used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution &amp; logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot matrix printers, also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot matrix printers are divided on two main groups: serial dot matrix printers and line matrix &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3: Introduction to System Administration|url=http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Introduction_to_System_Administration/s1-printers-types-impact.html|publisher=Red Hat|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; printers.
[[File:Line-matrix-movement.png|thumb|Line matrix mechanism]]

A serial dot matrix printer is a type of computer printer with a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.

Both line matrix and serial dot matrix printers, use pins to strike against the inked ribbon, making dots on the paper and forming the desired &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohta, Rosen|first=Noburu, Mitchell|title=Engineering of the color desktop printer|year=2005|publisher=CRC/Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Boca Raton|isbn=0-8247-5364-X|pages=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HixqjSEmWjUC&amp;q=Printronix&amp;pg=PA86|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; characters. The differences are that line matrix printers use a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.

The permanent magnetic field holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field. When both fields equalize, the energy stored in the spring is released to strike the hammer against the ribbon and prints a dot on the paper.

During the printing process the print-shuttle vibrates in horizontal direction with high speed while the print hammers are fired selectively. Each hammer prints a series of dots in horizontal direction for one pass of the shuttle, then paper advances at one step and the shuttle prints the following row of dots

==Line Matrix Printers versus Laser Printers==
For years [[laser printer|laser printers]] have been the popular choice, however line matrix printers have improved technological aspects and now claim to hold significant benefits over laser printers in terms of energy savings, cost per page, reliability in industrial environments and media flexibility (multi part forms, oversize media, peel off labels, cloth, or card stock). Every aspect of the line matrix printer is designed to deliver higher reliability, fast throughput, and greater resistance to rough handling and hazardous environmental conditions. The result is a product that provides a substantially lower cost over the life of the product. Industry today continues to use line matrix in the print production of mission critical business document production.  These documents are critical to keeping the enterprise operation functioning.  If these documents don't print the business workflow stops.

==Emerging Technology==
Line matrix technology continues to advance based on the need to support modern IT environments. Examples of emerging technologies include:
* Developing longer lasting ink cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printronix Launches P7000 Cartridge Series of Line Matrix Printers into Latin American Market|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110823005566/en/Printronix-Launches-P7000-Cartridge-Series-Line-Matrix|publisher=Businesswire|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integrating a &quot;Plug and Print&quot; solution.

A '''page printer''' is a computer [[Printer (computing)|printer]] which processes and prints a, whole page at a time, as opposed to printers which print one line or character at a time such as [[line printer]]s and [[dot-matrix printer]]s. Page printers are often all incorrectly termed [[laser printing|“laser printers”]]&amp;mdash;although virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist

==Components==
The components of a page printer are:
*A print engine, &quot;the unit within a printer that does the actual printing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of:printer engine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49696/printer-engine|website=PC Magazine|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a laser printer this would consist of the laser and drum and the mechanical paper feeds.
* [[Computer memory|Memory]] to process input and build up the image of a page. The printer may have its own memory or may use the host computer's memory.
* A [[page description language]] (PDL), with commands which tell the printer how to format the page. Popular PDLs are [[Printer Command Language|PCL]] (Printer Command Language) from [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[PostScript]] from [[Adobe Systems]] and PostScript clones, and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows’]] [[Graphics Device Interface]] (GDI).
*A [[raster image processor]] (RIP), i.e. a [[microprocessor|processor]] which constructs the [[Raster graphics|bitmap]] image of the page. Sometimes, this processing is done by the host computer. In other cases printers may have powerful processors to perform this task.
*A printer driver, a program ([[device driver]]) which converts the computer's information about the page into the actual PDL. Printer drivers may be included with the [[operating system]], be distributed with the printer on CDs or DVDs, or be downloaded from the printer manufacturer's home page or from independent web sites.
*A connection (interface) to the host computer.  Many printers communicate by [[Wi-Fi]].  Other popular interfaces are [[USB]] and [[Ethernet]].  Many older printers also have a parallel ([[IEEE 1284|Centronics]]) interface.  High-end printers often have a [[Channel I/O|channel interface]] for direct connection to a [[mainframe computer]].

==Page printing technologies==
There are several page printing technologies, for example:
*'''Laser printers''', in which a laser beam draws the page image on charged drum which collects charged toner and transfers the image to paper.
*'''LED printers''', which use [[Light-emitting diodes]] instead of a laser beam, but are otherwise very similar to laser printers.
*'''Melted wax (“phaser”) printers''', where solid ink is heated to the melting point and is applied on the print medium where it immediately solidifies.
*'''[[Dye-sublimation printer]]s''', where a solid ink (dye) is converted to a gaseous state ([[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) and applied on the print medium, where it immediately solidifies.

==Properties==
*'''Resolution''', 600 or 1200 dpi (dots per inch) is common in most modern page printers, often with resolution enhancement or [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] to smooth uneven lines. Higher resolutions are common. Before about 1992, the year Hewlett-Packard made the [[LaserJet]] 4, built around a [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] engine, most page printers had only 300 dpi, which made visible jagged lines and relatively poor image quality.
*'''Engine speed'''. In 1984 Canon introduced the first “small”&amp;mdash;{{convert|32|kg|lb}}&amp;mdash; laser printers which could sit on a (sturdy) desktop with a print speed of 8 pages per minute (ppm). Today, even the smallest page printers may be able to print 15–20 ppm, and the largest may print above 1000 ppm.
*'''Processing power'''. Usually larger printers have more powerful processors than small personal ones.
*'''Size''', from personal page printers at {{convert|8–10|kg|lb}} to high-volume production printers which may not be installed by one person.
*'''Cost''', both cost of the printer and the operating costs. Generally, the larger and more expensive printers have lower operating costs than the small and inexpensive ones.
*'''Paper-handling facilities''' for folding, stapling, etc., especially for the larger printers.
*'''Colour printing capability'''.  Many printers print in black only.  Colour printers usually have multiple [[toner]] cartridges, wax patrons etc. Printers using [[CMYK]] colour have four, one each for the colours cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. [[RGB color model|RGB]] printers have three, red, green, and blue, but may also have a &quot;true black&quot;. Some [[ink jet printer]]s may have additional cartridges, for example light cyan and light magenta in addition to the others, but this is rarely found in page printers.
*'''Multi-function''' devices provide additional functions such as copying, scanning, or [[FAX]].
*'''Media handling''': Most page printers accept paper, transparencies, envelopes, labels etc. in formats up to [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] and [[Letter (paper size)|letter]]. Some printers may also handle other media types such as larger formats and heavier paper.
*'''Energy consumption, noise, etc.''' Some page printers are too noisy to stay in the near vicinity of the users, even if page printers are quieter than the old [[line printer]]s and other impact printers.

A  '''pulled rickshaw''' (or '''ricksha''', 力車, りきしゃ) is a mode of [[human-powered transport]] by which a runner draws a two-wheeled [[cart]] which seats one or two people.

In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trillin104&quot;/&gt; Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by [[cycle rickshaw]] and [[auto rickshaw]]s.

==Overview==
{{main|Rickshaw}}
Rickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a rapid period of technical advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren p. 14&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 | publisher=NUS Press | author=James Francis Warren | year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/rickshawcooliepe0000warr/page/14 14] | isbn=997169266X | url=https://archive.org/details/rickshawcooliepe0000warr/page/14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diefendorf&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Amazing . . .

Peasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Mente p. 95&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suryadinata p. 37&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Chinese Adaptation and Diversity: Essays on Society and Literature in Indonesia, Malaysia &amp; Singapore | publisher=NUS Press | author=Leo Suryadinata | year=1992 | pages=37 | isbn=9971691868 | others=National University of Singapore. Centre for Advanced Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was &quot;the deadliest occupation in the East, [and] the most degrading for human beings to pursue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suryadinata p. 37&quot; /&gt;{{#tag:ref|In China, [[coolies]] performed rickshaw pulling. Other hard or demeaning jobs included being [[manual scavenging|night soil cleaners]] and dock workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suryadinata p. 37&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. In China, the rickshaw's popularity began to decline in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Mente p. 95&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Powerhouse /&gt; In Singapore, the rickshaw's popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lu p. 348&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
The initial rickshaws rode on iron-shod wooden wheels and the passenger sat on hard, flat seats. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[Natural rubber|rubber]] or [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] rubber [[tire]]s, [[Upholstery coil springs|spring cushions]], and backrests improved the passenger's comfort. Other features, such as lights, were also added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lu p. 69&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/69 69] | isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of Shanghai, public rickshaws were painted yellow to differentiate from the private vehicles of the wealthy citizens, which were described as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... always shiny, were carefully maintained, and sported 'a spotless white upholstered double seat, a clean [[Tartan|plaid]] for one's lap, and a wide protective tarpaulin to protect the passenger (or passengers, since sometimes up to three people rode together) against the rain.'&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/69 69–70] | isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rickshaws were a convenient means of travel, able to traverse winding, narrow city streets. During [[monsoon season]], passengers might be carried out of the carriage, above the flooded streets, to the door of their arrival. They offered door-to-door travel, unlike scheduled public bus and tram service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lu p. 69&quot; /&gt;

====East Africa====
In the 1920s, it was used in [[Bagamoyo]], [[Tanga, Tanzania]] and other areas of East Africa for short distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=60 Years in East Africa: The Life of a Settler | author=Werner Voigt | publisher=GeneralStore Publishing House | pages=32, 34–35 | year=1995 | isbn=1896182399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Madagascar====
[[File:Pousse-pousse Madagascar.jpg|thumb|250px|Pousse-pousse in [[Madagascar]]]]
Rickshaws, known as ''pousse-pousse'', were introduced by British [[missionary|missionaries]]. The intention was to eliminate the slavery-associated [[palanquin]]. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning ''push-push'', is reportedly gained from the need to have a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar's hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially [[Antsirabe]], but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Madagascar | edition=10 | author=Hilary Bradt | year=2011 | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | page=98 |isbn=978-1841623412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Madagascar, Volume 15 of Cultures of the World Cultures of the World - Group 15 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish |author1=Jay Heale |author2=Zawiah Abdul Latif | year=2008 | pages=75–76 | isbn=978-0761430360 | edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNax15GoPIkC&amp;pg=PT59&amp;dq=pousse-pousse | title=Madagascar Travel Guide | publisher=Lonely Planet | year=2012 | edition=7 | isbn=978-1743213018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nairobi====
Rickshaws operated in [[Nairobi]] in the beginning of the 20th century; pullers went on strike there in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Africa under colonial domination 1880–1935: 7 | editor=A.

====South Africa====
[[Durban]] is famous for its iconic [[Zulu people|Zulu]] rickshaw pullers navigating throughout the city. These colorful characters are famous for their giant, vibrant hats and costumes. There were about 2,000 registered men who pulled rickshaws in Durban in 1904; Since displaced by motorised transport, there are approximately 25 rickshaws left who mostly cater to tourists today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ethekwini Municipality Communications Department, edited by Fiona Wayman, Neville Grimmet and Angela Spencer |url=http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/discover/history/our-town/rickshaws |title=Zulu Rickshaws |publisher=Durban.gov.za |accessdate=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519145024/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/discover/history/our-town/rickshaws |archivedate=19 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=South Africa: Lesotho &amp; Swaziland | publisher=Lonely Planet |author1=Mary Fitzpatrick |author2=Kate Armstrong | year=2006 | pages=308 | isbn=1740599705 | edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
In China, from the ancient times and until the 19th century, rich and important people, when traveling overland, were commonly transported in [[Litter (vehicle)#China|sedan chairs]] carried by bearers, rather than in wheeled vehicles. This was at least partly explained by road conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the 19th century, wheelbarrow is the most popular transportation for commoners. In the spring of 1873, the French merchant Menard introduced rickshaw from Japan. The original name is &quot;Jinrikisha&quot;, meaning &quot;man-power-vehicle&quot; in Japanese. Most of the rickshaws were owned by foreign investors at the beginning, but in around the 1900s, rickshaws were owned mostly by Chinese companies. The official name for rickshaw is &quot;renliche&quot;, meaning &quot;man-power-vehicle&quot; in Chinese, but it is more commonly called &quot;dongyangche&quot;, meaning &quot;east-foreign-vehicle&quot;, or &quot;huangbaoche&quot; in Shanghai, meaning &quot;yellow carriage for rent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren p. 15&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 | publisher=NUS Press | author=James Francis Warren | year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/rickshawcooliepe0000warr/page/15 15] | isbn=997169266X | url=https://archive.org/details/rickshawcooliepe0000warr/page/15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/68 68] | isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | url=https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha | url-access=registration | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondneonlights0000luha/page/68 68–81] | isbn=0520215648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickshaw transportation was an important element in urban development in 20th century China, as a mode of transportation, source of employment and facilitation of migration for workers. According to author David Strand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sixty thousand men took as many as a half million fares a day in a city of slightly more than one million.  Sociologist Li Jinghan estimated that one out of six males in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty was a puller.  Rickshaw men and their dependents made up almost 20 percent of Beijing's population.&lt;ref name=Strand&gt;{{ cite book | title=Rickshaw Beijing: City People and Politics in the 1920 | author=David Strand | page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kosovo War==
{{main|Kosovo War}}

Between 5 and 7 March 1998, the Yugoslav Army [[Attack on Prekaz|launched an operation on Prekaz]]. The operation followed an earlier firefight (28 February) in which four policemen were killed and several more were wounded; [[Adem Jashari]], a KLA leader, escaped. In Prekaz, 28 militants were killed, along with 30 civilians, most belonging to Jashari's family. Amnesty International claimed that it was a military operation focused primarily on the elimination of Jashari and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/156000/eur700331998fr.pdf|title=RÉPUBLIQUE FÉDÉRATIVE DE YOUGOSLAVIE: Les droits humains bafoués dans la province du Kosovo|date=June 1998|website=amnesty.org|publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=3 September 2019|quote=L'opération semble plutôt avoir été menée comme une opération militaire, et les policiers qui y participaient avaient apparemment reçu l'ordre d'éliminer les suspects et leurs familles. (The operation appears to have been carried out as a military operation, and the police officers who participated were apparently ordered to eliminate the suspects and their families.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 1998, the Yugoslav Army (VJ) [[April 23, 1998 Albanian–Yugoslav border ambush|ambushed the KLA near the Albanian-Yugoslav border]]. The KLA had tried to smuggle arms and supplies into Kosovo. The Yugoslav Army, although greatly outnumbered, had no casualties, while 19 militants were killed.

According to Roland Keith, a field office director of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]'s [[Kosovo Verification Mission]]:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Failure of Diplomacy, Returning OSCE Human Rights Monitor Offers A View From the Ground in Kosovo&quot;, The Democrat, May 1999, Roland Keith&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon my arrival the war increasingly evolved into a mid intensity conflict as ambushes, the encroachment of critical lines of communication and the [KLA] kidnapping of security forces resulted in a significant increase in government casualties which in turn led to major Yugoslavian reprisal security operations... By the beginning of March these terror and counter-terror operations led to the inhabitants of numerous villages fleeing, or being dispersed to either other villages, cities or the hills to seek refuge... The situation was clearly that KLA provocations, as personally witnessed in ambushes of security patrols which inflicted fatal and other casualties, were clear violations of the previous October's agreement [and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199]]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some sources say that the KLA never won a battle, while others say it won relatively few battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Judah|title=Kosovo: The Politics of Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F0lqCkITqcC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5157-6|page=20|quote=&lt;!--It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),1 must rank as one of the most successful guerrilla organizations of modern times - especially since it has never won a battle.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perritt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry H.

==Recruitment==

=== In Kosovo ===
[[File:Hamëz Jashari monument in Skënderaj - Srbica.jpg|thumb|Hamez Jashari]]
The original core of KLA in the early 1990s was a closely knitted group of commanders consisting of commissioned and non commissioned officers belonging to reserve, regular and territorial defense units of the Yugoslav army (JNA).&lt;ref name=KoktsidisDam166167/&gt; In 1996, the KLA consisted of only a few hundred fighters.&lt;ref name=KoktsidisDam166167/&gt; Within the context of the armed struggle, in 1996-1997 a report by the CIA noted that the KLA could mobilize tens of thousands of supporters in Kosovo within a two to three year time frame.&lt;ref name=KoktsidisDam166167/&gt; By the end of 1998, the KLA had 17,000 men.&lt;ref name=KoktsidisDam166167&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koktsidis|first1=Pavlos Ioannis|last2=Dam|first2=Caspar Ten|title=A success story?

===Foreign volunteers===
Albanian recruits from neighbouring Macedonia joined the KLA and their numbers ranged from several dozen into the thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragaru551&quot;/&gt; Following the war some [[Albanians in North Macedonia|Albanians from Macedonia]] have felt that their military participation and assistance to fellow Kosovan  Albanians during the conflict has not been properly recognised in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragaru551&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ragaru|first=Nadege|title=The Political Uses and Social Lives of &quot;National Heroes&quot;: Controversies over Skanderbeg's Statue in Skopje|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00682663/document|journal=Südosteuropa|volume=56|issue=4|year=2008|pages=551|access-date=1 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222210307/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00682663/document|archive-date=22 February 2019|url-status=dead}} &quot;Some Macedonian Albanians, for instance, felt that their contribution to the military effort in Kosovo, in 1997-1999 – where several dozens, possibly thousands, fought side by side with their fellow brothers – had not been fully acknowledged.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Former KLA spokesman [[Jakup Krasniqi]] said that volunteers came from &quot;Sweden, Belgium, the UK, Germany and the U.S.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kelmendi|first=Adriatik|date=11 November 2001|title=Kosovars Refute Islamic Terror Claims|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/kosovars-refute-islamic-terror-claims|publisher=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting|quote=the KLA included in its ranks volunteers from Sweden, Belgium, the UK, Germany and the US.|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KLA included many foreign volunteers from West Europe, mostly from Germany and Switzerland, and also ethnic Albanians from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199904/90420-001-trae-tir.htm |date=20 April 1999 &lt;!-- 07:51 --&gt; |title=IN THE HOUSE OF KLA RECRUITS |publisher=Aimpress.ch |quote=Until now, the number of people coming from the West, mostly from Germany and Switzerland, has reached 8 thousand [...] from the USA have arrived at the airport of Tirana about 400}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}

According to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by September 1998 there were 1,000 foreign mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]]) and Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm|title=Kosovo Liberation Army [KLA]|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Interlanguage link multi|Abu Bekir Sidik|sr}} mujahideen unit of 115 members operated in [[Drenica]] in May–June 1998, and dozen of its members were Saudis and Egyptians, reportedly funded by Islamist organizations.

During the Kosovo conflict Milošević and his supporters portrayed the KLA as a terrorist organisation of militant Islam.&lt;ref name=Perritt144&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20influences&amp;f=false 144]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA advised the KLA to avoid involvement with Muslim extremists.&lt;ref name=Perritt3&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=catholic%20rather%20than%20Muslim&amp;f=false 3]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The KLA rejected offers of assistance from Muslim fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an understanding within the ranks of the KLA that foreign assistance from Muslim fundamentalists would limit support toward the cause of Kosovo Albanians in the West.&lt;ref name=Perritt144/&gt;

==Aftermath (post-1999)==
 [[File:UÇK monument in Đakovica.jpg|200px|thumb|right|UÇK monument in [[Deçan]]]]
After the war, the KLA was transformed into the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]], which worked alongside NATO forces patrolling the province.&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;[[Council on Foreign Relations]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509031137/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10159/ Terrorist Groups and Political Legitimacy], 16 March 2006, prepared by Michael Moran&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 there was unrest in Kosovska Mitrovica, with a Yugoslav police officer and physician killed, and three officers and a physician wounded, in February. In March, the FRY complained about the escalation of violence in the region, claiming this showed that the KLA was still active. Between April and September the FRY issued several documents to the UN Security Council about violence against Serbs and other non-Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations|title=Yearbook of the United Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yZvxlpU0NoC&amp;pg=PA360|date=November 2002|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-100857-9|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo, some fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees and others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herring|first1=Eric|date=2000|title=From Rambouillet to the Kosovo accords: NATO'S war against Serbia and its aftermath|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav [[Red Cross]] had estimated a total of 30,000 refugees and [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) from Kosovo, most of whom were Serb. The UNHCR estimated the figure at 55,000 refugees who had fled to [[Montenegro]] and [[Central Serbia]], most of whom were Kosovo Serbs: &quot;Over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllanZelizer2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allan,Stuart|author2=Zelizer,Barbie|title=Reporting War: Journalism in Wartime|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134298655|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post war Kosovo, KLA fighters have been venerated by Kosovar Albanian society with the publishing of literature such as biographies, the erection of monuments and commemorative events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ströhle|first=Isabel|chapter=Reinventing Kosovo: Newborn and the Young Europeans|editor1-last=Šuber|editor1-first=Daniel|editor2-last=Karamanic|editor2-first=Slobodan|title=Retracing images: Visual culture after Yugoslavia|year=2012|location=Leiden |publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004210301|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members and by Kosovar Albanian society. Several songs, literature works, monuments, memorials have been dedicated to him, and some streets and buildings bear his name across Kosovo.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiLellioSchwandersSievers516519527&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Di Lellio|Schwanders-Sievers|2006a|pp=516–519, 527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiLellioSchwandersSievers2745&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Di Lellio|Schwanders-Sievers|2006b|pp=27–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajredin Bala, an ex-KLA prison guard, was sentenced on 30 November 2005 to 13 years’ imprisonment for the mistreatment of three prisoners at the [[Llapushnik prison camp]], his personal role in the &quot;maintenance and enforcement of the inhumane conditions&quot; of the camp, aiding the torture of one prisoner, and of participating in the murder of nine prisoners from the camp who were marched to the Berisha Mountains on 25 or 26 July 1998 and killed.

==Reported abuses==
{{Main|War crimes in the Kosovo War}}

[[File:Weapons confiscated from the Kosovo Liberation Army (1999).JPEG|thumb|Weapons confiscated from the KLA, July 1999]]

There have been reports of war crimes committed by the KLA both during and after the conflict. These have been directed against Serbs, other ethnic minorities (primarily the [[Romani people|Roma]]) and against ethnic Albanians accused of collaborating with Serb authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/ UNDER ORDERS:War Crimes in Kosovo]. hrw.org (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The KLA was responsible for serious abuses... including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state.

Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals... widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries... combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities... elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.&lt;ref name=hrw1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The KLA engaged in [[tit-for-tat]] attacks against Serbs in Kosovo, reprisals against ethnic Albanians who &quot;collaborated&quot; with the Serbian government, and bombed police stations and cafes known to be frequented by Serb officials, killing innocent civilians in the process. Most of its activities were funded by drug running, though its ties to community groups and Albanian exiles gave it local popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr&quot;/&gt;

===Use of child soldiers===

The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1989, entered into force on 2 September 1990 and was valid throughout the conflict. Article 38 of this Convention state the age of 15 as the minimum for recruitment or participation in armed conflict. Article 38 requires state parties to prevent anyone under the age of 15 from taking direct part in hostilities and to refrain from recruiting anyone under the age of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Soldiers International - International Standards|url = http://www.child-soldiers.org/international_standards.php|website = www.child-soldiers.org|accessdate = 6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of persons under age of 18 in the KLA was confirmed in October 2000 when details of the registration of 16,024 KLA soldiers by the International Organisation for Migration in Kosovo became known. Ten per cent of this number were under age of 18. The majority of them were 16 and 17 years old. Around 2% were below the age of 16. These were mainly girls recruited to cook for the soldiers rather than to actually fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,CSCOAL,,SRB,,498805fbc,0.html Refworld|Child Soldiers Global Report 2001 – Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012192008/https://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2CCSCOAL%2C%2CSRB%2C%2C498805fbc%2C0.html |date=12 October 2012 }}.

The 1997 U.S. State Department's official [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|list of &quot;Foreign Terrorist Organizations&quot;]] did not include the KLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Timothy W.

During the war, the KLA troops collaborated with the NATO troops, and one of its members was called by NATO the embodiment of the Kosovo &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. In late 1999 the KLA was disbanded and its members entered the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reveron68&quot;&gt;Reveron, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations for war crimes==
{{main|Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office}}

In 2010, a report by the [[Council of Europe]] accused KLA guerrillas of killing civilian Serbs and ethnic Albanian political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= War crimes prosecutor indicts Kosovo president Thaci |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-warcrimes-president-idUSKBN23V22S |website= reuters.com |accessdate= 24 June 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the Council of Europe report, the Special Investigative Task Force (SITF) created in 2011 to investigate the allegations. The SITF chief prosecutor presented his general findings in 2014 and then the specialist chambers created in The Hague to adjudicate the cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kosovo: War Crimes Indictment Advances Justice |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/25/kosovo-war-crimes-indictment-advances-justice |website= hrw.com |accessdate= 25 June 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] considered and approved the establishment of a special court of Kosovo to try alleged war crimes and other serious abuses committed during and after the 1998–99 Kosovo war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Kosovo: Approve Special Court for Serious Abuses |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/11/kosovo-approve-special-court-serious-abuses |website= hrw.org |accessdate= 13 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court will adjudicate cases against individuals based on a 2010 Council of Europe report by the Swiss senator Dick Marty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Kosovo: Approval of Special Court Key Step for Justice |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/24/kosovo-approval-special-court-key-step-justice |website= hrw.org |accessdate= 27 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings will be EU-funded and held in The Hague, though it would still be a Kosovo national court. Defendants will likely include members of the Kosovo Liberation Army who are alleged to have committed crimes against ethnic minorities and political opponents, meaning the court is likely to meet with some unpopularity at home, where the KLA are still widely considered heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Valenzuela-Bock |first=Catherina |title=Special Court for Crimes Committed During Kosovo War Established in The Hague |url=https://www.asil.org/blogs/special-court-crimes-committed-during-kosovo-war-established-hague-january-15-2016 |work=[[American Society of International Law]] |date=2016-01-22 |accessdate=2020-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

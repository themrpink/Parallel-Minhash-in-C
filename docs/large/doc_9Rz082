[[File:Heidelberg winter.jpg|thumb|right|View from the castle during winter, 2014]]

The &quot;old town&quot; ({{lang-de|link=no|Altstadt}}), on the south bank of the Neckar, is long and narrow. It is dominated by the ruins of [[Heidelberg Castle]], 80 metres above the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] (''King's chair or throne'') hill.
*The Main Street (''Hauptstrasse''), a mile-long pedestrian street, running the length of the old town.
*The [[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|old stone bridge]] was erected 1786–1788. A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.
*The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] (''Heiliggeistkirche''), a [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] church in the marketplace of the old town.
*The Karls‘ gate (''Karlstor'') is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg's east side. It was built 1775–1781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.
*The house ''Zum Ritter Sankt Georg'' (Knight St. George) is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late [[Renaissance]]. It is named after the sculpture at the top.
*The ''Marstall'' (Stables), a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.

===Heidelberg Castle===
{{Main|Heidelberg Castle}}
[[File:Plan des Heidelberger Schlosses von Peter Friedrich von Walpergen um 1780.jpg|thumb|Historic map of [[Heidelberg Castle]]]]
[[File:Heidelberg 17.11.2012 - panoramio (10).jpg|thumb|Heidelberg Castle at night]]
[[File:Heidelberg Schloss Luftbild 2.JPG|thumb|right|Heidelberg Fortress]]
[[File:Michaelskloster von Westen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]]]]

The castle is a mix of styles from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398–1410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476–1508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall's columns from a decayed palace of [[Charlemagne]] from [[Ingelheim]] to Heidelberg.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556–1559) and Friedrich IV (1583–1610). Under Friedrich V (1613–1619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called &quot;English Building&quot;.

The castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.

Although the interior is in Gothic style, the King's Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.

The castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] once walked. The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] [[funicular]] railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the Königstuhl via the castle.

The castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/en/home/|title=Schloss Heidelberg: Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Baden-Württemberg|website=www.schloss-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophers' Walk===
On the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (''Saints' Mountain''), along the side of which runs the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg's philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century [[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]], the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan's hole and the remains of an earthen [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] from the 4th century BC.

===Heidelberg churches===
[[File:Heidelberg,_Alte_Br%C3%BCcke,_Heiliggeistkirche_20170601_004.jpg|[[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] tower and old bridge monument|thumb]]

There are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] has been shared over the centuries since the [[Protestant Reformation]] by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of the Palatinian Succession]]. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the ''Marktplatz'' next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866 to 1872. The church is also home to the Museum für sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of [[Ecclesiastical]] Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter's Church (now [[Lutheran]]). It was built some time during the 12th century.

==Education==
===Universities and academia===
{{Main|Heidelberg University|List of Heidelberg University people}}

[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|The university library]]

Heidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is [[Heidelberg University]] Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe's oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest [[college town|university town]] of today's Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the [[Humanities]], the [[Social Science]] and the Faculty of [[Jurisprudence|Law]]. The school of applied sciences is located in the ''Science Tower'' in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and [[Natural Science]] are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.

The campus of Heidelberg University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 30,898 as of 2014. The enrollment rate of this university is 16.3 percent. Less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. This university has many areas of study for national students such as; theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics, and social sciences. The university does not charge students for tuition. The school's academic calendar is semester based, and the majority of the language for instruction is in German. For international students the academic calendar is based on a block schedule. The international students attend in block periods of 5 weeks. The University or &quot;Uni&quot; is spread across three campuses each containing different fields of study.
[[File:Heidlbergaula.JPG|thumb|left|Old university hall]]
Since 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ''Pädagogische Hochschule Heidelberg''; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the ''[[Hochschule für Jüdische Studien Heidelberg]]''. It comprises nine branches specializing in both religion and [[Judaism|Jewish culture]]. The [[Schiller International University]], a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.

===Research===
[[File:EMBL campus Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings of [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg, including the new Advanced Training Centre]]

In addition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]], [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]], [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]], [[Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]].

===Schools===
[[File:Fachhochschule Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|left|SRH Hochschule Heidelberg is one of the oldest and largest private universities in Germany]]

Heidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the [[German school system]]. There are 14 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs.

The gymnasiums include the {{ill|Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium|de|Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, {{ill|Bunsen-Gymnasium|de|Bunsen-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, [[Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg|Helmholtz-Gymnasium]], Hölderlin-Gymnasium and Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven [[Realschule]], ten [[Hauptschule]] and nine [[vocational school]]s (the so-called ''[[Berufsschule]]''). In addition, there are several [[folk high schools]] with different specialisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044135/http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heidelberg International School]] serves the local expatriate community.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
In 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a &quot;Romantic town&quot;. This is used to attract more than [https://www.heidelberg.de/english/Home/Life/Heidelberg+in+figures.html#:~:text=11.9%20million%20visitors.,11.9%20million%20visitors%20every%20year. 11.9 million visitors] every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors. One of the biggest tourist attractions is the Christmas market during the winter time.

===Industry===
Only 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises; nearby [[Walldorf]] is a center of the IT industry and [[SAP SE|SAP]] World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer [[Lamy]] has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the [[Capri-Sonne]] ([[Capri-Sun]] in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of [[HeidelbergCement]], the world's second largest cement producer. The company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstrasse, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.
[[File:Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.jpg|thumb|right|Print Media Academy]]

===Roads===
The [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5 autobahn]] runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the north and [[Karlsruhe]] to the south. The [[Bundesautobahn 656|A 656]] commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with [[Mannheim]]. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards [[Stuttgart]].

Furthermore, the [[Bundesstraße 3|B 3]] (Frankfurt–Karlsruhe) runs north–south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim–[[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]) runs east–west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The [[Bundesstraße 535|B 535]] begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.

====Tourist roads====
Heidelberg is located on four tourist roads: [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]], [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], [[Castle Road]], and Straße der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).

===Railways===
[[Heidelberg Central Station]] (Hauptbahnhof) is on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] and is served by [[Intercity-Express]], [[EuroCity in Germany|Euro City]] trains. This station is served by the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]]. There is also a station for [[intercity bus service]]s outside the central station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/heidelberg|title=Heidelberg: Stations|publisher= Travelinho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transport===
[[File:Heidelberg - EC - 2018-07-20 12-36-59.jpg|thumb|DB train [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof]]]]

The main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstraße (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing to the south or from the south to the north to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.

Heidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the [[Trams in Heidelberg|Heidelberg tramway network]] to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Straße, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the ''Deutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'' in 1901 between Heidelberg and [[Wiesloch]]. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]. Tram and bus services are now operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). [[Carsharing]] increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.
[[File:Heidelberg - Bombardier RNV6 - RNV 4144 und RNV 4140 - 2016-08-25 14-39-04.jpg|thumb|Trams in Heidelberg]]

Since 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], the [[Saarland]] and southern [[Hesse]].

The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the [[funicular]] from Molkenkur to [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]]. It is one of the most popular means to reach [[Heidelberg Castle]]. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds was the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-Württemberg.

===United States military installations===
{{see also|United States Army Garrison Heidelberg}}
[[File:Behoerdenzentrum Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Behördenzentrum Heidelberg]]
During World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone]] of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. The main military facilities were [[Campbell Barracks]], the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, which housed the US Army, Europe ([[USAREUR]]) and [[NATO]]'s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).

Campbell Barracks and [[Mark Twain Village]] were both in Südstadt; Patton Barracks was in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach was home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, later designated the Heidelberg Health Center. [[Patrick Henry Village]], the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, was west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, made up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks was home to [http://www.imcom-europe.army.mil U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region.] The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to a&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt; heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the [[NATO]] [[Kosovo]] campaign.

The children of [[United States Department of Defense]] employees based in Heidelberg attended on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools&amp;nbsp;– Europe). There were three schools of this kind: [[Heidelberg High School]] in Mark Twain Village (Mark Twain Elementary School closed at the completion of the 2010–2011 school year), and [[Heidelberg Middle School]] and Patrick Henry Elementary in Patrick Henry Village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu.dodea.edu/schools/index.php?dId=2 Our Districts and Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814052444/http://www.eu.dodea.edu/schools/index.php?dId=2 |date=August 14, 2012 }} Dependents Schools Europe website, accessed: April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2009, the U.S. Army announced that it would be building new headquarters for USAREUR in [[Wiesbaden]]. The move from Heidelberg took place in 2012 and 2013, and was completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.eur.army.mil/news/HPpdf/2010/July_1_2010.pdf Heidelberg, Mannheim to close by 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330175747/http://www.bw.eur.army.mil/news/HPpdf/2010/July_1_2010.pdf |date=March 30, 2012 }}, HeraldPost Vol. 35 No. 38, accessed: October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 all United States forces had left Heidelberg. The barracks and the housing areas were returned to the German state for conversion to civilian use.

==Culture==
===Events===

[[File:Heidelberg night.jpg|thumb|right|Heidelberg with the Old Bridge illuminated]]
Several festivals and events hosted and organized in Heidelberg throughout the year. In February, the ''Ball der Vampire'' (Ball of the Vampires)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/content/e904/e911/e7697/index_ger.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030032923/http://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/content/e904/e911/e7697/index_ger.html|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is arranged and [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|Fasching]], the equivalent of Mardis Gras or Carnival in some German regions, with a giant vampire-themed costume party at the local castle or city hall is celebrated. In March or April the ''Heidelberger Frühling'' (Heidelberg Spring), the Classic Music Festival and the international Easter egg market are conducted. During the last weekend of April there is an annually organized half marathon. In the summertime there are the ''Frühlingsmesse'' on the Messeplatz (May) and Illumination of the castle and bridge with lights and fireworks take place. In September, on the last Saturday the ''Old Town Autumn Festival'' is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/en/events/highlights/heidelberger-herbst.html|title=Heidelberger Herbst|website=www.heidelberg-marketing.de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a Medieval Market, an arts and crafts market, a flea market, and music from Samba to Rock. During October or November there are the ''Heidelberger Theater Days'' and the [[Enjoy Jazz]] festival. Every year in November the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] take place in the city, too. The festival presents arthouse films of international newcomer directors and is held jointly by both of the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mannheim-filmfestival.com/ |title=Internationales FilmFestival Mannheim-Heidelberg &amp;#124; |publisher=Mannheim-filmfestival.com |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Christmas there is a Christmas market throughout the oldest part of the city. A famous gift is the chocolate called Heidelberger ''Studentenkuss'' (student kiss).

===Cinemas===

The nationwide trend of cinema closures hit Heidelberg harder than many other places in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/heidelberg_artikel,-rnz-HDKreis-Der-angekuendigte-Tod-des-Heidelberger-Kinos-_arid,56873.html|title=Der angekündigte Tod des Heidelberger Kinos|website=www.rnz.de|language=de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.heidelberg.de/stadtblatt-online/index.php?artikel_id=8453&amp;bf=|title=Stadt Heidelberg - Stadtblatt Online|website=ww2.heidelberg.de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2006-2013.ruprecht.de/nachrichten/archive/2011/may/22/article/kinosterben-geht-weiter/|title=Kinosterben geht weiter|website=2006-2013.ruprecht.de|language=German|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years saw the low-point of this development, when in this city of over 150,000 people there were just three small cinemas left, with a total capacity of under 450 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.film-krise-in-heidelberg-in-der-kinohochburg-geht-bald-das-licht-aus-page1.be520c8b-3a58-4d93-a41b-a7c017e2339f.html|title=Film-Krise in Heidelberg: Dem Kinosterben soll entgegnet werden|first=Stuttgarter Zeitung, Stuttgart|last=Germany|website=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation has slightly improved since late 2017, when Heidelberg got a new multiplex adjacent to the new Bahnstadt development, the &quot;Luxor Filmpalast&quot;.

Luxor shows mainly [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbuster movies]] in [[German language|German]], but some showings in [[English language|English]] are on offer for selected films.&lt;ref&gt;heidelberg-bahnstadt-teileroeffnung-vom-kino-luxor-filmpalast-am-23-november-9388433.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The small 2-screen cinema &quot;Gloria/Gloriette&quot; (Old Town), together with the affiliated &quot;Kamera&quot; (Neuenheim) offers arthouse and independent films, with some showings being offered in the films original language, usually with German subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gloria-kamera-kinos.de/original-versions.php|title=GLORIA - GLORIETTE - DIE KAMERA &amp;#124; Original Versions|website=www.gloria-kamera-kinos.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit &quot;Karlstorkino&quot; (at the far eastern edge of the Old Town, next to the river) offers international arthouse fare and the occasional documentary. The vast majority of non-German films at this cinema are shown in their original language with either English or German subtitles, depending on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.karlstorkino.de/originalversions/|title=Original Versions / Originalversionen|website=www.karlstorkino.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and exhibitions===
Among the most prominent museums of Heidelberg are for instance the Carl Bosch Museum which shows life and work of chemist and Nobel Prize-winner [[Carl Bosch]]. Then there is the [[Documentation and Culture Centre of German Sinti and Roma]] (Dokumentations- und Kulturzentrum Deutscher Sini und Roma) describing the Nazi genocide of the [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] peoples. The German Packing Museum (Deutsches Verpackungsmuseum) gives an overview of the history of packing and wrapping goods, whereas the German Pharmacy Museum (Deutsches Apothekenmuseum) which is located in the castle illustrates the history of Pharmacy in Germany. The [[Kurpfälzisches Museum]] (Palatinate Museum) offers a great art collection and some Roman archeological artifacts from the region. In honour of [[Friedrich Ebert]] the [[President Friedrich Ebert Memorial]], which commemorates the life of Germany's first democratic head of state, was established. Besides, there are guided tours in most of the historical monuments of Heidelberg, as well as organized tourist tours through the city available in several languages.

===Heidelberg Romanticism&lt;!--movement names are capitalized (cf. 'German Romanticism'); 'Heidelberg Romanticism', 'Heidelberg romanticism', 'Heidelberg Romantics' and 'Heidelberg romantics' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Carl Philipp Fohr 001.jpg|thumb|Romantic view of [[Heidelberg Castle]] ruins]]
Heidelberg was the centre of the epoch of ''Romantik'' ([[German Romanticism|Romanticism]]) in Germany. The phase after [[Jena Romanticism]] is often called '''Heidelberg Romanticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (see also [[Berlin Romanticism]]). There was a famous circle of poets (the '''Heidelberg Romantics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), such as [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Johann Joseph von Görres]], [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]], and [[Clemens Brentano]]. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.

The ''Romantik'' epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.

===Old Heidelberg===
{{Further|Alt Heidelberg (play)}}
In 1901 [[Wilhelm Meyer-Förster]] wrote the play ''[[Old Heidelberg (play)|Old Heidelberg]]'' which was followed by a large number of film adaptations. It was the basis for [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s 1924 operetta ''[[The Student Prince]]'' which was itself turned into a [[The Student Prince (film)|film of the same title]].

&quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; was another Willie Dixon-penned blues number. It was recorded live in the studio, and arranged in a slower and more laid-back style compared to some of the other material on the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}

&quot;How Many More Times&quot; was the group's closing live number in their early career. The song was improvised around an old [[Howlin' Wolf]] number, &quot;[[How Many More Years]]&quot;, and a Page guitar riff, which developed spontaneously into a [[jam session]]. The track includes a [[bolero]] section similar to Jeff Beck's &quot;[[Beck's Bolero]]&quot; (which was written by and featured Page), and segues into &quot;Rosie&quot; and &quot;[[The Hunter (Albert King song)|The Hunter]]&quot; which were improvised during recording. Page played the guitar with the violin bow in the middle section of the track, similar to &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=47}}

===Unreleased material===
Two other songs from the Olympic sessions, &quot;[[Baby Come On Home]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sugar Mama (song)#Led Zeppelin song|Sugar Mama]]&quot;, were left off the album. They were released on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/coda-reissue-192526/ |title=Coda (reissue) |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=31 July 2015 |access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|thumb|The image of the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship [[Hindenburg disaster|seconds after catching fire]] on 6 May 1937 was used as the ''Led Zeppelin'' album cover.]]
''Led Zeppelin''{{'}}s front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' airship, photographed by Sam Shere on 6 May 1937, during the [[Hindenburg disaster]].{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The image refers to the origin of the band's name itself: When Page, Beck and The Who's [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, &quot;It would probably go over like a lead balloon&quot;, and Entwistle reportedly replied, &quot;a lead zeppelin!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2006&quot;/&gt;

The back cover features a photograph of the band taken by Dreja. The entire design of the album's sleeve was coordinated by [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]], with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} Hardie himself also created the front cover illustration, rendering the famous original black-and-white photograph in ink using a [[Rapidograph]] technical pen and a [[mezzotint]] technique.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}}

Hardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco{{snd}}a multi-sequential image of a zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and a number of early press advertisements.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=33}} The first UK pressing featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector's item.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}}

The album cover gained further widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as &quot;the Nobs&quot; as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the [[Zeppelin]] aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the ''Hindenburg'' crashing in flames, threatened legal action over the concert taking place.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009071749/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bookshelf/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001958757 |first=Keith |last=Shadwick |title=Led Zeppelin 1968–1980: The Story of a Band and Their Music |magazine=Billboard |archivedate=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Greg Kot]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that &quot;The cover of ''Led Zeppelin''{{nbsp}}… shows the ''Hindenburg'' airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames.

==Critical reception==
The album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan &quot;Led Zeppelin{{snd}}the only way to fly&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=45}} It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine asserted that the band offered &quot;little that its twin, [[the Jeff Beck Group]], didn't say as well or better three months ago{{nbsp}}… to fill the void created by the demise of [[Cream (band)|Cream]], they will have to find a producer, editor and some material worthy of their collective talents&quot;, calling Page a &quot;limited producer&quot; and criticising his writing skills. It also called Plant &quot;as [[fop]]pish as [[Rod Stewart]], but nowhere near so exciting&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mendelsohn&gt;{{cite web |author=John Mendelsohn |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/led-zeppelin-i-19690315 |title=Led Zeppelin I |website=Rolling Stone |date=15 March 1969 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-classic-albums-rolling-stone-originally-panned-101316/led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-1969-101461/ |title=10 Classic Albums Rolling Stone Originally Panned |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the bad press, Led Zeppelin avoided talking to them throughout their career. Eventually, their reputation as a good live band recovered by word-of-mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snow1990&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Mat |last=Snow |title=Apocalypse Then |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=December 1990 |pages=74–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock journalist [[Cameron Crowe]] noted years later: &quot;It was a time of 'super-groups', of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;complete2&quot;&gt;Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite shaky press the album is now considered by some of their fans to be one of the group's best albums.

However, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. [[Chris Welch]] wrote, in a review titled &quot;Jimmy Page triumphs{{snd}}Led Zeppelin is a gas!&quot;: &quot;their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands&quot;.{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=37}} In ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', [[Felix Dennis]] regarded it as one of those rare albums that &quot;defies immediate classification or description, simply because it's so obviously a turning point in rock music that only time proves capable of shifting it into eventual perspective&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=9592 |title=Oz Review |publisher=Rocksbackpages.com |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparing the record to their follow-up ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' that the debut was &quot;subtler and more ambitious musically&quot;, and not as good, &quot;because subtlety defeated the effect. Musicianship, in other words, was really incidental to such music, but the music did have real strength and validity: a combination of showmanship and overwhelming physical force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=12 February 1970|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/delaney-70.php|title=Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends Featuring Eric Clapton|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was a commercial success. It was initially released in the US on 12 January 1969 to capitalise on the band's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1968–1969|first North American concert tour]]. Before that, Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled with a good reaction to the band's opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=34}} The album reached number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=95}} The album earned its US gold certification in July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/led-zeppelin-ii-how-band-came-into-its-own-on-raunchy-1969-classic-121246/|title='Led Zeppelin II': How Band Came Into Its Own on Raunchy 1969 Classic|website=Rolling Stone|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's success and influence is widely acknowledged, even by publications that were initially sceptical. In 2006, ''Rolling Stone'' commented on the originality of the music, and Zeppelin's heavy style, comparing them to Cream, [[Jimi Hendrix]], the [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]], but reiterated that they had mass appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2006&quot;/&gt; ''Led Zeppelin'' was cited by [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as &quot;a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11459|pure_url=yes}}Review by AllMusic]&lt;/ref&gt; According to arts and culture scholar Michael Fallon, it &quot;announced the emergence of a loud and raw new musical genre&quot; in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fallon |first=Michael |page=107 |title=Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s |publisher=Counterpoint |year=2014 |isbn=978-1619023437}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[BBC]] as &quot;a product of the 1960s whose often bombastic style signposted a new decade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3pvh/|title=BBC – Music – Review of Led Zeppelin – Led Zeppelin|last=Moffitt|first=Greg|language=en-GB|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon Pearce from ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' regarded it as Zeppelin's &quot;ode to rock's progressive metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;the first hard rock domino&quot; for their future accomplishments: &quot;Its orchestration delves adventurously through hard rock and heavy metal with bluesy undertones that often cause the chords to weep poignantly as if struck with malice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;COS&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pearce|first=Sheldon|date=2 June 2014|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/06/album-review-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-i-reissue/|title=Led Zeppelin – Led Zeppelin I Reissue|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was described as a &quot;brilliant if heavy-handed blues-rock offensive&quot; by popular music scholar Ronald Zalkind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zalkind|first=Ronald|year=1980|title=Contemporary Music Almanac|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00zalk|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00zalk/page/255 255]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Popoff]] argued that while the album may not have been the first heavy metal record, it did feature what was likely to be the first metal song – &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;{{snd}}&quot;with its no-nonsense machine gun between the numbers riff&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=206|last=Popoff|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Popoff|year=2003|title=The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|isbn=1550225308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[VH1]] named ''Led Zeppelin'' the 44th-greatest album of all time.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 97, based on 10 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' deemed it an improvement over previous remasters of the album and credited Page's contribution to the remaster for revealing more detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qmag&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|title=Review|page=120|date=July 2014|author=Anon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erlewine found the bonus disc &quot;particularly exciting&quot; in his review for [[AllMusic]], writing that &quot;it's not tight but that's its appeal, as it shows how the band was a vital, living beast, playing differently on-stage than they did in the studio.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/led-zeppelin-1-deluxe-edition-mr0004121585|title=Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition|website=AllMusic|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine's Ryan Reed, &quot;for years, Zep-heads have tolerated the murky fidelity of the '90s remasters&quot; until the reissue, which &quot;finally punches and shimmers instead of fizzling in fuzz&quot;. He was critical of the bonus disc, however, believing it &quot;remains inessential—the very definition of 'for completists only.'{{nbsp}}... [It] demonstrates Zeppelin at their most bloated, sloppily fumbling through rhythmic cues and extending tracks to their breaking point&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;paste&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Reed|first=Ryan|date=19 June 2014|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/06/led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zepp.html|title=Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin, II, III Reissues|magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand II''' (c. 1137 – 22 January 1188) was [[List of Leonese monarchs|King of León]] and [[kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] from 1157 to his death.

==Life==
Born in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], he was the son of King [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] and of [[Berenguela of Barcelona|Berenguela]], of the [[House of Barcelona]]. At his father's death, he received [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], while his brother [[Sancho III of Castile|Sancho]] received [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Toledo|Toledo]].&lt;ref&gt;Busk,  M. M., ''The history of Spain and Portugal from B.C. 1000 to A.D. 1814'', (Baldwin and Cradock, 1833), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand earned the reputation of a good [[knight]] and hard fighter, but did not display political or organising faculty.

He spent most of his first year as king in a dispute with his powerful nobles and an invasion by his brother Sancho III.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.9, Ed. Thomas Spencer Baynes, (Henry G. Allen and Company, 1888), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1158 the two brothers met at Sahagun, and peacefully solved the heritage matters. However, Sancho died in the same year, being succeeded by his child son [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]], while Ferdinand occupied parts of Castile.&lt;ref&gt;Busk, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary troubles with Castile restarted in 1164: he then met at Soria with the Lara family, who represented Alfonso VIII, and a truce was established, allowing him to move against the Muslim [[Almoravid]]s who still held much of southern Spain, and to capture the cities of [[Alcántara]] and [[Alburquerque, Spain|Alburquerque]]. In the same year, Ferdinand defeated King [[Afonso I of Portugal]], who, in 1163, had occupied [[Salamanca]] in retaliation for the repopulation of the area ordered by the King of León.

In 1165 he married [[Urraca of Portugal|Urraca]], daughter of Afonso of Portugal. However, strife with Portugal was not put to an end by this move. In 1168 Afonso again felt menaced by Ferdinand II's repopulation of the area of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]]: he then attacked Galicia, occupying [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]] and the territory of [[Xinzo de Limia]], former fiefs of his mother. However, as his troops were also besieging the Muslim citadel of [[Badajoz]], Ferdinand II was able to push the Portuguese out of Galicia and to rush to Badajoz. When Afonso saw the Leonese arrive he tried to flee, but he was disabled by a broken leg caused by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner at one the city's gates. Afonso was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests he had made in Galicia in the previous year. In the peace signed at Pontevedra the following year, Ferdinand got back twenty five castles, and the cities of [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]], Badajoz, [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], Santa Cruz and [[Montánchez]], previously lost by León. When in the same years the Almoravids laid siege to the Portuguese city of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], Ferdinand II came to help his father-in-law, and helped to free the city from the menace.

Also in 1170, Ferdinand created the military-religious [[Order of Santiago de Compostela]], with the task to protect the city of Cáceres.{{sfn|Morton|2014|page=39}} Like the [[Order of Alcántara]], it initially began as a knightly confraternity and took the name &quot;Santiago&quot; (St. James) after St. James the apostle.{{sfn|Morton|2014|page=39}}

In 1175 Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] annulled Ferdinand II and Urraca of Portugal's marriage due to [[consanguinuity]]. The King remarried to [[Teresa Fernández de Traba]], daughter of count [[Fernando Pérez de Traba]], and widow of count [[Nuño Pérez de Lara]]. In 1178 war against Castile broke out. Ferdinand surprised his nephew Alfonso VIII, occupied [[Castrojeriz]] and [[Dueñas, Palencia|Dueñas]], both formerly lands of Teresa's first husband. The war was settled in 1180 with the peace of Tordesillas. In the same year his wife Teresa died while bearing their second son.

In 1184, after a series of failed attempts, the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] invaded Portugal with an army recruited in Northern Africa and, in May, besieged Afonso I in Santarém; the Portuguese were helped by the arrival of the armies sent by the [[archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]], in June, and by Ferdinand II in July.

In 1185 Ferdinand married for the third time to Urraca López de Haro (daughter of Lope Díaz, lord of [[Biscay]], [[Nájera]] and [[Haro, La Rioja|Haro]]), who was his mistress since 1180. Urraca tried in vain to have [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]], first son of Ferdinand II, declared illegitimate, to favour her son Sancho.

Ferdinand II died in 1188 at [[Benavente Municipality|Benavente]], while returning from a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to Santiago de Compostela. He was buried in the cathedral of Compostela.

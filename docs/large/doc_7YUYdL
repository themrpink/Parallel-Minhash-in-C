Like many other drivers at the time, Rindt continued to race in Formula Two races alongside his duties in Formula One; his last F2 appearance was the ''Festspielpreis der Salzburg'' in August 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festspielpreis der Salzburg (non-ch)|url=http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/festspielpreis-der-salzburg-non-ch/|website=jochenrindt.com|publisher=Natasha Rindt|accessdate=14 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114213723/http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/festspielpreis-der-salzburg-non-ch/ |archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he dominated Formula Two, winning nine races in his [[Brabham BT23]]. As an experienced Formula One driver, he was graded &quot;A&quot;, meaning his results did not count towards the championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further thoughts on Formula 2 |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1967/28/further-thoughts-formula-2 |journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] |issue=May 1967 |page=28 |accessdate=14 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114134053/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1967/28/further-thoughts-formula-2 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title went to [[Jacky Ickx]].{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} Still, his performances led him to be called &quot;king of Formula 2&quot; by the racing press. He had a long-standing relationship with Roy Winkelmann, and drove with his team until it closed at the end of 1969.&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt;

===Sports cars===
[[File:Ferrari 250 LM.jpg|thumb|The [[Ferrari P|Ferrari 250LM]] that took Rindt to his win at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]]|alt=Back view of a red Ferrari sports car standing on a grass field at a car show]]
Along with [[Open-wheel car|single-seater racing]], Rindt took up [[sports car racing]] in the mid-1960s. Rindt started at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] a total of four times. At his debut in {{24hLM|1964}}, sharing a [[Ferrari P|Ferrari 250LM]] with [[David Piper (racing driver)|David Piper]], the car retired too early for Rindt even to take the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 Hours Le Mans (Int.)|url=http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int/|website=jochenrindt.com|publisher=Natasha Rindt|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116162750/http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int/ |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rindt's best result came the following year at the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American [[Masten Gregory]] for the [[North American Racing Team]], Rindt won the event. Neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car. A 1998 article in ''[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]'' stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race, but instead it was &quot;more a case of 'hope it breaks soon' so they could draw their money and split&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemans1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=1965 The Old Man and the Plea|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=June 1998|pages=36–37|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1998/36/1965-old-man-and-plea|accessdate=3 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603162406/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-1998/36/1965-old-man-and-plea |archivedate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start, the drivers had to run to their cars; Rindt entered with a forward roll that allowed him to get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead.&lt;ref name=spiegel2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tödliche Lotus-Blüten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45741439.html|accessdate=16 January 2016|journal=Der Spiegel|issue=20/1969|date=12 May 1969|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116164021/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45741439.html |archivedate=16 January 2016|language=German|trans-title=Deadly Lotus Blossoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair experienced considerable trouble in the early part of the race; the car did not restart during Gregory's first pit stop. Later, the engine failed partially and Gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemans1998&quot;/&gt; At this point, Rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes, expecting their race to be over.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemans2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fearnley|first1=Paul|title=The race Ferrari doesn't need|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=June 2015|page=102|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-2015/102/race-ferrari-doesnt-need|accessdate=3 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603163128/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/june-2015/102/race-ferrari-doesnt-need |archivedate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After thirty minutes of repairs, the car restarted and Rindt and Gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event &quot;flat out&quot;, at full speed and with the accompanying risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemans1998&quot;/&gt; Rindt drove most of the night, advancing from 18th to third position by dawn.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} Gregory persuaded Rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race, suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse the car to the finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemans2015&quot;/&gt; Jacky Ickx later recalled that the two had driven &quot;like maniacs&quot;. Even so, the car survived, handing the pair what Ickx called an &quot;unexpected victory&quot;.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Mans 24-hour race|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1965/11/le-mans-24-hour-race|website=motorsportmagazine.com|publisher=Motor Sport Magazine|accessdate=20 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520105312/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1965/11/le-mans-24-hour-race |archivedate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Rindt drove, again in a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 kilometre race at [[Zeltweg Air Base|Zeltweg]]. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of [[Mike Parkes]] owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}}

Apart from his 1965 victory, he never finished the race in Le Mans. In [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]], his [[Ford GT40]] (shared with [[Innes Ireland]]) suffered an engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 Hours Le Mans (Int.)|url=http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int-3/|website=jochenrindt.com|publisher=Natasha Rindt|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116162831/http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int-3/ |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|A year later]], he drove a [[Porsche 907]] with [[Gerhard Mitter]] until their camshaft failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 Hours Le Mans (Int.)|url=http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int-4/|website=jochenrindt.com|publisher=Natasha Rindt|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116162906/http://jochenrindt.com/en/racing/24-hours-le-mans-int-4/ |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula One===
====Cooper and Brabham (1964–1968)====
Rindt made his Formula One debut at his home race, the [[1964 Austrian Grand Prix]], in a loaned [[Brabham BT11]] supplied by the [[Rob Walker Racing Team]]. He retired on the 58th lap with a broken steering column in his only Grand Prix of the season.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkinson|first=Denis|authorlink=Denis Jenkinson|title=Austrian Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=October 1964|page=39|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1964/39/austrian-grand-prix|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116184204/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1964/39/austrian-grand-prix |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[1965 Formula One season]], Rindt signed as a permanent driver with Cooper, paired with [[Bruce McLaren]]. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the [[1965 South African Grand Prix]], he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=11th South African Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=February 1965|page=28|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/february-1965/28/11th-south-african|accessdate=16 January 2016|archivedate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116191023/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/february-1965/28/11th-south-african }}&lt;/ref&gt; His best result was a fourth place at the [[1965 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] at the Nürburgring.&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt; He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=1965 F1 World Championship|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/147-1965-f1-world-championship|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116185207/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/147-1965-f1-world-championship |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dauerausstellung 360GRAZ - Overall von Jochen Rindt aus der Saison 1966.jpg|thumb|Rindt's overalls for the [[1966 Formula One season|1966 season]]]]
For {{F1|1966}}, Cooper introduced the [[Cooper T81|T81]] chassis and used nine-year old [[Maserati in Formula One|Maserati]] [[V12 engine]]s, which were powerful but heavy. A new engine formula was introduced for the season, with the capacity doubled to three litres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=1966 F1 World Championship|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/championships/1-f1/148-1966-f1-world-championship|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116112323/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/championships/1-f1/148-1966-f1-world-championship|archivedate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams struggled with the new rules, leaving Cooper competitive even with their old Maserati V12s. After McLaren left, Rindt became team leader until {{F1|1964}} world champion [[John Surtees]] joined from [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt; At the second race of the year, the {{F1GP|1966|Belgian}}, Rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second, next to Surtees on the front row of the grid. In a race affected by heavy rain, he overtook Surtees for the lead on lap four. He spun several times on the wet track and suffered from a [[limited-slip differential]], but held onto the lead until lap 21, when Surtees repassed him and won. It was Rindt's first ever podium finish in Formula One, after what ''Motor Sport'' magazine called a &quot;very courageous&quot; drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkinson|first=Denis|authorlink=Denis Jenkinson|title=Belgian GP|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=July 1966|page=16|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1966/16/belgian-gp|accessdate=16 January 2016|archivedate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116192122/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1966/16/belgian-gp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he achieved three podium positions, handing him third place in the championship at the end of the year.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=1966 F1 World Championship|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/148-1966-f1-world-championship|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116185825/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/148-1966-f1-world-championship |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{F1|1967}} was less successful, as Rindt only finished two races, the [[1967 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian]] and [[1967 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grands Prix]], both in fourth place.&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt; Six points meant that he ended the season in 13th place in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=1967 F1 World Championship|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/149-1967-f1-world-championship|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116190423/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/championships/1-f1/149-1967-f1-world-championship |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to {{F1|1968}}, Rindt received offers from every team except [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]],{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} and moved to Brabham, who had been world champions in the two previous seasons. Technical problems restricted him that year. Brabham's [[Repco#Repco V8 engine|Repco V8 engine]] was not competitive against the now widely used [[Cosworth DFV]]&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt; and Rindt finished just two races, both in third place. At the season opener in [[1968 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] on New Year's Day, Rindt placed third, being elevated by a late retirement from [[Jackie Stewart]] and closing on second-placed Graham Hill towards the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clark eases to victory in last grand prix|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/56585.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116202324/http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/56585.html |archivedate=16 January 2016|date=1 January 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was won by [[Jim Clark]], a close friend of Rindt's.

During these years, he also raced in the [[Indianapolis 500]] in both [[1967 Indianapolis 500|1967]] and [[1968 Indianapolis 500|1968]], but finished only 24th and 32nd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=1967 Indianapolis 500|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/races/572-1967-indianapolis-500|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116204005/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/races/572-1967-indianapolis-500 |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=1968 Indianapolis 500|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/races/573-1968-indianapolis-500|magazine=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116204048/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/database/races/573-1968-indianapolis-500 |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of the 1967 race.

====Team Lotus (1969–1970)====
=====1969 season=====
[[File:Chapman and Rindt at 1970 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|Rindt had a strained relationship with [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] team owner [[Colin Chapman]].|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Colin Chapman on the left and Rindt on the right conversing in the pit lane in front of a brick wall]]
For the [[1969 Formula One season|1969 season]], Rindt signed for the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where he joined the defending Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: &quot;Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus.&quot;&lt;ref name=spiegel3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Immer Angst|journal=Der Spiegel|date=14 September 1970|issue=38/1970|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44906605.html|accessdate=16 January 2016|trans-title=Always afraid|language=German|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116205543/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44906605.html |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and ''de facto'' manager [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham may have been a better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} Rindt commented: &quot;At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die.&quot;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;{{sfn|Zwickl|2007|p=78}} Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the [[1969 Spanish Grand Prix]].{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}
[[File:Jochen Rindt 1969 German GP.jpg|thumb|left|Rindt at the [[1969 German Grand Prix]]|alt=Side-view color photograph of Rindt racing a red and white Lotus Formula One car with a wing attached at the rear]]
Rindt's hesitancy appeared justified when both he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at [[Montjuïc circuit|Montjuïc]]. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt's car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart profits from Lotus failures|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/56823.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116223906/http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/56823.html |archivedate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one [[Motorsport marshal|marshal]] lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus's team owner, [[Colin Chapman]], over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: &quot;I place the blame on him [Chapman] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break.&quot; In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: &quot;These wings are insanity [''ein Wahnsinn''] in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars. [...] But to get any wisdom into Colin Chapman's head is impossible.&quot; Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: &quot;I never had any trust in Lotus&quot;, going on to describe his relationship with the team as &quot;purely business&quot;.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}}{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} His accident left him sidelined for the {{F1GP|1969|Monaco}}, a race that Hill won.&lt;ref name=forix&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diepraam|first1=Mattijs|title=The Champions / Jochen Rindt.

Stewart took the win, only eight hundredths of a second ahead of Rindt, while fourth placed McLaren was also within two tenths of a second.

=====1970 season=====
For {{F1|1970}}, Rindt's partner at Lotus was [[John Miles (racing driver)|John Miles]]; Graham Hill had left the team to drive for Rob Walker's [[Privateer (motorsport)|customer franchise]]. Rindt became the clear team leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grand Prix scene|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=March 1970|page=24|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1970/24/grand-prix-scene|accessdate=16 January 2016|archivedate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116225253/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1970/24/grand-prix-scene }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first Grand Prix of the season in [[1970 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with [[Chris Amon]] and [[Jack Brabham]], the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grand Prix of South Africa|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=April 1970|page=30|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1970/30/grand-prix-south-africa|archivedate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116230200/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1970/30/grand-prix-south-africa }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the following race, the {{F1GP|1970|Spanish}}, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the [[Lotus 72]] featured two, one on each side of the cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight.&lt;ref name=mmmspain70&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grand Prix of Spain|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=May 1970|page=30|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1970/30/grand-prix-spain|accessdate=16 January 2016|archivedate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116231255/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1970/30/grand-prix-spain }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.&lt;ref name=mmmspain70/&gt;

As the Lotus 72 was not as effective as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in [[1970 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer [[Herbie Blash]] called &quot;the race of his life&quot;. From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the {{F1GP|1970|Belgian}}, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken [[Double wishbone suspension|lower wishbone]], forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Belgian Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=July 1970|page=36|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1970/36/belgian-grand-prix|accessdate=17 January 2016|archivedate=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117100355/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1970/36/belgian-grand-prix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the {{F1GP|1970|Dutch}}, Rindt eventually used the new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole position in the final practice session, almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|author= Jenkinson, Denis |authorlink= Denis Jenkinson |url= http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1970/44/dutch-grand-prix-technical-step-forward |date= August 1970 |title= The Dutch Grand Prix: A Technical Step Forward |magazine= [[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]] |volume= 46 |issue= 8 |pages= 850–853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, but it was not a joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.{{sfn|Henry|1990|p=99}}

After the success of [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]], Rindt gained confidence in the new Lotus 72, describing it as &quot;the best racing car that exists at the moment&quot;.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} But he continued to have problems. During practice for the {{F1GP|1970|French}}, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek.&lt;ref name=mmmfrance70&gt;{{cite journal|title=The French Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=August 1970|page=32|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1970/32/french-grand-prix|accessdate=17 January 2016|archivedate=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117102323/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1970/32/french-grand-prix }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: &quot;If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!&quot;{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} Rindt was still able to win the race, taking the lead in the championship.&lt;ref name=mmmfrance70/&gt; The next race was the {{F1GP|1970|British}} at [[Brands Hatch]]. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=23rd British Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|date=August 1970|page=22|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1970/22/23rd-british-grand-prix|accessdate=17 January 2016|archivedate=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117103607/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/august-1970/22/23rd-british-grand-prix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{F1GP|1970|German}} was originally set to take place at its traditional venue, the Nürburgring. The [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] (GPDA), represented by Rindt and Graham Hill, demanded changes to the circuit to increase safety, including [[AK Steel Holding|Armco]] barriers along the entire {{convert|22.8|km|mi}} of the ''Nordschleife''. No agreement was reached and the Grand Prix moved to Hockenheim, where Rindt took his fourth victory in succession. The race was another two-way fight, this time between Rindt and Ickx, who exchanged the lead several times.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} This meant that he could have secured the drivers' title at his home event at the {{F1GP|1970|Austrian}}. He set the Lotus 72 on pole position, to the delight of the crowd, but retired from the race with an engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 8th Austrian Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|issue=September 1970|page=22|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1970/22/8th-austrian-grand-prix|accessdate=17 January 2016|archivedate=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117104950/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1970/22/8th-austrian-grand-prix }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title decision was therefore postponed to the next race in [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].{{sfn|Giesser|2010}}

====Death and legacy====
[[File:Jochen Rindt 1969 (N-Ring).jpg|thumb|upright|Rindt in 1969|alt=Black-and-white headshot photograph of Rindt's]]
The paddock moved to the {{F1GP|1970|Italian}} at Monza, a track known for high speeds; drivers often used the [[slipstream]] of cars in front to increase their pace. Because of this, many teams, including Lotus, opted to drop the rear wings mounted on the cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds. The more powerful [[flat-twelve engine|flat-12]] Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and [[Clay Regazzoni]] had been up to {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} faster than the Lotus at the previous race in Austria. Rindt's teammate John Miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in Friday practice, reporting that the car &quot;wouldn't run straight&quot;. Rindt reported no such problems, and Chapman recalled that Rindt reported the car to be &quot;almost 800&amp;nbsp;rpm faster on the straight&quot; without wings.{{sfn|Prüller|1970|pages=192–193}}

On the following day, Rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag, increasing the car's potential top speed to {{convert|205|mi/h|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Prüller|1970|p=195}} On his fifth lap of his practice session, he crashed heavily at the approach to the Parabolica corner. [[Denny Hulme]], who was following Rindt at the time, described the accident as follows:
{{quote|Jochen was following me for several laps and slowly catching me up and I didn't go through the second Lesmo corner very quick so I pulled to the one side and let Jochen past me and then I followed him down into the Parabolica, [...] we were going very fast and he waited until about the 200 metres to put on the brakes. The car just sort of went to the right and then it turned to the left and turned out to the right again and then suddenly just went very quickly left into the guardrail.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}}}

Upon impact, a joint in the crash barrier parted, the suspension of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a [[stanchion]] head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was in the habit of using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps, as he wanted to be able to exit the car quickly in the event of fire.  As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts, and the belts fatally slit open Rindt's throat.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;{{sfn|Henry|1990|p=104}}{{sfn|Prüller|1970|p=199}} Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front [[inboard brake]] shaft, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.{{sfn|Nye|1986|p=69}}&lt;ref name=forix/&gt;

Rindt was pronounced dead on the way to hospital in Milan and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker.&lt;ref name=forix/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmmitaly1&gt;{{cite journal|title=41st Italian Grand Prix|journal=[[Motor Sport (magazine)|Motor Sport]]|date=October 1970|page=32|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1970/32/41st-italian-grand-prix|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120105252/http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1970/32/41st-italian-grand-prix |archivedate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian GP, 1970 Race Report|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr194.html|website=grandprix.com|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120113551/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr194.html |archivedate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a [[Lola Cars|Lola]] Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near [[Milan]].{{sfn|Zwickl|2007|p=79}}

[[File:Grab Jochen Rindt.jpg|thumb|upright|Rindt's grave in Graz]]
Rindt was buried at the central cemetery (Zentralfriedhof) in Graz on 11 September 1970.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jochen Rindt – Ein Leben für den Motorsport|url=http://www.steiermark.at/cms/beitrag/10000820/2075/|website=steiermark.at|publisher=Landesregierung Steiermark|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120122551/http://www.steiermark.at/cms/beitrag/10000820/2075/ |archivedate=20 January 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral, [[Joakim Bonnier]] gave the eulogy, saying:

Regardless what happens in the remaining Grands Prix this year, to all of us, Jochen is the world champion.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}}}

At the time he died Rindt had won five of that year's ten Grands Prix, which meant that he had a substantial lead in the Drivers' Championship. After winning the [[1970 Canadian Grand Prix|next race in Canada]], Jacky Ickx moved within 17 points of Rindt in the Championship, giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian GP, 1970 Race Report|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr195.html|website=grandprix.com|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120123235/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr195.html |archivedate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the {{F1GP|1970|United States}}, a race won by Rindt's replacement at Lotus, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing's only posthumous world champion.{{sfn|Rendall|2007|p=264}} The championship trophy was handed to his widow Nina by Jackie Stewart on 18 November 1970 in a ceremony near the [[Place de la Concorde]] in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Jackie|title=Winning Is Not Enough|date=2007|publisher=Headline Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-7553-1539-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/winningisnotenou0000stew/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/winningisnotenou0000stew/page/174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/54973818|title=The F1 champion crowned beyond the grave|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The early season BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the ''Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy'' for as long as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz unveiled a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present.&lt;ref name=forix/&gt; The penultimate corner at the [[Red Bull Ring]] in Austria is named after Rindt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit|url=https://www.projekt-spielberg.com/de/formel-1/circuit|website=projekt-spielberg.com|publisher=Projekt Spielberg GmbH &amp; Co KG|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120123718/https://www.projekt-spielberg.com/de/formel-1/circuit |archivedate=20 January 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In March 1967, Rindt married Nina Lincoln, a Finnish model and daughter of racing driver [[Curt Lincoln]], whom he had raced in the early part of his career.&lt;ref name=walitsch/&gt; After becoming engaged, Lincoln had originally broken up with Rindt and sent the engagement ring back. Rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: &quot;I like men who know what they want.&quot;&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Formel-1-Legende Jochen Rindt: Todesfahrt zum Weltmeistertitel|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/formel-1-legende-jochen-rindt-a-946660.html|website=spiegel.de|publisher=Spiegel Online|accessdate=16 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116154624/http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/formel-1-legende-jochen-rindt-a-946660.html |archivedate=16 January 2016|language=German|date=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple moved to Switzerland, near [[Begnins]], where they built a house together.&lt;ref name=forix/&gt; The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father's death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt's death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then [[Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport]], making her Nina Hood, Lady Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was wurde aus der schönen Witwe Nina Rindt?|url=http://www.bild.de/sport/motorsport/was-wurde-aus-der-schoenen-witwe-nina-rindt-13857782.bild.html|website=bild.de|publisher=Bild|accessdate=16 January 2016|language=German|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}

Rindt had met Bernie Ecclestone during his time at Cooper and the two became friends. Noticing his commercial talent, Rindt allowed Ecclestone to manage his professional contracts, without ever officially employing him as a manager. Ecclestone said of the relationship: &quot;I was never his manager, we were good friends. I helped him with any help he ever needed.&quot; After Rindt's accident, it was Ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}
[[File:Stewart and Rindt at 1968 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|Rindt following [[Jackie Stewart]] at the [[1968 Dutch Grand Prix]]|alt=Black-and-white photograph of two Formula One cars driving on a wet track]]
In Formula One, Rindt had several friendly relationships with other drivers, most notably Jackie Stewart. They met at a Formula Two event in 1964 and soon became friends, often going on holiday together and living near each other in Switzerland. Until his death, they were sometimes accompanied by Jim Clark.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} Rindt became involved in Stewart's fight for increased safety in Formula One, being one of the leading figures of the GPDA. For his role in the safety campaign, Rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike; reporters derogatively called Stewart, Rindt and Joakim Bonnier the &quot;Geneva connection&quot;, due to their residence in Switzerland.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} Stewart said that it took Rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that, he was a &quot;good ally&quot;.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} After Rindt's death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the [[1971 Monaco Grand Prix]] in the [[Roman Polanski]]-produced film ''[[Weekend of a Champion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Simon, Frank (director); Polanski, Roman (producer) |year=1972 |title=Weekend of a Champion |medium= Motion picture |publisher=Anglo-EMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Rindt was known to family and friends as an often reckless driver when on public roads. During the early years of his career, he took his [[Jaguar E-Type]] out in the streets of Vienna, where he lived, and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifted]] through the streets.{{sfn|Zwickl|2007|p=73}} He sparked public criticism in 1968 when he flipped over a [[Mini#Mini Cooper and Cooper S: 1961.E2.80.931971.3B 1990-2000|Mini Cooper]] during a demonstration run at an [[autocross]] event in [[Großhöflein]], while his pregnant wife was on board.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}}

Rindt's success popularised motorsport in Austria. Helmut Zwickl called him &quot;the driving instructor of the nation&quot;.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}} In 1965, Rindt put together the first exhibition of racing cars in Austria, the ''Jochen-Rindt-Show'' in Vienna. It was an immediate success, with 30,000 visitors on the first weekend alone. Using his connections, he brought in his friend Joakim Bonnier and former [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] Grand Prix manager [[Alfred Neubauer]] as opening speakers, with other drivers such as Jackie Stewart attending.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} The show soon became an annual event and later moved to the German city of [[Essen]] in 1970, shortly after Rindt's death, and remains there as the [[Essen Motor Show]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; Rindt, with the help of Ecclestone, was able to successfully promote himself, including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts.{{sfn|Giesser|2010}} Following his ascent in racing, two race tracks were built in Austria, the Österreichring (now Red Bull Ring), for which Rindt worked as a consultant, and the [[Salzburgring]]. Rindt's popularity was further increased through the TV show ''Motorama'', which he hosted. The monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads, reports from Grands Prix and interviews of fellow drivers by Rindt.{{sfn|Reuß|2010}}

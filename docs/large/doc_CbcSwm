The '''Four Corners Monument''' marks the [[quadripoint]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] where the [[U.S. state|states]] of [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]] meet.  It is the only point in the United States shared by four states, leading to the area being named the [[Four Corners]] region.&lt;ref name=explore4corners&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.explorefourcorners.com/
|title = Explore Four Corners|publisher =Canyonlands eSolutions |accessdate = March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument also marks the boundary between two semi-autonomous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] governments, the [[Navajo Nation]], which maintains the monument as a tourist attraction, and the [[Ute Mountain Ute Tribe]] Reservation.

The origins of the state boundaries marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the [[American Civil War]], when the [[United States Congress]] acted to form governments in the area to combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along [[Geographic coordinate system|meridian and parallel lines]]. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.

==Monument==
The monument is maintained as a [[tourist attraction]] by the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department. It is an example of a [[border|political boundary]] that is a tourist destination in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb8-1_timothy.pdf|last=Timothy|first=Dallen J.|date=Spring 2000|title=BORDERLANDS: An Unlikely Tourist Destination?|journal=Boundary and Security Bulletin|publisher=IBRU|volume=8|issue=1|pages=57–65|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument consists of a [[granite]] disk embedded with a smaller [[bronze]] disk around the point, surrounded by smaller, appropriately located state [[seal (emblem)|seals]] and flags representing both the states and tribal nations of the area. Circling the point, starting from Colorado, the disk reads with two words in each state &quot;Here meet in freedom under God four states&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Highways (Volume 39), Raymond Carlson (Editor), George M. Avey (Editor), Arizona Highways Department, First Annual Bound Edition, 1963, 440 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://navajonationparks.org/tribal-parks/four-corners-monument/ Four Corners Monument – Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from New Mexico, the disk reads &quot;In freedom under God four states here meet&quot;; starting from Arizona, the disk reads &quot;Under God four states here meet in freedom&quot;; and starting from Utah, the disk reads &quot;Four states here meet in freedom under God&quot;. Around the monument, local Navajo and Ute artisans sell souvenirs and food. An admission fee is required to view and photograph the monument.&lt;ref name=navajonation&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument is a popular tourist attraction despite its remote and isolated location. As early as 1908, people traveled long distances to take pictures of family and friends at the monument in [[Twister (game)|Twister]]-like poses, sitting on the disk, in a circle of friends or family around the disk, or for couples to kiss directly over the disk.&lt;ref name=denverpost&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4280569|title = A corner on the market –&quot;Corner&quot; office with a 4-state view|last = Draper |first = Electa |work = Denver Post|date = September 3, 2006|accessdate = May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Located in the [[Colorado Plateau|Colorado Plateau desert region]] of the [[Southwestern United States]], The Four Corners Monument has a strong [[cold desert climate]] (BWk) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. Winters are cold but sunny, while summers are hot and dry. The record high temperature of {{convert|105|F|0}} has been observed five times, on June 19, 29 and 30, 1974, July 14, 2003, and July 21, 2005. The record low temperature of {{convert|−18|F|0}} was observed on January 3, 1974.

The area now called Four Corners was initially [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] land and beginning in the 16th century it was claimed by Spain as part of [[New Spain]]. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the area was governed by Mexico until being [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] to the United States by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848 following the United States' victory in the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref name=treaty&gt;{{cite web

The first boundary which would become part of the monument was set as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], which created the [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Utah Territory]]. The border between the two territories was congressionally defined as the [[37th parallel north]] by the [[31st United States Congress]]. In 1861, the [[36th United States Congress]] transferred land previously allocated to the Utah Territory, to the newly created [[Colorado Territory]]. The Colorado Territory's southern border would remain as the 37th parallel north, but a new border—between the Colorado and Utah Territories—was declared to be the [[32nd meridian west from Washington]]. This line was derived from the reference used at the time, the [[Washington meridian]].&lt;ref name=ColoradoTerritory&gt;{{cite journal

|date=February 28, 1861
|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], a group of people in the southern portion of [[New Mexico Territory]] passed a resolution condemning the United States for creating such a vast territory with only a single, small government in place at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. They claimed that by doing so, the U.S. had ignored the needs of the southern portion, left it without a functional system of law and order, and allowed the situation to deteriorate into a state of chaos and near anarchy.&lt;ref name=lascruces&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.las-cruces.org/public-services/museums/history_exhibit/LearnMore/documents/CivWarArizona.html |title=History of Las Cruces:Confederate Territory of Arizona |publisher=City of Las Cruces, New Mexico |accessdate=May 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215055447/http://www.las-cruces.org/public-services/museums/history_exhibit/LearnMore/documents/CivWarArizona.html |archive-date=February 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group declared secession from the United States and announced their intent to join the [[Confederate States of America]] under the name of the [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]]. The U.S. Congress responded in 1863 by creating another [[Arizona Territory]] with different, but partially overlapping boundaries. The Confederate boundaries split New Mexico along an east–west line, the [[34th parallel north]], allowing for a single state connection from Texas to the [[Colorado River]]. This would give the Confederacy access to California and the Pacific coast. The Union definition split New Mexico along a north–south line, the 32nd meridian west from Washington, which simply extended the boundary between Colorado and Utah southward. The Union plan eventually became reality, and this created the [[quadripoint]] at the modern Four Corners.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news

===Surveying the boundaries===
After the Civil War, efforts began to survey and mark the actual borders. In 1868, the [[General Land Office]] (GLO) had Ehud N. Darling survey and set markers along the border between the Colorado and New Mexico Territories (the 37th parallel north); this border has become known as the &quot;Darling Line&quot;.&lt;ref name=AThousandThings&gt;{{cite book |last= Stimpson |first= George|title= A Book About A Thousand Things |url= https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.75602 |publisher= Harper &amp; Brothers |year= 1946 |isbn= 0-7607-3803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, another GLO surveyor, Chandler Robbins, surveyed and marked the border between the Arizona and New Mexico Territories (the 32nd meridian west of Washington). Robbins began near the [[Mexico–United States border]], and worked his way north marking the border every so often. Near the 37th parallel north he intersected the Darling Line, and here he erected a sandstone shaft. This sandstone shaft marked today's location of the Four Corners Monument.&lt;ref name=navajo2/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BLM_Field_Notes_1992&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Rollin J. Reeves surveyed and marked the border between the newly created State of Colorado and the Utah Territory. Reeves located the sandstone shaft marker placed by Robbins at today's Four Corners Monument. He then began to survey and mark the border between Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter surveyed and marked the border between Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLM_Field_Notes_1992&quot;/&gt;

The results of these surveys and the markers placed were later accepted as the legal boundaries between the various states.&lt;ref name=ap2/&gt;

===The marker's transformation into a monument===
[[Image:Four-States-At-Once.jpg|thumb|A child straddling all four states, on the monument as it looked following the 1962 reconstruction.|alt=A child with one arm or leg in each of the four states.]]
By 1899, the sandstone shaft marker placed by Chandler Robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken, so it was replaced with a new stone by two U.S. surveyors, Hubert D. Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple concrete pad was poured around the marker. The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 in an effort to organize and regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they would play a big role in the monument's further development.&lt;ref name=navajonation/&gt;&lt;ref name=navajo3&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. surveyor, found this newer stone had broken too and he replaced it with a brass disc marker set in concrete. In 1962, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] poured an elevated concrete pad around the 1931 brass marker; this pad included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLM_Field_Notes_1992&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=utahmonuments&gt;{{cite web

|title = Correction: Four Corners marker story
|agency = Associated Press
|date = April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial surveys, it was found that the borders did not always follow the lines of meridian and parallel (as they had been intended to) due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time of construction. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border. The issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and in 1925 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (this includes the Four Corners Monument).&lt;ref name=supremecourt&gt;{{cite web

Because of this, the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag. One example is the border between Colorado and Utah, where in one area the border jogs west about {{convert|1.5|mi}} from where it was intended to be placed ({{ Coord|38.27619|-109.06065|format=dms|display=inline|type:landmark_region:US-CO}}). Because this error occurred in the original survey, which superseded the written description (being simply the 32nd meridian west of Washington), the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladkink.htm |title=Kink in Utah's border |last1=Case |first1=William F. |year=2000 |website=Utah Geological Survey: Survey Notes |publisher=Utah Geological Survey |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 this issue was again brought to the forefront due to U.S. media reports that the monument was placed {{convert|2.5|mi}} west of its intended location. These reports were quickly corrected after it was discovered that sources had forgotten that when the initial surveys were conducted that the [[Washington meridian]] was used. This meridian has an offset from the modern reference, the [[Prime Meridian]], which has been used in the United States since 1912. This offset is often missed by those not familiar with the history of U.S. surveying.&lt;ref name=americansurveyer&gt;{{cite journal

Even after the mistakes in the reports were discovered, a spokesperson for the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] admitted the monument is placed {{convert|1807|ft}} east of where modern surveyors would mark the point. However, he defended the accuracy of the original survey, stating surveyors &quot;nailed it&quot; considering the primitive tools of the day. Pointing out the achievement given the conditions, he further stated, &quot;Their ability to replicate that exact point — what they did was phenomenal, what they did was spot on.&quot; He concluded by stating that any claims of errors in the location of the monument are irrelevant. Once a survey commissioned to establish a boundary has been accepted by the involved parties, the survey markers are legally binding, regardless of any error that is later discovered.&lt;ref name=ap2&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are radially symmetrical, but most are asymmetrical. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where the water deposits nutrients and then leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules (skeletal-like fragments) of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooper&quot;/&gt; All sponges are [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] aquatic animals, meaning that they attach to an underwater surface and remain fixed in place (i.e., do not travel). Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt-water) species, ranging in habitat from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

Although most of the approximately 5,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;known species of sponges feed on [[bacteria]] and other microscopic food in the water, some host [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] microorganisms as [[endosymbiont]]s, and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponges that live in food-poor environments have evolved as [[carnivore]]s that prey mainly on small [[crustacean]]s.{{sfn|Vacelet|Duport|2004|pp=179–190}}

Most species use [[sexual reproduction]], releasing [[sperm]] cells into the water to fertilize [[ovum|ova]] that in some species are released and in others are retained by the &quot;mother.&quot; The fertilized eggs develop into [[larva]]e, which swim off in search of places to settle.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|pp=183–185}} Sponges are known for regenerating from fragments that are broken off, although this only works if the fragments include the right types of cells. A few species reproduce by budding. When environmental conditions become less hospitable to the sponges, for example as temperatures drop, many freshwater species and a few marine ones produce [[gemmule]]s, &quot;survival pods&quot; of unspecialized cells that remain dormant until conditions improve; they then either form completely new sponges or recolonize the skeletons of their parents.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|pp=120–127}}

In most sponges, an internal gelatinous matrix called mesohyl functions as an [[endoskeleton]], and it is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust such hard surfaces as rocks. More commonly, the mesohyl is stiffened by [[Biomineralization|mineral]] [[sponge spicule|spicules]], by spongin fibers, or both. [[Demosponge]]s use spongin; many species have [[silica]] spicules, whereas some species have calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. Demosponges constitute about 90% of all known sponge species, including all freshwater ones, and they have the widest range of habitats. [[Calcareous sponge]]s, which have calcium carbonate spicules and, in some species, calcium carbonate exoskeletons, are restricted to relatively shallow marine waters where production of calcium carbonate is easiest.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=179}} The fragile [[glass sponge]]s, with &quot;[[scaffolding]]&quot; of silica spicules, are restricted to polar regions and the ocean depths where predators are rare. Fossils of all of these types have been found in rocks dated from {{ma|580}}. In addition [[Archaeocyathid]]s, whose fossils are common in rocks from {{ma|530|490}}, are now regarded as a type of sponge.

The [[unicellular|single-celled]] [[choanoflagellate]]s resemble the choanocyte cells of sponges which are used to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules have been used as morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;collins 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins AG | title = Evaluating multiple alternative hypotheses for the origin of Bilateria: an analysis of 18S rRNA molecular evidence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 26 | pages = 15458–63 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9860990 | pmc = 28064 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.26.15458 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9515458C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, in other words do not include ''all and only'' the descendants of a common ancestor.

The few species of demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard elements have been used by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been [[overfishing|overfished]] so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. [[Dolphin]]s have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krutzen 2005&quot;/&gt;

==Distinguishing features==
{{Further|Cnidaria|Ctenophore}}
Sponges constitute the [[phylum]] Porifera, and have been defined as [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] [[metazoa]]ns (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with whip-like flagella.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=29}} However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=39}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera&quot;&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Hooper JN, Van Soest RW, Debrenne F |contribution=Phylum Porifera Grant, 1836|pages=9–14| veditors = Hooper JN, Van Soest RW |title=Systema Porifera: A Guide to the Classification of Sponges|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum|location=New York|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OQoxzqjQXWEC|page=220}}|year=2002 |isbn=978-0-306-47260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;

Even if a few sponges are able to produce mucus – which acts as a microbial barrier in all other animals – no sponge with the ability to secrete a functional mucus layer has been recorded. Without such a mucus layer their living tissue is covered by a layer of microbial symbionts, which can contribute up to 40–50% of the sponge wet mass. This inability to prevent microbes from penetrating their porous tissue could be a major reason why they have never evolved a more complex anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakshani CR, Morales-Garcia AL, Althaus M, Wilcox MD, Pearson JP, Bythell JC, Burgess JG | title = Evolutionary conservation of the antimicrobial function of mucus: a first defence against infection | language = En | journal = NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | page = 14 | date = 2018-07-04 | pmid = 30002868 | pmc = 6031612 | doi = 10.1038/s41522-018-0057-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[cnidaria]]ns (jellyfish, etc.) and [[Ctenophora|ctenophore]]s (comb jellies), and unlike all other known metazoans, sponges' bodies consist of a non-living jelly-like mass ([[mesohyl]]) sandwiched between two main layers of cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Hinde RT |year=1998|chapter=The Cnidaria and Ctenophora|pages=28–57| veditors = Anderson DT |title=Invertebrate Zoology|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-551368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cnidarians and ctenophores have simple nervous systems, and their cell layers are bound by internal connections and by being mounted on a basement membrane (thin fibrous mat, also known as &quot;[[basal lamina]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot;/&gt; Sponges have no nervous systems, their middle jelly-like layers have large and varied populations of cells, and some types of cells in their outer layers may move into the middle layer and change their functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;

==Basic structure==
&lt;!--[[File:Tide pools sponge.jpg|A pink sponge in a [[tide pool]]|thumb]]
[[File:Aphrocallistes vastus.jpg|thumb|''Aphrocallistes vastus'' (Cloud sponge) is a type of glass sponge. They are very fragile, as they are made out of tiny glass crystals ([[Hydrated silica|hydrated silica dioxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/sally_leys/uploads/personal/Glass%20sponge%20ecology.htm|title=Studies in Life Sciences, University of Alberta: Glass Sponge Ecology|work=Department of Biological Sciences|access-date=2008-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715083546/http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/sally_leys/uploads/personal/Glass%20sponge%20ecology.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]--&gt;

===Cell types===
{{anchor|Ostium (sponges)}}
{{Annotated image/Porifera cell types}}
A sponge's body is hollow and is held in shape by the [[mesohyl]], a jelly-like substance made mainly of [[collagen]] and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one [[flagellum]] per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have '''ostia''', channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like [[porocytes]] that form closable inlet valves. [[Pinacocyte]]s, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all other parts of the mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson&quot;/&gt; while those at the base of the animal are responsible for anchoring it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson&quot;/&gt;

Other types of cell live and move within the mesohyl:&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson&quot;/&gt;
* [[Lophocyte]]s are [[amoeba]]-like cells that move slowly through the mesohyl and secrete collagen fibres.
* [[Collencyte]]s are another type of collagen-producing cell.
* [[Rhabdiferous]] cells secrete [[polysaccharide]]s that also form part of the mesohyl.
* [[Oocyte]]s and [[spermatocyte]]s are reproductive cells.
* [[Sclerocyte]]s secrete the mineralized [[sponge spicule|spicules]] (&quot;little spines&quot;) that form the [[skeleton]]s of many sponges and in some species provide some defense against predators.
* In addition to or instead of sclerocytes, [[demosponge]]s have [[spongocyte]]s that secrete a form of collagen that [[polymer]]izes into [[spongin]], a thick fibrous material that stiffens the mesohyl.
* [[Myocyte]]s (&quot;muscle cells&quot;) conduct signals and cause parts of the animal to contract.
* &quot;Grey cells&quot; act as sponges' equivalent of an [[immune system]].
* [[Archaeocytes]] (or [[amoebocytes]]) are [[amoeba]]-like cells that are [[totipotent]], in other words each is capable of transformation into any other type of cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing debris that block the ostia.

Many larval sponges possess neuron-less [[eye]]s that are based on [[cryptochrome]]s. They mediate phototaxic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivera AS, Ozturk N, Fahey B, Plachetzki DC, Degnan BM, Sancar A, Oakley TH | title = Blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is expressed in a sponge eye lacking neurons and opsin | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 215 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 1278–86 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22442365 | pmc = 3309880 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.067140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass sponges' syncytia===
{{Annotated image/Euplectella|float=left}}
[[Glass sponge]]s present a distinctive variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, which are made of [[silica]], form a [[scaffolding]]-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a [[Spider web|cobweb]] that contains most of the cell types.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt; This tissue is a [[syncytium]] that in some ways behaves like many cells that share a single external [[Cell membrane|membrane]], and in others like a single cell with multiple [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. The mesohyl is absent or minimal. The syncytium's [[cytoplasm]], the soupy fluid that fills the interiors of cells, is organized into &quot;rivers&quot; that transport nuclei, [[organelle]]s (&quot;organs&quot; within cells) and other substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leys SP | title = The significance of syncytial tissues for the position of the hexactinellida in the metazoa | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–27 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 21680406 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.19 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of choanocytes, they have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with &quot;collar bodies&quot;, each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the &quot;cobweb&quot; and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;

Some types of cells have a single nucleus and membrane each, but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by &quot;bridges&quot; made of [[cytoplasm]]. The [[sclerocyte]]s that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by &quot;plugged junctions&quot; that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues&quot;/&gt;

===Water flow and body structures===
{{Annotated image/Porifera body structures}}
Most sponges work rather like [[chimney]]s: they take in water at the bottom and eject it from the [[osculum]] (&quot;little mouth&quot;) at the top. Since ambient currents are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by [[Bernoulli's principle]] does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if there is a lot of sand or silt in the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;

Although the layers of [[pinacocyte]]s and [[choanocyte]]s resemble the [[epithelia]] of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|p=83}}

The simplest body structure in sponges is a tube or vase shape known as &quot;asconoid&quot;, but this severely limits the size of the animal. The body structure is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes. If it is simply scaled up, the ratio of its volume to surface area increases, because surface increases as the square of length or width while volume increases proportionally to the cube. The amount of tissue that needs food and [[oxygen]] is determined by the volume, but the pumping capacity that supplies food and oxygen depends on the area covered by choanocytes. Asconoid sponges seldom exceed {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Porifera&quot;/&gt;

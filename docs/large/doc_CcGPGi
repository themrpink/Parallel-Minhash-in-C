Over time, this decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasties thinned over the generations. Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige on par with that of the Zhou.{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} When [[King You of Zhou|King You]] demoted and exiled his [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] queen in favor of the beautiful commoner [[Bao Si]], the disgraced queen's father the [[Marquis of Shen]] joined with Zeng and the [[Quanrong]] [[Hua-Yi distinction|barbarians]] to sack [[Haojing|Hao]] in 771 BC. Some modern scholars have surmised that the sack of Haojing might have been connected to a [[Scythians|Scythian]] raid from the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] before their westward expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scythian successes&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565551/the-Steppe/10302/Scythian-successes |title=The Steppe: Scythian successes |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With King You dead, a conclave of nobles met at [[state of Shen|Shen]] and declared the Marquis's grandson [[King Ping of Zhou|King Ping]]. The capital was moved eastward to [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chengzhou&quot;/&gt; marking the end of the &quot;Western Zhou&quot; ({{lang|zh|西周}}, &lt;small&gt;p&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Xī Zhōu'') and the beginning of the &quot;Eastern Zhou&quot; dynasty ({{lang|zh|东周}}, &lt;small&gt;p&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Dōng Zhōu'').

===Eastern Zhou===
{{Main|Eastern Zhou}}
[[File:States of Zhou Dynasty.png|thumb|380px|Map showing major states of Eastern Zhou]]
The Eastern Zhou was characterized by an accelerating collapse of royal authority, although the king's ritual importance allowed over five more centuries of rule. The [[Spring and Autumn Annals|Confucian chronicle]] of the early years of this process led to its title of the &quot;[[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]]&quot; period. The [[partition of Jin]] in the mid-5th century BC initiated a second phase, the [[Warring States Period|&quot;Warring States&quot;]].{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} In 403 BC, the Zhou court recognized [[state of Han|Han]], [[state of Zhao|Zhao]], and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] as fully independent states. [[King Hui of Wei|Duke Hui]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], in 344 BC,  was the first to claim the royal title of [[wang (title)|king]] (Chinese: 王) for himself. Others followed, marking a turning point, as rulers did not even entertain the pretence of being vassals of the Zhou court, instead proclaiming themselves fully independent kingdoms. A series of states rose to prominence before each falling in turn, and Zhou was a minor player in most of these conflicts.

The last Zhou king is traditionally taken to be [[King Nan of Zhou|Nan]], who was killed when [[Qin state|Qin]] captured the capital [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Chengzhou&quot;/&gt; in 256 BC. A &quot;[[Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou|King Hui]]&quot; was declared, but his splinter state was fully removed by 249 BC. Qin's [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] concluded in 221 BC with [[Qin Shihuang]]'s annexation of [[Qi (state)|Qi]].

The Eastern Zhou, however, is also remembered as the golden age of Chinese philosophy: the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] which flourished as rival lords patronized itinerant ''[[Four occupations#The shi .28.E5.A3.AB.29|shi]]'' scholars is led by the example of [[Qi (state)|Qi]]'s [[Jixia Academy]]. The [[Nine Schools of Thought]] which came to dominate the others were [[Confucianism]] (as interpreted by [[Mencius]] and others), [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], the utopian communalist [[Agriculturalism]], two strains of [[school of Diplomacy|Diplomatists]], the sophistic [[School of Names|Logicians]], [[Sun-tzu]]'s [[School of the Military|Militarists]], and the [[School of Naturalists|Naturalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chiphi&quot;&gt;.Carr, Brian &amp; al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=osxPipnXeN0C&amp;pg=PA466 Companion Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy],'' p. 466. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2012. {{ISBN|041503535X}}, 9780415035354.&lt;/ref&gt; Although only the first three of these went on to receive imperial patronage in later dynasties, doctrines from each influenced the others and Chinese society in sometimes unusual ways. The [[Mohism|Mohists]], for instance, found little interest in their praise of meritocracy but much acceptance for their mastery of defensive siege warfare; much later, however, their arguments against nepotism were used in favor of establishing the [[imperial exam]]ination system.

==Culture and society==

===Mandate of Heaven and the justification of power===
[[Image:Western Zhou Gui Vessel.jpg|thumb|A Western Zhou bronze gui vessel, {{circa|lk=no|1000}} BC]]

Zhou rulers introduced what was to prove one of East Asia's most enduring political doctrines: the concept of the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot;. They did this by asserting that their moral superiority justified taking over Shang wealth and territories, and that heaven had imposed a moral mandate on them to replace the Shang and return good governance to the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcat.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|last=Tignor|first=Robert L.|others=Adelman, Jeremy; Aron, Stephen; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin A.; Liu, Xinru; Pittman, Holly|isbn=9780393922080|edition=fourth (two volume)|location=New York|oclc=870312289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandate of Heaven was presented as a religious compact between the Zhou people and their supreme god in heaven (literally the 'sky god'). The Zhou agreed that since worldly affairs were supposed to align with those of the heavens, the heavens conferred [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] power on only one person, the Zhou ruler. In return, the ruler was duty-bound to uphold heaven's principles of [[harmony]] and [[honor]]. Any ruler who failed in this duty, who let [[instability]] creep into earthly affairs, or who let his people suffer, would lose the mandate. Under this system, it was the [[prerogative]] of spiritual authority to withdraw support from any wayward ruler and to find another, more worthy one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worlds together, worlds apart&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Peter Brown, Benjamin Elman, Xinru Liu, Holly Pittman, Brent|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|date=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92208-0|page=153|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the Zhou sky god legitimized regime change.

In using this creed, the Zhou rulers had to acknowledge that any group of rulers, even they themselves, could be ousted if they lost the mandate of heaven because of improper practices. The book of odes written during the Zhou period clearly intoned this caution.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcat.org&quot;/&gt;

The early Zhou kings contended that heaven favored their triumph because the last [[Shang]] kings had been evil men whose policies brought pain to the people through waste and corruption. After the Zhou came to power, the mandate became a political tool.

One of the duties and privileges of the king was to create a royal [[calendar]]. This official document defined times for undertaking agricultural activities and celebrating rituals. But unexpected events such as [[solar eclipses]] or natural [[Disaster|calamities]] threw the ruling house's mandate into question. Since rulers claimed that their authority came from heaven, the Zhou made great efforts to gain accurate knowledge of the stars and to perfect the [[astronomical]] system on which they based their calendar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worlds together, worlds apart&quot;/&gt;

Zhou [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] also arose indirectly from [[Shang]] material culture through the use of bronze ritual vessels, [[statues]], ornaments, and [[weapons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Worlds together, worlds apart&quot;/&gt; As the Zhou emulated the Shang's large scale production of ceremonial bronzes, they developed an extensive system of bronze metalworking that required a large force of tribute labor. Many of its members were Shang, who were sometimes forcibly transported to new Zhou to produce the bronze ritual objects which were then sold and distributed across the lands, symbolizing Zhou legitimacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcat.org&quot;/&gt;

===Feudalism===
[[Image:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze gui.jpg|thumb|right|A Western Zhou ceremonial bronze of cooking-vessel form inscribed to record that the King of Zhou gave a fiefdom to Shi You, ordering that he inherit the title as well as the land and people living there]]
Western writers often describe the Zhou period as &quot;[[Feudalism|feudal]]&quot; because the Zhou's ''[[fēngjiàn]]'' (封建) system invites comparison with [[Middle Ages|medieval rule in Europe]].

There were many similarities between the decentralized systems. When the dynasty was established, the conquered land was divided into hereditary fiefs ({{lang|zh|諸侯}}, ''zhūhóu'') that eventually became powerful in their own right. In matters of inheritance, the Zhou dynasty recognized only patrilineal [[primogeniture]] as legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancestral Memory in Early China|first=K. E.|last=Brashier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJAMLt5NYAQC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=9780674056077|date=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ramage system in China and Polynesia Li Hwei {{cite web |url=http://c.ianthro.tw/sites/c.ianthro.tw/files/da/df/401/401104_0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055816/http://c.ianthro.tw/sites/c.ianthro.tw/files/da/df/401/401104_0001.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tao (1934: 17–31), &quot;the Tsung-fa or descent line system has the following characteristics: patrilineal descent, patrilineal succession, patriarchate, sib-exogamy, and primogeniture&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tao, Hsi-Sheng. Marriage and Family, Shanghai. 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

The system, also called &quot;extensive stratified patrilineage&quot;, was defined by the anthropologist [[Kwang-chih Chang]] as &quot;characterized by the fact that the eldest son of each generation formed the main of line descent and political authority, whereas the younger brothers were moved out to establish new lineages of lesser authority. The farther removed, the lesser the political authority&quot;. Ebrey defines the descent-line system as follows: &quot;A great line (ta-tsung) is the line of eldest sons continuing indefinitely from a founding ancestor. A lesser line is the line of younger sons going back no more than five generations. Great lines and lesser lines continually spin off new lesser lines, founded by younger sons&quot;.

K.E. Brashier writes in his book &quot;Ancestral Memory in Early China&quot; about the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture: &quot;The greater lineage, if it has survived, is the direct succession from father to eldest son and is not defined via the collateral shifts of the lesser lineages. In discussions that demarcate between trunk and collateral lines, the former is called a zong and the latter a zu, whereas the whole lineage is dubbed the shi. [...] On one hand, every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage (Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory). [...] According to the Zou commentary, the [[son of heaven]] divided land among his feudal lords, his feudal lords divided the land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who &quot;each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence&quot;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ancestral Memory in Early China Written By K. E. Brashier https://books.google.com/books?id=aJAMLt5NYAQC&amp;pg=PA71&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of unilineal descent-group later became the model of the Korean family through the influence of [[Neo-Confucianism]], as [[Zhu Xi]] and others advocated its re-establishment in China.&lt;ref&gt;The Confucian Transformation of Korea: A Study of Society and Ideology Written By Martina Deuchler https://books.google.com/books?id=NQeeYOyUx64C&amp;pg=PA129&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fēngjiàn system and bureaucracy====
There were [[Chinese nobility#Peer ranks of the Zhou dynasty|five peerage ranks]] below the royal ranks, in descending order with common English translations: ''gōng'' 公 &quot;duke&quot;, ''hóu'' 侯 &quot;marquis&quot;, ''bó'' 伯 &quot;count&quot;, ''zǐ'' 子 &quot;viscount&quot;, and ''nán'' 男 &quot;baron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ChinaKnowledge.de encyclopedia, http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Alternatively, the sequence was translated as '''prince, lord, elder, master, chieftain''': Brooks 1997:3 n.9.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a vigorous duke would take power from his nobles and centralize the state. Centralization became more necessary as the states began to war among themselves and decentralization encouraged more war. If a duke took power from his nobles, the state would have to be administered bureaucratically by appointed officials.

Despite these similarities, there are a number of important differences from medieval Europe. One obvious difference is that the Zhou ruled from walled cities rather than castles. Another was China's distinct class system, which lacked an organized clergy but saw the Shang [[Zi (surname)|Zi]]-clan yeomen become masters of ritual and ceremony known as ''Shi'' (士). When a dukedom was centralized, these people would find employment as government officials or officers. These hereditary classes were similar to Western knights in status and breeding, but unlike Western clergy were expected to be something of a scholar instead of a warrior. Being appointed, they could move from one state to another. Some would travel from state to state peddling schemes of administrative or military reform. Those who could not find employment would often end up teaching young men who aspired to official status. The most famous of these was [[Confucius]], who taught a system of mutual duty between superiors and inferiors. In contrast, the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] had no time for Confucian virtue and advocated a system of strict laws and harsh punishments. The wars of the Warring States were finally ended by the most legalist state of all, Qin. When the [[Qin dynasty]] fell and was replaced by the [[Han dynasty]], many Chinese were relieved to return to the more humane virtues of Confucius.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Agriculture===
[[Image:Shi Qiang pan.jpg|thumb|The [[Shi Qiang pan]], inscribed with the accomplishments of the earliest Zhou kings, circa 10th century BC]]
Agriculture in the Zhou dynasty was very intensive and, in many cases, directed by the government. All farming lands were owned by nobles, who then gave their land to their [[Serfdom|serfs]], a situation similar to European [[feudalism]]. For example, a piece of land was divided into nine squares in the [[well-field system]], with the grain from the middle square taken by the government and that of surrounding squares kept by individual farmers. This way, the government was able to store surplus food and distribute it in times of famine or bad harvest. Some important manufacturing sectors during this period included bronze smelting, which was integral to making weapons and farming tools. Again, these industries were dominated by the nobility who directed the production of such materials.

China's first projects of [[hydraulic engineering]] were initiated during the Zhou dynasty, ultimately as a means to aid agricultural [[irrigation]]. The [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Sunshu Ao]], who served [[King Zhuang of Chu]], dammed a river to create an enormous irrigation [[reservoir]] in modern-day northern [[Anhui]] province. For this, Sunshu is credited as China's first hydraulic engineer. The later Wei statesman [[Ximen Bao]], who served [[Marquis Wen of Wei]] (445–396 BC), was the first hydraulic engineer of China to have created a large irrigation canal system. As the main focus of his grandiose project, his canal work eventually diverted the waters of the entire [[Zhang River]] to a spot further up the [[Yellow River]].

===Military===
The early Western Zhou supported a strong army, split into two major units: &quot;the Six Armies of the west&quot; and &quot;the Eight Armies of Chengzhou&quot;. The armies campaigned in the northern [[Loess Plateau]], modern [[Ningxia]] and the [[Yellow River]] floodplain. The military prowess of Zhou peaked during the 19th year of [[King Zhao of Zhou|King Zhao]]'s reign, when the six armies were wiped out along with King Zhao on a campaign around the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]].  Early Zhou kings were true commanders-in-chief. They were in constant wars with barbarians on behalf of the fiefs called ''guo'', which at that time meant &quot;statelet&quot; or &quot;principality&quot;.

King Zhao was famous for repeated campaigns in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] areas and died in his last action. Later kings' campaigns were less effective. [[King Li of Zhou|King Li]] led 14 armies against [[barbarians]] in the south, but failed to achieve any victory. [[King Xuan of Zhou|King Xuan]] fought the [[Quanrong]] nomads in vain. [[King You of Zhou|King You]] was killed by the Quanrong when Haojing was sacked. Although [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariots]] had been introduced to China during the Shang dynasty from Central Asia, the Zhou period saw the first major use of chariots in battle.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988}} Recent archaeological finds demonstrate similarities between [[horse burial]]s of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and Indo-European peoples in the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrechSteinicke&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Krech|Steinicke|2011|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible cultural influences resulting from Indo-European contact in this period may include fighting styles, head-and-hooves burials, art motifs and myths.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrechSteinicke&quot;/&gt;

===Philosophy===
During the Zhou dynasty, the origins of native [[Chinese philosophy]] developed, its initial stages of development beginning in the 6th century BC. The greatest Chinese philosophers, those who made the greatest impact on later generations of Chinese, were [[Confucius]], founder of [[Confucianism]], and [[Laozi]], founder of [[Taoism]]. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were [[Mozi]], founder of [[Mohism]]; [[Mencius]], a famous Confucian who expanded upon Confucius' legacy; [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], responsible for the development of ancient Chinese [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (the core philosophy of the [[Qin dynasty]]); and [[Xun Zi]], who was arguably the center of ancient Chinese intellectual life during his time, even more so than iconic intellectual figures such as Mencius.{{sfnp|Schirokauer|Brown|2006|pp=25–47}}

====Li====
{{Main|Li (Confucian)}}
Established during the Western period, the ''Li'' ({{CJKV|t=禮|s=礼|p=lǐ}}) ritual system encoded an understanding of manners as an expression of the social hierarchy, ethics, and regulation concerning material life; the corresponding social practices became idealized within Confucian ideology.

The system was canonized in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', ''[[Zhou li|Zhouli]]'', and ''[[Yili (text)|Yili]]'' compendiums of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD), thus becoming the heart of the Chinese imperial ideology. While the system was initially a respected body of concrete regulations, the fragmentation of the Western Zhou period led the ritual to drift towards moralization and formalization in regard to:

* The five orders of [[Chinese nobility]].
* Ancestral temples (size, legitimate number of pavilions)
* Ceremonial regulations (number of [[Ding (vessel)|ritual vessels]], musical instruments, people in the dancing troupe)

==Kings==

The rulers of the Zhou dynasty were titled ''Wáng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|王}}}}), which is normally translated into English as &quot;king&quot; and was also the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] term for their rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nobles of the Ji family proclaimed Duke Hui of Eastern Zhou as King Nan's successor after their capital, Chengzhou, fell to Qin forces in 256 BC. Ji Zhao, a son of King Nan, led a resistance against Qin for five years. The dukedom fell in 249 BC. The remaining Ji family ruled [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Wei (Spring and Autumn period)|Wei]] until 209 BC.

{{History of China|BC=1}}
The '''Shang dynasty'''  ({{zh|c={{linktext|商朝}}|p=Shāngcháo}}), also historically known as the '''Yin dynasty''' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|殷代}}|p=Yīndài}}), was a [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese dynasties|dynasty]] that ruled in the middle and lower [[Yellow River]] valley in the [[second millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]], succeeding the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] and followed by the [[Zhou dynasty]]. The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122&amp;nbsp;BC, but according to the chronology based upon the &quot;current text&quot; of ''Bamboo Annals'', they ruled from 1556 to 1046&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] dated them from c. 1600 to 1046&amp;nbsp;BC based on the carbon 14 dates of the [[Erligang]] site.

The Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional [[Chinese history]] firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Excavation at the [[Yinxu|Ruins of Yin]] (near modern-day [[Anyang]]), which has been identified as the last Shang capital, uncovered eleven major royal tombs and the foundations of palaces and ritual sites, containing weapons of war and remains from both animal and human sacrifices.  Tens of thousands of [[bronze]], [[jade]], [[stone]], [[bone]], and [[ceramic]] artifacts have been found.

The Anyang site has yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s – turtle shells, ox [[scapula]]e, or other bones. More than 20,000 were discovered in the initial scientific excavations during the 1920s and 1930s, and over four times as many have been found since.  The inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]].{{sfnp|Keightley|2000}}

==Traditional accounts==
Many events concerning the Shang dynasty are mentioned in various [[Chinese classics]], including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.  Working from all the available documents, the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] assembled a sequential account of the Shang dynasty as part of his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  His history describes some events in detail, while in other cases only the name of a king is given.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=233–235}}  A closely related, but slightly different, account is given by the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.  The ''Annals'' were interred in 296&amp;nbsp;BC, but the text has a complex history and the authenticity of the surviving versions is controversial.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978b}}

The name ''Yīn'' (殷) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the &quot;current text&quot; version of the ''Bamboo Annals'' for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the ''Records of Emperors and Kings'' by [[Huangfu Mi]] (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (''In'') dynasty. However, it seems to have been a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] name for the earlier dynasty.  The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as ''Shāng'' (商), and the capital as ''Dàyì Shāng'' (大邑商 &quot;Great Settlement Shang&quot;).{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}  It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978a|p=xiv}}

===Founding myth===
The founding myth of the Shang dynasty is described by Sima Qian in the ''Annals of the Yin''.  In the text, a woman named [[Jiandi]] (簡狄), who was the second wife of [[Emperor Ku]], swallowed an egg dropped by a black bird (玄鳥) and subsequently gave birth miraculously to [[Xie of Shang|Xie]] (偰) – also appearing as Qi (契).  Xie is said to have helped [[Yu the Great]] to control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] and for his service to have been granted a place called Shang as a fief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}, with additional details from the ''Historical Records''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynastic course===
In the ''Annals of the Yin'', Sima Qian writes that the dynasty was founded 13 generations after [[Xie of Shang|Xie]], when Xie's descendant [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] overthrew the impious and cruel final [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] ruler in the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].  The ''Records'' recount events from the reigns of Tang, [[Tai Jia]], [[Tai Wu]], [[Pan Geng]], [[Wu Ding]], [[Wu Yi of Shang|Wu Yi]] and the depraved final king [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]], but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name.  According to the ''Records'', the Shang moved their capital five times, with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}

Di Xin, the last Shang king, is said to have committed suicide after his army was defeated by [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu of Zhou]]. Legends say that his army and his equipped slaves betrayed him by joining the Zhou rebels in the decisive [[Battle of Muye]]. According to the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' and [[Mencius]] the battle was very bloody. The classic, [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict with rival factions of gods supporting different sides in the war.

After the Shang were defeated, King Wu allowed Di Xin's son [[Wu Geng]] to rule the Shang as a [[vassal]] kingdom.  However, Zhou Wu sent three of his brothers and an army to ensure that Wu Geng would not rebel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 邶、鄘二國考] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081821/http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 |date=17 June 2011 }} (Bei, Yong two national test)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ch.shvoong.com/humanities/1230377-%E5%91%A8%E5%88%9D-%E4%B8%89%E7%9B%91-%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%B6-%E9%84%98-%E5%8D%AB%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/ 周初&quot;三监&quot;与邶、鄘、卫地望研究] (Bei, Yong, Wei – looking at the research)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html &quot;三监&quot;人物疆地及其地望辨析 ——兼论康叔的始封地问题] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022308/http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html |date=9 May 2011 }} (breaking ground on Kangshu problem)&lt;/ref&gt; After Zhou Wu's death, the Shang joined the [[Rebellion of the Three Guards]] against the [[Duke of Zhou]], but the rebellion collapsed after three years, leaving Zhou in control of Shang territory.

===Descendants of the Shang royal family===
After Shang's collapse, Zhou's rulers forcibly relocated &quot;Yin diehards&quot; (殷頑) and scattered them throughout Zhou territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/jrxz/lztdzdxl/yuan231.htm 一 被剥削者的存在类型] (Expoited by the presence of...)&lt;/ref&gt; Some surviving members of the Shang royal family collectively changed their surname from the ancestral name Zi (子) to the name of their fallen dynasty, Yin. The family retained an aristocratic standing and often provided needed administrative services to the succeeding Zhou dynasty. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' states that [[King Cheng of Zhou]], with the support of his regent and uncle, the [[Duke of Zhou]], [[feoffment|enfeoffed]] Weiziqi (微子啟), a brother of Di Xin, as the Duke of [[Song (state)|Song]], with its capital at [[Shangqiu]]. This practice was known as [[w:zh:二王三恪|二王三恪]] (&quot;enfeoffment of three generations for two kings&quot;). The Dukes of Song would maintain rites honoring the Shang kings until [[Qi (state)|Qi]] conquered Song in 286&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Confucius]] was possibly a descendant of the Shang Kings through the Dukes of Song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Eastern Han dynasty bestowed the title of Duke of Song and ''&quot;Duke Who Continues and Honours the Yin&quot;'' ([[w:zh:殷紹嘉公|殷紹嘉公]]) upon Kong An ([[w:zh:孔安 (東漢)|孔安 (東漢)]]) because he was part of the Shang dynasty's legacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespigny2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Rafe de Crespigny|title= A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23–220 AD)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389|date= 28 December 2006|publisher= BRILL|isbn= 978-90-474-1184-0|pages= 389–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《汉书·杨胡朱梅云传》：初，武帝时，始封周后姬嘉为周子南君，至元帝时，尊周子南君为周承休侯，位次诸侯王。使诸大夫博士求殷后，分散为十余姓，郡国往往得其大家，推求子孙，绝不能纪。时，匡衡议，以为&quot;王者存二王后，所以尊其先王而通三统也。其犯诛绝之罪者绝，而更封他亲为始封君，上承其王者之始祖。《春秋》之义，诸侯不能守其社稷者绝。今宋国已不守其统而失国矣，则宜更立殷后为始封君，而上承汤统，非当继宋之绝侯也，宜明得殷后而已。今之故宋，推求其嫡，久远不可得；虽得其嫡，嫡之先已绝，不当得立。《礼记》孔子曰：‘丘，殷人也。’先师所共传，宜以孔子世为汤后。&quot;上以其语不经，遂见寝。&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of the Confucius family is a separate branch from the line that held the title of Marquis of Fengsheng village and later Duke Yansheng.

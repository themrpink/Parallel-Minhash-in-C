==Name==
Tianjin is the [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Chinese character]]s {{lang|zh|{{linktext|天津}}}}, which means &quot;[[Tian (god)|Heavenly]] [[river ford|Ford]]&quot; or &quot;Ford of Heaven&quot;.

The origin of the name is obscure. One [[folk etymology]] is that it was an homage to the patriotic [[state of Chu|Chu]] [[Chinese poetry|poet]] [[Qu Yuan]], whose &quot;[[Li Sao]]&quot; includes the verse &quot;... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...&quot; ({{lang|zh-hant|朝發軔於天津兮}}, ''zhāo fārèn yú Tiānjīn xī''). Another is that it honors a former name of the [[Girl (Chinese constellation)|girl]], a [[Chinese constellations|Chinese constellation]] recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the [[Book of Sui]]. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]]. The most common is that it was bestowed by the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew, the [[Jianwen Emperor]].

==History==

=== Early history ===
The land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by [[sedimentation]] of various rivers entering the sea at [[Bohai Gulf]], including the [[Yellow River]], which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] under the [[Sui dynasty]] helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from [[Hangzhou]] to the [[Beijing]] and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the [[Song dynasty]] and gains importance during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the [[Ming dynasty]]. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=813|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing dynasty===

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644{{ndash}}1911) Tianjin [[Zhou (country subdivision)|Prefecture]] or ''Zhou'' ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|州}}}}) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an [[Fu (country subdivision)|urban prefecture]] or ''Fu'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|府}}}}) before becoming a relay station ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|駐|地}}}}) under the command of the [[Viceroy of Zhili]].

===Opening up as a treaty port===
{{See also|Concessions in Tianjin}}
In 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded ''The Arrow'', a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral [[Michael Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Michael Seymour]] to capture the [[Taku forts]] near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the [[Second Opium War]] in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and [[Russia]], and even by countries without Chinese [[concession (territory)|concessions]] such as [[Austria-Hungary]], Italy and [[Belgium]], in establishing self-contained [[concessions in Tianjin]], each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0018246X15000461|title=Italy's Informal Imperialism in Tianjin During the Liberal Epoch, 1902–1922|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=59|issue=2|pages=447–468|date=June 2016|last1=Donati|first1=Sabina}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.

[[File:望海楼教堂.jpg|thumb|right|Church of Our Lady's Victories, built in 1869, was the site of the [[Tientsin massacre|Tianjin Church Massacre]].]]
The presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the [[Tientsin massacre|Tianjin Church Massacre]]. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin|Roman Catholic missionaries]], was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the [[magistrate]] of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.

In 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy ({{zh|labels=no|t=天津武備學堂}}) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbank1978&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;q=Liu+Chin-t%27ang%27s+big+German+guns+Pai+Yen-hu+without+resistance|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|access-date=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821143754/https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;q=Liu+Chin-t%27ang%27s+big+German+guns+Pai+Yen-hu+without+resistance#v=snippet&amp;q=wu-pei%20hsueh-t'ang%201885%20tardy&amp;f=false|archive-date=August 21, 2016|url-status=live}}{{rp|266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was supported by [[Huai Army|Anhui Army]] commander Zhou Shengchuan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbank1978&quot; /&gt;{{rp|267}} The academy was to serve Anhui Army and [[Green Standard Army]] officers.

In June 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby [[Langfang]], and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.

In July 1900, the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] [[Battle of Tientsin|recaptured Tientsin]]. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General [[Yuan Shikai]] led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.

Western nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.

Because of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|municipality]] of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of [[Hebei Province|Hopeh]], after which it was reestablished as a municipality.

Garrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], the &quot;architect of victory&quot; in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry]]. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
On July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected [[Concessions in Tianjin|foreign concessions]] until 1941, when the [[Concessions in Tianjin|American and British concessions]] were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the [[Tientsin Incident]]. On June 14, 1939, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] was advised by the [[Royal Navy]] and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937–1940)|North China Executive Committee]], a [[puppet state]] based in Beijing.

On August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]]. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to [[Vichy France|Vichy]]) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the [[Italian Social Republic]] formally ceded it to [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japan-controlled [[Reorganized National Government of China|puppet state]]. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.

===Post World War II===
[[File:China 10th Anniversary Parade in Tianjin.jpg|thumb|P.R.China's 10th anniversary parade in Tianjin in 1959]]
In the [[Pingjin Campaign]] of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.

From 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, [[Tianjin Port|Tanggu New Port]] officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to &quot;preparation, preparation for disasters&quot;, and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.

On July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|Tangshan Earthquake]], Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.

[[File:邓小平题开发区大有希望的天津泰达垦荒犁.jpg|thumb|Monument of TEDA]]
In 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the [[Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area|Tianjin Development Zone]]'s economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the [[Binhai|Binhai New Area]] with the [[Port of Tianjin|Tianjin Port]] as the core. In October 2005, the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee]] was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the [[Binhai New Area]] into the &quot;Eleventh Five-Year Plan&quot; and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an &quot;international port city, a northern economic center, and an &quot;ecological city&quot;. Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the &quot;State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area&quot; was announced and clearly stated: &quot;In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.

In August 2008, China's first [[high-speed railway]], the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|29th Olympic Games]]. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of [[World Economic Forum]] (also called [[Summer Davos]]) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |title=World Economic Forum: The Inaugural Annual Meeting of the New Champions |publisher=China.org |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232350/http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/04/china.climate.talks/index.html?hpt=T2 |title=Global climate talks kick off in China |publisher=CNN |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |date=October 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108184048/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/04/china.climate.talks/index.html?hpt=T2 |archive-date=November 8, 2012 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Tianjin Metro]] Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.

In October 2013, Tianjin hosted the [[East Asian Games]], which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as &quot;National Advanced Manufacturing R&amp;D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area&quot;. In the same year, the first phase of the [[South–North Water Transfer Project|South-to-North Water Transfer Project]] was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, [[Jincheng Group|Jincheng Bank]], the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a [[2015 Tianjin explosions|major fire and explosion accident]] occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-33896292|title=China blasts: Casualties as Tianjin warehouse blows up|work=BBC News|access-date=June 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718135259/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-33896292|archive-date=July 18, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tianjin is located along the west coast of the [[Bohai Gulf]], looking out to the provinces [[Shandong]] and [[Liaoning]] across those waters, bordered by [[Beijing]] {{convert|120|km|sp=us}} to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by [[Hebei]], with the exception of its eastern border,  the [[Bohai Sea]]. With a latitude ranging from 38° 34' to 40° 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116° 43' to 118° 04' E, the total area is {{convert|11,860.63|km2|sqmi|2||sp=us}}. There is {{convert|153|km|abbr=on}} of coastline and {{convert|1,137.48|km|mi|2||sp=us}} of land border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies at the northern end of the [[Grand Canal of China]], which connects with the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze River]]. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the [[Yan Mountains]] intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is [[Jiuding Shan|Jiuding Peak]] ({{lang|zh-hans|九顶山}}) in [[Ji County, Tianjin|Ji County]] on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of {{convert|1078.5|m|abbr=on}}.

The [[Hai River]] forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the [[Ziya River]] ({{lang|zh|子牙河}}), Daqing River ({{lang|zh|大清河}}), [[Yongding River]], North Grand Canal, and [[Grand Canal (China)|South Grand Canal]], and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in [[Tanggu District]]. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in [[Dagang District]]) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in [[Ji County, Tianjin|Ji County]].

===Climate===
Tianjin has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' bordering on ''Dwa''). It has a four-season, [[monsoon]]-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast [[Siberian anticyclone]], and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing [[Dust storm|sandstorms]] blowing in from the [[Gobi Desert]], capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−3.4|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|26.8|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{convert|12.9|°C|1}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of {{convert|511|mm|sp=us}}, and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the [[semi-arid]] zone, with parts of the municipality being [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''/''Dwa'', respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png &quot;Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification&quot;].

===Measures to improve air quality===
In May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pollution&quot; &gt;

Tropical rainforests provide [[timber]] as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Rainforests also have value as [[tourism]] destinations and for the [[ecosystem services]] provided. Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown on [[plantation]]s in regions that were formerly primary forest.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1985). ''The primary source''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], New York, pp. 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, plant-derived medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/fieldcourses03/PapersCostaRicaArticles/FinalPaper.TheMedicinalVa.html |title=Final Paper: The Medicinal Value of the Rainforest May 15, 2003.

On January 18, 2007, [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribes]] in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, [[Brazil]] has now overtaken the island of [[New Guinea]] as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN17285256 |title=Brazil sees traces of more isolated Amazon tribes |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2007-01-17 |access-date=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of Irian Jaya or [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]] in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survival-international.org/news.php?id=2191|date=2007-01-25|title=BBC: First contact with isolated tribes?|url-status=dead|website=SurvivalInternational.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206061137/http://survival-international.org/news.php?id=2191|archive-date=2008-02-06|access-date=2020-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes are in danger because of the deforestation, especially in Brazil.

Central African rainforest is home of the [[Mbuti]] [[pygmies]], one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59&amp;nbsp;inches, on average). They were the subject of a study by [[Colin Turnbull]], ''The Forest People'', in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm The Tribal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020212056/http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm |date=2012-10-20 }}, [[ThinkQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as “[[Negrito]]”.
There are many tribes in the rainforests of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. Sarawak is part of Borneo, the third largest island in the world. Some of the other tribes in Sarawak are: the Kayan, Kenyah, Kejaman, Kelabit, Punan Bah, Tanjong, Sekapan, and the Lahanan. Collectively, they are referred to as Dayaks or Orangulu which means &quot;people of the interior&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous People of the Rainforest |url=https://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/background/people.htm |website=Rainforest Information Centre Educational Supplement |access-date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of Sarawak's 1.5 million people are Dayaks. Most Dayaks, it is believed by anthropologists, came originally from the South-East Asian mainland. Their mythologies support this

[[Tropical rainforest|Tropical]] and [[temperate rainforest]]s have been subjected to heavy [[logging|legal]] and [[illegal logging]] for their valuable [[Tropical timber|hardwood]]s and [[agricultural expansion|agricultural]] clearance ([[slash-and-burn]], [[clearcutting]]) throughout the 20th century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081204095313/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/entire-rainforests-set-to-disappear-in-next-decade-585840.html Entire rainforests set to disappear in next decade], [[The Independent]] 5 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven to [[extinction]] (possibly more than 50,000 a year; at that rate, says [[E.

Another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding [[urban area]]s.

[[Image:Oblique rays 04 Pengo.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Solar radiation has a lower intensity in polar regions because the angle at which it hits the earth is not as direct as at the equator. Another effect is that sunlight has to go through more atmosphere to reach the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/education/edu06nature/ele_srad_e.htm|title=Why is the equator very hot and the poles very cold?|last=Yung|first=Chung-hoi|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''polar climate''' regions are characterized by a lack of warm [[summer]]s. Every month in a polar climate has an average temperature of less than {{convert|10|C|F}}. Regions with polar climate cover more than 20% of the Earth's area. Most of these regions are far from the equator, and in this case, winter days are extremely short and summer days are extremely long (could last for the entirety of each season or longer). A polar climate consists of cool summers and very cold winters, which results in treeless [[tundra]], [[glacier]]s, or a permanent or semi-permanent layer of [[ice]].

==Subtypes==
{{main|Ice cap climate|Tundra climate}}

There are two types of polar climate: '''ET''' and TY, or tundra climate; and '''EF''', or ice cap climate. A tundra climate is characterized by having at least one month whose average temperature is above {{convert|0|C|F}}, while an ice cap climate has no months above {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=McKnight | first1=Tom L | last2=Hess | first2=Darrel | year=2000 | chapter=Climate Zones and Types: The Köppen System | title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation | pages=[https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/235 235–7] | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-020263-5 | chapter-url-access=registration | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn | url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Are regions with between 1 and 29 days above 0 C of ice cap or tundra climate?|date=March 2018}} In a tundra climate, trees cannot grow, but other specialized plants can grow. In an ice cap climate, no plants can grow, and ice gradually accumulates until it flows elsewhere. Many [[high altitude]] locations on Earth have a climate where no month has an average temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} or higher, but as this is due to elevation, this climate is referred to as [[Alpine climate]]. Alpine climate can mimic either tundra or ice cap climate.

== Locations ==
[[File:Ursus maritimus mother with cub.jpg|A [[polar bear]] with cub|right|thumb]]
On Earth, the only continent where the ice cap polar climate is predominant is [[Antarctica]]. All but a few isolated coastal areas on the island of [[Greenland]] also have the ice cap climate. Coastal regions of Greenland that do not have permanent ice sheets have the less extreme tundra climates. The northernmost part of the Eurasian land mass, from the extreme northeastern coast of [[Scandinavia]] and eastwards to the [[Bering Strait]], large areas of northern [[Siberia]] and northern [[Iceland]] have tundra climate as well. Large areas in northern [[Canada]] and northern [[Alaska]] have tundra climate, changing to ice cap climate in the most northern parts of Canada. Southernmost [[South America]] ([[Tierra del Fuego]] where it abuts the [[Drake Passage]]) and such subantarctic islands such as the [[South Shetland Islands]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] have [[tundra]] climates of slight [[thermal]] range in which no month is as warm as {{convert|10|C|F}}. These subantarctic lowlands are found closer to the [[equator]] than the coastal tundras of the Arctic basin.

===Arctic===
{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}
[[Image:Arctic big.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A map of the Arctic. The red line indicates the 10°C [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] in July and the white area shows the average minimum [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent of sea ice]] in [[summer]] as of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613024704/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/reference_maps/pdf/arctic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some parts of the Arctic are covered by ice ([[sea ice]], [[glacier|glacial ice]], or [[snow]]) year-round, and nearly all parts of the Arctic experience long periods with some form of ice on the surface. Average January temperatures range from about {{convert|−40|to|0|C|F}}, and winter temperatures can drop below {{convert|−50|C|F}} over large parts of the Arctic. Average July temperatures range from about {{convert|−10|to|10|C|F}}, with some land areas occasionally exceeding {{convert|30|C|F}} in summer.

The Arctic consists of ocean that is almost surrounded by land. As such, the [[climate]] of much of the [[Arctic]] is moderated by the ocean water, which can never have a temperature below {{convert|−2|C|F}}. In winter, this relatively warm water, even though covered by the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice pack]], keeps the [[North Pole]] from being the coldest place in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it is also part of the reason that [[Antarctica]] is so much colder than the Arctic. In summer, the presence of the nearby water keeps coastal areas from warming as much as they might otherwise, just as it does in [[temperate]] regions with [[maritime climate]]s.

===Antarctica===
{{main|Climate of Antarctica}}
The [[climate]] of [[Antarctica]] is the coldest on Earth. Antarctica has the lowest naturally occurring [[temperature]] ever recorded: {{convert|−89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok, Antarctica|Vostok Station]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ecoworldly coldest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecoworldly.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218000756/http://ecoworldly.com/2008/12/14/the-coldest-inhabited-places-on-earth/ |archivedate=2008-12-18|title=The Coldest Inhabited Places on Earth |publisher=Eco Worldly |date=2008-12-14 |author=Gavin Hudson |accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also extremely dry (technically a [[desert]]), averaging {{convert|166|mm|in}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year, as [[weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent.

==Quantifying polar climate==
There have been several attempts at quantifying what constitutes a polar climate.

Climatologist [[Wladimir Köppen]] demonstrated a relationship between the Arctic and Antarctic tree lines and the {{convert|10|C|F}} summer isotherm; i.e., places where the average temperature in the warmest calendar month of the year is below {{convert|10|C|F}} cannot support forests. See [[Köppen climate classification]] for more information.

[[Otto Nordenskjöld]] theorized that winter conditions also play a role: His formula is {{nowrap|1=''W'' = 9 − 0.1 ''C''}}, where ''W'' is the average temperature in the warmest month and ''C'' the average of the coldest month, both in degrees Celsius. For example, if a particular location had an average temperature of {{convert|−20|C|F}} in its coldest month, the warmest month would need to average {{convert|11|C|F}} or higher for trees to be able to survive there as {{nowrap|1=9 − 0.1(−20) = 11}}. Nordenskiöld's line tends to run to the north of Köppen's near the west coasts of the Northern Hemisphere continents, south of it in the interior sections, and at about the same latitude along the east coasts of both Asia and North America. In the Southern Hemisphere, all of [[Tierra del Fuego]] lies outside the polar region in Nordenskiöld's system, but part of the island (including [[Ushuaia]], [[Argentina]]) is reckoned as being within the Antarctic under Köppen's.

In 1947, [[Holdridge life zone|Holdridge improved on these schemes]], by defining [[biotemperature]]: the mean annual temperature, where all temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F|disp=or}} (and above {{convert|30|C|F|disp=or}}) are treated as 0&amp;nbsp;°C (because it makes no difference to plant life, being dormant). If the mean biotemperature is between {{convert|1.5|and|3|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~amjones/dundee/36biomes.htm|title=Biodiversity lectures and practicals|first=Allan|last=Jones|publisher=University of Dundee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131915/http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~amjones/dundee/36biomes.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holdridge quantifies the climate as [[subarctic climate|subpolar]] (or alpine, if the low temperature is caused by elevation).

The '''subarctic climate''' (also called '''subpolar climate''', or '''boreal climate''') is a [[climate]] characterised by long, usually very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers. It is found on large landmasses, away from the moderating effects of an ocean, generally at [[latitude]]s from 50° to 70°N poleward of the [[humid continental climate]]s. Subarctic or boreal climates are the source regions for the cold air that affects temperate latitudes to the south in winter. These climates represent [[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'', ''Dwc'', ''Dsc'', ''Dfd'', ''Dwd'' and  ''Dsd''.

==Description==
This type of climate offers some of the most extreme seasonal temperature variations found on the planet: in [[winter]], temperatures can drop to below {{convert|-50|°C}} and in [[summer]], the temperature may exceed {{convert|26|°C}}. However, the summers are short; no more than three months of the year (but at least one month) must have a 24-hour average temperature of at least {{convert|10|°C}} to fall into this category of climate and the coldest month should average below {{convert|0|°C}} (or {{convert|-3|°C}}).  Record low temperatures can approach {{convert|-70|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stepanova|first1=N.A.|title=On the Lowest Temperatures on Earth|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=86|issue=1|pages=6–10|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/086/mwr-086-01-0006.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2018|bibcode=1958MWRv...86....6S|year=1958|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1958)086&lt;0006:OTLTOE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With 5–7 consecutive months where the average temperature is below freezing, all moisture in the soil and subsoil freezes solidly to depths of many feet. Summer warmth is insufficient to thaw more than a few surface feet, so [[permafrost]] prevails under most areas not near the southern boundary of this climate zone. Seasonal thaw penetrates from {{convert|2|to|14|ft|m|abbr=on}}, depending on latitude, aspect, and type of ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;usdf&quot;&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/colorimagemap/images/130.html Subarctic Division] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105072109/http://www.fs.fed.us/colorimagemap/images/130.html |date=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some northern areas with subarctic climates located near oceans (southern [[Alaska]], the northern fringe of Europe, [[Sakhalin Oblast]] and [[Kamchatka Oblast]]), have milder winters and no permafrost, and are more suited for farming unless precipitation is excessive. The frost-free season is very short, varying from about 45 to 100 days at most, and a freeze can occur during any month in many areas.

===Description===
The first D indicates continental.
* ''s'': A dry summer&amp;mdash;the driest month in the high-sun half of the year (April to September in the Northern Hemisphere, October to March in the Southern Hemisphere) has less than {{convert|30|mm|2|abbr=}}/{{convert|40|mm|2|abbr=}} of rainfall and has exactly or less than {{fraction|3}} the precipitation of the wettest month in the low-sun half of the year (October to March in the Northern Hemisphere, April to September in the Southern Hemisphere),
* ''w'': A dry winter&amp;mdash;the driest month in the low-sun half of the year has exactly or less than one‑tenth of the precipitation found in the wettest month in the summer half of the year,
* ''f'': Without dry season&amp;mdash;does not meet either of the alternative specifications.
The third letter denotes temperature:
* ''c'': Regular subarctic, only 1–3 months above {{convert|10|°C|1}}, coldest month below {{convert|-3|°C|1}}.
* ''d'': Extreme subarctic, only 1–3 months above {{convert|10|°C|1}}, coldest month at or below {{convert|-38|°C|1}}.

===Precipitation===
Most subarctic climates have little precipitation, typically no more than {{convert|380|mm|abbr=on}} over an entire year. Away from the coasts, precipitation occurs mostly in the warmer months, while in coastal areas with subarctic climates the heaviest precipitation is usually during the autumn months when the relative warmth of sea vis-à-vis land is greatest. Low precipitation, by the standards of more temperate regions with longer summers and warmer winters, is typically sufficient in view of the very low [[evapotranspiration]] to allow a water-logged terrain in many areas of subarctic climate and to permit snow cover during winter.

A notable exception to this pattern is that subarctic climates occurring at high altitudes in otherwise temperate regions have extremely high precipitation due to [[orographic lift]]. [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], with temperatures typical of a subarctic climate, receives an average rain-equivalent of {{convert|101.91|in|mm|1}} of precipitation per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/normals.php Mount Washington Observatory: Normals, Means, and Extremes, Retrieved July 1, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal areas of [[Khabarovsk Krai]] also have much higher precipitation in summer due to orographic influences (up to {{convert|175|mm|in}} in July in some areas), whilst the mountainous [[Kamchatka]] peninsula and [[Sakhalin]] island are even wetter, since orographic moisture isn't confined to the warmer months and creates large [[glacier]]s in Kamchatka. [[Labrador]], in eastern Canada, is similarly wet throughout the year due to the semi-permanent [[Icelandic Low]] and can receive up to {{convert|1300|mm|in|0}} of rainfall equivalent per year, creating a snow cover of up to {{convert|1.5|m|in|0}} that does not melt until June.

===Vegetation and land use===
[[Vegetation]] in regions with subarctic climates is generally of low diversity, as only hardy species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers. [[Tree]]s are mostly limited to [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s, as few broadleaved trees are able to survive the very low temperatures in winter. This type of forest is also known as [[taiga]], a term which is sometimes applied to the climate found therein as well. Even though the diversity may be low, numbers are high, and the taiga (boreal) forest is the largest forest biome on the planet, with most of the forests located in Russia and Canada. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold temperatures is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].

Agricultural potential is generally poor, due to the natural infertility of soils&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/land/ecosysmgmt/colorimagemap/images/130.html|title=Subarctic Division|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of swamps and lakes left by departing [[ice sheet]]s, and short growing seasons prohibit all but the hardiest of crops. Despite the short season, the long summer days at such latitudes do permit some agriculture. In some areas, ice has scoured rock surfaces bare, entirely stripping off the overburden. Elsewhere, rock basins have been formed and stream courses dammed, creating countless lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;usdf&quot; /&gt;

===''Dsc'' and ''Dsd'' distribution===
Climates classified as ''Dsc'' or ''Dsd'', with a dry summer, are rare, occurring in very small areas at high altitudes around the Mediterranean Basin, [[Iran]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Alaska]] and other parts of the [[northwestern United States]] ([[Eastern Washington]], [[Eastern Oregon]], [[Southern Idaho]], California's [[Eastern Sierra]]) and the [[Russian Far East]], such as in [[Seneca, Oregon]] or [[Atlin, British Columbia]].

===''Dwc'' distribution===
{{Anchor|Koppen_Dwc}}In parts of East Asia, like China, the [[Siberian High]] makes the winters colder than places like Scandinavia or Alaska interior but extremely dry (typically with around {{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}} of rainfall equivalent per month) that snow cover is very limited, creating a ''Dwc'' climate in:
*Much of northern [[Mongolia]]
*Russia:
**Most of [[Khabarovsk Krai]] except the south
**Southeastern [[Sakha Republic]]
**Southern [[Magadan Oblast]]
**Northern [[Amur Oblast]]
**Northern [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]
**[[Zabaykalsky Krai]]
**[[Irkutsk Oblast]]
*China:
**[[Tahe County]] and [[Mohe County]] in [[Heilongjiang]]
**Northern [[Hulunbuir]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]
**[[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Gannan]] in [[Gansu]] (due to extreme altitude)
**[[Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Huangnan]], eastern [[Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Hainan]] and eastern [[Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Guoluo]] in [[Qinghai]] (due to extreme altitude)
**Most of [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Garzê]] and [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture|Ngawa Autonomous Prefectures]] (due to extreme altitude) in [[Sichuan]]
**Most of [[Qamdo Prefecture]] (due to extreme altitude) in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]
* Parts of [[Ladakh]] (including [[Siachen Glacier]]) and [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] regions of [[India]]{{Citation needed|reason=Not included in the referenced Köppen-Geiger Climate Map of the World by Murray Peel|date=October 2019}}
* Parts of [[Kaema Plateau]] (including [[Mount Baekdu]], [[Samjiyon]], [[Musan]]) in [[North Korea]]{{Citation needed|reason=Not included in the referenced Köppen-Geiger Climate Map of the World by Murray Peel|date=October 2019}}

Further north in Siberia, continentality increases so much that winters can be exceptionally severe, averaging below {{convert|-38|°C}}, even though the hottest month still averages more than {{convert|10|°C}}. This creates ''Dfd'', ''Dwd'' and ''Dsd'' climates.{{clarify|What is the difference between Dfd, Dwd and Dsd?|date=October 2014}}

Should one go poleward or even toward a polar sea, one finds that the warmest month has an average temperature of less than {{convert|10|°C}}, and the subarctic climate grades into a [[tundra]] climate even less suitable for trees. Equatorward or toward a lower altitude, this climate grades into the [[humid continental climate]]s with longer summers (and usually less-severe winters); in a few locations close to a temperate sea (as in [[North Norway|northern Norway]] and [[Southcentral Alaska|southern Alaska]]), this climate can grade into a short-summer version of an [[oceanic climate]], the [[subpolar oceanic climate]], as the sea is approached. In China and Mongolia, as one moves southwestwards or towards lower altitudes, temperatures increase but precipitation is so low that the subarctic climate grades into a cold [[semi-arid climate]].

'''Biostasis''' or [[Cryptobiosis]] is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microorganisms==
Biostasis in this context is also synonymous for '''viable but nonculturable state'''. In the past{{when|date=December 2018}} when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as &quot;starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light&quot; (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include &quot;dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis&quot;. (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who were in the growth state.

It is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. &quot;They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;&quot; (9)

'''Fungistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (viable but nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as &quot;when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture.&quot; (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability etc.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to &quot;slow life to save life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|website=www.darpa.mil|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==== Protein chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

==== Intracellular crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brangwynne|first1=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473|bibcode=2015NatPh..11..899B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Boothby|first1=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|pmid=28306513|pmc=5987194|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

As chitin is a component of the [[cell wall]]s of [[fungi]] and [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] elements of some animals (including [[mollusk]]s and [[arthropod]]s), chitinases are generally found in organisms that either need to reshape their own chitin&lt;ref name=&quot;Sami1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sámi L, Pusztahelyi T, Emri T, Varecza Z, Fekete A, Grallert A, Karanyi Z, Kiss L, Pócsi I | title = Autolysis and aging of Penicillium chrysogenum cultures under carbon starvation: Chitinase production and antifungal effect of allosamidin | journal = The Journal of General and Applied Microbiology | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–211 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 12483620 | doi = 10.2323/jgam.47.201 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; or dissolve and digest the chitin of fungi or animals.

They attack living [[arthropod]]s, [[zooplankton]] or fungi or they may degrade the remains of these organisms.

Fungi, such as ''[[Coccidioides]] immitis'', also possess degradative chitinases related to their role as detritivores and also to their potential as arthropod pathogens.

Chitinases are also present in plants (barley seed chitinase: {{PDB|1CNS}}, {{EC number|3.2.1.14}}); some of these are [[pathogenesis related (PR) proteins]] that are [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|induced]] as part of systemic acquired resistance. Expression is mediated by the NPR1 gene and the salicylic acid pathway, both involved in resistance to fungal and insect attack.  Other plant chitinases may be required for creating fungal symbioses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10875337&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salzer P, Bonanomi A, Beyer K, Vögeli-Lange R, Aeschbacher RA, Lange J, Wiemken A, Kim D, Cook DR, Boller T | title = Differential expression of eight chitinase genes in Medicago truncatula roots during mycorrhiza formation, nodulation, and pathogen infection | journal = Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 763–77 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10875337 | doi = 10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.7.763 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mammals do not produce chitin, they have two functional chitinases, Chitotriosidase (CHIT1) and acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), as well as chitinase-like proteins (such as [[CHI3L1|YKL-40]]) that have high sequence similarity but lack chitinase activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eurich K, Segawa M, Toei-Shimizu S, Mizoguchi E | title = Potential role of chitinase 3-like-1 in inflammation-associated carcinogenic changes of epithelial cells | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 15 | issue = 42 | pages = 5249–59 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19908331 | pmc = 2776850 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.15.5249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

# Endochitinases ({{EC number|3.2.1.14}}) randomly split chitin at internal sites of the chitin microfibril, forming soluble, low molecular mass [[multimer]] products. The multimer products includes di-acetylchitobiose, chitotriose, and chitotetraose, with the dimer being the predominant product.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Sahai AS, Manocha MS |date=1993-08-01|title=Chitinases of fungi and plants: their involvement in morphogenesis and host—parasite interaction | journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 317–338 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.1993.tb00004.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Endochitinase.png|thumb|679x679px|Endochitinase breaking down chitin into multimer products.|center]]
#Exochitinases have also been divided into two sub categories:
## Chitobiosidases ({{EC number|3.2.1.29}}) act on the non-reducing end of the chitin microfibril, releasing the dimer, di-acetylchitobiose, one by one from the chitin chain. Therefore, there is no release of [[monosaccharide]]s or [[oligosaccharide]]s in this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Harman GE | title=Chitinolytic Enzymes of Trichoderma harzianum: Purification of Chitobiosidase and Endochitinase | journal=Phytopathology|volume=83|issue=3|pages=313|doi=10.1094/phyto-83-313 | year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
## β-1,4- ''N''-acetylglucosaminidases ({{EC number|3.2.1.30}}) split the multimer products, such as di-acetylchitobiose, chitotriose, and chitotetraose, into monomers of [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucoseamine]] (GlcNAc).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Exochitinase.png|thumb|697x697px|Exochitinase breaking down chitin into dimers via chitobiosidase and monomers via β-1,4 N-acetylglucosaminidase.|center]]

Chitinases were also classified based on the amino acid sequences, as that would be more helpful in understanding the evolutionary relationships of these enzymes to each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patil|first=Reetarani S.|last2=Ghormade|first2=Vandana|last3=Deshpande|first3=Mukund V. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Chitinolytic enzymes: an exploration |journal=Enzyme and Microbial Technology | date =  April 2000 |volume=26|issue=7|pages=473–483|doi=10.1016/s0141-0229(00)00134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the chitinases were grouped into three [[Glycoside hydrolase families|families]]: [[Glycoside hydrolase family 18|18]], [[Glycoside hydrolase family 19|19]], and [[Glycoside hydrolase family 20|20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henrissat B | title = A classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino acid sequence similarities | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 280 | pages = 309–16 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1747104 | pmc = 1130547 | doi=10.1042/bj2800309 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both families 18 and 19 consists of endochitinases from a variety of different organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, insect, and plants. However, family 19 mainly comprises plant chitinases. Family 20 includes ''N-''acetylglucosaminidase and a similar enzyme, [[N-acetylhexosaminidase|''N''-acetylhexosaminidase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt;

And as the gene sequences of the chitinases were known, they were further classified into six classes based on their sequences. Characteristics that determined the classes of chitinases were the N-terminal sequence, localization of the enzyme, [[Isoelectric Ph|isoelectric pH]], [[signal peptide]], and [[inducer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt;

Class I chitinases had a cysteine-rich N-terminal, leucine- or valine-rich signal peptide, and [[Vacuole|vacuolar]] localization. And then, Class I chitinases were further subdivided based on their acidic or basic nature into Class Ia and Class Ib, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Flach J, Pilet PE, Jollès P | date = August 1992 | title=What's new in chitinase research? | journal = Experientia | volume=48|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.1007/BF02124285 | pmid = 1516675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Class 1 chitinases were found to comprise only plant chitinases and mostly endochitinases.

Class II chitinases did not have the cysteine-rich N-terminal but had a similar sequence to Class I chitinases. Class II chitinases were found in plants, fungi, and bacteria and mostly consisted of exochitinases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt;

Class III chitinases did not have similar sequences to chitinases in Class I or Class II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt;

Class IV chitinases had similar characteristics, including the immunological properties, as Class I chitinases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt; However, Class IV chitinases were significantly smaller in size compared to Class I chitinases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collinge|first=David B. |last2=Kragh|first2=Karsten M. |last3=Mikkelsen|first3=Jørn D. |last4=Nielsen|first4=Klaus K. |last5=Rasmussen|first5=Ulla |last6=Vad |first6=Knud| name-list-style = vanc | date=1993-01-01|title=Plant chitinases |journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=31–40|doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.t01-1-00999.x |pmid=8401605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class V and Class VI chitinases are not well characterized. However, one example of a Class V chitinase showed two chitin [[binding domain]]s in tandem, and based on the gene sequence, the cysteine-rich N-terminal seemed to have been lost during evolution, probably due to less selection pressure that caused the catalytic domain to lose its function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patil_2000&quot; /&gt;

== Function ==
Like cellulose, chitin is an abundant biopolymer that is relatively resistant to degradation.&lt;ref name=Akaki1&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |vauthors=Akaki C, Duke GE |year=2005 |volume=283 |issue=4–5 |pages=387–393 |title=Apparent chitin digestibilities in the Eastern screech owl (''Otus asio'') and the American kestrel (''Falco sparverius'') |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990301/01)283:4/5&lt;387::AID-JEZ8&gt;3.0.CO;2-W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically not digested by animals, though certain fish are able to digest chitin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556391&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutowska MA, Drazen JC, Robison BH | title = Digestive chitinolytic activity in marine fishes of Monterey Bay, California | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

Human chitinases may explain the link between some of the most common allergies ([[dust mite]]s, mold spores—both of which contain chitin) and [[worm]] ([[helminth]]) infections, as part of one version of the [[hygiene hypothesis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16202576&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maizels RM | title = Infections and allergy - helminths, hygiene and host immune regulation | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 656–61 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16202576 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2005.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14723608&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter MM, McKay DM | title = Review article: helminths as therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–77 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14723608 | doi = 10.1111/j.0269-2813.2004.01803.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12756068&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmas C, Gabriele F, Conchedda M, Bortoletti G, Ecca AR | title = Causality or coincidence: may the slow disappearance of helminths be responsible for the imbalances in immune control mechanisms? | journal = Journal of Helminthology | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–53 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12756068 | doi = 10.1079/JOH2003176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (worms have chitinous mouthparts to hold the intestinal wall).

== Regulation in fungi ==
Regulation varies from species to species, and within an organism, chitinases with different physiological functions would be under different regulation mechanisms. For example, chitinases that are involved in maintenance, such as remodeling the cell wall, are constitutively expressed. However, chitinases that have specialized functions, such as degrading exogenous chitin or participating in cell division, need [[Spatiotemporal gene expression|spatio-temporal regulation]] of the chitinase activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langner T, Göhre V | title = Fungal chitinases: function, regulation, and potential roles in plant/pathogen interactions | journal = Current Genetics | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–54 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26527115 | doi = 10.1007/s00294-015-0530-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation of an endochitinase in ''[[Trichoderma]] atroviride'' is dependent on a ''N-''acetylglucosaminidase, and the data indicates a feedback-loop where the break down of chitin produces ''N-''acetylglucosamine, which would be possibly taken up and triggers up-regulation of the chitinbiosidases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner K, Peterbauer CK, Mach RL, Lorito M, Zeilinger S, Kubicek CP | title = The Nag1 N-acetylglucosaminidase of Trichoderma atroviride is essential for chitinase induction by chitin and of major relevance to biocontrol | journal = Current Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–95 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12748812 | doi = 10.1007/s00294-003-0399-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and the regulation of ScCts1p (''S. cerevisiae'' chitinase 1), one of the chitinases involved in cell separation after [[cytokinesis]] by degrading the chitin of the [[Septum (cell biology)|primary septum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuranda MJ, Robbins PW | title = Chitinase is required for cell separation during growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 266 | issue = 29 | pages = 19758–67 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1918080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As these types of chitinases are important in [[cell division]], there must be tight regulation and activation. Specifically, ''Cts1'' expression has to be activated in daughter cells during late [[mitosis]] and the protein has to localize at the daughter site of the septum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colman-Lerner A, Chin TE, Brent R | title = Yeast Cbk1 and Mob2 activate daughter-specific genetic programs to induce asymmetric cell fates | journal = Cell | volume = 107 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–50 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11747810 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00596-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And to do this, there must be coordination with other networks controlling the different phases of the cell, such as [[Cdc14|Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR)]], [[Mitotic exit|mitotic exit network (MEN)]], and regulation of Ace2p (transcription factor) and cellular morphogenesis (RAM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson B, Kurischko C, Horecka J, Mody M, Nair P, Pratt L, Zougman A, McBroom LD, Hughes TR, Boone C, Luca FC | title = RAM: a conserved signaling network that regulates Ace2p transcriptional activity and polarized morphogenesis | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 3782–803 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12972564 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E03-01-0018 | pmc = 196567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; signalling networks. Overall, the integration of the different regulatory networks allows for the cell wall degrading chitinase to function dependent on the cell's stage in the cell cycle and at specific locations among the daughter cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

== Presence in food ==
Chitinases occur naturally in many common foods. Bananas, chestnuts, kiwifruit, avocados, papaya, and tomatoes, for example, all contain significant levels of chitinase, as defense against fungal and invertebrate attack. Stress, or environmental signals like [[ethylene]] gas, may stimulate increased production of chitinase.

Some parts of chitinase molecules, almost identical in structure to [[hevein (protein)|hevein]] or other proteins in rubber latex due to their similar function in plant defense, may trigger an allergic cross-reaction known as [[Latex allergy#Latex-fruit syndrome|latex-fruit syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Latex-Fruit Syndrome and Class 2 Food Allergy | url = http://dmd.nihs.go.jp/latex/cross-e.html | work = Division of Medical Devices, Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Chitinases have a wealth of applications, some of which have already been realized by industry. This includes bio-conversion of chitin to useful products such as [[fertilizer]], the production of non-allergenic, non-toxic, [[biocompatible]], and [[biodegradable]] materials ([[contact lenses]], [[artificial skin]] and [[Surgical suture|suture]]s with these qualities are already being produced) and enhancement of [[insecticide]]s and [[fungicide]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamid R, Khan MA, Ahmad M, Ahmad MM, Abdin MZ, Musarrat J, Javed S | title = Chitinases: An update | journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23559820 | pmc = 3612335 | doi = 10.4103/0975-7406.106559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible future applications of chitinases are as food additives to increase shelf life, therapeutic agent for asthma and chronic [[rhinosinusitis]], as an anti-fungal remedy, an anti-tumor drug and as a general ingredient to be used in [[protein engineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;update&quot;/&gt;

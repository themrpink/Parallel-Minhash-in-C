On [[VHF]], phased arrays are used extensively for [[FM broadcasting]]. These greatly increase the [[antenna gain]], magnifying the emitted RF energy toward the [[horizon]], which in turn greatly increases a station's [[broadcast range]]. In these situations, the distance to each element from the transmitter is identical, or is one (or other [[integer]]) wavelength apart. Phasing the array such that the lower elements are slightly delayed (by making the distance to them longer) causes a downward [[beam tilt]], which is very useful if the antenna is quite high on a [[radio tower]].

Other phasing adjustments can increase the downward radiation in the [[far field]] without tilting the main [[Side lobe|lobe]], creating [[null fill]] to compensate for extremely high [[mountain]]top locations, or decrease it in the [[near and far field|near field]], to prevent excessive exposure to those workers or even nearby homeowners on the ground.  The latter effect is also achieved by half-wave spacing{{Snd}} inserting additional elements halfway between existing elements with full-wave spacing.  This phasing achieves roughly the same horizontal gain as the full-wave spacing; that is, a five-element full-wave-spaced array equals a nine- or ten-element half-wave-spaced array.

=== Radar ===
Phased array radar systems are also used by [[warships]] of many navies. Because of the rapidity with which the [[Beam steering|beam can be steered]], phased array radars allow a warship to use one [[radar]] system for surface detection and tracking (finding ships), air detection and tracking (finding aircraft and missiles) and missile uplink capabilities. Before using these systems, each [[surface-to-air missile]] in flight required a dedicated [[fire-control radar]], which meant that radar-guided weapons could only engage a small number of simultaneous targets. Phased array systems can be used to control missiles during the mid-course phase of the missile's flight. During the terminal portion of the flight, [[continuous-wave]] fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target. Because the antenna pattern is [[Beam steering|electronically steered]], phased array systems can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a [[fire-control system|fire control quality]] track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several in-flight missiles.

==Mathematical perspective and formulas==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Phase array sweep.webm|thumb|Radiation pattern of phased array containing 7 emitters spaced a quarter wavelength apart, showing the beam switching direction.  The phase shift between adjacent emitters is switched from 45 degrees to −45 degrees]]

[[File:Phased array radiation pattern.gif|thumb|483x483px|The radiation pattern of a phased array in polar coordinate system.]]
Mathematically a phased array is an example of ''N''-slit [[diffraction]], in which the radiation field at the receiving point is the result of the coherent addition of ''N'' point sources in a line.  Since each individual antenna acts as a slit, emitting radio waves, their diffraction pattern can be calculated by adding the phase shift φ to the fringing term.

We will begin from the ''N''-slit diffraction pattern derived on the [[diffraction formalism]] page, with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits of equal size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta \right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2}  kd \sin\theta \right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{kd}{2}    \sin\theta \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, adding a φ term to the &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;kd\sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; fringe effect in the second term yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{{2\pi d}}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)\right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \frac{\phi}{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square of the wave function gives us the intensity of the wave.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                      {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi\right)\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \frac{\phi}{2} \right)}
           \right)^2 \\
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                                {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi  }{\lambda} Nd \sin\theta + \frac{N}{2} \phi\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}    \sin\theta + \frac{\phi}{2} \right)}\right)^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now space the emitters a distance &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{4}&lt;/math&gt; apart.  This distance is chosen for simplicity of calculation but can be adjusted as any scalar fraction of the wavelength.

:&lt;math&gt;I = I_0{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda } \sin\theta \right)}{\frac{\pi a}{\lambda }
\sin\theta }\right)}^2}{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4} N \sin\theta+\frac{N}{2} \phi \right)}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4}
\sin\theta+ \frac{\phi}{2} \right)}\right)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As sine achieves its maximum at &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we set the numerator of the second term = 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\pi}{4}N\sin\theta + \frac{N}{2}\phi &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{N}{2}\phi \right)\frac{4}{N\pi} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \frac{2}{N} - \frac{2\phi}{\pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus as ''N'' gets large, the term will be dominated by the &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{2\phi}{\pi}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; term.  As sine can oscillate between −1 and 1, we can see that setting &lt;math&gt;\phi=-\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; will send the maximum energy on an angle given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \sin^{-1} 1 = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we can see that if we wish to adjust the angle at which the maximum energy is emitted, we need only to adjust the phase shift φ between successive antennas.  Indeed, the phase shift corresponds to the negative angle of maximum signal.

A similar calculation will show that the denominator is minimized by the same factor.

== Different types of phased arrays ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Beamforming}}
There are two main types of beamformers. These are [[time domain]] beamformers and [[frequency domain]] beamformers.

A graduated attenuation window is sometimes applied across the face of the array to improve side-lobe suppression performance, in addition to the phase shift.

Time domain beamformer works by introducing time delays. The basic operation is called &quot;delay and sum&quot;. It delays the incoming signal from each array element by a certain amount of time, and then adds them together. A [[Butler matrix]] allows several beams to be formed simultaneously, or one beam to be scanned through an arc. The most common kind of time domain beam former is serpentine waveguide. Active phased array designs use individual delay lines that are switched on and off. [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters vary the phase delay using the strength of a magnetic field.

There are two different types of frequency domain beamformers.

The first type separates the different frequency components that are present in the received signal into multiple frequency bins (using either a [[Discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) or a [[filterbank]]). When different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each frequency bin, the result is that the main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies. This can be an advantage for communication links, and is used with the [[SPS-48]] radar.

The other type of frequency domain beamformer makes use of Spatial Frequency. Discrete samples are taken from each of the individual array elements. The samples are processed using a DFT. The DFT introduces multiple different discrete phase shifts during processing. The outputs of the DFT are individual channels that correspond with evenly spaced beams formed simultaneously. A 1-dimensional DFT produces a fan of different beams. A 2-dimensional DFT produces beams with a [[pineapple]] configuration.

These techniques are used to create two kinds of phased array.
:* Dynamic{{Snd}} an array of variable phase shifters are used to move the beam
:* Fixed{{Snd}} the beam position is stationary with respect to the array face and the whole antenna is moved

There are two further sub-categories that modify the kind of dynamic array or fixed array.
:* Active{{Snd}} amplifiers or processors are in each phase shifter element
:* Passive{{Snd}} large central amplifier with attenuating phase shifters

=== Dynamic phased array ===
Each array element incorporates an adjustable phase shifter that are collectively used to move the beam with respect to the array face.

Dynamic phased array require no physical movement to aim the beam. The beam is moved electronically. This can produce antenna motion fast enough to use a small pencil-beam to simultaneously track multiple targets while searching for new targets using just one radar set (track while search).

As an example, an antenna with a 2 degree beam with a pulse rate of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz will require approximately 8 seconds to cover an entire hemisphere consisting of 8,000 pointing positions. This configuration provides 12 opportunities to detect a {{convert|1000|m/s|mph km/h|abbr=on}} vehicle over a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which is suitable for military applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The position of mechanically steered antennas can be predicted, which can be used to create [[electronic countermeasures]] that interfere with radar operation. The flexibility resulting from phased array operation allows beams to be aimed at random locations, which eliminates this vulnerability. This is also desirable for military applications.

=== Fixed phased array ===
[[File:Antenna-tower-collinear-et-al.jpg|thumb|130px|An antenna tower consisting of a fixed phase collinear antenna array with four elements]]
Fixed phased array antennas are typically used to create an antenna with a more desirable form factor than the conventional [[parabolic reflector]] or [[cassegrain reflector]]. Fixed phased arrays incorporate fixed phase shifters. For example, most commercial FM Radio and TV antenna towers use a [[collinear antenna array]], which is a fixed phased array of dipole elements.

In radar applications, this kind of phased array is physically moved during the track and scan process. There are two configurations.
:* Multiple frequencies with a delay-line
:* Multiple adjacent beams

The [[SPS-48]] radar uses multiple transmit frequencies with a serpentine delay line along the left side of the array to produce vertical fan of stacked beams. Each frequency experiences a different phase shift as it propagates down the serpentine delay line, which forms different beams. A filter bank is used to split apart the individual receive beams. The antenna is mechanically rotated.

[[Semi-active radar homing]] uses [[monopulse radar]] that relies on a fixed phased array to produce multiple adjacent beams that measure angle errors. This form factor is suitable for [[gimbal]] mounting in missile seekers.

=== Active phased array ===
[[Active electronically scanned array|Active electronically-scanned array]]s (AESA) elements incorporate transmit amplification with [[phase shift]] in each [[Transceiver|antenna element]] (or group of elements). Each element also includes receive pre-amplification. The phase shifter setting is the same for transmit and receive.&lt;ref&gt;Active Electronically Steered Arrays{{Snd}} A Maturing Technology (ausairpower.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

Active phased arrays do not require phase reset after the end of the transmit pulse, which is compatible with [[Doppler radar]] and [[pulse-Doppler radar]].

=== Passive phased array ===
[[Passive phased array]]s typically use large amplifiers that produce all of the microwave transmit signal for the antenna. Phase shifters typically consist of waveguide elements controlled by magnetic field, voltage gradient, or equivalent technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|title=YIG-sphere-based phase shifter for X-band phased array applications|publisher=Scholarworks|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212406/http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|archivedate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|title=Ferroelectric Phase Shifters|publisher=Microwaves 101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913014513/http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|archivedate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase shift process used with passive phased arrays typically puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The sign of the phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a phase impulse that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.

Passive phased array design is used in the AEGIS Combat System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|title=Total Ownership Cost Reduction Case Study: AEGIS Radar Phase Shifters|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234942/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Direction of arrival|direction-of-arrival]] estimation.

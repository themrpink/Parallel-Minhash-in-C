==Fragmentation==
By late 1992, breakbeat hardcore started to fragment into a number of subsequent [[Music genre|genres]]: [[darkcore]] (piano rolls giving way to dark-themed samples and stabs), [[hardcore jungle]] (where reggae basslines and samples became prominent), and [[happy hardcore]] (retaining piano rolls and more uplifting vocals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Reynolds|first = Simon|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|year = 1998|publisher = Picador|quote = Back in 1993, when hardcore plunged into the 'darkside', a breakaway faction  of DJ-producers like Seduction, Vibes and Slipmatt continued to make celebratory, upful tunes based around hectic breakbeats. By the end of 1994, happy hardcore had coalesced into a scene that operated in parallel with its estranged cousin, jungle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|GCB|GCVO|CMG}} (24 April 1882 – 15 February 1970) was an officer in the [[Royal Air Force]]. He was Air Officer Commanding [[RAF Fighter Command]] during the [[Battle of Britain]] and is generally credited with playing a crucial role in Britain's defence, and hence, the defeat of [[Operation Sea Lion|Adolf Hitler's plan]] to invade Britain.

Born in [[Moffat]], Scotland, Dowding was an officer in the British Army in the 1900s and early 1910s. He joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] at the start of the [[First World War]] and went on to serve as a fighter pilot and then as commanding officer of [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No. 16 Squadron]]. During the inter-war years he became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, [[Air Defence of Great Britain]] and then joined the Air Council as [[Air Member for Supply and Research]]. In July 1936, Dowding was appointed chief of the newly created RAF Fighter Command.

During the Battle of Britain in the [[Second World War]], Dowding's Fighter Command successfully defended the UK against the attacks of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', thanks to his prudent management of RAF resources and detailed preparation of Britain's air defences (the [[Dowding system]]). He subsequently came into conflict with proponents of the [[Big Wing]] tactic, most notably [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] and [[Douglas Bader]], which along with the inadaquecies of RAF's nighttime defence during [[the Blitz]] led to his eventual downfall. In November 1940, Downding was replaced in command against his wishes by [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]], another Big Wing advocate.

Dowding retired from the Royal Air Force in July 1942 and was made a [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]] in June 1943. He died on 15 February 1970, aged 87.

==Early life==
Dowding was born at [[St Ninian's School, Moffat|St. Ninian's Boys' Preparatory School]] in [[Moffat]], Dumfriesshire, the son of Arthur John Caswall Dowding and Maud Caroline Dowding (née Tremenheere). His father had taught at [[Fettes College]] in Edinburgh before moving to Moffat.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/battle-of-britain-and-the-fall-of-stuffy-dowding-1.219259|title=Battle of Britain and the fall of 'Stuffy' Dowding|work=The Herald|date=8 September 2000|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowding was educated at St Ninian's School and [[Winchester College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edkins |first=Richard |url=http://www.dalbeattie.com/moffat/wellroadcentre/schools.html |title=Well Road and the Schools of Moffat |publisher=Moffat Business Index |accessdate=19 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917034852/http://www.dalbeattie.com/moffat/wellroadcentre/schools.html |archivedate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] before being commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] on 18 August 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27222|page=5174|date=21 August 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 8 May 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27456 |date=22 July 1902 |page=4671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowding served with the Royal Garrison Artillery at [[Gibraltar]], in [[Ceylon]] and in [[Hong Kong]] before being posted to No. 7 Mountain Artillery Battery in [[British India|India]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=air&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Dowding.htm |publisher=Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation |title= Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding of Bentley Priory|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United Kingdom, he attended the [[Staff College, Camberley|Army Staff College]] 1912 before being promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 18 August 1913 and being posted with the Royal Garrison Artillery on the [[Isle of Wight]] later that year.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; After becoming interested in aviation, Dowding gained [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1913|Aviator's Certificate no. 711]] on 19 December 1913 in a [[Vickers]] biplane at the Vickers School of Flying, [[Brooklands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200039.html |title=Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom: Official Notices to Members|publisher=Flight|date=14 October 1914|accessdate= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[Central Flying School]], where he was awarded his [[aircrew brevet|wings]].  Although added to the Reserve List of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), Dowding returned to the Isle of Wight to resume his Royal Garrison Artillery duties.  However, this arrangement was short lived and in August 1914, he joined the RFC as a pilot on [[No. 7 Squadron RAF|No. 7 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

===First World War===
Dowding transferred to [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] in October 1914 and then, after two weeks as a staff officer in [[Western Front (World War I)|France]], became a Flight Commander, first with [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] and then with No. 6 Squadron. He became commanding officer of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Brooklands in March 1915 and went on to be commanding officer of [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No. 16 Squadron]] in July 1915.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; After the [[Battle of the Somme]], Dowding clashed with General [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]], the commander of the RFC, over the need to give pilots some rest and recuperation. In September 1915 the author [[Duncan Grinnell-Milne]] joined No 16 squadron as a junior pilot. Years later he published an account of his time in the squadron, in which he criticises Dowding as being &quot;too reserved and aloof from his juniors&quot;, although efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell-Milne 1933, pp. 42–3&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[major]] on 30 December 1915, Dowding was recalled to England in January 1916, and, having been promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] on 1 February 1916 was given command of 7 Wing at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] later that month. He transferred to the command of 9 wing at [[Fienvillers]] in June 1916. Returning to England, he was promoted to temporary [[colonel]] on 1 January 1917 on appointment as commander of the Southern Group Command and promoted to temporary [[brigadier-general]] on 23 June 1917 before being given command of the southern training brigade in August 1917. He was sent to [[York]] as chief staff officer to the RAF's senior administrative officer in the area in April 1918.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32884 |title=Hugh Dowding|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] on 1 January 1919.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

===Inter-war years===
Dowding was given a permanent commission in the RAF on 1 August 1919 with the rank of [[group captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32372|page=5139|date=28 June 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded [[No. 16 Group RAF|No. 16 Group]] from October 1919 and then [[No. 1 Group RAF|No. 1 Group]] from February 1920 where he was responsible for organising two of the annual air displays at [[Hendon]]. He was promoted to [[air commodore]] on 1 January 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|city=e|issue=13774|page=11|date=2 January 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as chief staff officer at Inland Area headquarters at [[Uxbridge]] from February 1922 before being appointed Chief Staff Officer for [[RAF Iraq Command]] in August 1924.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

Dowding was an accomplished [[skiing|skier]], winner of the first ever National [[slalom skiing|Slalom Championship]], and president of the [[Ski Club of Great Britain]] from 1924 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2005, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1926 Dowding was appointed director of training at the [[Air Ministry]]. He was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 2 January 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|city=e|issue=14405|page=5|date=3 January 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[air vice-marshal]] on 1 January 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33453|page=71|date=1 January 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trenchard sent him to Palestine and Transjordan to study security problems caused by Arab–Jewish unrest: his reports, which gained Trenchard's approval, were a cause of further career advancement. Dowding became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, [[Air Defence of Great Britain]] in December 1929 and then joined the Air Council as [[Air Member for Supply and Research]] in September 1930.  One of his first responsibilities in this post was the approval of the granting of a [[certificate of airworthiness]] to the [[R101]] airship shortly before it set off on its ill-fated voyage to India; he later said  &quot;I think I was wrong not to insist on much more extensive trials and tests&quot; and that his decision had been based on optimistic technical advice.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1970, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Dowding's time in this office coincided with a period of rapid development in aircraft design and a growing fear that another major war was on the horizon. Although without scientific or technical training, he displayed a great capacity for understanding technical matters. He was promoted to [[air marshal]] on 1 January 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33898 |supp=y|page=16|date=30 December 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 3 June 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|city=e|issue=14971|page=468|date=6 June 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1936 Dowding was appointed commanding officer of the newly created [[RAF Fighter Command]], and was perhaps the one important person in Britain, and perhaps the world, who did not agree with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s 1932 declaration that &quot;[[The bomber will always get through]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Korda 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived and oversaw the development of the &quot;[[Dowding system]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Deighton 1980, pp. 88, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This consisted of an integrated air defence system which included (i) [[radar]] (whose potential Dowding was among the first to appreciate), (ii) human observers (including the [[Royal Observer Corps]]), who filled crucial gaps in what radar was capable of detecting at the time (the early radar systems, for example, did not provide good information on the altitude of incoming German aircraft), (iii) raid plotting, and (iv) radio control of aircraft. The whole network was linked in many cases by dedicated telephone cables buried sufficiently deeply to provide protection against bombing. The network had its centre at [[RAF Bentley Priory]], a converted country house on the outskirts of London.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; The system as a whole later became known as [[Ground-controlled interception]] (GCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rquirk.com/cdnradar/cor/chapter11.pdf |title=Ground Controlled Interception Radars in Operation Neptune / Overlord|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowding also introduced modern aircraft into service during the pre war period, including the eight gun [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He is also credited with having fought the Air Ministry so that fighter planes were equipped with bullet proof wind shields.&lt;ref name = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/battle-britain-real-story/article/fighting-blue-battle-britain/|title=Fighting The Blue|publisher=Yesterday TV |date= 25 June 2011|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[air chief marshal]] on 1 January 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34356|page=17|date=1 January 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a [[Royal Victorian Order|Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] on 23 January 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34420|page=4733|date=23 July 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===

====Battle of Britain====
[[File:Sir Hugh Dowding with George VI and Queen Elizabeth.jpg|thumb|right| 
[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[George VI|King George VI]] with Dowding in 1940]]
At the time of his retirement in June 1939, Dowding was asked to stay on until March 1940 because of the tense international situation. He was again permitted to continue through the [[Battle of Britain]], first until July and finally until November 1940.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1940, Dowding, nicknamed &quot;Stuffy&quot; by his men for his alleged lack of [[humour]],&lt;ref&gt;Waugh and Wright, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; proved unwilling to sacrifice aircraft and pilots in the attempt to aid Allied troops during the [[Battle of France]]. He, along with his immediate superior [[Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall|Sir Cyril Newall]], then [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]], resisted repeated requests from [[Winston Churchill]] to weaken the home defence by sending precious squadrons to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waligorski|first= Martin|url=http://spitfiresite.com/2010/05/battle-of-britain-1940-dowding-letter.html |title=The Battle is Lost: Dowding's Letter Which Changed History|publisher=The Spitfire Site|accessdate= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Allied resistance in France collapsed, he worked closely with Air Vice-Marshal [[Keith Park]], the commander of [[No. 11 Group RAF|11 Fighter Group]], in organising cover for the [[Operation Dynamo|evacuation]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] at [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/pmdair/rafcms/mediafiles/1E868EDE_5056_A318_A8E3EB2BA855A09C.doc.|title=The Command and Leadership Competence of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Caswell Tremenheere Dowding GCB GCVO CMG ADC RAF|first=Simon|last=Braun|publisher=Royal Air Force|page=4|accessdate=19 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221826/http://www.raf.mod.uk/pmdair/rafcms/mediafiles/1E868EDE_5056_A318_A8E3EB2BA855A09C.doc.|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the summer and autumn of 1940 in the [[Battle of Britain]], Dowding's Fighter Command resisted the attacks of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Beyond the critical importance of the overall system of integrated air defence which he had developed for Fighter Command, his major contribution was to marshal resources behind the scenes (including replacement aircraft and air crew) and to maintain a significant fighter reserve, while leaving his subordinate commanders' hands largely free to run the battle in detail.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:Dowding and The Few.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Dowding with some of ''[[The Few]]'']]
Dowding was known for his humility and great sincerity.&lt;ref name = &quot;blue&quot;/&gt; Fighter Command pilots came to characterise Dowding as one who cared for his men and had their best interests at heart. Dowding often referred to his &quot;dear fighter boys&quot; as his &quot;chicks&quot;: indeed his son Derek was one of them.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Because of his brilliant detailed preparation of Britain's air defences for the German assault, and his prudent management of his resources during the battle, Dowding is today generally given the credit for Britain's victory in the [[Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/pmdair/rafcms/mediafiles/1E868EDE_5056_A318_A8E3EB2BA855A09C.doc.|title=The Command and Leadership Competence of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Caswell Tremenheere Dowding GCB GCVO CMG ADC RAF|first=Simon|last=Braun|publisher=Royal Air Force|page=17|accessdate=19 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221826/http://www.raf.mod.uk/pmdair/rafcms/mediafiles/1E868EDE_5056_A318_A8E3EB2BA855A09C.doc.|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowding's subsequent downfall has been attributed by some to his singlemindedness and perceived lack of diplomacy and political savoir faire in dealing with intra-RAF challenges and intrigues, most obviously the still, even now, hotly debated [[Big Wing]] controversy in which a number of senior and active service officers had argued in favour of large set-piece air battles with the ''Luftwaffe'' as an alternative to Dowding's successful [[Fabian strategy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;korda2009&quot;&gt;Korda 2009, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason often cited for his removal, but characterised by some contemporary commentators more as a pretext, was the difficulty of countering German nighttime bombing raids on British cities.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 2009, pp. 103–120&lt;/ref&gt; The account of radar pioneer, [[Edward George Bowen|E. G. Bowen]] in ''Radar Days'' (1987) rebuts the claim that Dowding's grasp of the problems of British night fighters was inadequate. He suggests that if Dowding had been left to follow his own path, the ultimately effective British response to night bombing (which depended completely on developments in air-borne radar) would have come somewhat sooner.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 1987, pp. 71, 119, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Dowding himself showed that he had a good grasp of night fighter defence and was planning a defence system against night bombing in a letter he wrote some time after the Battle of Britain. However, there was great political and public pressure during [[the Blitz]] for something to be done, and Fighter Command's existing resources without, as yet, airborne radar, proved woefully inadequate. A committee of enquiry chaired by Sir [[John Salmond]] produced a long list of recommendations to improve night air defence; when Dowding approved only some of them, his erstwhile supporters, [[Lord Beaverbrook]] and Churchill, decided that it was time for him to step down.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Dowding was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 8 October 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34964|page=5893|date=8 October 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; He unwillingly relinquished command on 24 November 1940 and was replaced by Big Wing advocate [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]]. Churchill tried to soften the blow by putting him in charge of the British Air Mission to the US, responsible for the [[British Purchasing Commission|procurement of new aircraft types]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinstry 2010, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication of his book ''Twelve Legions of Angels'' was suppressed in November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Daily Herald (United Kingdom)]] |date=10 November 1941|title=Banned |first1=John|last1=Slee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government considered that it contained information which might be of use to the Germans. The book was finally published in 1946, soon after the war ended.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

====Ministry of Aircraft Production====
After leaving Fighter Command, Dowding was sent on special duty to the United States for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but there he made himself unpopular with his outspokenness. On his return he headed a study into economies of RAF manpower before retiring from the Royal Air Force in July 1942. He was elevated to the [[peerage]], as '''Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory''' on 2 June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36087|page=3117|date=9 July 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Lord Dowding at Biggin Hill.jpg|thumb|Lord Dowding laying the foundation stone of the RAF chapel, now known as St. George's Chapel of Remembrance, at [[RAF Biggin Hill]] in 1951]]
Later in life, because of his belief that he was unjustly treated by the RAF, Dowding became increasingly bitter. He approved [[Robert Wright (historian)|Robert Wright]]'s book ''Dowding and the Battle of Britain'' which argued that a conspiracy of [[Big Wing]] proponents, including [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] and [[Douglas Bader]], had engineered his sacking from Fighter Command.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1970, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the debate that followed, the RAF passed him over for promotion to [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In his retirement, Dowding became actively interested in [[Spiritualism]], both as a writer and speaker. His first book on the subject, ''Many Mansions'', was written in 1943, followed by ''Lychgate'' (1945), ''The Dark Star'' and ''God's Magic''. Rejecting conventional [[Christianity]], he joined the [[Theosophical Society]] which advocated belief in [[reincarnation]]. He wrote of meeting dead &quot;RAF boys&quot; in his sleep – spirits who flew fighters from mountain-top runways made of light.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; The American poet [[H.D.]] fictionalised her early involvement with Dowding and Spiritualism in her novel ''Majic Ring'', written in 1943-4 but not published until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/463904 Sword, Helen. 'H.D.'s Majic Ring', in ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'', Vol 14 No 2, Autumn 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dowding laid the foundation stone of the Chapel of St George at [[RAF Biggin Hill]], now [[London Biggin Hill Airport]], in memory of fallen airmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafchapelbigginhill.com/uploads/9/0/8/4/908434/chronicle_chapel0001.pdf|title=Say A Prayer for St George's Chapel|publisher=RAF Chapel Biggin Hill|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowding and his second wife [[Muriel Dowding, Baroness Dowding|Baroness Dowding]] were both anti-[[vivisection]]ists and in 1973 Britain's [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] founded the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldf.org.uk/research/49/50/0/ |title=The Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research|publisher=National Anti-Vivisection Society|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowding became a vegetarian, based on his beliefs as a [[theosophist]] and [[spiritualist]].  Although he was a vegetarian, he believed that &quot;animals will be killed to satisfy human needs for many a long day to come&quot;, and he made several appeals in the House of Lords for the humane killing of animals intended for food.&lt;ref&gt;Orange 2008, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Fairy Investigation Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/11/14/fairy-investigation-society/ |title=Fairy Investigation Society |publisher=Strange History|accessdate= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he knew that people considered him a crank for his belief in fairies, Dowding believed that fairies &quot;are essential to the growth of plants and the welfare of the vegetable kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Orange 2008, p.  263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Dowding died at his home in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]], on 15 February 1970. His body was cremated and its ashes were placed below the ''Battle of Britain Memorial Window'' in the [[Royal Air Force chapel]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Dowding's son Derek (1919–1992) inherited the title of Baron Dowding.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Personal life==
Dowding married Clarice Maud Vancourt, the daughter of an officer in the Indian Army, on 16 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My5iDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40|title=Dowding of Fighter Command: Victor of the Battle of Britain|first= Vincent|last= Orange|publisher=Grubb Street|year=2008|isbn=978-1906502140}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had one child from a previous marriage, Marjorie Brenda Williams (1911–2003) and they had one child together, Derek Hugh Tremenheere (1919–1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dowding-the Man Exhibition|url=https://moffatmuseum.co.uk/marriage-and-children/|access-date=2020-06-26|website=Moffat Museum|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarice died in 1920,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and Dowding's sister Hilda helped Dowding look after the two children.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Dowding married [[Muriel Whiting]] ({{nee|Albino}}) on 25 September 1951; they had no children.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Media portrayals==
[[File:Dowdingout.jpg|thumb|Memorial in Moffat]]
In the 1956 film ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'', Dowding was played by [[Charles Carson (actor)|Charles Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0049665/fullcredits?ref_=m_tt_cl_scc|title=Reach for the Sky|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=8 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1969 film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'', Dowding was played by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Olivier had himself served as a pilot in the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm]] during World War II. During filming in summer 1968, 86 years old and wheel-chair-bound by severe arthritis, Dowding visited the set at Hawkinge airfield in Kent. Olivier told Dowding he had sat behind the latter's desk all day &quot;pretending to be you&quot; and was &quot;making an awful mess of it too&quot;, to which Dowding replied, &quot;Oh, I'm sure you are.&quot; This broke the crew and Olivier into laughter. Footage of this can be seen in the special features section of the film's Special Edition DVD.&lt;ref&gt;Battle of Britain film starring Harry Andrews, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, et al. 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 film ''[[Darkest Hour (film)|Darkest Hour]]'', Dowding was played by [[Adrian Rawlins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/fullcredits|title=Darkest Hour|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Dowding stands outside [[St Clement Danes]] church on the [[Strand, London]]. The inscription reads:&lt;br/&gt;{{quote|Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding was commander-in-chief of Fighter Command, Royal Air Force, from its formation in 1936 until November 1940. He was thus responsible for the preparation for and the conduct of the Battle of Britain. With remarkable foresight, he ensured the equipment of his command with monoplane fighters, the Hurricane and the Spitfire. He was among the first to appreciate the vital importance of R.D.F. (radar) and an effective command and control system for his squadrons. They were ready when war came. In the preliminary stages of that war, he thoroughly trained his minimal forces and conserved them against strong political pressure to disperse and misuse them. His wise and prudent judgement and leadership helped to ensure victory against overwhelming odds and thus prevented the loss of the Battle of Britain and probably the whole war. To him, the people of Britain and of the Free World owe largely the way of life and the liberties they enjoy today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/9880|title=Lord Dowding|publisher=Open Plaques|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

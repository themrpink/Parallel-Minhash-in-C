Following the end of World War II, the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] of 1946 between Austria and Italy introduced a level of autonomy for Trentino and South Tyrol but did not include any provisions for the Ladin language. Only in the second autonomy statute for South Tyrol in 1972 was Ladin recognized as a partially official language.

==Status==
[[File:Scuola ladina.JPG|thumb|Plaque of a Ladin school in Santa Cristina.]]
Ladin is officially recognised in Trentino and South Tyrol by provincial and national law. Italy signed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] of 1991, but it has not ratified it so far. The charter calls for [[minority rights]] to be respected and [[minority language]]s, to which Ladin belongs, to be appropriately protected and promoted. Starting in the 1990s, the Italian parliament and provincial assembly have passed laws and regulations protecting the Ladin language and culture. A cultural institute was founded to safeguard and educate in the language and culture. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Ladin, and street signs are being changed to bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canazei.dk/public/image/canazei_sign.jpg |title=Canazei – Skiferie i Canazei i Italien |year=2011 |publisher=Canazei.dk |language=da |accessdate=13 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911165500/http://www.canazei.dk/public/image/canazei_sign.jpg |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladin is also recognized as a protected language in the [[Province of Belluno]] in [[Veneto]] region pursuant to the Standards for Protection of Historic Language Minorities Act No. 482 (1999). In comparison with South Tyrol and Trentino, the wishes of the Ladins have barely been addressed by the regional government. In a popular referendum in October 2007, the inhabitants of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] overwhelmingly voted to leave Veneto and return to South Tyrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cresce la Voglia di Trentino Alto Adige Quorum Raggiunto a Cortina d'Ampezzo|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/referendum-cortina/referendum-cortina/referendum-cortina.html#Scene_1|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=La Repubblica|date=28 October 2007|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cortina Vuole Andare in Alto Adige|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_ottobre_29/cortina_referendum.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=29 October 2007|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redrawing of the provincial borders would return Cortina d'Ampezzo, [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]] to South Tyrol, to which they traditionally belonged when part of the [[County of Tyrol]] or the [[Bishopric of Brixen]].
[[File:Trilingual road sign in Val Gardena.jpg|thumb|Trilingual traffic sign.]]
Although the Ladin communities are spread out over three neighbouring regions, the ''Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites'' is asking that they be reunited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generela.info/ Homepage of the Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ladin Autonomist Union]] and the [[Fassa Association]] run on a Ladin list and have sought more rights and autonomy for Ladin speakers. Ladins are also guaranteed political representations in the assemblies of Trentino and South Tyrol due to a reserved seats system.

In South Tyrol, in order to reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service, a system called &quot;ethnic proportion&quot; was established in the 1970s. Every 10 years, when the general census of population takes place, each citizen has to identify with a linguistic group. The results determine how many potential positions in public service are allocated for each linguistic group. This has theoretically enabled Ladins to receive guaranteed representation in the South Tyrolean civil service according to their numbers.

The recognition of minority languages in Italy has been criticised since the implementation of Act No. 482 (1999), especially due to alleged financial benefits. This applies also to Ladin language, especially in the province of Belluno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/magazine/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Toso_minor_ling.html] Fiorenzo Toso, Univ. di Sassari: ''I benefici (soprattutto di natura economica) previsti dalla legge482/1999 hanno indotto decine di amministrazioni comunali a dichiarare una inesistente appartenenza a questa o a quella minoranza: col risultato, ad esempio, che le comunità di lingua ladina si sono moltiplicate nel Veneto'' (financial benefits provided by the law 482/1999 led dozens of municipalities to declare a non-existent affiliation to some minority, resulting e.g. in a multiplication of the Ladin-speaking communities in the Veneto region)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
A possible subdivision of Ladin language&lt;ref&gt;Mário Eduardo Viaro, ''O reto-românico: unidade e fragmentação. Caligrama. Belo Horizonte, 14: 101–156'', December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies six major groups.

===Athesian Group of the Sella===
The dialects of the Athesian group (from the river [[Adige]] Basin) of the [[Sella group|Sella]] are spoken in South Tyrol:
* Gherdëina, spoken in [[Val Gardena]] by 8,148 inhabitants (80–90% of the population);
* Badiot and Maró, spoken in [[Val Badia]] and in [[Mareo]] by 9,229 people, i.e. 95%, as native language.

The South Tyrolean dialects are most similar to the original Ladin.

===Trentinian Group of the Sella===
The names of the Ladin dialects spoken in the [[Fassa Valley]] in Trentino are Moenat, Brach, and Cazet. 82.8% of the inhabitants of Fassa Valley are native Ladin speakers;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minoranzelinguistiche.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_minoranze/minoranze/ladini_mocheni_cimbri_pop_2001_x_comune_e_residenza.1205943234.pdf Tav. I.5 appartenenza alla popolazione di lingua ladina (censimento 2001)], Annuario statistico della provincia autonoma di Trento 2006 – Tav. I.5&lt;/ref&gt; the Ladin language in Fassa is influenced by Trentinian dialects.

===Agordino Group of the Sella===
In the Province of Belluno the following dialects are considered as part of the Agordino group:
*[[Fodom]], also called Livinallese, spoken in [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]], native language of 80–90% of the people;
*Rocchesano in the area of [[Rocca Pietore]]. While Laste di Sopra (Ladin ''Laste de Sora'') and Sottoguda (Ladin ''Stagùda'') are predominantly Ladin, in [[Alleghe]], [[San Tomaso]], and [[Falcade]] so-called Ladin-Venetian dialects are spoken, with strong Venetian influence;
* Ladin in the area of Agordo and [[Valle del Biois]], even if some regard it rather as Venetian-Ladin.

===Ampezzan Group===
Spoken in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] (''Anpezo''), similar to [[Cadorino dialect]].

Even in [[Valle di Zoldo]] (from Forno-Fôr upwards) there are elements of the Ampezzan Group.

===Cadorino Group===
Spoken in [[Cadore]] and [[Comelico]] and best known as [[Cadorino dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovan Battista Pellegrini]], I dialetti ladino-cadorini, Miscellanea di studi alla memoria di [[Carlo Battisti]], Firenze, Istituto di studi per l'Alto Adige, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nones and Solandro Group===
In Western Trentino, in [[Non Valley]], [[Val di Sole]], [[Val di Peio]], [[Val di Rabbi]], and part of [[Val Rendena]], detached from the dolomitic area, dialects are spoken that are often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Anaunic Ladin), but enjoy strong influences from Trentinian and Eastern Lombard dialects.

===Låger / Nortades Group===
In other areas of South Tyrol, particularly in the [[South Tyrolean Unterland|Unterland]], the dialects of the towns of [[Kurtatsch]], [[Kurtinig]], [[Laag]], and [[Salurn]], are also often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Nortades Ladin). However, among the most important features of these dialects is the plural ending in ''j'' / ''e'' for masculine and feminine nouns (respectively) and a stronger influence of [[Tyrol]]ean – [[German language|German]] dialects.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most widely used type of speaker is the '''dynamic speaker'''. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an [[audio power amplifier]] before the signal is sent to the speaker.  

The dynamic speaker was invented in 1924 by [[Edward W. Kellogg]] and [[Chester W. Rice]].  The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a [[dynamic microphone]], but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical [[audio signal]] is applied to its [[voice coil]], a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]], the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to [[Faraday's law of induction]], which causes a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create [[sound wave]]s. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. 

Speakers are typically housed in a [[speaker enclosure]] or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular box made of wood or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design play an important role in the quality of the sound. The enclosure generally must be as stiff and non-resonant as practically possible. Where [[high fidelity]] reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ''(picture at right)''.  In this case, the individual speakers are referred to as ''drivers'' and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker.  Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called [[tweeter]]s, those for middle frequencies are called [[mid-range speaker|mid-range]] drivers and those for low frequencies are called [[woofer]]s. Extremely low frequencies (16Hz-~100Hz) may be reproduced by separate [[subwoofer]]s. 

Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as [[Radio receiver|radios]], [[television]]s, portable audio players, [[computer]]s, and [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] in theatres and concert halls, and in [[public address system]]s.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;loudspeaker&quot; may refer to individual transducers (also known as &quot;drivers&quot;) or to complete speaker systems consisting of an [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] including one or more drivers.
 
To adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher [[sound pressure level]] or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named [[subwoofer]]s (for very low frequencies); [[woofer]]s (low frequencies); [[mid-range speaker]]s (middle frequencies); [[tweeter]]s (high frequencies); and sometimes [[supertweeters]], optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds is divided between the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation &quot;tweeter&quot; for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as &quot;HF&quot; or &quot;highs&quot;. When multiple drivers are used in a system, a &quot;filter network&quot;, called a [[Audio crossover|crossover]], separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with ''n'' separate frequency bands is described as &quot;''n''-way speakers&quot;: a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker drivers of the type pictured are termed  &quot;dynamic&quot; (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., [[moving iron speaker]]), or speakers using [[Piezoelectric speakers#Piezo tweeter|piezoelectric]] or [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] systems, or any of several other sorts.

==History==
[[Johann Philipp Reis]] installed an electric loudspeaker in his ''[[telephone]]'' in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but also could reproduce muffled [[speech]] after a few revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis|title=The Forgotten Johann Philipp Reis|website=Integrated Network Cables|access-date=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]] patented his first electric loudspeaker (capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Siemens]]. During this time, [[Thomas Edison]] was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Pathé]], produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. However, these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the system were used for [[public address]] applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/auxetophone/auxetoph.htm |title=The Auxetophone &amp; Other Compressed-Air Gramophones |access-date=2019-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Moving-coil ===
The first experimental moving-coil (also called ''dynamic'') loudspeaker was invented by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aes-media.org/historical/html/recording.technology.history/loudspeaker.html |title=Loudspeaker History |access-date=2019-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer [[Peter L. Jensen]] and Edwin Pridham in 1915, in [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=korn&gt;Kornum, Rene. &quot;[http://ing.dk/artikel/hoejttaleren-fylder-100-aar-og-foedselaren-er-dansk-179868 The loudspeaker is 100 years old]&quot; ''[[Ingeniøren]]'', 4 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Like previous loudspeakers these used horns to amplify the sound produced by a small diaphragm.  Jensen was denied patents. Being unsuccessful in selling their product to telephone companies, in 1915 they changed their target market to radios and [[public address system]]s, and named their product [[Magnavox]]. Jensen was, for years after the invention of the loudspeaker, a part owner of The Magnavox Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aes-media.org/historical/html/recording.technology.history/jensen.html |title=Jensen History |access-date=2019-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moving-coil principle commonly used today in speakers was patented in 1924{{Not in source|reason=1925?|date=January 2020}} by [[Chester W. Rice]] and [[Edward W. Kellogg]]. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters so that the fundamental resonance of the moving system is below the frequency where the cone's radiation [[Acoustic impedance|Impedance]]  becomes uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|volume= 52|issue=4|year=2004|pages=412–432 (p. 416)|url=http://www.aes.org/journal/online/JAES_V52/jaes.cfm?file=JAES_V52_4/JAES_V52_4_PG412.pdf|author=[[John M. Eargle|J. Eargle]] and M. Gander|title=Historical Perspectives and Technology Overview of Loudspeakers for Sound Reinforcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; About this same period, [[Walter H. Schottky]] invented the first ribbon loudspeaker together with Dr. Erwin Gerlach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019183905/http://geocities.com/bioelectrochemistry/schottky.htm |url=http://www.geocities.com/bioelectrochemistry/schottky.htm |title=Walter Schottky |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first loudspeakers used [[electromagnet]]s, because large, powerful [[permanent magnet]]s were generally not available at a reasonable price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a [[inductor|choke coil]], filtering the [[power supply]] of the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]] that the loudspeaker was connected to.&lt;ref&gt;Henry B. O. Davis, ''Electrical and Electronic Technologies: A Chronology of Events and Inventors from 1900 to 1940', Scarecrow Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0810815907}} page 75&lt;/ref&gt; AC ripple in the current was attenuated by the action of passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 [[Peter L. Jensen|Jensen]] introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight [[alnico]] magnets after World War II.

=== First loudspeaker systems ===
In the 1930s, loudspeaker manufacturers began to combine two and three bandpasses' worth of drivers in order to increase [[frequency response]] and [[sound pressure]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audio Signal Processing and Coding |last=Spanias |first=Andreas |author2=Ted Painter |author3=Venkatraman Atti  |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |isbn=978-0-470-04196-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7_nVWzx1Q4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the first film industry-standard loudspeaker system, &quot;The [http://www.audioheritage.org/html/profiles/lmco/shearer.htm Shearer Horn] System for Theatres&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/lmco/bulletins/2b.jpg Lansingheritage.com: (1937 brochure image) ''The Shearer Horn System for Theatres'']&lt;/ref&gt; (a two-way system), was introduced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It used four 15″ low-frequency drivers, a crossover network set for 375&amp;nbsp;Hz, and a single multi-cellular horn with two compression drivers providing the high frequencies. [[John Kenneth Hilliard]], [[James Bullough Lansing]], and [[Douglas Shearer]] all played roles in creating the system. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], a very large two-way [[public address]] system was mounted on a tower at [[Flushing Meadows]]. The eight 27″ low-frequency drivers were designed by [[Rudy Bozak]] in his role as chief engineer for Cinaudagraph. High-frequency drivers were likely made by [[Western Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozak, R.T., ''Electronics'' magazine, June 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altec Lansing]] introduced the ''604'', which became their most famous coaxial [[Altec Lansing Duplex|Duplex]] driver, in 1943. It incorporated a high-frequency horn that sent sound through a hole in the pole piece of a 15-inch woofer for near-point-source performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1943/page05.jpg Lansing Heritage. ''Loudspeakers by Lansing: First Time in History. A Two-Way Loud Speaker in Compact Form.''

''1966 Voice of the Theatre'' (catalog image)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the [[cinema (place)|film house]] industry standard in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Audioheritage.org.

In 1954, [[Edgar Villchur]] developed the [[acoustic suspension]] principle of loudspeaker design in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  This allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted in smaller cabinets which was important during the transition to stereo recording and reproduction.  He and his partner [[Henry Kloss]] formed the [[Acoustic Research]] company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle.  Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!--citation also needed in [[Acoustic suspension]]--&gt; The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent [[magnet]] materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.  At low frequencies, the application of electrical network theory to the acoustic performance allowed by various enclosure designs (initially by Thiele, and later by Small) has been very important at the design level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The most common type of driver, commonly called a '''dynamic loudspeaker''', uses a lightweight [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], or ''cone'', connected to a rigid ''basket'', or ''frame'', via a flexible suspension, commonly called a ''spider'', that constrains a [[voice coil]] to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. A protective cap glued in the cone's center prevents dust, especially iron filings, from entering the gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the [[voice coil]], a [[magnetic field]] is created by the electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound under the control of the applied electrical signal coming from the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.

=== Diaphragm ===
The diaphragm is usually manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A variety of different materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well [[Absorption (acoustics)|damped]], to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped with little or no audible ringing due to its [[resonance]] frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves [[trade-off]]s. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]], [[Glass (fiber)|glass]], [[hemp]] or [[bamboo]] fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.

=== Basket ===
The chassis, frame, or basket, is designed to be rigid, preventing deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps allowing the voice coil to rub against the magnet around the gap. Chassis are typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from aluminum alloy, in heavier magnet-structure speakers; or [[machine press|stamped]] from thin sheet steel in lighter-structure drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=81|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.   Metallic chassis can play an important role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, broils the varnish on the voice coil; it may even demagnetize permanent magnets.

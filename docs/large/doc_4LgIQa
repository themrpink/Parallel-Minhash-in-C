=== Vichy showers ===
A [[Vichy shower]] is a form of hydrotherapy which uses a series of shower nozzles which spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the client's needs.

=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===
Many different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capellini|first1=Steve|last2=Welden|first2=Michel Van|title=Massage For Dummies|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470642757|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgFnbJ7E90IC&amp;pg=PA20|date=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massage tools ===
These instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages.  Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.

====Tools used by massage therapists====
Instrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work. 

A body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist's strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.

[[Bamboo massage|Bamboo]] and [[rosewood]] tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma.  Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.

====Tools used by both individuals and massagers====
Hand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a [[haircut]].

Vibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.

Vibrating [[massage chair]]s can provide an alternative for therapy at home.

There is a widespread market in [[erotic massage]] instruments, including electric [[dildos]] and [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] such as the [[massage wand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trout|first1=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date=28 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical and therapeutic use ==
The main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]] and practitioners of many [[traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines]]. Massage practitioners work in a variety of medical settings and may travel to private residences or businesses.&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt; [[Contraindication]]s to massage include [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[bleeding disorders]] or taking blood thinners such as [[Warfarin]], damaged blood vessels, weakened bones from [[cancer]], [[osteoporosis]], or [[fractures]], and [[fever]].&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt;

=== Practitioner associations and official recognition of professionals ===
The US based National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine recognizes over eighty different massage techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;nccam&quot;/&gt; The most cited reasons for introducing massage as therapy have been client demand and perceived clinical effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;policy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myklebust M, Iler J | title = Policy for therapeutic massage in an academic health center: a model for standard policy development | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–5 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17532742 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.6323 | hdl = 2027.42/63197 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/63197/1/acm.2007.6323.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associated methods ===
Many types of practices are associated with massage and include [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[manual therapy]], [[energy medicine]], neural mobilization and [[breathwork]]. Other names for massage and related practices include hands-on work, body/somatic therapy, and somatic movement education. Body-mind integration techniques stress self-awareness and movement over physical manipulations by a practitioner. Therapies related to movement awareness/education are closer to [[Dance therapy|dance and movement therapies]]. Massage can also have connections with the [[New Age]] movement and [[alternative medicine]] as well as holistic philosophies of preventive medical care, as well as being used by mainstream medical practitioners.

==== Single-dose effects ====
[[File:Massage Chairs in VivoCity.jpg|thumb|right|Mechanical [[massage chair]]s at [[VivoCity]] in [[Singapore]]]]
* '''Pain relief:'''  Relief from pain due to [[musculoskeletal]] injuries and other causes is cited as a major benefit of massage.&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt; A 2015 Cochrane Review concluded that there is very little evidence that massage is an effective treatment for [[lower back pain]].&lt;ref name=Furlan2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furlan AD, Giraldo M, Baskwill A, Irvin E, Imamura M | title = Massage for low-back pain | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD001929 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26329399 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001929.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis conducted by scientists at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] failed to find a statistically significant reduction in pain immediately following treatment.&lt;ref name= Meta&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moyer CA, Rounds J, Hannum JW | title = A meta-analysis of massage therapy research | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–18 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14717648 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.3 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.509.7123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weak evidence suggests that massage may improve pain in the short term for people with acute, sub-acute, and chronic lower back pain.&lt;ref name=Furlan2015 /&gt;

==== Neuromuscular effects ====
Massage has been shown to reduce neuromuscular excitability by measuring changes in the [[Hoffman's reflex]] (H-reflex) amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young JD, Spence AJ, Behm DG | title = Roller massage decreases spinal excitability to the soleus | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 950–959 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29357488 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00732.2017 | url = http://research.library.mun.ca/12893/1/thesis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A decrease in peak-to-peak H-reflex amplitude suggests a decrease in motoneuron excitability.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg J, Sullivan SJ, Seaborne DE | title = The effect of two intensities of massage on H-reflex amplitude | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 449–57 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1589464 | doi=10.1093/ptj/72.6.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others explain, &quot;H-reflex is considered to be the electrical analogue of the stretch reflex...and the reduction&quot; is due to a decrease in spinal reflex excitability.&lt;ref name=&quot;weerapong&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200535030-00004 |pmid=15730338 |title=The Mechanisms of Massage and Effects on Performance, Muscle Recovery and Injury Prevention |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=235–256 |year=2005 |last1=Weerapong |first1=Pornratshanee |last2=Hume |first2=Patria A. |last3=Kolt |first3=Gregory S. |s2cid=44736682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Field (2007) confirms that the inhibitory effects are due to deep tissue receptors and not superficial cutaneous receptors, as there was no decrease in H-reflex when looking at light fingertip pressure massage.&lt;ref name=&quot;field&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2005.12.002 |title=Massage therapy research |journal=Developmental Review |volume=27 |pages=75–89 |year=2007 |last1=Field |first1=Tiffany |last2=Diego |first2=Miguel |last3=Hernandez-Reif |first3=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been noted that &quot;the receptors activated during massage are specific to the muscle being massaged&quot;, as other muscles did not produce a decrease in H-reflex amplitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldberg&quot; /&gt;

=== Massage and proprioception ===
Proprioceptive studies are much more abundant than massage and [[proprioception]] combined, yet researchers are still trying to pinpoint the exact mechanisms and pathways involved to get a fuller understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Proske U, Gandevia SC | title = The kinaesthetic senses | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 587 | issue = Pt 17 | pages = 4139–46 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19581378 | pmc = 2754351 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.175372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proprioception may be very helpful in rehabilitation, though this is a fairly unknown characteristic of proprioception, and &quot;current exercises aimed at 'improving proprioception' have not been demonstrated to achieve that goal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s001670100208 |pmid=11420785 |title=Can proprioception really be improved by exercises? |journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=128–136 |year=2001 |last1=Ashton-Miller |first1=James A. |last2=Wojtys |first2=Edward M. |last3=Huston |first3=Laura J. |last4=Fry-Welch |first4=Donna |s2cid=9004972 |hdl=2027.42/41912 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until this point, very little has been studied looking into the effects of massage on proprioception. Some researchers believe &quot;documenting what happens under the skin, bioelectrically and biochemically, will be enabled by newer, non-invasive technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and continuous plasma sampling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;field&quot;/&gt;

=== Regulations ===
Because the art and science of massage is a globally diverse phenomenon, different legal jurisdictions sometimes recognize and license individuals with titles, while other areas do not. Examples are:
* Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) Canada
* Remedial Massage Therapist (RMT) New Zealand
* Certified Massage Therapist (CMT) New Zealand
* Licensed Massage Practitioner (LMP)
* Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT)
* Licensed Massage and Bodywork Therapist (LMBT) North Carolina
* Therapeutic Massage Therapist (TMT) South Africa

In some jurisdictions, [[practicing without a license]] is a crime. One such jurisdiction is [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], where any health professionals practicing without a license can be issued a fine and charged with a misdemeanor offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.130.190 |title=RCW 18.130.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
In regulated provinces massage therapists are known as Registered Massage Therapists, in Canada five [[provinces]] regulate massage therapy:&lt;ref name=overviewca&gt;{{cite web |url= https://nccih.nih.gov/node/3365 |title=Overview of Manual Therapy in Canada | vauthors =Verhoef M | publisher=The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) |date=10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name=law/&gt; Registered Massage Therapy in British Columbia is regulated by the College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia (CMTBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmtbc.ca/law-standards/health-professions-act-regulations/|title=Health Professions Act &amp; Regulations|website=College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia|access-date=2019-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulated provinces have, since 2012, established inter-jurisdiction competency standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmto.com/cmto-wordpress/assets/Inter-Jurisdictional-Competency-Standards-June-2012.pdf |title=Inter-Jurisdiction Competency Standards |date=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=overviewca/&gt; [[Quebec]] is not provincially regulated. Massage therapists may obtain a certification with one of various associations operating. There is the Professional Association of Specialized Massage Therapists of Quebec, also named Mon Réseau Plus, which represents 6,300 massage therapists (including orthotherapists, naturotherapists and others), the Quebec Federation of massage therapists (FMQ), and the Association québécoise des thérapeutes naturels; however, none of these are regulated by provincial law.

Canadian educational institutions are undergoing a formal accreditation process through the Canadian Massage Therapy Council for Accreditation (CMTCA).

==== China ====
Most types of massage, with the exception of some [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller businesses are fronts for prostitution. J.K., anti-prostitution operation has established sting operations to combat the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gochina.about.com/od/tripplanning/a/prostitution.htm |title=About.com&amp;nbsp;— Traveler Warning: Prostitution in China |publisher=Gochina.about.com |date=10 April 2012 |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are called [[Prostitution in China#Types and venues|falangmei]] (发廊妹 &quot;hairdressing salon sisters&quot;).

==== France ====
France requires three years of study and two final exams in order to apply for a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=7F4C787EF6BFD7F0C51286E82C217E0F.tpdjo09v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020567935&amp;categorieLien=id |title=Décret n° 2009-494 du 29 avril 2009 relatif aux études préparatoires et au diplôme d'Etat de masseur-kinésithérapeute |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date= |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
In Germany, massage is regulated by the government on a federal and national level.&lt;!--unclear: does this mean at the federal and the state level? --&gt;  Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title &quot;Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister&quot; 'Masseur and Medical Spa Therapist'.  This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training).  The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise and Movement Therapy.  During the training they will study: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Gynecology, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Surgery, and probably most importantly Dermiatry and Orthopedics.  They are trained in [[Electrotherapy]], and Hydrotherapy.  Hydrotherapy includes: Kneipp, Wraps, underwater Massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna and Steambath.  A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example: Foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage etc.  Finally a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor.  He is regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists.  This includes the restriction on advertising and oath of confidentiality to clients.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== India ====
In India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]] in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In [[ayurveda]], massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as &quot;Thokkanam&quot; and is classified in to nine types, each for specific variety of disease.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Adolfo Farsari - Blind Shampoonier.JPG|thumb|Traditional Japanese blind massage]]
{{see also|ja:あん摩マッサージ指圧師|Anma}}

In Japan, [[shiatsu]] is regulated but oil massage and [[Thai massage]] are not. [[Prostitution in Japan]] is not heavily policed, and prostitutes posing as massage therapists in &quot;[[fashion health]]&quot; shops and &quot;[[pink salon]]s&quot; are fairly common in the larger cities.

==== Myanmar ====
In [[Myanmar]], massage is unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/opinion/12663-regional-government-happy-to-keep-the-bribes-flowing.html|title=Massage parlours avoid the squeeze as bribery remains entrenched|work=The Myanmar Times|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is necessary to apply for a spa license with the government to operate a massage parlour in major cities such as Yangon. Blind and visually impaired people can become masseurs, but they are not issued licenses. There are a few professional spa training schools in Myanmar but these training centers are not accredited by the government.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico massage therapists, called &quot;''sobadores''&quot;, combine massage using oil or lotion&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Christopher | name-list-style = vanc |url=http://www.liveincostarica.com/blog/2010/05/what-the-heck-are-sobadores-and-pegas.html |title=What the heck are sobadores and pegas? |publisher=Liveincostarica.com |date=24 May 2010 |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a form of acupuncture and faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2009/03/25/2009-03-25_mexican_tradition_of_massage_lives_on_in-2.html |title=Mexican tradition of massage lives on in Tijuana |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=24 March 2009 |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sobadores'' are used to relieve digestive system problems as well as knee and back pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores2&quot; /&gt; Many of these therapists work out of the back of a truck, with just a curtain for privacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores2&quot; /&gt; By learning additional holistic healer's skills in addition to massage, the practitioner may become a ''[[curandero]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sobadores3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanderbilt |first=Shirley |url=http://www.massagetherapy.com/articles/index.php/article_id/208/Curanderismo%3A-Mexican-Folk-Healers |title=Curanderismo: Mexican Folk Healers |publisher=Massagetherapy.com |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, [[prostitution in Mexico]]  is legal, and prostitutes are allowed to sell sexual massage. These businesses are often confined to a specific area of the city, such as the [[Zona Norte (Tijuana)|Zona Norte]] in [[Tijuana]].

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, massage is unregulated.  There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognised.  Registration at the Certified Massage Therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage.  Registration at the Remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage.  Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.massagenewzealand.org.nz/Site/membership/levels.aspx |title=Levels of Membership |publisher=Massage New Zealand |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor.  The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a 2-year diploma in Therapeutic Massage and registration with The Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The 2 year qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours community service.

==== South Korea ====
In [[South Korea]],  blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7699114.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blind S Korea masseurs win case | date=30 October 2008 | access-date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thailand ====
In [[Thailand]], [[Thai massage]] is officially listed as one of the branches of [[traditional Thai medicine]], recognized and regulated by the government. It is considered to be a medical discipline in its own right and is used for the treatment of a wide variety of ailments and conditions. Massage schools, centers, therapists, and practitioners are increasingly regulated by the Ministries of Education and Public Health in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangraibulletin.com/2013/07/17/only-in-thailand-you-can-get-a-thai-massage-for-under-5/ |title=Only in Thailand...

In addition there are many professional bodies which have a required minimum standard of education and hold relevant insurance policies including: the Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fht.org.uk/|title=Federation of Holistic Therapists Directory Service|website=fht.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Complementary Therapists Association (CThA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctha.com/|title=Complementary Therapists Association|website=www.ctha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Complementary Health Professionals (CHP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.complementaryhealthprofessionals.co.uk/|title=Complementary Health Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the CNHC these bodies exist to support therapists rather than clients.

==== United States ====
According to research done by the American Massage Therapy Association, as of 2012 in the United States there are between 280,000 and 320,000 massage therapists and massage school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Massage Therapy Industry Fact Sheet|url=https://www.amtamassage.org/uploads/cms/documents/amta2012_industryfactsheet.pdf|publisher=American Massage Therapy Association|access-date=17 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021085026/http://www.amtamassage.org/uploads/cms/documents/amta2012_industryfactsheet.pdf|archive-date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, there were more than 300 accredited massage schools and programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Massage Firms To Aid Aching Area Economy|url=http://nhi.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SacBee.pdf|publisher=American Massage Therapy Association, Massage Envy, Bee Research|access-date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most states have licensing requirements that must be met before a practitioner can use the title &quot;massage therapist&quot;, and some states and municipalities require a license to practice any form of massage. If a state does not have any massage laws then a practitioner need not apply for a license with the state. Training programs in the US are typically 500 hours to 1000 hours in total training time, and can award a certificate, diploma, or degree depending on the particular school.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherman KJ, Cherkin DC, Kahn J, Erro J, Hrbek A, Deyo RA, Eisenberg DM | title = A survey of training and practice patterns of massage therapists in two US states | journal = BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 5 | pages = 13 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15955245 | pmc = 1182347 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6882-5-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 1,300 programs training massage therapists in the US; study will often include [[anatomy and physiology]], [[kinesiology]], massage techniques, [[first aid]] and [[CPR]], [[business]], [[medical ethics|ethical]] and [[legal]] issues, and hands on practice along with [[continuing education]] requirements if regulated.&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt; The Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA) is one of the organizations that works with massage schools in the U.S. and there are approximately 300 schools that are accredited through this agency.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Forty-three states and the District of Columbia currently offer some type of credential to professionals in the massage and bodywork field—usually licensure, certification or registration.&lt;ref name=policy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.massageregister.com/massage-license-requirements |title=Massage License Requirements |publisher=Massageregister.com |access-date=26 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129003305/http://www.massageregister.com/massage-license-requirements |archive-date=29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight states and the [[District of Columbia]] require some type of licensing for massage therapists.&lt;ref name=stellin&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/business/yourmoney/15spa.html | title = Beyond the Body Wrap: What Makes a Spa Stand Out? | vauthors = Stellin S | newspaper = New York Times | date =15 July 2007 | access-date = 20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, 39 states use the [[National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork]]'s certification program as a basis for granting licenses either by rule or [[statute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wellnessgeeky.com/states-require-ncbtmb-exams-national-certification-board-therapeutic-massage-bodywork|title = States that require NCBTMB exams| publisher = National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork| access-date = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Board grants the designation Nationally Certified in Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCTMB).

In the US, [[licensure]] is the highest level of [[regulation]] and this restricts anyone without a license from practicing massage therapy or calling themselves by that protected title. [[Certification]] allows only those who meet certain educational criteria to use the protected title and registration only requires a listing of therapists who apply and meet an educational requirement.&lt;ref name=walsh/&gt;  It is important to note that a massage therapist may be certified, but not licensed. Licensing requirements vary per state, and often require additional criteria be met in addition to attending an accredited massage therapy school and passing a required state specified exam (basically the certification requirements in many states). In the US, most certifications are locally based. Some states still do not require a license or a certification, but this is changing as more regulatory bodies governing the profession of massage are established in each state. Some states allow license reciprocity, where licensed massage therapists who relocate can relatively easily obtain a license in their new state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.massagetherapyschoolsinformation.com/ | title = MTSI Institute | last = Lyons | first = Neal | name-list-style = vanc | publisher = MTSI | access-date = 3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards launched a new certification exam titled the [[MBLEx]]. Currently, 40 states have accepted this certification exam, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

In 1997 there were an estimated 114 million visits to massage therapists in the US.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Massage therapy is the most used type of [[alternative medicine]] in hospitals in the United States.&lt;ref name=policy/&gt;  Between July 2010 and July 2011 roughly 38 million adult Americans (18 percent) had a massage at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amtamassage.org/uploads/cms/documents/amta2012_industryfactsheet.pdf |title=2012 Massage Therapy Industry Fact Sheet&amp;nbsp;— American Massage Therapy Association |publisher=Amtamassage.org |date=17 February 2012 |access-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021085026/http://www.amtamassage.org/uploads/cms/documents/amta2012_industryfactsheet.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People state that they use massage because they believe that it relieves pain from [[musculoskeletal]] injuries and other causes of pain, reduces [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and enhances [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], rehabilitates sports injuries, decreases feelings of anxiety and depression, and increases general well being.&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt;

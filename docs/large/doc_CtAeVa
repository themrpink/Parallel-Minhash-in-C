=== DRS securities ===
Securities may also be held in the Direct Registration System (DRS), which is a method of recording shares of stock in book-entry form. Book-entry means the company's transfer agent maintains the shares on the owner's behalf without the need for physical share certificates. Shares held in un-certificated book-entry form have the same rights and privileges as shares held in certificated form.

==== Bearer securities ====
[[File:1969 $100K Treasury Bill (front).jpg|thumb|1969 $100,000 Treasury Bill|417x417px]]
Bearer securities are completely negotiable and entitle the holder to the rights under the security (e.g., to payment if it is a debt security, and voting if it is an equity security). They are transferred by delivering the instrument from person to person. In some cases, transfer is by endorsement, or signing the back of the instrument, and delivery.

Regulatory and fiscal authorities sometimes regard bearer securities negatively, as they may be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the issue of bearer securities was heavily restricted firstly by the ''Exchange Control Act'' 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.

In Luxembourg, the law of 28 July 2014 concerning the compulsory deposit and immobilization of shares and units in bearer form adopts the compulsory deposit and immobilization of bearer shares and units with a depositary allowing identification of the holders thereof.

==== Registered securities ====
[[File:1981 $10k 15.875% Registered Note .jpg|thumb|1981 $10,000 15.875% Registered Note]]
In the case of registered securities, certificates bearing the name of the holder are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person does not automatically acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details of the holder of the securities are entered and updated as appropriate. A transfer of registered securities is effected by amending the register.

=== Non-certificated securities and global certificates ===
Modern practice has developed to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. There are two general ways this has been accomplished.

==== Non-certificated securities ====
In some jurisdictions, such as France, it is possible for issuers of that jurisdiction to maintain a legal record of their securities electronically.

In the [[United States]], the current &quot;official&quot; version of Article 8 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] permits non-certificated securities. However, the &quot;official&quot; UCC is a mere draft that must be enacted individually by each [[U.S. state]]. Though all 50 states (as well as the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) have enacted some form of Article 8, many of them still appear to use older versions of Article 8, including some that did not permit non-certificated securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/ucc.html#a8 |title=LII: UCC - Locator |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=2004-03-15 |access-date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global certificates, book entry interests, depositories ====
To facilitate the electronic transfer of interests in securities without dealing with inconsistent versions of Article 8, a system has developed whereby issuers deposit a single global certificate representing all the outstanding securities of a class or series with a universal depository. This depository is called [[The Depository Trust Company]], or DTC. DTC's parent, [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities on behalf of all the DTC participants.

All securities traded through DTC are in fact held, in electronic form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g., a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at local broker Jones &amp; Co. brokers. In turn, Jones &amp; Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones &amp; Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones &amp; Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books for the benefit of customers like Jones &amp; Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called [[beneficial ownership]]. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in &quot;Street name&quot;.

Among brokerages and mutual fund companies, a large amount of mutual fund share transactions take place among intermediaries as opposed to shares being sold and redeemed directly with the transfer agent of the fund. Most of these intermediaries such as brokerage firms clear the shares electronically through the National Securities Clearing Corp. or &quot;NSCC&quot;, a subsidiary of DTCC.

==== Other depositories ====
Besides DTC, two other large securities depositories exist, both in Europe: Euroclear and Clearstream.

=== Divided and undivided security ===
The terms &quot;divided&quot; and &quot;undivided&quot; relate to the proprietary nature of a security.

Each divided security constitutes a separate asset, which is legally distinct from each other security in the same issue. Pre-electronic bearer securities were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.

With undivided securities, the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each of the securities being a fractional part of this undivided whole. Shares in the secondary markets are always undivided. The issuer owes only one set of obligations to shareholders under its memorandum, articles of association and company law. A [[share (finance)|share]] represents an undivided fractional part of the issuing company. Registered debt securities also have this undivided nature.

=== Fungible and non-fungible securities ===

In a fungible security, all holdings of the security are treated identically and are interchangeable.

Sometimes securities are not fungible with other securities, for example different series of bonds issued by the same company at different times with different conditions attaching to them.

== Regulation ==
In the US, the public offer and sale of securities must be either registered pursuant to a registration statement that is filed with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) or are offered and sold pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Dealing in securities is regulated by both federal authorities (SEC) and state securities departments. In addition, the brokerage industry is supposedly self policed by Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs), such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (or NASD) or the MSRB.

With respect to investment schemes that do not fall within the traditional categories of securities listed in the definition of a security (Sec. 2(a)(1) of the 33 act and Sec. 3(a)(10) of the 34 act) the US Courts have developed a broad definition for securities that must then be registered with the SEC. When determining if there is an &quot;investment contract&quot; that must be registered the courts look for an investment of money, a common enterprise and expectation of profits to come primarily from the efforts of others. See ''[[SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.]]''

{{Redirect|Data transfer|sharing data between different programs or schemas|Data exchange}}

'''Data transmission''' and '''data reception''' (or, more broadly, '''data communication''' or '''digital communications''') is the transfer and reception of [[data]] (a [[Digital data|digital]] [[bitstream]] or a [[digitize]]d analog signal&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt;) over a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] or [[Multicast|point-to-multipoint]] [[communication channel]]. Examples of such channels are [[copper wire]]s, [[optical fiber]]s, [[wireless]] communication channels, [[storage media]] and [[Bus (computing)|computer bus]]es. The data are represented as an [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], such as an [[electrical voltage]], [[radiowave]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] signal. 

Analog or analogue transmission is a transmission method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a [[line code]] (''[[baseband]] transmission''), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (''[[passband]] transmission''), using a digital [[modulation]] method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by [[modem]] equipment. According to the most common definition of [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]], both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of [[digital-to-analog conversion]].

Data transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, [[digitize]]d into a bit-stream, for example, using [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) or more advanced [[source coding]] ([[analog-to-digital conversion]] and [[data compression]]) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by [[codec]] equipment.

Digital transmission or data transmission traditionally belongs to [[telecommunication]]s and [[electrical engineering]]. Basic principles of data transmission may also be covered within the [[computer science]] or [[computer engineering]] topic of data communications, which also includes [[computer network]]ing applications and [[Communication protocol|networking protocols]], for example routing, switching and [[inter-process communication]]. Although the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) involves transmission, TCP and other transport layer protocols are covered in computer networking but ''not'' discussed in a textbook or course about data transmission.

The term [[tele transmission]] involves the analog as well as digital communication. In most textbooks, the term [[analog transmission]] only refers to the transmission of an analog message signal (without digitization) by means of an analog signal, either as a non-modulated baseband signal, or as a passband signal using an [[analog modulation method]] such as [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] or [[Frequency modulation|FM]]. It may also include analog-over-analog [[Modulation#Pulse modulation methods|pulse modulatated]] baseband signals such as pulse-width modulation. In a few books within the computer networking tradition, &quot;analog transmission&quot; also refers to passband transmission of bit-streams using [[digital modulation]] methods such as [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]], [[phase-shift keying|PSK]] and [[amplitude-shift keying|ASK]]. Note that these methods are covered in textbooks named digital transmission or data transmission, for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt;

The theoretical aspects of data transmission are covered by [[information theory]] and [[coding theory]].

==Protocol layers and sub-topics==
{{OSIModel}}
Courses and textbooks in the field of data transmission typically deal with the following [[OSI model]] protocol layers and topics:
* Layer 1, the [[physical layer]]:
** [[Channel coding]] including
*** [[Digital modulation]] schemes
*** [[Line coding]] schemes
*** [[Forward error correction]] (FEC) codes
** [[Bit synchronization]]
** [[Multiplexing]]
** [[Equalization (communications)|Equalization]]
** [[Channel model]]s
* Layer 2, the [[data link layer]]:
** [[Channel access]] schemes, [[media access control]] (MAC)
** Packet mode communication and [[Frame synchronization]]
** [[Error detection]] and [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ)
** [[Flow control (data)|Flow control]]
* Layer 6, the [[presentation layer]]:
** [[Source coding]] (digitization and data compression), and information theory.
** [[Cryptography]] (may occur at any layer)
It is also common to deal with the cross-layer design of those three layers.&lt;ref&gt;F. Foukalas et al.,

==Applications and history==
Data (mainly but not exclusively [[information]]al) has been sent via non-electronic (e.g. [[optical]], [[acoustics|acoustic]], [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]]) means since the advent of [[communication]]. [[Analog signal]] data has been sent electronically since the [[History of the telephone|advent of the telephone]]. However, the first data electromagnetic transmission applications in modern time were [[telegraphy]] (1809) and [[teletypewriter]]s (1906), which are both [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s. The fundamental theoretical work in data transmission and information theory by [[Harry Nyquist]], [[Ralph Hartley]], [[Claude Shannon]] and others during the early 20th century, was done with these applications in mind.

Data transmission is utilized in [[computers]] in [[computer bus]]es and for communication with [[peripheral equipment]] via [[parallel port]]s and [[serial port]]s such as [[RS-232]] (1969), [[FireWire]] (1995) and [[USB]] (1996). The principles of data transmission are also utilized in storage media for [[Error detection and correction#Data storage|Error detection and correction]] since 1951.

Data transmission is utilized in [[computer networking]] equipment such as [[modems]] (1940), [[local area network]]s (LAN) adapters (1964), [[repeater]]s, [[repeater hub]]s, [[microwave link]]s, [[wireless access point|wireless network access point]]s (1997), etc.

In telephone networks, digital communication is utilized for transferring many phone calls over the same copper cable or fiber cable by means of [[Pulse code modulation]] (PCM), i.e. sampling and digitization, in combination with [[Time division multiplexing]] (TDM) (1962). [[Telephone exchange]]s have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value added services. For example, the first [[AXE telephone exchange]] was presented in 1976. Since the late 1980s, digital communication to the end user has been possible using [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) services. Since the end of the 1990s, broadband access techniques such as [[ADSL]], [[Cable modem]]s, [[fiber-to-the-building]] (FTTB) and [[fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes. The current tendency is to replace traditional telecommunication services by packet mode communication such as [[IP telephony]] and [[IPTV]].

Transmitting analog signals digitally allows for greater [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] capability. The ability to process a communications signal means that errors caused by random processes can be detected and corrected. Digital signals can also be [[sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] instead of continuously monitored. The [[multiplexing]] of multiple digital signals is much simpler to the multiplexing of analog signals.

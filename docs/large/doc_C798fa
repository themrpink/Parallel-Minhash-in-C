After the war, ''Oregon'' steamed to New York for an overhaul, after which she was assigned to the [[Asiatic Squadron]] in October. She reached [[Manila]] in the Philippines on 18 March 1899 and operated there for the next year during the [[Philippine–American War]]. During this period, she assisted with the blockade of Manila and the [[Lingayen Gulf]] and supported the capture of the city of [[Vigan]]. On 13 February 1900, ''Oregon'' departed for a visit to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] that lasted into May, when she steamed to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. By that time, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] had broken out in [[Qing China]], and the ship was ordered to steam to [[Taku, China]], on 23 June to reinforce the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces that were gathering there. While passing through the [[Bohai Strait]] on 28 June, she struck an uncharted rock, running hard aground. She remained on the rock for a week before being re-floated on 5 July. After completing temporary repairs, she steamed to [[Kure, Japan]] to be dry-docked for permanent repairs on 17 July.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Lomax}}

''Oregon'' got underway again on 29 August for operations along the coast of China. She patrolled off the mouth of the [[Yangtze River]] and was then stationed at [[Wusong]] in [[Shanghai]], China until 5 May 1901. That day, she departed to return to the United States for a refit, sailing first to [[Yokohama]], Japan, and then to [[Honolulu]], Hawaii. From there, she steamed to San Francisco, arriving there on 12 June. She then steamed north to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]], which she reached on 6 July. She remained there for a year and a half before departing in early 1903 for China. She arrived in Hong Kong on 18 March, and over the course of the next three years, she served on the Asiatic Station, visiting ports in China, Japan, and the Philippines. The period passed uneventfully for ''Oregon'', and she returned to the United States in February 1906. She was decommissioned in Puget Sound on 27 April.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Lomax}}

=== Later career ===
[[File:USS Oregon (19-LCM-16394).jpg|thumb|left|''Oregon'' in January 1914]]

The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She received a fairly minimal modernization during her period in [[reserve fleet|reserve]], which included the installation of a cage main mast. She also had her slow-firing 6-inch guns removed and a battery of twelve {{cvt|3|in}} [[quick-firing gun]]s was installed to improve her defenses against torpedo-boats, which had grown in size and power since ''Oregon''{{'}}s construction. These were placed in single mounts, with four in an open battery atop the [[deckhouse]] amidships, one on each 8-inch turret and two on the 13-inch turrets apiece. Her small size and cramped decks prevented the more thorough modernization of her [[superstructure]] that the later American [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s received at this time.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Friedman|pp=82–83}}

On 29 August 1911, ''Oregon'' was recommissioned, but she remained assigned to the reserve fleet until October, when she got underway for [[San Diego, California]]. Over the next two years, she cruised off the West Coast but saw no events of note. She was placed &quot;[[in ordinary]]&quot; on 9 April 1913 in [[Bremerton, Washington]] before being formally returned to the reserve fleet on 16 September 1914, though she remained in partial commission. She was fully commissioned again on 2 January 1915 to participate in the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] in San Francisco. She was again reduced to the reserve fleet on 11 February 1916, remaining there until 7 April 1917, though she was still in partial commission. This period was spent in San Francisco, and 7 April she was once again returned to full commission, the United States having entered [[World War I]] the day before. She saw no activity during the war, but she was used to escort the [[troop ship]]s carrying the force for the [[Siberian expedition]] that intervened in the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}

After returning from Russia, ''Oregon'' was decommissioned again on 12 June 1919 before being recommissioned briefly from 21 August to 4 October. During this period, she hosted President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during a [[naval review|review]] of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] when it arrived in [[Seattle]], Washington. She was assigned the [[hull number]] of &quot;BB-3&quot; on 17 July 1920 when the Navy adopted the system. Beginning in 1921, a group of naval enthusiasts embarked on a campaign to have ''Oregon'' preserved as a [[museum ship]], to be based somewhere in her namesake state. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed in 1922, required ''Oregon'' to be demilitarized, and she was accordingly disarmed in 1923, being pronounced compliant with the terms of the treaty on 4 January 1924. She was listed on the [[Naval Vessel Register]] as an &quot;unclassified&quot; relic. The Navy loaned the ship to Oregon in June 1925, and she was moored in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and restored as a museum vessel.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}

===Fate===
[[File:USS Oregon mast.jpg|thumb|''Oregon''{{'}}s mast in Portland, Oregon]]

''Oregon'' was redesignated with the hull number IX-22 on 17 February 1941. After the United States entered [[World War II]] with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, the Navy determined that ''Oregon'' ought to be sold for [[scrap]] to free resources for the war effort. She was accordingly struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 1942 and was sold to [[ship breaker]]s on 7 December. In March 1943, she was towed to [[Kalama, Washington]] to be broken up, but after the work began the Navy decided that ''Oregon'' would be of use during the planned reconquest of Guam scheduled for mid-1944, either as a storage [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] or as a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. The Navy requested that the breakers stop after the superstructure had been cleared and her internal fittings and equipment had been removed and to return her. She was then loaded with ammunition to support the forces that would [[Battle of Guam (1944)|invade Guam]] and towed there as part of the invasion fleet.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}

The vessel remained moored in Guam through the end of the war in 1945 and for several years thereafter. During this period, on the night of 14–15 November 1948, ''Oregon'' broke free from her moorings during a [[typhoon]] and drifted away. After an extensive search, aircraft located the vessel adrift some {{cvt|500|nmi}} southeast of Guam. The ship was towed back to Guam, and she remained there until 1956, when on 15 March she was sold to Massey Supply Corporation, which in turn resold her to Iwai Sanggo Company of [[Kawasaki, Japan]]. She was then towed there and broken up.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}

Several parts of the ship remain in Portland; her military foremast was erected in 1956 at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park and her [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] is held in the collection of the [[Oregon Historical Society]]. Both of her funnels also survive, but are not on public display.{{sfn|Boddie}}

'''Avro''' was a British [[aircraft manufacturer]].  Its designs include the [[Avro 504]], used as a trainer in the First World War, the [[Avro Lancaster]], one of the pre-eminent bombers of the Second World War, and the delta wing [[Avro Vulcan]], a stalwart of the [[Cold War]].

Avro was founded in 1910 by [[Alliott Verdon Roe]] at the [[Brownsfield Mill]] on [[Great Ancoats Street]] in [[Manchester]]. The company remained based primarily in [[Lancashire]] throughout its 53 years of existence, with key development and manufacturing sites in [[Alexandra Park Aerodrome (Manchester)|Alexandra Park]], [[Chadderton]], [[Trafford Park]], and [[Woodford, Greater Manchester|Woodford]].  The company was merged into [[Hawker Siddeley]] Aviation in 1963, although the Avro name has been used for some aircraft since then.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:AV Roe Bulls Eye.jpg|thumb|The A.V. Roe Type I Triplane, Roe's first successful aircraft]]
One of the world's first aircraft builders, A.V. Roe and Company was established on 1 January 1910 at Brownsfield Mill, Great Ancoats Street, [[Manchester]], by [[Alliott Verdon Roe]] and his brother [[Humphrey Verdon Roe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdon-roe.co.uk/#/thelifeofavroe/biography/ &quot;Alliott Verdon-Roe.&quot;] ''verdon-roe.co.uk''. Retrieved: 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey's contribution was chiefly financial and organizational; funding it from the earnings of the family [[webbing]] business and acting as managing director until he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps|RFC]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1949/1949%20-%201381.html &quot;H.V. Roe.&quot;] ''Flight'', 4 August 1949, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Alliot had already constructed a successful aircraft, the [[Roe I Triplane]], named ''The Bullseye'' after a brand of [[braces (clothing)|braces]] manufactured by Humphrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winthrop|first=John|title=The Technical World Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96|volume=Volume 13|year=1910|publisher=Armour Institute of Technology|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The railway arch where A.V. Roe in 1909 built and achieved the first all-British powered flight still stands in the Lee Valley Park in Hackney.
In 1911, [[Roy Chadwick]] began work as Alliott's personal assistant and the firm's draughtsman and in 1918 he was appointed Chief Designer.  The first Avro aircraft to be produced in any quantity was the Avro E or [[Avro 500]], first flown in March 1912, of which 18 were manufactured, most for the newly formed RFC. The company also built the world's first aircraft with enclosed crew accommodation in 1912, the monoplane [[Avro Type F|Type F]] and the biplane [[Avro Type G]] in 1912, neither progressing beyond the prototype stage.  The Type 500 was developed into the [[Avro 504]], first flown in September 1913. A small number were bought by the War Office before the outbreak of the First World War, and the type saw some front-line service in the early months of the war, but it is best known as a training aircraft, serving in this role until 1933. Production lasted 20 years and totalled 8,340 at several factories: Hamble, Failsworth, Miles Platting and Newton Heath.

===Interwar years===
After the boom in orders during the First World War, the lack of new work in peacetime caused severe financial problems and in August 1920, 68.5% of the company's shares were acquired by nearby [[Crossley Motors]] which had an urgent need for more factory space for automotive vehicle body building.&lt;ref name=Crossley&gt;Eyre, M., Chris Heaps and Alan Townsin. ''Crossley''. Hersham, Surrey, UK: OPC Railprint, 2002. {{ISBN|0-86093-574-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the company left [[Alexandra Park Aerodrome]] in south Manchester where test flying had taken place since 1918; the site was used for a mixture of recreation and housing development. A rural site to the south of the city was found at New Hall Farm, [[Woodford Aerodrome|Woodford]] in Cheshire, which continued to be used by aviation company [[BAE Systems]] until March 2011; the site has now been earmarked for a mixed use development. In 1928 Crossley Motors sold AVRO to [[Armstrong Siddeley]] Holdings Ltd.&lt;ref name=Crossley/&gt; In 1928 A.V. Roe resigned from the company he had founded and formed the [[Saunders-Roe]] company, which after World War II developed several radical designs for combat jets, and, eventually, a range of powerful [[hovercraft]]. In 1935 Avro became a subsidiary of [[Hawker Siddeley]].

===Second World War===
[[File:Avro Lancaster B I PA474.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Avro Lancaster]]]]
Maintaining their skills in designing [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]] aircraft, the company built a more robust biplane called the [[Avro Tutor]] in the 1930s which the [[Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force (RAF)]] also bought in quantity. A twin piston-engined airliner called the [[Avro Anson|Anson]] followed but as tensions rose again in Europe the firm's emphasis returned to combat aircraft. The [[Avro Manchester]], [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], and [[Avro Lincoln|Lincoln]] were particularly famous Avro designs. Over 7,000 Lancasters were built and their bombing capabilities led to their use in the famous ''[[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]]'' raid. Of the total, nearly half were built at Avro's Woodford (Stockport) and Chadderton (Oldham) sites, with some 700 Lancasters built at the Avro &quot;shadow&quot; factory next to [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] (formerly Yeadon Aerodrome), northwest [[Leeds]]. This factory employed 17,500 workers at a time when the population of Yeadon was just 10,000. It was the largest building in Europe at the time, at {{convert|1.5|e6sqft|m2|abbr=off}}, and its roof was disguised by the addition of fields and hedges to hide it from enemy planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/motion-to-celebrate-leeds-factory-s-war-efforts-1-5779881|title=Motion to celebrate Leeds factory's war efforts|last=Bowyer|first=Laura|date=19 June 2013|work=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old taxiway from the factory to the runway is still evident.

The Avro Lancaster carried the heaviest bomb loads of the war, including the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam bomb]].

===Postwar developments===
[[File:Avro Vulcan Bomber RAF.JPEG|thumb|250px|[[Avro Vulcan]]]]
[[File:Blue Steel missile.png|thumb|250px|[[Blue Steel missile]]]]
The civilian [[Avro Lancastrian|Lancastrian]] and maritime reconnaissance [[Avro Shackleton|Shackleton]] were derived from the successful Lancaster design. The [[Avro Tudor|Tudor]] was a pressurised but problematic post-war Avro airliner which faced strong competition from designs by [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]], [[Bombardier Aerospace|Canadair]], [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[Handley Page Aircraft Company|Handley Page]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. With the same wings and engines as the Lincoln, it achieved only a short (34 completed) production run following a first flight in June 1945 and the cancellation of an order from [[BOAC]]. The older [[Avro York]] was somewhat more successful in both the RAF and in commercial service, being distinguished by a fuselage square in cross-section. Both Tudors and Yorks played an important humanitarian part in the [[Berlin Airlift]].

The postwar [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] [[bomber]], originally designed as a nuclear-strike aircraft, was used to maintain the British nuclear deterrent, armed with the [[Blue Steel missile|Avro Blue Steel]] stand-off nuclear bomb. The [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] saw service as a conventional bomber during the British campaign to recapture the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1982. Several Vulcans are prized as museum exhibits.

A twin turboprop [[airliner]], the [[Avro 748]], was developed during the 1950s and sold widely to airlines and governments across the globe, powered by two [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] engines. The RAF bought 6 for use by the [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|Queen's Flight]] and a variant with a rear-loading ramp and a &quot;kneeling&quot; main undercarriage was sold to the RAF (31 aircraft) as the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|Andover]].

===Avro regional jets===

The Avro name would subsequently be resurrected by [[British Aerospace]] when this aircraft manufacturer renamed its [[BAe 146]] family of regional jetliners as Avro regional jets ([[Avro RJ]]).  Three differently sized versions of the four engine jetliner were produced:  the [[Avro RJ70]], the [[Avro RJ85]] and the largest example, the [[Avro RJ100]].

===Avro Canada===
{{main|Avro Canada}}
In 1945, [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Group]] purchased the former [[Victory Aircraft]] firm in [[Malton, Ontario]], and renamed the operation '''A.V. Roe Canada Limited'''.&lt;ref&gt;Campagna 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly known as [[Avro Canada]], it was actually a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group and used the Avro name for trading purposes.

===Amalgamation===
When the company was absorbed into Hawker Siddeley Aviation in July 1963 following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], the Avro name ceased to be used. The brand still had a strong heritage appeal, and as mentioned above the marketing name &quot;''Avro RJ''&quot; (regional jet) was used by [[British Aerospace]] from 1994 to 2001 for production of the RJ70, RJ85 and RJ100 models which were respectively based on the [[BAe 146-100]], [[BAe 146-200]] and [[BAe 146-300]]. This four engine jet aircraft type is sometimes also loosely called the &quot;Avro 146&quot;.

The [[BAe ATP]] (Advanced Turbo Prop) design evolved from the [[Avro 748]] and examples continue in use on shorter, mainly domestic, scheduled air services. A few Avro 504s, Tutors, Ansons and Lancasters are maintained in flying condition as reminders of the heritage of this influential English company. At 39 years, the noisy but impressive Shackleton held the distinction of being the aircraft with the longest period of active RAF service, until overtaken by the [[English Electric Canberra]] in 1998.

==Car production==
Avro also built motor vehicles in the immediate post-World War 1 era, including the three-wheeler [[Harper Runabout]], as well as their own light car. Powered by a 1,330 cc 4-cylinder engine, wood and aluminium were used in an integral construction similar to an aircraft. Approximately 100 were built.

In 1927 Alliott Verdon-Roe designed a two-wheeler car powered by a 350 cc [[Villiers Ltd|Villiers]] air-cooled engine. An outrigger wheel kept the car upright when stationary. The ''Mobile'' did not go into production.

==Football==
[[Avro F.C.]] was founded at the Chadderton factory and still exists today.

The town is home to [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], three of the [[Five College Consortium|Five Colleges]]. The name of the town is pronounced without the ''h'' (&quot;AM-erst&quot;) by natives and long-time residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001533.php|title=languagehat.com : AMHERST.|website=www.languagehat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the local saying, &quot;only the 'h' is silent&quot;, in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Chris Rohmann, [http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=14216 &quot;Stage Struck: Silent But Deadly&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112100540/http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=14216 |date=2014-01-12 }}, ''Valley Advocate'', Oct. 20, 2011; and [http://www.cohousing.com/living-in-western-massachusetts.html &quot;Living in Western Massachusetts&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825012230/http://www.cohousing.com/living-in-western-massachusetts.html |date=2012-08-25 }}, Pioneer Valley Cohousing (last visited Sept. 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Amherst has three [[census-designated place]]s;   [[Amherst Center, Massachusetts|Amherst Center]], [[North Amherst, Massachusetts|North Amherst]], and [[South Amherst, Massachusetts|South Amherst]].

Amherst is part of the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] [[Springfield metropolitan area, Massachusetts|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Lying {{convert|22|mi}} north of the city of Springfield, Amherst is considered the northernmost town in the [[Hartford-Springfield]] Metropolitan Region, &quot;The Knowledge Corridor&quot;.  Amherst is also located in the Pioneer Valley, which encompasses the Hampshire, Hampden and Franklin counties.

==History==
[[File:Amherst &amp; Sunderland streetcar, Amherst, 1903.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A [[streetcar]] for the [[Amherst and Sunderland Street Railway]] crosses Amherst Center, in front of the town hall, {{circa|1903}}]]
[[File:View of Amherst MA in 1886 - LOC 00406u.jpg|thumb|right|Listing of sights in Amherst, 1886]]

The earliest known document of the lands now comprising Amherst is the deed of purchase dated December 1658 between John Pynchon of Springfield and three native inhabitants, referred to as Umpanchla, Quonquont, and Chickwalopp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Carpenter |first1=Edward Wilson |last2=Charles Frederick Morehouse |year=1896 |title=The History of the Town of Amherst, Massachusetts |location=Amherst, Mass. |publisher=Press of Carpenter &amp; Morehouse |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historytownamhe01moregoog/page/n15 1]–2 |oclc=11223569 |url=https://archive.org/details/historytownamhe01moregoog |access-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the deed, &quot;ye Indians of Nolwotogg (Norwottuck) upon ye River of Quinecticott (Connecticut)&quot; sold the entire area in exchange for &quot;two Hundred fatham of [[Wampam]] &amp; Twenty fatham, and one large Coate at Eight fatham wch Chickwollop set of, of trusts, besides severall small giftes&quot; {{sic}}.

Amherst was first visited by Europeans no later than 1665, when [[Nathaniel Dickinson (pioneer)|Nathaniel Dickinson]] surveyed the lands for its mother town [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]]. The first permanent English settlements arrived in 1727.  It remained a part of Hadley, even when it gained precinct status in 1734, before becoming a [[Township (United States)|township]] in 1759.

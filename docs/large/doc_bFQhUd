The 1960 constitution put in place a form of power-sharing, or [[Consociationalism|consociational]] government, in which concessions were made to the [[Turkish Cypriots]] minority, including as a requirement that the vice-president of Cyprus and at least 30% of members of parliament be Turkish Cypriots. Archbishop [[Makarios III]] would be the [[President of Cyprus|President]] and Dr. [[Fazıl Küçük]] would become Vice President. One of the articles in the constitution was the creation of separate local municipalities so that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could manage their own municipalities in large towns.

Internal conflicts turned into full-fledged armed fighting between the two communities on the island which prompted the United Nations to send [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|peacekeeping forces]] in 1964; these forces are still in place today. In 1974, Greek nationalists performed [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|a military coup]] with the support of military junta in Greece. Unable to secure multilateral support against the coup, Turkey [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded]] the northern portion of the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the [[Taksim (politics)|partition]] of the island.&lt;ref name=danopoulos&gt;Danopoulos, Constantine Panos. ''Civil-military relations, nation building, and national identity: comparative perspectives'' (2004), Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The intercommunal violence, the coup, and the subsequent invasion led to the [[Cypriot refugees|displacement]] of hundreds of thousands of Cypriots.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Rose Johnston, Susan Slyomovics.

The ''[[de facto]]'' state of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed in 1975 under the name of the [[Turkish Federated State of Cyprus]]. The name was changed to its present form, the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], on 15 November 1983.  Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus.

In 2002 [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] started a new round of negotiations for the unification of the island. In 2004 after long negotiations between both sides a plan for unification of the island emerged. The resulting plan was supported by [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. The nationalists on both sides campaigned for the rejection of the plan, the result being that Turkish Cypriots accepted the plan while Greek Cypriots rejected it overwhelmingly. 

After Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004, it adopted the [[euro]] as its currency on January 1, 2008, replacing the previously used [[Cypriot pound]]; Northern Cyprus continued to use the [[Turkish lira]].

In [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, '''{{Mono|chmod}}''' is the [[command (computing)|command]] and [[system call]] which is used to change the [[File system permissions|access permissions]] of [[file system]] objects ([[Computer file|files]] and [[Directory (computing)|directories]]). It is also used to change [[#Special modes|special mode]] flags. The request is filtered by the [[umask]]. The name is an abbreviation of ''change mode''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catcode.com/teachmod/|title=Tutorial for chmod|website=catcode.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A {{Mono|chmod}} command first appeared in [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] [[Unix]] version 1.

As systems grew in number and types of users, [[access control list]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIX 5.3 System management|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/#!/ssw_aix_53/com.ibm.aix.baseadmn/doc/baseadmndita/acl.htm?cp=ssw_aix_53|website=IBM knowledge Center|publisher=IBM|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were added to many file systems in addition to these most basic modes to increase flexibility.

The version of {{Mono|chmod}} bundled in [[GNU]] [[coreutils]] was written by David MacKenzie and Jim Meyering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod|title=chmod(1): change file mode bits - Linux man page|website=linux.die.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Mono|chmod}} command has also been ported to the [[IBM i]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM System i Version 7.2 Programming Qshell |language=en |author=IBM |author-link=IBM |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzahz/rzahzpdf.pdf?view=kc |access-date=2020-09-05 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command syntax==
{{Multiple|
{{confusing|section|date=March 2019}}
{{Duplication|section|dupe=File system permissions#Notation of traditional Unix permissions|date=March 2019}}
}}
&lt;!-- Very little in this section talks about the actual command syntax. The focus here is mostly on how the file permissions work, which is a little out of scope. ~~~~ --&gt;

Throughout this section, ''{{strong|u}}ser'' refers to the owner of the file, as a reminder that the symbolic form of the command uses &quot;'''u'''&quot;. 
&lt;!-- Please do not change to owner. dgerman --&gt;

&lt;code&gt;chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 ...]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html|title=chmod Man Page with examples and calculator - Linux - SS64.com|website=ss64.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually implemented options include:
* {{code|-R}} Recursive, i.e. include objects in subdirectories.
&lt;!-- not in Mac OS * {{code|-f}} forge ahead; processing continues if errors occur. NOT force --&gt;
* {{code|-v}} verbose, show objects changed (unchanged objects are not shown).

If a [[symbolic link]] is specified, the target object is affected. File modes directly associated with symbolic links themselves are typically not used.

To view the file mode, the [[ls|{{code|ls}}]] or [[stat (Unix)|{{code|stat}}]] commands may be used:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh
-rwxr-xr--  1 dgerman  staff  823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh
$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh
754
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The {{code|r}}, {{code|w}}, and {{code|x}} specify the read, write, and execute access. The first character of the {{Mono|ls}} display denotes the object type; a [[hyphen]] represents a plain file. This script can be read, written to, and executed by the user {{Mono|dgerman}}; read and executed by members of the {{Mono|staff}} group; and only read by any other users.

===Octal modes===
{{See also|File system permissions#Numeric notation|l1=Octal notation of file system permissions}}

The main parts of the {{Mono|chmod}} permissions:

For example: {{code|drwxrwx---}}

The characters to the right of the &quot;d&quot; define permissions for each ''[[File system permissions#Classes|class]]'':
* the three leftmost characters, {{code|rwx}}, define permissions for the ''User'' class (i.e. the file owner).
* the middle three characters, {{code|rwx}}, define permissions for the ''Group'' class (i.e. the [[Group identifier|group]] owning the file)
* the last three characters, {{code|---}}, define permissions for the ''Others'' class. In this example, users who are not the owner of the file and who are not members of the ''Group'' (and, thus, are in the ''Others'' class) have no permission to access the file.

====Numerical permissions====
The {{Mono|chmod}} numerical format accepts up to four octal digits. The three rightmost digits define permissions for the file user, the group, and others. The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special {{Mono|[[setuid]]}}, {{Mono|[[setgid]]}}, and {{Mono|[[Sticky bit|sticky]]}} flags. Each digit of the three rightmost digits represents a binary value, which controls the &quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot; and &quot;execute&quot; permissions respectively. A value of 1 means a class is allowed that action, while a 0 means it is disallowed.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

For example, {{code|754}} would allow:
* &quot;read&quot; (4), &quot;write&quot; (2), and &quot;execute&quot; (1) for the ''User'' class, as the binary value of 7 (4+2+1) is 111.
* &quot;read&quot; (4) and &quot;execute&quot; (1) for the ''Group'' class, as the binary value of 5 (4+1) is 101.
* Only &quot;read&quot; (4) for the ''Others'' class, as the binary value of 4 (4) is 100.

====Numeric example====
Change permissions to permit members of the {{Mono|programmers}} group to update a file:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ ls -l sharedFile
-rw-r--r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
$ chmod 664 sharedFile
$ ls -l sharedFile
-rw-rw-r--  1 jsmith programmers 57 Jul  3 10:13  sharedFile
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since the {{Mono|setuid}}, {{Mono|setgid}} and {{Mono|sticky}} bits are not specified, this is equivalent to:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ chmod 0664 sharedFile
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Symbolic modes===
{{See also|File system permissions#Symbolic notation|l1=Symbolic notation of file system permissions}}

The {{Mono|chmod}} command also accepts a finer-grained symbolic notation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIX 5.5 Commands Reference|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/#!/ssw_aix_53/com.ibm.aix.cmds/doc/aixcmds1/chmod.htm?cp=ssw_aix_53%2F1-2-0-2-78|website=IBM Knowledge Center|publisher=IBM|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows modifying specific modes while leaving other modes untouched. The symbolic mode is composed of three components, which are combined to form a single string of text:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ chmod [references][operator][modes] file ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Classes of users are used to distinguish to whom the permissions apply. If no classes are specified &quot;all&quot; is implied. The classes are represented by one or more of the following letters:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Reference !! Class !! Description
|-
| {{Mono|u}} || user || file owner
|-
| {{Mono|g}} || group || members of the file's group
|-
| {{Mono|o}} || others || users who are neither the file's owner nor members of the file's group
|-
| {{Mono|a}} || all || all three of the above, same as {{code|ugo}}
|}

The {{Mono|chmod}} program uses an operator to specify how the modes of a file should be adjusted. The following operators are accepted:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Description
|-
| {{Mono|+}} || adds the specified modes to the specified classes
|-
| {{Mono|-}} || removes the specified modes from the specified classes
|-
| {{Mono|&amp;#61;}} || the modes specified are to be made the exact modes for the specified classes
|}

The modes indicate which permissions are to be granted or removed from the specified classes. There are three basic modes which correspond to the basic permissions:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Mode !! Name !! Description
|-
| {{Mono|r}} || read ||'''r'''ead a file or list a directory's contents
|-
| {{Mono|w}} || write ||'''w'''rite to a file or directory
|-
| {{Mono|x}} || execute ||e'''x'''ecute a file or recurse a directory tree
|-
| {{Mono|X}} || special execute || which is not a permission in itself but rather can be used instead of {{Mono|x}}. It applies execute permissions to directories regardless of their current permissions and applies execute permissions to a file which already has at least one execute permission bit already set (either ''User'', ''Group'' or ''Others''). It is only really useful when used with {{code|+}} and usually in combination with the {{code|-R}} flag for giving ''Group'' or ''Others'' access to a big directory tree without setting execute permission on normal files (such as text files), which would normally happen if you just used {{code|chmod -R a+rx .}}, whereas with {{Mono|X}} you can do {{code|chmod -R a+rX .}} instead

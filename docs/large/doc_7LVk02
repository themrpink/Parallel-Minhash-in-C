==== Audrey Madison Turner ====
Turner met [[Audrey Madison Turner|Audrey Madison]] in 1993; she also started as an Ikette before also becoming his lead singer. They married on October 8, 2006 in Las Vegas at A Special Memory Wedding Chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ike Turner's wedding 10/08/2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRK4jxaoOpM|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he filed for divorce two months later on December 22, 2006. After the divorce was granted they reconciled before his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt; In 2011, Audrey appeared as a contestant on [[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|''The X Factor'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/05/famous-x/|title=Famous 'X'|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=October 5, 2011|website=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she released a memoir titled ''Love Had Everything to Do with It'', which details her volatile relationship with Turner due to his [[bipolar disorder]]. She told [[Baltimore Afro-American|''The Afro'']]: &quot;I decided to write it because it was like a cleansing and it released all of the trauma. Also, I wanted the general public to have a better outlook and perspective on where Ike was mentally and emotionally, because so often, as a nation, we turn on people who have mental health issues and define them by their behaviors rather than their condition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afro.com/ike-turners-widow-pens-memoir-on-singers-violent-bipolar-condition/#|title=Ike Turner's Widow Pens Memoir on Singer's Violent Bipolar Condition|last=Cornish|first=Stephanie|date=June 8, 2016|website=The Afro|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205193305/https://www.afro.com/ike-turners-widow-pens-memoir-on-singers-violent-bipolar-condition/|archive-date=December 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children ===
Turner had six children: sons Ike Turner Jr. born in 1958 and Michael Turner born in 1960 (with Lorraine Taylor), Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Turner born in 1960 (with Tina Turner), daughters Mia Turner born in 1969 (with Ann Thomas), and Twanna Melby Turner (with Pat Richard).&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/05/us/ike-turner-is-paroled.html|title=Ike Turner Is Paroled|date=September 5, 1991|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tina's son Craig Turner born in 1958 (fathered by [[Raymond Hill (musician)|Raymond Hill]]) was adopted by Turner and therefore carried his surname. Craig died in an apparent suicide in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/03/tina-turners-firstborn-son-craig-turner-dies-apparent-suicide/757019002/|title=Tina Turner's firstborn son dies of apparent suicide|last=Andrea Mandell|first=Bryan Alexander|date=July 3, 2018|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner's second wife Velma Davis (née Dishman) claimed that Turner fathered her daughter, Linda Turner Bullock, who was born in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; Turner denied that assertion in his autobiography (in which Velma is mistakenly referred to as Thelma): &quot;I met Thelma Dishman, who, at that time, I thought was a pretty girl. Thelma was pregnant, not by me, but I liked her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

In 1988, Turner discovered he had a daughter named Twanna Melby.{{Sfn|Turner|1999|p=211}} He was paroled into her custody in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philips-05-09-1991&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jet-9/23/91&quot; /&gt; Her mother, Pat Richard attended [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High school]] with Tina in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt;

Ike Turner Jr. released an album, ''Hard Labor'', in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ike-Turner-Jr-Hard-Labor/release/3593824|title=Ike Turner Jr – Hard Labor|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a Grammy Award for his involvement with Turner's 2006 album ''Risin' with the Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/ike-turner-jr|title=Ike Turner, Jr.|website=Recording Academy Grammy Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tours with former Ikette Randi Love as Sweet Randi Love and The Love Thang Band.&lt;ref name=&quot;:27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoklahomaeagle.net/2017/10/12/tulsa-native-randi-love-giving-to-give-back/|title=Tulsa Native Randi Love Giving To Give Back|last=Jones|first=Fred L.|date=October 12, 2017|website=The Oklahoma Eagle|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronnie Turner was in a band called Manufactured Funk with songwriter and musician [[Patrick Moten]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:27&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blogtalkradio.com/wfunk/2017/10/16/an-interview-with-ike-turner-jr-and-randi-love-on-the-bobby-eaton-show|title=An Interview with Ike Turner Jr and Randi Love on The Bobby Eaton Show|date=2017|website=BlogTalkRadio}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played bass guitar in his mother's band after his parents split up, and he later played in a band with his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner-1999&quot; /&gt; He married French-American singer [[Afida Turner]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voici.fr/news-people/actu-people/mort-de-craig-turner-afida-turner-rend-hommage-a-son-beau-frere-648336|title=Mort de Craig Turner : Afida Turner rend hommage à son beau-frère|date=July 5, 2018|website=Voici|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307173744/https://www.voici.fr/news-people/actu-people/mort-de-craig-turner-afida-turner-rend-hommage-a-son-beau-frere-648336|archive-date=March 7, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death, he told [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'' magazine]]: &quot;I loved my father very much... You can talk 5 or 10 minutes about the bad he's done. You can talk all night about the achievements he's had. He was successful with my mom and after my mom. He won a Grammy before he died.

=== Legal difficulties and drug addiction ===
In 1959, Turner was charged with what he described as &quot;interstate transportation of forged checks and conspiracy&quot; and was forced to stand trial in St. Louis. At the first trial, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and at the retrial a year later he was found not guilty.&lt;ref name=Collis-2003-76&gt;{{harvnb|Collis|2003|pp=76–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Turner was arrested for using illegal [[blue box]]es at Bolic Sound studio to make long-distance phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 2, 1974|title=Turner Says He's Innocent Of Telephone Abuse Rap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uI8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|journal=Jet|volume=46|issue=6|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cleared of the charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiersh-08-1985&quot;/&gt;

Before the age of 30, Turner did not use drugs or drink alcohol. He was noted for firing anyone in his band who used substances. Turner claimed that he was first introduced to cocaine by &quot;two very famous people I'd been working with in Las Vegas at the same hotel,&quot; later alleged by producer D'Angela Proctor in Turner's 2015 ''Unsung'' documentary to be singer [[Elvis Presley]] and comedian [[Redd Foxx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pendleton |first1=Tonya |title=D'Angela Proctor Talks Ike Turner 'Unsung', Reveals Who Introduced Him To Cocaine |url=https://blackamericaweb.com/2015/06/02/dangela-proctor-talks-ike-turner-unsung-reveals-who-introduced-him-to-cocaine/ |website=Black America Web |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=June 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609013424/https://blackamericaweb.com/2015/06/02/dangela-proctor-talks-ike-turner-unsung-reveals-who-introduced-him-to-cocaine/ |archive-date=June 9, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; He took the cocaine home and tried it one night while writing songs at the piano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot;/&gt; Turner said he liked the reduced need for sleep the drug gave him which allowed him to write more music.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; By the early 1970s, he was heavily addicted to the drug, buying it in large quantities and sharing it with friends. Turner later estimated that he had spent $11&amp;nbsp;million on cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/obituary/2007/12/19/ike-turner|title=Ike Turner|date=2007-12-19|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-11-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; His addiction caused a hole through his [[nasal septum]], the pain of which he relieved by using more cocaine. He eventually began [[freebasing]] [[crack cocaine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougherty-09-03-1990&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Christian-10-2008/&gt;

By 1985, Turner's finances were in disarray and he owed the state of California $12,802 in back taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiersh-08-1985&quot; /&gt; He later settled his account. He had tried to sell his studio Bolic Sound in 1980 to raise funds to avoid [[foreclosure]], but the studio burned down on the day a potential buyer was scheduled to view it in January 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiersh-08-1985&quot; /&gt;

During the 1980s, Turner was arrested multiple times for drug and firearm offenses which resulted in two convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dougherty-09-03-1990&quot; /&gt;

* In 1980, a [[SWAT]] team raided his Bolic Sound studio, finding a live [[hand grenade]] and seven grams of [[cocaine]]. Turner received his first conviction for cocaine possession. He was sentenced to thirty days in the L.A. county jail with three years [[probation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiersh-08-1985&quot; /&gt; 
* In April 1981, Turner was arrested for shooting a 49-year-old newspaper delivery man. He accused the man of assaulting his wife Ann Thomas and of kicking his dog. Turner said he only fired a shot to scare him off and that the man had injured himself when he climbed over the fence to get away. A jury [[Acquittal|acquitted]] Turner of assault in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiersh-08-1985&quot; /&gt;
* In June 1985, Turner was arrested and charged with conspiracy to sell $16,000 worth of cocaine, possession and maintaining a residence for selling or using a controlled substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakeland-28-06-1985&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ike Turner Released From Jail|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19850628&amp;id=ue8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1777,4664336|access-date=February 27, 2012|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=June 28, 1985|author=Lakeland Wire Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police took $1,000 worth of rock cocaine from his [[North Hollywood]] apartment.

Turner managed to break his dependency on cocaine while in prison and remained clean for more than ten years. He visited high schools during [[Black History Month]] to speak against [[Substance abuse|drug use]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pareles 12-13-2007&quot; /&gt; While trying to help an acquaintance from crack addiction at a [[crack house]] he [[relapse]]d in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt;

=== Health problems ===
In 2005, Turner revealed he had been diagnosed with [[emphysema]] which required him to use an oxygen tank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams-10-27-2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ike-turner-on-sex-drugs-and-rocknroll-512759.html|title=Ike Turner: On sex, drugs and rock'n'roll|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=October 27, 2005|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Mia Turner said, &quot;He was too weak from the emphysema to do anything. He'd go in the studio for a couple of minutes and play a couple of bars and say he had to go lay down.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carter-01-17-2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Chelsea J.|title=Cocaine overdose killed Ike Turner, San Diego coroner rules|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-01-17/news/17151576_1_cocaine-overdose-drug-abuse-turner-s-daughter|access-date=October 3, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (AP)|date=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his ill health, he collaborated with the Gorillaz on their album ''[[Demon Days]]'' and performed the track with them at the [[Manchester Opera House]] in November 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;:25&quot; /&gt;

After his death in 2007, Turner's autopsy and toxicology report showed he was taking [[Seroquel]] at the time of his death. The medicine is most commonly used as treatment for [[bipolar disorder]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[schizophrenia]]. His ex-wife Audrey Madison claimed Turner was bipolar and that she was helping him with his illness, a claim supported by Turner's personal assistant and caretaker, Falina Rasool. Rasool said she talked to Turner about his bipolar disorder and witnessed its effects. &quot;I would come in the room and see him change like a lightbulb, switch on and switch off. I did ask him about it. He said he made a song about it and we started laughing,&quot; said Rasool, referring to &quot;Bi Polar&quot; from the Grammy-winning album ''Risin' With The Blues''. &quot;I know I'm bipolar....And I've been bipolar, but a lot of people is bipolar,&quot; he told her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt; However, Turner's daughter, Mia Turner, disagreed with this diagnosis and felt he was being over-medicated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Margena A.|date=October 2008|title=The Last Days of Ike Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|journal=Ebony|volume=63|issue=12|pages=94–100|access-date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In the weeks leading up to his death, Turner became reclusive. On December 10, 2007, he told Falina Rasool that he believed he was dying and would not live until Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot;/&gt;
As he predicted, Turner died two days later, on December 12, at the age of 76, at his home in [[San Marcos, California]], near San Diego.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ray |last=McDonald |title=Rock and Roll Legend Ike Turner Dies |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-13-voa18.cfm |work=VOA News |access-date=January 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122243/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-12/2007-12-13-voa18.cfm |archive-date=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found dead by his former wife Ann Thomas. Rasool was also in the house and administered [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]. Turner was pronounced dead at 11:38&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot;/&gt;

The funeral was held on December 22, 2007, at the City of Refuge Church in [[Gardena, California]]. Among those who spoke at the funeral were Little Richard, [[Solomon Burke]] and Phil Spector. The Kings of Rhythm played versions of &quot;Rocket 88&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. Turner was cremated after the funeral service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-10-2008&quot; /&gt;

On January 16, 2008, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office reported that Turner had died from a [[cocaine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]]. &quot;The cause of death for Ike Turner is cocaine toxicity with other significant conditions, such as hypertensive [[cardiovascular disease]] and pulmonary [[emphysema]]&quot;, Supervising Medical Examiner Investigator Paul Parker told CNN.&lt;ref name=&quot;death cause&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Medical examiner says Ike Turner died of cocaine overdose|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/16/iketurner.cocaine/?iref=mpstoryview |publisher=CNN.com |date=January 17, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Mia was said to be surprised at the coroner's assessment, believing his advanced stage emphysema was a bigger factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter-01-17-2008&quot;/&gt;

Turner died without a valid [[Will and testament|will]]. Less than a week after his death, his former wife Audrey Madison Turner filed a petition stating that he had penned a handwritten will naming her as a beneficiary. In 2009, a judge ruled that the handwritten will was invalid and that by law, Turner's children were the direct heirs of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-exclusive-judge-leans-toward-finding-ike-turners-2009oct30-story.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Judge leans toward finding Ike Turner's children as heirs|last=Figueroa|first=Teri|date=October 30, 2009|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grey Mule (7104389757).jpg|thumb|upright|A grey mule]]

A '''mule''' is the [[offspring]] of a male [[donkey]] (jack) and a female [[horse]] ([[mare]]).&lt;ref name=LOCMuleDay&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-12-18 |title=Mule Day: A Local Legacy |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/tn/es_tn_mule_1.html |website=americaslibrary.gov |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2020-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk/what-we-do/knowledge-and-advice/about-donkeys/mule|website=The Donkey Sanctuary|title=What is a mule?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. Of the two [[F1 hybrid|first generation hybrids]] between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a [[hinny]], which is the offspring of a female donkey ([[Jenny (donkey)|jenny]]) and a male horse ([[stallion]]).

The size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's female parent ([[Mare|dam]]). Mules can be lightweight, medium weight or when produced from [[draft horse]] mares, of moderately heavy weight.&lt;ref name=Ensminger85&gt;{{cite book |last=Ensminger |first=M. E. |year=1990 |title=Horses and Horsemanship: Animal Agriculture Series |edition=Sixth |publisher=Interstate |location=Danville, IL |isbn=0-8134-2883-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85–87}} Mules are reputed to be more patient, hardy and long-lived than horses and are described as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.&lt;ref name=Jackson2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Louise A |year=2004 |title= The Mule Men: A History of Stock Packing in the Sierra Nevada |publisher=Mountain Press |location= Missoula, MT |isbn=0-87842-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

The mule is valued because, while it has the size and ground-covering ability of its dam, it is stronger than a horse of similar size and inherits the endurance and disposition of the [[donkey]] sire, tending to require less food than a horse of similar size. Mules also tend to be more independent than most domesticated equines other than its parental species, the donkey.

The median weight range for a mule is between about {{convert|370|and|460|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Mule | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g50MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15 | encyclopedia = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General | volume = XVII | pages = 15 | publisher = Henry G. Allen and Company | year = 1888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While a few mules can carry live weight up to {{convert|160|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, the superiority of the mule becomes apparent in their additional endurance.&lt;ref name=Carlton/&gt;

In general, a mule can be packed with dead weight of up to 20% of its body weight, or approximately {{convert|90|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Carlton&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |title=Hunter's Specialties: More With Wayne Carlton On Elk Hunting |url=http://hunterspec.com/content/more-wayne-carlton-elk-hunting |website=hunterspec.com |publisher=Hunter's Specialties|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008150241/http://hunterspec.com/Updateable/update_display.cfm?pageID=2048&amp;categoryID=12 |archive-date=2010-10-08 |url-status=live |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it depends on the individual animal, it has been reported that mules trained by the [[Army of Pakistan]] can carry up to {{convert|72|kg|lbs|0}} and walk {{convert|26|km|mi|1}} without resting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Aamer Ahmed |date=2005-10-19 |title=Beasts ease burden of quake victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4354440.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average equine in general can carry up to approximately 30% of its body weight in live weight, such as a rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|title=Chapter 3, Section IV: Size|author=American Endurance Ride Conference|access-date=2008-08-07|date=November 2003|work=Endurance Rider's Handbook|publisher=AERC|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515133147/http://www.aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|archive-date=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female mule that has [[estrus]] cycles and thus, in theory, could carry a fetus, is called a &quot;molly&quot; or &quot;Molly mule&quot;, though the term is sometimes used to refer to female mules in general.  Pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur naturally as well as through [[embryo transfer]]. A male mule is properly called a ''horse mule'', though often called a ''john mule'', which is the correct term for a [[Gelding|gelded]] mule. A young male mule is called a ''mule colt'', and a young female is called a ''mule filly''.&lt;ref name=LongearLingo&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-05-22 |title=Longear Lingo |url=http://www.lovelongears.com/longearlingo.html |website=lovelongears.com |publisher=American Donkey and Mule Society |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Rhyton en forme de tête d'équidé01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[rhyton]] in the shape of a mule's head, made by [[Brygos]], early 5th century BC. Jérôme Carcopino Museum, Department of Archaeology, [[Aleria]]]]

With its short thick head, long ears, thin limbs, small narrow hooves, and a short [[mane (horse)|mane]], the mule shares characteristics of a donkey. In height and body, shape of neck and [[Rump (animal)|rump]], uniformity of coat, and teeth, it appears horse-like.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The mule comes in all sizes, shapes and [[Equine conformation|conformations]]. There are mules that resemble huge draft horses, sturdy [[American quarter horse|quarter horses]], fine-boned racing horses, shaggy [[pony|ponies]] and more.

The mule is an example of [[hybrid vigor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Chen |editor1-first=Z. Jeffrey |editor2-last=Birchler |editor2-first=James A. |year=2013 |title=Polyploid and Hybrid Genomics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rZmCf5ZvYUC&amp;lpg=PA137 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-96037-0 |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin wrote: &quot;The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |year=1879 |title=What Mr. Darwin Saw in His Voyage Round the World in the Ship 'Beagle' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GY41AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 |publisher=Harper &amp; Bros. |location=New York |pages=33–34 |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mule inherits from its sire the traits of intelligence, sure-footedness, toughness, endurance, disposition, and natural cautiousness. From its dam it inherits speed, conformation, and agility.&lt;ref name=Hauer2014&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hauer |editor-first=John |year=2014 |title=The Natural Superiority of Mules |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVJlAgAAQBAJ |publisher=Skyhorse |isbn=978-1-62636-166-9 |access-date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6,8}} Mules are reputed to exhibit a higher cognitive intelligence than their parent species. That said, there is a lack of robust scientific evidence to back up these claims.  There is preliminary data from at least two evidence based studies, but they rely on [[sample size |a limited set of specialized cognitive tests and a small number of subjects]].&lt;ref name=MuleCognition/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giebel1958&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giebel|display-authors=etal|date=1958 |title=Visuelles Lernvermögen bei Einhufern |journal=Zoologische Jahrbücher |series=Physiologie |volume=67  |pages=487–520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mules are generally taller at the shoulder than donkeys and have better endurance than horses, although a lower top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://purelyfacts.com/question/9/which-is-taller-a-mule-or-a-horse?DDA=77&amp;DDB=55 |title=Which is taller, a Mule or a Horse? |website=Purelyfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuleCognition&gt;{{cite journal |last=Proops |first=Leanne |author2=Faith Burden |author3=Britta Osthaus  |date=2008-07-18 |title=Mule cognition: a case of hybrid vigor? |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=75–84 |doi= 10.1007/s10071-008-0172-1 |pmid=18636282 |s2cid=27962537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

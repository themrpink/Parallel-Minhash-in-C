[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] gives a thumbnail sketch of the resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to Greece'' Book 7 Sections 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miletus]] was the first city attacked, where there had been some Mycenaean Greeks apparently under the rule of [[Crete|Cretans]]. After overthrowing the Cretan government and settling there the Ionians widened their attack to [[Ephesus]], [[Samos]] and [[Priene]]. Combining with [[Aeolians]] from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] they founded [[Myus]]. [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] was already in the hands of Aeolians who had arrived via Crete in Mycenaean times. The Ionians &quot;swore a treaty of union&quot; with them. They took [[Lebedos]] driving out the Carians and augmented the Aeolian population of [[Teos]]. They settled on [[Chios]], took [[Erythrae]] from the Carians, Pamphylians (both Luwian) and Cretans. [[Clazomenae]] and [[Phocaea]] were settled from [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Somewhat later they took [[Smyrna]] from the Aeolians.

===Brief autonomy===
{{main|Ionian League|Panionium|Delos}}
The Ionian cities formed a religious and cultural (as opposed to a political or military) confederacy, the [[Ionian League]], of which participation in the [[Panionia|Panionic festival]] was a distinguishing characteristic. This festival took place on the north slope of [[Mt. Mycale]] in a shrine called the [[Panionium]]. In addition to the Panionic festival at Mycale, which was celebrated mainly by the Asian Ionians, both European and Asian coast Ionians convened on [[Delos]] Island each summer to worship at the temple of the Delian [[Apollo]].

But like the [[Amphictyonic league]] in Greece, the Ionic was rather of a sacred than a political character; every city enjoyed absolute autonomy, and, though common interests often united them for a common political object, they never formed a real confederacy like that of the Achaeans or [[Boeotia]]ns. The advice of [[Thales]] of Miletus to combine in a political union was rejected.

The colonies naturally became prosperous. [[Miletus]] especially was at an early period one of the most important commercial cities of Greece; and in its turn became the parent of numerous other colonies, which extended all around the shores of the [[Euxine Sea]] and the Propontis from Abydus and [[Cyzicus]] to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] and Panticapaeum. [[Phocaea]] was one of the first Greek cities whose mariners explored the shores of the western Mediterranean. [[Ephesus]], though it did not send out any colonies of importance, from an early period became a flourishing city and attained to a position corresponding in some measure to that of Smyrna at the present day.

===Under the last Anatolian empire===
[[File:IONIA, Uncertain. Circa 600-550 BC.jpg|thumb|Possible coin of Ionia. Circa 600-550 BC]]
About 700 BC [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], first Mermnad king of [[Lydia]], invaded the territories of Smyrna and Miletus, and is said to have taken [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] as his son Ardys did Priene. The first event in the history of Ionia for which there is a trustworthy account is the inroad of the [[Cimmerians|Cimmerii]], who ravaged a great part of Asia Minor, including Lydia, and sacked [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], but were foiled in their attack upon Ephesus. This event may be referred to the middle of the 7th century BC. It was not until the reign of [[Croesus]] (560–545 BC) that the cities of Ionia fell completely under Lydian rule.

The defeat of Croesus by [[Cyrus the Great]] was followed by the conquest of all the Ionian cities in 547 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzjAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=ionian+revolt+547+BC&amp;pg=PA261|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece|accessdate=31 December 2014|isbn=9781136787997|last1=Wilson|first1=Nigel|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These became subject to the Persian monarchy with the other Greek cities of Asia. In this position they enjoyed a considerable amount of autonomy, but were for the most part subject to local despots, most of whom were creatures of the Persian king. It was at the instigation of one of these despots, [[Histiaeus of Miletus]], that in about 500 BC the principal cities ignited the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persia. They were at first assisted by the Athenians and [[Eretria]], with whose aid they penetrated into the interior and burnt Sardis, an event which ultimately led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian invasion of Greece]]. But the fleet of the Ionians was defeated off the island of [[Battle of Lade|Lade]], and the destruction of Miletus after a protracted siege was followed by the reconquest of all the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well as continental.

===Autonomy under the Athenian empire===
The victories of the Greeks during the great Persian war and the liberation of [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]], and Ionia from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] had the effect of enfranchising their kinsmen on the other side of the Aegean; and the [[Battle of Mycale]] (479 BC), in which the defeat of the Persians was in great measure owing to the Ionians, secured their emancipation. They henceforth became the dependent allies of Athens (see [[Delian League]]), though still retaining their autonomy, which they preserved until the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387 BC once more placed them as well as the other Greek cities in Asia under the nominal dominion of Persia.

===Satrapy again (387-335 BC)===
[[File:IONIA, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC.jpg|thumb|Ionia, Achaemenid Period. Uncertain satrap. Circa 350-333 BC]]
Ionian cities appear to have retained a considerable amount of freedom until the conquest of Asia Minor by [[Alexander the Great]].

===Hellenistic period===
After the [[battle of the Granicus]] most of the Ionian cities submitted to the rule of [[Alexander the Great]] and his [[Diadochi]]. As such Ionia enjoyed a great prosperity during the [[Hellenistic]] times with the notable exception of [[Miletus]], which, being the only city of the [[Ionian League]] to deny homage to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], was finally leveled after a long siege at 334 [[Before Christ|BC]], never regaining its splendor.

===Under Rome===
Ionia became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 133 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History |title=Ionia |first=Jan |last=Breder |editor5-first=Sabine R |editor5-last=Huebner |editor4-first=Andrew |editor4-last=Erskine |editor3-first=Craige B |editor3-last=Champion |editor2-first=Kai |editor2-last=Brodersen |editor1-first=Roger S |editor1-last=Bagnall |date=26 October 2012 |isbn=9781405179355 |doi=10.1002/9781444338386 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |oclc=230191195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Ionia has a long roll of distinguished men of letters and science (notably the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] of philosophy) and distinct school of art. This school flourished between 700 and 500 BC. The great names of this school are [[Theodorus of Samos|Theodorus]] and Rhoecus of Samos; [[Bathycles of Magnesia|Bathycles]] of [[Magnesia on the Maeander]]; [[Glaucus of Chios]], Melas, Micciades, Archermus, [[Bupalus|Bupalus and Athenis]] of [[Chios]]. Notable works of the school still extant are the famous archaic female statues found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1885–1887, the seated statues of Branchidae, the Nike of Archermus found at Delos, and the objects in [[ivory]] and [[electrum]] found by D.G. Hogarth in the lower strata of the Artemision at Ephesus.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] designation for [[Greek language|Greek]] is ''Younan'' (یونان), a transliteration of &quot;Ionia&quot;, through [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''Yauna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindner|first1=Rudi Paul|title=Explorations in Ottoman Prehistory|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=978-0-47209-507-0|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMUAfa3GFVQC&amp;q=yunan+yauna&amp;pg=PA19|quote=The name &quot;Yunan&quot; comes from Ionia; cf. Old Persian &quot;Yauna&quot; (...)|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word, &quot;Yavan&quot; (יוון) and the [[Sanskrit]] word &quot;''[[yavana]]''&quot;. The word was later adopted in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] as well as in other places.

Seymour's paternal grandfather had come to live in the East End of London after escaping the Czarist [[pogrom]]s when he was 14.

Seymour was educated at [[Tring Park School for the Performing Arts]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. She chose the screen name Jane Seymour, after the English queen [[Jane Seymour]], because it seemed more saleable.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; One of Seymour's notable features is [[heterochromia]], making her right eye brown and her left eye green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/g2844/celebrities-with-heterochromia-different-colored-eyes/|title=9 Famous People Whose Eyes Are Two Different Colors|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
In 1969, Seymour appeared uncredited in her first film, [[Richard Attenborough]]'s ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]''. In 1970, Seymour appeared in her first major film role in the war drama ''The Only Way''. She played Lillian Stein, a Jewish woman seeking shelter from [[Nazi]] persecution. In 1973, she gained her first major television role as Emma Callon in the successful 1970s series ''[[The Onedin Line]]''. During this time, she appeared as female lead Prima in the two-part television miniseries ''Frankenstein: The True Story''. She also appeared as [[Winston Churchill]]'s girlfriend Pamela Plowden in ''Young Winston'', produced by her father-in-law Richard Attenborough.

In 1973, Seymour achieved international fame in her role as [[Bond girl]] [[Solitaire (James Bond)|Solitaire]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''. IGN ranked her as 10th in a Top 10 Bond Babes list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Bond Babes |work=IGN Entertainment |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/746/746292p1.html |access-date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Seymour was cast as Princess Farah in ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'', the third part of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s ''[[Sinbad]]'' trilogy. The film was not released until its [[stop motion]] animation sequences had been completed in 1977. In 1978, she appeared as [[Serina (Battlestar Galactica)|Serina]] in the ''[[Saga of a Star World|Battlestar Galactica]]'' film, and in the first five episodes of the television series. Seymour returned to the big screen in the comedy ''[[Oh Heavenly Dog]]'' opposite [[Chevy Chase]].

[[File:Jane Seymour (1988) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Seymour at the Emmy Awards, 1988]]
In 1980, Seymour played the role on stage of Constanze in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'', opposite [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] and [[Tim Curry]] as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. The play premiered on Broadway in 1980, ran for 1,181 performances and was nominated for seven Tony Awards, of which it won five.

Also in 1980, Seymour was given the role of young theatre actress Elise McKenna in the period romance ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]''. Though the film was made with a markedly limited budget, the role enticed Seymour with a character she felt she knew. The effort was a decided break from her earlier work, and marked the start of her friendship with co-star [[Christopher Reeve]].

In 1981, she appeared in the television film ''[[East of Eden (miniseries)|East of Eden]]'', based on [[East of Eden (novel)|the novel]] by [[John Steinbeck]]. Her portrayal of main antagonist [[Cathy Ames]] won her a [[Golden Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29175|title=Award Search Jane Seymour|publisher=HOLLYWOOD FOREIGN PRESS ASSOCIATION|access-date=7 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118193740/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29175|archive-date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, she appeared in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982 film)|The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' with [[Anthony Andrews]] and her ''Amadeus'' costar Ian McKellen. In 1984, Seymour appeared nude in the film ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'', co-starring [[Tom Selleck]], but the film was a box office flop. In 1987, Seymour was the subject of a pictorial in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, although she did not pose nude.

In 1988, Seymour got the female lead in the 12-part television miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance (miniseries)|War and Remembrance]]'', the continued story from the miniseries ''[[The Winds of War (miniseries)|The Winds of War]]''. She played Natalie Henry, an American Jewish woman trapped in Europe during [[World War II]]. That same year, she won an [[Emmy Award]] for playing [[Maria Callas]] in the television movie ''[[Onassis: The Richest Man in the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19880829&amp;id=4tFKAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=840,7171673&amp;hl=en |title=Fox, Kiley Win Best Actor Awards |work=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date=1988-08-29 |access-date=2018-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/jane-seymour|title=Jane Seymour – Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the [[French Revolution]], Seymour appeared in the television film ''[[La Révolution française (film)|La révolution française]]'', filmed in both French and English. Seymour appeared as the doomed French queen, [[Marie Antoinette]]; the actress's two children, Katherine and Sean, appeared as the queen's children.

[[File:Jane Seymour Emmy Awards 1994.jpg|thumb|upright|Seymour at the Emmy Awards, 1994]]
In the 1990s, Seymour earned popular and critical praise for her role as [[Michaela A. Quinn|Dr. Michaela &quot;Mike&quot; Quinn]] in the television series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' and its television sequels (1993–2001). Her work on the series earned her a second [[Golden Globe Award]]. While working on the series ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'', she met her fourth husband, actor-director [[James Keach]].

In the 2000s, Seymour continued to work primarily in television. In 2004 and 2005, she made six guest appearances in the [[WB Network]] series, ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', playing Genevieve Teague, the wealthy, scheming mother of Jason Teague ([[Jensen Ackles]]). In 2005, Seymour returned to the big screen in the comedy ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', playing Kathleen Cleary, wife of fictional [[Secretary of the Treasury|United States Secretary of the Treasury]] William Cleary, played by [[Christopher Walken]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Jane Seymour 2010 Oscars.jpg|thumb|Jane Seymour at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] in 2010]]
Seymour has been married and divorced four times. Her first marriage, to [[Michael Attenborough]], the son of film actor and director [[Richard Attenborough]], was from 1971 to 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference&quot;/&gt; to be followed by marriage to Attenborough's friend Geoffrey Planer from 1977 to 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, Seymour married David Flynn. This marriage produced two children: actress Katherine Flynn, born on 7 February 1982; and Sean Flynn, born 31 July 1985. Flynn had involved her in the housing market, an involvement which left her &quot;completely beyond bankrupt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.todayactress.com|title=From Today Actress Bond Girl To Medicine Woman: Jane Seymour's Big Break}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference&quot;/&gt; The following year, Seymour married actor [[James Keach]]. Together they had twins, John Stacy and Kristopher Steven, born 30 November 1995, and named after family friends [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Christopher Reeve]], and James's brother, actor [[Stacy Keach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide&quot;/&gt;

In February 2005, Seymour became a naturalised citizen of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-02-11-seymour-citizen_x.htm &quot;British-born actress Jane Seymour becomes a U.S. citizen.&quot;] ''Associated Press'' (11 February 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour is a celebrity ambassador for [[Childhelp]], a national non-profit organisation dedicated to helping victims of [[child abuse]] and [[Child neglect|neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Childhelp|work=Childhelp|url=http://www.childhelp.org/pages/about|access-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022502/http://www.childhelp.org/pages/about|archive-date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she sponsored a children's Art Pillow contest as part of the Jane Seymour Collection, with the proceeds going to Childhelp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actress Jane Seymour Sponsors National Art Competition to Help Abused and Neglected Children |work=Childhelp |url=http://www.childhelp.org/press-releases/entry/actress-jane-seymour-sponsors-national-art-competition-to-help-abused-and-n |access-date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2013, it was announced that Seymour was divorcing Keach.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffpost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Seymour, James Keach: Actress Opens Up About Divorce On 'The View' |work=Huffington Post |date=18 April 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/jane-seymour-james-keach-_n_3111069.html |access-date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce was finalized in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/12/16/jane-seymour-james-keach-divorce-finalized/|title=Jane Seymour, James Keach's divorce finalized|work=[[Fox News]]|date=16 December 2015|access-date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, she posed for ''Playboy'' for a third time, becoming at the age of 67 the oldest woman to be photographed for the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/becoming-jane-seymour|title=Becoming Jane: The Iconic Actress is Heating Up Television Once Again (and She Knows It)|website=Playboy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221202328/http://www.playboy.com/articles/becoming-jane-seymour|archive-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Playboy'' interview, Seymour revealed that she briefly quit acting after being sexually harassed by an unnamed [[film producer]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/21/jane-seymour-poses-for-playboy-recalls-how-almost-quit-acting-after-being-sexually-harassed.html|title=Jane Seymour poses for Playboy, recalls how she almost quit acting after being sexually harassed|first=Stephanie|last=Nolasco|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooney |first=Samantha |url=http://time.com/5170560/jane-seymour-sexual-harassment/ |title=Jane Seymour Says She Quit Hollywood After Being Sexually Harassed by a Producer |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2018-02-22 |access-date=2018-03-23 }}after earlier referring to this in her 1986 book Jane Seymours Guide to romantic Living&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and fashion careers==
In the 1980s, Seymour began a parallel career as a writer of self-help and inspirational books, including ''Jane Seymour's Guide to Romantic Living'' (1986), ''Two at a Time: Having Twins'' (2002), ''Remarkable Changes'' (2003), and ''[[Among Angels (book)|Among Angels]]'' (2010). She also co-wrote several children's books, with her then-husband [[James Keach]], for the ''This One 'N That One'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmreference&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, Seymour appeared at Fashion Aid, a one-time fashion show fundraiser held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. An event organised by [[Bob Geldof]] to raise funds for the ongoing Ethiopian famine, the finale of the show saw her partake in a faux matrimonial ceremony with [[Freddie Mercury]]. Seymour wore a white lace wedding dress that was designed by [[David Emanuel (fashion designer)|David]] and [[Elizabeth Emanuel]] – who had previously created [[Wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer|Princess Diana's wedding gown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remember when Freddie Mercury had a fake wedding? |url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/a22885382/freddie-mercury-fashion-fake-wedding-jane-seymour/ |access-date=17 April 2019 |agency=Cr fashion book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Seymour replaced [[Selina Scott]] as the new face of fashion label [[Country Casuals|CC]] (formerly known as Country Casuals) under the [[Austin Reed (retailer)|Austin Reed]] banner of retailers.&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pyle |first=Ally |title=The New Face of CC |magazine=Vogue |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2008/03/19/the-new-face-of-cc |access-date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The CC Brand Country Casuals |work=CC |url=http://www.ccfashion.co.uk/ |access-date=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise in 2008, Seymour teamed up with and designed the &quot;Open Heart Collection&quot; for [[Kay Jewelers]], which promoted it with the advice, &quot;Keep your heart open, and love will ''always'' find its way in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janeseymour.com/contact-adirondack/|title=Jane Seymour Biography|website=Jane Seymour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning that year, she saw to it that she would always be wearing one of the collection's necklaces whenever seen in public while not in character for any of her acting performances. In the same year, Seymour also wrote and published the books ''Open Hearts: If Your Heart Is Open, love Will Always Find Its Way In'' and ''Open Hearts Family.''

A 2.08-carat cushion-cut fancy vivid blue diamond in an 18-karat rose-gold-plated platinum setting was named The Jane Seymour in her honour by World of Diamonds Group, who had mined it in Russia, cut and set it. The ring was presented to Seymour in April 2016 in Singapore while she was there to star in ''[[The Vortex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishtheatreplayhouse.com/vortex.html |title=The Vortex |work=britishtheatreplayhouse.com |publisher=British Theatre Playhouse |access-date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewellerymonthly.com/the-jane-seymour-presented-by-world-of-diamonds/ |title=The Jane Seymour Presented by World of Diamonds |work=jewellerymonthly.com |publisher=Jewellery Monthly |access-date=30 July 2016|date=7 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peak&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thepeakmagazine.com.sg/2016/04/actress-jane-seymour-is-grace-in-blue/ | title=Vortex actress Jane Seymour gets warm Singapore welcome | publisher=SPH Magazines | work=thepeakmagazine.com.sg | date=29 April 2016 | access-date=26 July 2016 | author=Chen, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

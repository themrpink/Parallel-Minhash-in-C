[[Thomas Newman]]'s score was recorded in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weinraub&quot;/&gt; He used mainly percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes.&lt;ref name=&quot;burlingame&quot;/&gt; Newman &quot;favored pulse, rhythm, and color over melody&quot;, making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created. He built each cue around &quot;small, endlessly repeating phrases&quot;—often, the only variety through a &quot;thinning of the [[texture (music)|texture]] for eight [[bar (music)|bars]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;&gt;Torniainen, James (February 2000). &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

Maslin felt that Mendes directed with &quot;terrific visual flair&quot;, saying his minimalist style balanced &quot;the mordant and bright&quot; and that he evoked the &quot;delicate, eroticized power-playing vignettes&quot; of his theater work.&lt;ref name=&quot;maslin&quot;/&gt; Jackson said Mendes' theatrical roots rarely showed, and that the &quot;most remarkable&quot; aspect was that Spacey's performance did not overshadow the film. He said that Mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble's strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot;/&gt; McCarthy believed ''American Beauty'' a &quot;stunning card of introduction&quot; for film débutantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes' &quot;sure hand&quot; was &quot;as precise and controlled&quot; as his theater work. McCarthy cited Hall's involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was &quot;unsurpassed&quot; at conveying the themes of a work.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccarthy&quot;/&gt; Turan agreed that Mendes' choice of collaborators was &quot;shrewd&quot;, naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that ''American Beauty'' may have benefited from Mendes' inexperience, as his &quot;anything's possible daring&quot; made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes' accomplishment was to &quot;capture and enhance [the] duality&quot; of Ball's script—the simultaneously &quot;caricatured&amp;nbsp;... and painfully real&quot; characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;turan&quot;/&gt; Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball's choices, admitted the film showed off their &quot;considerable talents&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hentzi 50&quot;/&gt;

Turan cited Ball's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;turan&quot;/&gt; McCarthy said the script was &quot;as fresh and distinctive&quot; as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue &quot;tart&quot; and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were &quot;deeply drawn&quot;. One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked &quot;hoary [[Sigmund Freud#Ideas|Freudianism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccarthy&quot;/&gt; Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a &quot;wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy&quot;. He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with &quot;unexpected nuance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot;/&gt; Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense.&lt;ref name=&quot;hentzi 50&quot;/&gt; McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating &quot;ironic counterpoint[s]&quot; to the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccarthy&quot;/&gt; Hentzi concluded that ''American Beauty'' was &quot;vital but uneven&quot;; he felt the film's examination of &quot;the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives&quot; was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside &quot;the most enduring literary treatments&quot; of the theme, such as ''[[Lolita]]''. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were &quot;hackneyed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hentzi 46&quot;/&gt; McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a &quot;starting point&quot; from which to tell its &quot;subtle and acutely judged tale&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccarthy&quot;/&gt; Maslin agreed; she said that while it &quot;takes aim at targets that are none too fresh&quot;, and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own &quot;corrosive novelty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;maslin&quot;/&gt; Ebert awarded ''American Beauty'' four stars out of four,&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot;/&gt; and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex, and surprising, concluding it was &quot;a hell of a picture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;turan&quot;/&gt;

A few months after the film's release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press,&lt;ref name=&quot;backlash&quot;/&gt; and the years since have seen its critical regard wane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joel|last=Brown|date=June 22, 2001|title=The Tube Has Few Intriguing Choices to Offer|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lowenstein 271-272&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' named ''American Beauty'' as one of 20 &quot;most overrated movies of all time&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=September 2005|title=The 20 most overrated movies of all time|magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|volume=19|issue=1|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, &quot;I thought some of it was entirely justified—it was a little overpraised at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lowenstein 271-272&quot;/&gt; As the 20th anniversary of the film's release approached, ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Matthew Jacobs noted that the film's reputation had continued to decline to the point of making it a &quot;widespread punchline&quot; by 2019. &quot;What was once a provocative masterstroke now looks like retrograde hooey&quot;, he observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPost 20th anniversary story&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |title=The Steady Cultural Demise Of 'American Beauty' |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-beauty-legacy-20-years-later_n_5d5c344fe4b0d1e1136902be |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=September 9, 2019 |access-date=September 10, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
{{main|List of accolades received by American Beauty}}
''American Beauty'' was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists.&lt;ref name=&quot;topsy&quot;&gt;Lyman, Rick (March 27, 2000). &quot;Early Oscars to Caine, Jolie and 'Topsy-Turvy{{'&quot;}}. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] and the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] named the film the best of 1999, but while the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] recognized ''American Beauty'',&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/180738/American-Beauty/awards &quot;American Beauty (1999)&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524173223/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/180738/American-Beauty/awards |date=May 24, 2013 }}. New York Times Online. Retrieved January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; they gave their top awards to other films.&lt;ref name=&quot;topsy&quot; /&gt; By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested ''American Beauty'' was the underdog in the race for Best Picture;&lt;ref name=&quot;backlash&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|date=January 8, 2001|accessdate=September 6, 2020|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/awards/road-to-best-pic-an-american-dream-1117791364/amp/|title=Road to best pic: An 'American' dream|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, ''American Beauty'' won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Film]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;

As the nominations for the [[72nd Academy Awards]] approached, a frontrunner had not emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;topsy&quot; /&gt; DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for ''American Beauty'' five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although [[advertising mail|direct mail]] campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in &quot;casual, comfortable settings&quot; in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] the previous year, ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', lost to ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to &quot;think small&quot;. Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of ''American Beauty'', to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]. [[Dale Olson]] advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in [[Beverly Hills]]—home to many voters—in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen ''American Beauty'' to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took writer Alan Ball to the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of [[Anthony Hopkins]], meeting several voters who were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy (March 28, 2000). &quot;Aggressive campaign may have helped 'Beauty's' win&quot;. ''[[The Journal Gazette]]''. (Reprinted from the ''Los Angeles Times''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2000, ''American Beauty'' was nominated for eight Academy Awards; its closest rivals, ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', received seven nominations each. In March 2000, the major industry labor organizations{{refn|The [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the [[Producers Guild of America]], the [[American Society of Cinematographers]], and the [[Directors Guild of America]]&lt;ref name=&quot;topsy&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} all awarded their top honors to ''American Beauty''; perceptions had shifted—the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;topsy&quot; /&gt; ''American Beauty''{{'}}s closest rival for Best Picture was still ''The Cider House Rules'', from [[Miramax]]. Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns; DreamWorks bought 38% more advertising space in ''Variety'' than Miramax.&lt;ref&gt;Karger, Dave (March 10, 2000). &quot;Apple Juice&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly'' (530).&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2000, ''American Beauty'' won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Spacey), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, Rick (March 28, 2000).

[[File:Gyroscope operation.gif|thumb|right|A gyroscope in operation. Note the freedom of rotation in all three axes. The rotor will maintain its spin axis direction regardless of the orientation of the outer frame.]]

A '''gyroscope''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] γῦρος ''gûros'', &quot;circle&quot; and σκοπέω ''skopéō'', &quot;to look&quot;) is a device used for measuring or maintaining [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] and [[angular velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gyroscope|website=Oxford Dictionaries|title=Gyroscope|accessdate=4 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003851/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gyroscope|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/Gyroscope/ Gyroscope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430090205/http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/Gyroscope/ |date=30 April 2008 }}&quot; by Sándor Kabai, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the [[conservation of angular momentum]].

Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist, such as the microchip-packaged [[Vibrating structure gyroscope#MEMS gyroscopes|MEMS gyroscopes]] found in electronic devices (sometimes called '''gyrometers'''), solid-state [[ring laser gyroscope|ring lasers]], [[fibre optic gyroscope]]s, and the extremely sensitive [[quantum gyroscope]].&lt;ref&gt; Tao W, Liu T, Zheng R, Feng H.

Applications of gyroscopes include [[inertial navigation system]]s, such as in the [[Hubble Telescope]], or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in [[gyrotheodolite]]s to maintain direction in tunnel mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/may/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-tunnels |title=20 things you didn't know about tunnels |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |date=April 29, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615212002/http://discovermagazine.com/2009/may/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-tunnels |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyroscopes can be used to construct [[gyrocompass]]es, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance system.

MEMS gyroscopes are popular in some consumer electronics, such as smartphones.

== Description and diagram ==
[[File:Gyroscope wheel-text.png|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of a gyro wheel. Reaction arrows about the output axis (blue) correspond to forces applied about the input axis (green), and vice versa.]]

A gyroscope is an instrument, consisting of a wheel mounted into two or three [[gimbal]]s providing pivoted supports, for allowing the wheel to rotate about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. 

In the case of a gyroscope with '''two gimbals''', the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The second gimbal, inner gimbal, is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.

The axle of the spinning wheel defines the spin axis. The rotor is constrained to spin about an axis, which is always perpendicular to the axis of the inner gimbal. So the rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and its axis possesses two.
The wheel responds to a force applied to the input axis by a reaction force to the output axis.

The behaviour of a gyroscope can be most easily appreciated by consideration of the front wheel of a bicycle. If the wheel is leaned away from the vertical so that the top of the wheel moves to the left, the forward rim of the wheel also turns to the left. In other words, rotation on one axis of the turning wheel produces rotation of the third axis.

A '''gyroscope flywheel''' will roll or resist about the output axis depending upon whether the output gimbals are of a free or fixed configuration. Examples of some free-output-gimbal devices would be the [[attitude control|attitude reference]] gyroscopes used to sense or measure the pitch, roll and yaw attitude angles in a spacecraft or aircraft.

The centre of gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position. The rotor simultaneously spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two other axes, and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point (except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin). Some gyroscopes have mechanical equivalents substituted for one or more of the elements. For example, the spinning rotor may be suspended in a fluid, instead of being mounted in gimbals. A [[control moment gyroscope]] (CMG) is an example of a fixed-output-gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force.

In some special cases, the outer gimbal (or its equivalent) may be omitted so that the rotor has only two degrees of freedom. In other cases, the centre of gravity of the rotor may be offset from the axis of oscillation, and thus the centre of gravity of the rotor and the centre of suspension of the rotor may not coincide.

Essentially, a gyroscope is a [[top]] combined with a pair of [[gimbal]]s. Tops were invented in many different civilizations, including classical Greece, Rome, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=327 |title=Brief History of Gyroscopes |last1=Range|first1=Shannon K'doah |last2=Mullins|first2=Jennifer |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710113230/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=327 |archivedate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these were not utilized as instruments.

The first known apparatus similar to a gyroscope (the &quot;Whirling Speculum&quot; or &quot;Serson's Speculum&quot;) was invented by [[John Serson]] in 1743. It was used as a level, to locate the horizon in foggy or misty conditions.

The first instrument used more like an actual gyroscope was made by [[Johann Bohnenberger]] of Germany, who first wrote about it in 1817. At first he called it the &quot;Machine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johann G. F.

In the 1860s, the advent of electric motors made it possible for a gyroscope to spin indefinitely; this led to the first prototype [[heading indicator]]s, and a rather more complicated device, the [[gyrocompass]]. The first functional gyrocompass was patented in 1904 by German inventor [[Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe and Friedrich von Schirach, [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=DE&amp;NR=182855C&amp;KC=C&amp;FT=D&amp;date=&amp;DB=&amp;locale= &quot;Kreiselapparat&quot;] (Gyroscope) Deutsches Reichspatent no. 182855 (filed: 27 March 1904 ; issued: 2 April 1907).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Elmer Sperry]] followed with his own design later that year, and other nations soon realized the military importance of the invention&amp;mdash;in an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military power&amp;mdash;and created their own gyroscope industries. The [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] quickly expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well, and other gyroscope developers followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Donald.

In 1917, the Chandler Company of Indianapolis, created the &quot;Chandler gyroscope&quot;, a toy gyroscope with a pull string and pedestal. Chandler continued to produce the toy until the company was purchased by TEDCO inc. in 1982. The chandler toy is still produced by TEDCO today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/02/tedco_toys_cool_company_history_gre.html |title=TEDCO Toys - Cool company history, great science kits |last=Anon |work=TEDCO Toys company website |publisher=O'Reilly Media Inc |accessdate=23 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309071225/https://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/02/tedco_toys_cool_company_history_gre.html |archivedate=9 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first several decades of the 20th century, other inventors attempted (unsuccessfully) to use gyroscopes as the basis for early [[flight recorder|black box]] navigational systems by creating a stable platform from which accurate acceleration measurements could be performed (in order to bypass the need for star sightings to calculate position). Similar principles were later employed in the development of [[inertial navigation system]]s for [[ballistic missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Donald.

During World War II, the gyroscope became the prime component for aircraft and anti-aircraft gun sights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=PiEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=86&amp;query=destroyer+escort The Little Top That Aims a Gun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710151152/http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=PiEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=86&amp;query=destroyer+escort |date=10 July 2011 }} by Gold Sanders, ''[[Popular Science]]'', July 1945&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the race to miniaturize gyroscopes for guided missiles and weapons navigation systems resulted in the development and manufacturing of so-called '''midget gyroscopes''' that weighed less than {{convert|3|oz|g}} and had a diameter of approximately {{convert|1|in|cm}}. Some of these miniaturized gyroscopes could reach a speed of 24,000 revolutions per minute in less than 10 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=1 March 1954|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=5 November 2017|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032244/https://books.google.com/books?id=nNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyroscopes continue to be an engineering challenge. For example, the axle bearings have to be extremely accurate. A small amount of friction is deliberately introduced to the bearings, since otherwise an accuracy of better than &lt;math&gt;10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; of an inch (2.5 nm) would be required.{{sfn|Feynman|Gottlieb|Leighton|2013|pp=148-149}}

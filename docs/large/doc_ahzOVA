A variety of visual effects were used to incorporate Tom Hanks into archive footage with various historical figures and events.]]

[[Ken Ralston]] and his team at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] were responsible for the film's visual effects. Using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEyes1&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|time=12:29|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter [[Lip sync#In films|lip-syncing]] for the new dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;BookChanges&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Bart|title=In 'Forrest Gump,' Historical Figures Speak for Themselves|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24184772.html?dids=24184772:24184772&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+08%2C+1994&amp;author=Bart+Mills.+Special+to+the+Tribune.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=IN+%60FORREST+GUMP%2C%27+HISTORICAL+FIGURES+SPEAK+FOR+THEMSELVES&amp;pqatl=google|format=Fee required|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 8, 1994|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques as [[chroma key]], [[image warping]], [[morphing]], and [[rotoscoping]], Hanks was integrated into it.

In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba away from an incoming [[napalm]] attack. To create the effect, [[stunt actor]]s were initially used for [[compositing]] purposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the actors were digitally added to appear just in front of the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDVietnam&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Seeing is Believing: The Visual Effects of Forrest Gump-Vietnam)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGI removal of actor [[Gary Sinise]]'s legs, after his character had them amputated, was achieved by wrapping his legs with a blue fabric, which later facilitated the work of the &quot;roto-paint&quot; team to paint out his legs from every single frame. At one point, while hoisting himself into his [[wheelchair]], his legs are used for support.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDLegs&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Seeing is Believing: The Visual Effects of Forrest Gump-Lt. Dan's Legs)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene where Forrest spots Jenny at a [[Peace movement|peace rally]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]] in Washington, D.C., required visual effects to create the large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 [[Extra (actor)|extras]] were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEnhanReal&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Seeing is Believing: The Visual Effects of Forrest Gump-Enhancing Reality)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a different [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|quadrant]] away from the camera. With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.&lt;ref name=&quot;HankSign&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEnhanReal&quot; /&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
The film received generally positive reviews. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 71% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.51/10, based on a 103 reviews. The website's critical consensus states, &quot;''Forrest Gump'' may be an overly sentimental film with a somewhat problematic message, but its sweetness and charm are usually enough to approximate true depth and grace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RTFresh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/forrest_gump/|title=''Forrest Gump'' (1994)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 4, 2020|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the website [[Metacritic]], the film earned a rating of 82 out of 100 based on 20&amp;nbsp;reviews by mainstream critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/forrest-gump |title=''Forrest Gump'' Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-cinemascore-matters-box-office-225563|title=Why CinemaScore Matters for Box Office|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was commended by several critics. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, &quot;I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.

Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a percent share of the film's ''gross'' receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGLostMoney&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HanksPoints&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Charles E.|title=Accounting is like a box of chocolates: A lesson in cost behavior|journal=Journal of Accounting Education|doi=10.1016/S0748-5751(97)00008-0|pages=307â€“318|volume=15|issue=3|date=Summer 1997}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 1, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoMention&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Calender Goes to the Oscars Analysis Life Is Like a Box of Oscars But Statues Are Divvied Up, Quite Fittingly|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/22753498.html?dids=22753498:22753498&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+28%2C+1995&amp;author=KENNETH+TURAN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Calender+Goes+to+the+Oscars+Analysis+Life+Is+Like+a+Box+of+Oscars+But+Statues+Are+Divvied+Up%2C+Quite+Fittingly&amp;pqatl=google|format=Fee required|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 28, 1995|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groom's dispute with Paramount was later effectively resolved after Groom declared he was satisfied with Paramount's explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to another of his books, ''[[Gump and Co.|Gump &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Gump-Author-Settles-Fight-With-Studio-3031365.php &quot;'Gump' Author Settles Fight With Studio&quot;].

''Forrest Gump'' was first released on [[VHS]] on April 27, 1995 and on [[Laserdisc]] the following day. The laserdisc was released without chapters, requiring the film be watched start to finish. Film magazines of the period stated this was at the request of Zemeckis who wanted viewers to enjoy the film in its entirety. It was released in a two-disc [[DVD]] set on August 28, 2001. Special features included director and producer commentaries, production featurettes, and screen tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpecialFeatures&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowman|first=Rob|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EE3576468090812&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D|format=Fee required|title=Video Enchanted Forrest the Much-beloved &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; Arrives on DVD with Sweetness Intact|work=[[Beacon Journal]]|date=August 28, 2001|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] in November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;BluRayRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Schweiger |first=Arlen |url=http://www.electronichouse.com/article/paramount_saves_top_titles_for_blu_ray_sapphire_treatment/C157 |title=Paramount Saves Top Titles for Blu-ray 'Sapphire' Treatment |work=Electronic House |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710181200/http://www.electronichouse.com/article/paramount_saves_top_titles_for_blu_ray_sapphire_treatment/C157 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Paramount/Disc_Announcements/paramount-preps-forrest-gump-for-4k-ultra-hd-bluray/41197|title=Paramount Preps 'Forrest Gump' for 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray {{!}} High-Def Digest|website=highdefdigest.com|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2019 Paramount Pictures released a newly remastered two-disc Blu-ray that contains bonus content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blue-ray |first1=Webmaster |title=Forrest Gump 25th Anniversary |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Forrest-Gump-Blu-ray/238653/ |website=Blu-ray.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, ''Forrest Gump'' was selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/atlanta-movies/forrest-gump-hannibal-lecter-1277319.html?cxntlid=thbz_hm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111160501/http://www.accessatlanta.com/atlanta-movies/forrest-gump-hannibal-lecter-1277319.html?cxntlid=thbz_hm |archivedate=January 11, 2012|title=Forrest Gump, Hannibal Lecter join film registry|author=Nuckols, Ben|newspaper=Associated Press|publisher=Cox Newspapers|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Registry said that the film was &quot;honored for its technological innovations (the digital insertion of Gump seamlessly into vintage archival [[footage]]), its resonance within the culture that has elevated Gump (and what he represents in terms of American innocence) to the status of folk hero, and its attempt to engage both playfully and seriously with contentious aspects of the era's traumatic history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2011/11-240.html|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|publisher=Library of Congress|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
&lt;!-- NO ORIGINAL RESEARCH. PUBLISHED CRITIQUES ONLY --&gt;

=== Feather ===

{{Quote box |width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=&quot;I don't want to sound like a bad version of 'the child within'. But the childlike innocence of Forrest Gump is what we all once had. It's an emotional journey. You laugh and cry. It does what movies are supposed to do: make you feel alive.&quot;|source=â€”producer [[Wendy Finerman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldTime&quot; /&gt;}}

Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of ''The New York Times'' noted several suggestions made about the feather: &quot;Does the white feather symbolize [[The Unbearable Lightness of Being|the unbearable lightness of being]]? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LyallFeather&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |title=It's 'Forrest Gump' vs. Harrumph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/weekinreview/it-s-forrest-gump-vs-harrumph.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 31, 1994 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801025155/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/weekinreview/it-s-forrest-gump-vs-harrumph.html |archivedate=August 1, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanks interpreted the feather as: &quot;Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEyes3&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|time=23:27|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: &quot;It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEyes4&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|time=23:57|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: &quot;It can mean so many things to so many different people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDEyes5&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|time=26:29|date=August 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Gump Roast]]&quot; opening scene, [[Homer Simpson]] is shown on a park bench, like Forrest Gump. Homer gets stung in both his eyes by the acute tip of the gently falling feather.

=== Political interpretations ===

Hanks states that &quot;the film is non-political and thus non-judgmental.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldTime&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, CNN's ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' debated in 1994 whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of the [[counterculture]] movement of the 1960s. Thomas Byers called it &quot;an aggressively conservative film&quot; in a ''Modern Fiction Studies'' article.&lt;ref name=&quot;ByersAggCon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byers|first=Thomas B.|title=History Re-Membered: Forrest Gump, Postfeminist Masculinity, and the Burial of the Counterculture|journal=Modern Fiction Studies|pages=419â€“444|volume=42|issue=2|year=1996|doi=10.1353/mfs.1995.0102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=All over the political map, people have been calling Forrest their own. But, ''Forrest Gump'' isn't about politics or conservative values. It's about humanity, it's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.|source=â€”producer [[Steve Tisch]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ByersAggCon&quot; /&gt;}}
It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of countercultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EbertReview&quot; /&gt; Jennifer Hyland Wang argues in a ''Cinema Journal'' article that Jenny's death to an unnamed virus &quot;symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade&quot; in the 1960s. She also notes that the film's screenwriter [[Eric Roth]] developed the screenplay from the novel and transferred to Jenny &quot;all of Gump's flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the 1960s and 1970s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangStruggle&quot; /&gt;

Other commentators believe the film forecast the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]] and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leader [[Newt Gingrich]]'s traditional, conservative values. Jennifer Hyland Wang observes that the film idealizes the 1950s, as made evident by the lack of &quot;whites only&quot; signs in Gump's Southern childhood, and envisions the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion. She argues that this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jennifer|title=&quot;A Struggle of Contending Stories&quot;: Race, Gender, and Political Memory in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;|journal=Cinema Journal|date=Spring 2000|volume=39|issue=3|pages=92â€“115|doi=10.1353/cj.2000.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang argues that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a &quot;traditional version of recent history&quot; to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangStruggle&quot; /&gt; Presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] stated that the film's message was &quot;no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody's reach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WangStruggle&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, ''[[National Review]]'' included ''Forrest Gump'' in its list of the &quot;Best 100 Conservative Movies&quot; of all time,&lt;ref name=&quot;100ConMov&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Quillen|first=Ed|title=Why are modern conservatives so enchanted with Forrest Gump?|work=Denver Post|date=May 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked it number four on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRRanks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=John J. |title=The Best Conservative Movies |url=http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=YWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM= |url-status=dead |work=[[National Review]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026032717/http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=YWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM%3D |archivedate=October 26, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRRanks&quot; /&gt;

Professor James Burton at [[Salisbury University]] argues that conservatives claimed ''Forrest Gump'' as their own due less to the content of the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994. Burton claims that the film's content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasized family values and American values, epitomized in the book ''Hollywood vs. America''. He claims that this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed many different political interpretations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burton September 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=James Amos|title= Film, History and Cultural Memory: Cinematic Representations of Vietnam-Era America During the Culture Wars, 1987â€“1995|journal=PHD Thesis|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators see the conservative readings of ''Forrest Gump'' as indicating the death of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony rely on the assumption of the audience's historical knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burton September 2007&quot; /&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|Forrest Gump â€“ Original Motion Picture Score}}

The 32-song soundtrack from the film was released on July 6, 1994. With the exception of a lengthy suite from [[Alan Silvestri]]'s score, all the songs are previously released; the soundtrack includes songs from [[Elvis Presley]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[The Byrds]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Doors]], [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Buffalo Springfield]] among others. Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack: &quot;We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SongMood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Lynette|title=Songs Set the Mood for 'Gump'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SzcTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hOoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5648,4299465|work=[[Gainesville Sun]]|date=August 14, 1994|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-disc album has a variety of music from the 1950sâ€“1980s performed by American artists. According to Sill, this was due to Zemeckis' request, &quot;All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn't buy anything but American.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SongMood&quot; /&gt;

The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' album chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SongMood&quot; /&gt; The soundtrack went on to sell twelve&amp;nbsp;million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbumSell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topalbums.asp |title=Top Albums at the Recording Industry Association of America|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=July 1, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619214153/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topalbums.asp |archivedate = June 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscar-nominated [[Film score|score]] for the film was composed and conducted by [[Alan Silvestri]] and released on August 2, 1994.

== Novel sequel ==
{{Main|Gump and Co.}}

The screenplay for the sequel was written by [[Eric Roth]] in 2001. It is based on the original novel's sequel, ''[[Gump and Co.]]'' written by Winston Groom in 1995. Roth's script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school. After the [[September 11 attacks]], Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer &quot;relevant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;911Relevant&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=9/11 Killed the Forrest Gump Sequel |publisher=/Film |date=December 7, 2008 |url=https://slashfilm.com/2008/12/07/911-killed-the-forrest-gump-sequel/ |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109162417/http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/12/07/911-killed-the-forrest-gump-sequel/ |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, however, it was reported Paramount producers took another look at the screenplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007Sequel&quot;/&gt;

On the first page of the sequel novel, Forrest Gump tells readers &quot;Don't never let nobody make a movie of your life's story,&quot; and &quot;Whether they get it right or wrong, it doesn't matter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GumpCo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Groom|first=Winston|title=Gump &amp; Co.|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/gumpco00wins_0/page/1 1]|isbn=978-0-671-52264-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gumpco00wins_0/page/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter of the book suggests the real-life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest's storyline, and that Forrest got a lot of media attention as a result of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoviesBook&quot; /&gt; During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks and at the end of the novel in the film's release, including Gump going on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The David Letterman Show]]'' and attending the [[Academy Award]]s.

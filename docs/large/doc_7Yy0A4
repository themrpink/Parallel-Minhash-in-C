==Social activism==
While Bernstein was very well known for his music compositions and conducting, he was also known for his outspoken political views and his strong desire to further social change. His first aspirations for social change were made apparent in his producing (as a student) a recently banned opera, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', by [[Marc Blitzstein]], about the disparity between the working and upper class. His first opera, ''[[Trouble in Tahiti]]'', was dedicated to Blitzstein and has a strong social theme, criticizing American civilization and suburban upper-class life in particular. As he went on in his career, Bernstein would go on to fight for everything from the influences of &quot;American Music&quot; to the disarming of western nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Causes and Effecting Change | author=Bernstein:The Best of All Possible Worlds | url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/bernstein/leonardbernstein/essays/nr_socialactivist.html |url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224044931/http://www.carnegiehall.org/bernstein/leonardbernstein/essays/nr_socialactivist.html | archive-date=December 24, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many of his friends and colleagues, Bernstein had been involved in various left-wing causes and organizations since the 1940s. He was blacklisted by the [[US State Department]] and [[CBS]] in the early 1950s, but unlike others his career was not greatly affected, and he was never required to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].{{sfn|Seldes|2009|p={{page needed|date=August 2019}}}} His political life received substantial press coverage though in 1970, due to a gathering hosted at his Manhattan apartment at 895 [[Park Avenue]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/10/18/leonard-bernsteins-new-york/ &quot;Leonard Bernstein's New York&quot;] by Barbara Hoffman, ''[[New York Post]]'', October 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; on January 14, 1970. Bernstein and his wife held the event seeking to raise awareness and money for the defense of several members of the [[Black Panther Party]] against a variety of charges, especially the case of the [[Panther 21]].&lt;ref name=&quot;loc2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Radical Chic |url=http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/hopeforamerica/causesandcontroversies/polarization/ExhibitObjects/RadicalChic.aspx |work=Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=December 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725171227/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/hopeforamerica/causesandcontroversies/polarization/ExhibitObjects/RadicalChic.aspx |archive-date=July 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' initially covered the gathering as a [[Entertainment journalism|lifestyle]] item, but later posted an editorial harshly unfavorable to Bernstein following generally negative reaction to the widely publicized story.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt_false_note&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=False Note on Black Panthers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag_html&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfe |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Wolfe |id=&quot;Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers&quot; |url= https://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html |title=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction culminated in June 1970 with the appearance of &quot;[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers|Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's]]&quot;, an essay by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] featured on the cover of the magazine ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag1970&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf |title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's |last=Wolfe |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Wolfe |date=June 8, 1970 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article contrasted the Bernsteins' comfortable lifestyle in one of the world's most expensive neighborhoods with the [[anti-establishment]] politics of the Black Panthers.

Bernstein was named in the book ''[[Red Channels]]: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television'' (1950) as a Communist along with [[Aaron Copland]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Artie Shaw]] and other prominent figures of the performing arts. ''Red Channels'' was issued by the right-wing journal ''Counterattack'' and was edited by Vincent Hartnett, who was later found to have libeled and defamed the noted radio personality [[John Henry Faulk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bernstein-copland-seeger-and-others-are-named-as-communists?et_cid=76800153&amp;et_rid=1221598356&amp;linkid=http%3a%2f%2fwww.history.com%2fthis-day-in-history%2fbernstein-copland-seeger-and-others-are-named-as-communists |title=Bernstein, Copland, Seeger and others are named as Communists |work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fear On Trial&quot; by [[John Henry Faulk]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Jury Returns&quot; by [[Louis Nizer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Among the many awards Bernstein earned throughout his life, one allowed him to make one of his philanthropic dreams a reality. He had for a long time wanted to develop an international school to help promote the integration of arts into education. When he won the [[Praemium Imperiale]], Japan Arts Association award for lifetime achievement in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Temple Emanuel | url=http://www.emanuelnyc.org/composer.php?composer_id=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; he used the $100,000 that came with the award to build such a school in Nashville, that would strive to teach teachers how to better integrate music, dance, and theater into the school system which was &quot;not working&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Harrison | first=Eric | title=The maestro's legacy reverberates in Nashville : Leonard Bernstein's dream of creating a center that integrates the arts and the classroom is in full swing | location=Los Angeles | newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=Oct 11, 2011 | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-09/news/mn-22033_1_leonard-bernstein | date=August 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the school was not able to open until shortly after Bernstein's death.

==Influence and characteristics as a conductor==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}
[[File:Leonard Bernstein 1971.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leonard Bernstein in rehearsal of his &quot;Mass&quot;, 1971]]
Bernstein was one of the major figures in orchestral conducting in the second half of the 20th century. He was held in high regard amongst many musicians, including the members of the Vienna Philharmonic, evidenced by his honorary membership; the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], of which he was president; and the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], with which he appeared regularly as guest conductor. He was probably the main conductor from the 1960s onwards who acquired a sort of superstar status similar to that of [[Herbert von Karajan]], although unlike Karajan he conducted relatively little opera and part of Bernstein's fame was based on his role as a composer. As the first American-born music director of the New York Philharmonic, his rise to prominence was a factor in overcoming the perception of the time that the top conductors were necessarily trained in Europe.

Bernstein's conducting was characterized by extremes of emotion with the rhythmic pulse of the music conveyed visually through his balletic podium manner. Musicians often reported that his manner in rehearsal was the same as in concert. As he got older his performances tended to be overlaid to a greater extent with a personal expressiveness which often divided critical opinion. Extreme examples of this style can be found in his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of &quot;Nimrod&quot; from Elgar's ''[[Enigma Variations]]'' (1982), the end of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|9th Symphony]] (1985), and the finale of Tchaikovsky's ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Pathétique Symphony]]'' (1986), where in each case the tempos are well below those typically chosen.

Bernstein performed a wide repertoire from the Baroque era to the 20th century, although perhaps from the 1970s onwards he tended to focus more on music from the Romantic era. He was considered especially accomplished with the works of Gustav Mahler and with American composers in general, including [[George Gershwin]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Roy Harris]], [[William Schuman]], and of course himself. Some of his recordings of works by these composers would likely appear on many music critics' lists of recommended recordings. A list of his other well-thought-of recordings would include, among others, individual works from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Carl Nielsen|Nielsen]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Holmes | first=John L.|title=Conductors on Record | location= UK | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-313-22990-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His recordings of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (full-orchestra version) and ''[[An American in Paris]]'' for Columbia Records, released in 1959, are considered definitive by many, although Bernstein cut the ''Rhapsody'' slightly, and his more 'symphonic' approach with slower tempi is quite far from Gershwin's own conception of the piece, evident from his two recordings. ([[Oscar Levant]], [[Earl Wild]], and others come closer to Gershwin's own style.) Bernstein never conducted Gershwin's [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Piano Concerto in F]], or more than a few excerpts from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', although he did discuss the latter in his article ''Why Don't You Run Upstairs and Write a Nice Gershwin Tune?'', originally published in ''The New York Times'' and later reprinted in his 1959 book ''[[The Joy of Music]]''.

In addition to being an active conductor, Bernstein was an influential teacher of conducting. During his many years of teaching at Tanglewood and elsewhere, he directly taught or mentored many conductors who are performing now, including [[John Mauceri]], [[Marin Alsop]], [[Herbert Blomstedt]], [[Edo de Waart]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Paavo Järvi]], [[Eiji Oue]], [[Maurice Peress]], [[Seiji Ozawa]] (who made his American TV debut as the guest conductor on one of the ''Young People's Concerts''), [[Carl St.Clair]], [[Helmuth Rilling]], [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], and [[Jaap van Zweden]]. He also undoubtedly influenced the career choices of many American musicians who grew up watching his television programmes in the 1950s and 60s.

==Recordings==
[[File:P Kolbe-01 Bernstein 01.jpg|thumb|left|Audio recording for CBS of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 3]] by Danish composer [[Carl Nielsen]] in Copenhagen, 1965]]
Bernstein recorded extensively from the mid-1940s until just a few months before his death. Aside from those 1940s recordings, which were made for [[RCA Victor]], Bernstein recorded primarily for [[Columbia Masterworks Records]], especially when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic between 1958 and 1971. His typical pattern of recording at that time was to record major works in the studio immediately after they were presented in the orchestra's subscription concerts or on one of the ''Young People's Concerts'', with any spare time used to record short orchestral showpieces and similar works. Many of these performances were digitally remastered and reissued by [[Sony Classical Records]] (the successor to American Columbia/CBS Masterworks following Sony's 1990 acquisition of Columbia/CBS Records) between 1992 and 1993 as part of its 100 volume, 125-CD &quot;Royal Edition&quot;, as well as its 1997–2001 &quot;Bernstein Century&quot; series. The rights to Bernstein's 1940s RCA Victor recordings became fully owned by Sony following its 2008 acquisition of [[Bertelsmann Music Group]]'s (BMG), and now controls both the RCA Victor and Columbia archives. The complete Bernstein Columbia and RCA Victor catalog was reissued on CD in a three-volume series of box sets (released in 2010, 2014, and 2018, respectively) comprising a total of 198 discs under the mantle &quot;Leonard Bernstein Edition&quot;.

His later recordings (starting with Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' in 1972) were mostly made for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], though he would occasionally return to the Columbia label. Notable exceptions include recordings of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s ''[[Das Lied von der Erde|Song of the Earth]]'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 15 (Mozart)|15th piano concerto]] and [[Symphony No. 36 (Mozart)|&quot;Linz&quot; symphony]] with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] for [[Decca Records]] (1966); [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' and ''[[Harold in Italy]]'' (1976) for [[EMI]]; and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1981) for [[Philips Records]], a label that like Deutsche Grammophon was part of [[PolyGram]] at that time. Unlike his studio recordings for Columbia Masterworks, most of his later Deutsche Grammophon recordings were taken from live concerts (or edited together from several concerts with additional sessions to correct errors). Many replicate repertoire that he recorded in the 1950s and 60s.

In addition to his audio recordings, many of Bernstein's concerts from the 1970s onwards were recorded on motion picture film by the German film company [[Unitel GmbH &amp; Co.KG|Unitel]]. This included a complete cycle of the Mahler symphonies (with the Vienna Philharmonic and London Symphony Orchestra), as well as complete cycles of the Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann symphonies recorded at the same series of concerts as the audio recordings by Deutsche Grammophon. Many of these films appeared on [[LaserDisc]] and are now on DVD.

In total Bernstein was awarded 16 [[Grammys]] for his recordings in various categories, including several for posthumously released recordings. He was also awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Grammy]] in 1985.

==Influence and characteristics as a composer==
Bernstein was an eclectic composer whose music fused elements of jazz, Jewish music, theatre music and the work of earlier composers like [[Aaron Copland]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[George Gershwin]], and [[Marc Blitzstein]]. Some of his works, especially his score for ''[[West Side Story]]'', helped bridge the gap between classical and popular music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} His music was rooted in tonality but in some works like his ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Bernstein)|Kaddish Symphony]]'' and the opera ''[[A Quiet Place (opera)|A Quiet Place]]'' he mixed in [[Twelve-tone technique|12-tone]] elements. Bernstein himself said his main motivation for composing was &quot;to communicate&quot; and that all his pieces, including his symphonies and concert works, &quot;could in some sense be thought of as 'theatre' pieces&quot;.&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;In the 1978 Peter Rosen documentary ''Leonard Bernstein: Reflections'', now available on a Medici Arts DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Place Léonard-Bernstein, Paris 12.jpg|thumb|Place Léonard-Bernstein, a square in the [[12th arrondissement of Paris]]]]
According to the [[League of American Orchestras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanorchestras.org/images/stories/ORR_0809/ORR_0809.pdf |title=2008–2009 Season, Orchestra Repertoire Report |publisher=League of American Orchestras |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the second most frequently performed American composer by U.S. orchestras in 2008–09 behind Copland, and he was the 16th most frequently performed composer overall by U.S. orchestras. (Some performances were probably due to the 2008 90th anniversary of his birth.) His most popular pieces were the ''Overture to Candide'', the ''Symphonic Dances from West Side Story'', the ''[[Serenade after Plato's &quot;Symposium&quot;]]'' and the ''Three Dance Episodes from On the Town''. His shows ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' are regularly performed, and his symphonies and concert works are programmed from time to time by orchestras around the world. Since his death many of his works have been commercially recorded by artists other than himself. The ''[[Serenade after Plato's &quot;Symposium&quot;|Serenade]]'', which has been recorded more than 10 times, is probably his most recorded work not taken from an actual theatre piece.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Despite the fact that he was a popular success as a composer, Bernstein himself is reported to have been disillusioned that some of his more serious works were not rated more highly by critics, and that he himself had not been able to devote more time to composing because of his conducting and other activities.&lt;ref name=reaching/&gt; Professional criticism of Bernstein's music{{By whom|date=October 2020}} often involves discussing the degree to which he created something new as art versus simply skillfully borrowing and fusing together elements from others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In the late 1960s, Bernstein himself reflected that his [[eclecticism]] was in part due to his lack of lengthy periods devoted to composition, and that he was still seeking to enrich his own personal musical language in the manner of the great composers of the past, all of whom had borrowed elements from others.{{sfn|Gruen|1968|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}} Perhaps the harshest criticism he received from some critics in his lifetime though was directed at works like his ''Kaddish Symphony'', his ''MASS'' and the opera ''A Quiet Place'', where they found the underlying message of the piece or the text as either mildly embarrassing, clichéd or offensive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Despite this, all these pieces have been performed, discussed and reconsidered since his death.

The ''Chichester Psalms'', and excerpts from his Third Symphony and ''MASS'' were performed for [[Pope John Paul II]], including at [[World Youth Day]] in [[Denver]] on August&amp;nbsp;14, 1993, and at the [[Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah]] on April 7, 1994, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the [[Paul VI Audience Hall|Sala Nervi]] at the Vatican. Both performances were conducted by [[Gilbert Levine]].

Although he taught conducting, Bernstein did not teach composition and left no direct legacy of students in that field.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

      <text bytes="8239" xml:space="preserve">[[File:RMI-Stubs-Skeletons.svg|thumb|right|400px|A typical implementation model of Java-RMI using [[Class stub|stub]] and [[Distributed object communication#Skeleton|skeleton]] objects. Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.2 removed the need for a skeleton.]]

In [[computing]], the '''Java Remote Method Invocation''' ('''Java RMI''') is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] that performs [[remote method invocation]], the object-oriented equivalent of [[remote procedure call]]s (RPC), with support for direct transfer of [[Serialization#Java|serialized]] Java classes and [[Distributed Garbage Collection|distributed garbage-collection]].

The original implementation depends on [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM) class-representation mechanisms and it thus only supports making calls from one JVM to another. The protocol underlying this Java-only implementation is known as [[Java Remote Method Protocol]] (JRMP). In order to support code running in a non-JVM context, programmers later developed a [[Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]] version.

Usage of the term '''RMI''' may denote solely the programming interface or may signify both the API and [[JRMP]], [[IIOP]], or another implementation, whereas the term [[RMI-IIOP]] (read: RMI over [[IIOP]]) specifically denotes the RMI interface delegating most of the functionality to the supporting [[CORBA]] implementation.

The basic idea of Java RMI, the distributed garbage-collection (DGC) protocol, and much of the architecture underlying the original Sun implementation, come from the &quot;network objects&quot; feature of [[Modula-3]].

==Generalized code==
The programmers of the original RMI API generalized the code somewhat to support different implementations, such as a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] transport. Additionally, the ability to pass arguments &quot;[[Call by value|by value]]&quot; was added to CORBA in order to be compatible with the RMI interface. Still, the RMI-IIOP and JRMP implementations do not have fully identical interfaces.

RMI functionality comes in the package {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.rmi|java/rmi}}, while most of Sun's implementation is located in the &lt;code&gt;sun.rmi&lt;/code&gt; package. Note that with Java versions before Java 5.0 developers had to compile RMI stubs in a separate compilation step using &lt;code&gt;'''rmic'''&lt;/code&gt;. Version 5.0 of Java and beyond no longer require this step.

==Jini version==
[[Jini]] offers a more advanced version of RMI in Java. It functions similarly but provides more advanced security, object discovery capabilities, and other mechanisms for distributed object applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;From P2P to Web Services and Grids 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian J |last=Taylor |title=From P2P to Web Services and Grids : Peers in a Client/Server World |series=Computer Communications and Networks |publisher=Springer-Verlag |publication-place=London |year=2005 |isbn=1852338695 |doi=10.1007/b138333 |url=https://archive.org/details/fromp2ptowebserv0000tayl |oclc=827073874 |url-access=registration }}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The following classes implement a simple client-server program using RMI that displays a message.

'''&lt;code&gt;RmiServer&lt;/code&gt; class''' &amp;mdash; listens to RMI requests and implements the interface which is used by the client to invoke remote methods.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=java&gt;
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.rmi.registry.*;

public class RmiServer extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RmiServerIntf {
    public static final String MESSAGE = &quot;Hello World&quot;;

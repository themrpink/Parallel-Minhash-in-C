Unsuccessful French attacks on the city were launched in 1641 and 1645.{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=457}} In 1667, [[Louis XIV of France]] (the Sun King) successfully laid [[Siege of Lille (1667)|siege to Lille]], resulting in it becoming French in 1668 under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], provoking discontent among the citizens of the prosperous city. A number of important public works undertaken between 1667 and 1670, such as the [[Citadel of Lille|Citadel]] (erected by [[Vauban]]), or the creation of the quartiers of Saint-André and la Madeleine, enabled the French king to gradually gain the confidence of his new subjects in Lille, some of whom continued to feel Flemish, but they had always spoken the Romance [[Picard language]].

For five years, from 1708 to 1713, the city was occupied by the Dutch during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Throughout the 18th century, Lille remained profoundly Catholic. It took little part in the [[French Revolution]], but there were riots and the destruction of churches. In 1790, the city held its first municipal elections.

===Post-French Revolution===
In 1792, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the [[Austrians]], then in the United Provinces, laid siege to Lille. The &quot;[[Column of the Goddess]]&quot;, erected in 1842 in the &quot;Grand-Place&quot; (officially named {{ill|Place du Général-de-Gaulle|fr|Place du Général-de-Gaulle (Lille)}}), is a tribute to the city's resistance, led by [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] [[François André-Bonte]]. Although Austrian artillery destroyed many houses and the main church of the city, the city did not surrender, and the Austrian Army left after eight days.
[[File:France-Lille-cannonballs.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|The black dots around the windows (''not'' the decorative [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]]) are Austrian cannonballs lodged in the façade.]]

The city continued to grow and, by 1800, had some 53,000 residents, leading to Lille becoming the seat of the Nord ''départment'' in 1804. In 1846, a railway connecting Paris and Lille was built. In the early the 19th century, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]'s [[Continental System|continental blockade]] against the United Kingdom led to Lille's textile industry developing even more fully. The city was known for its cotton while the nearby towns of [[Roubaix]] and [[Tourcoing]] worked wool.  Leisure activities were thoroughly organised in 1858 for the 80,000 inhabitants.  Cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1,300, or one for every three houses. At that time the city counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets festivals and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848-1945, vol. 2, Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) pp 2:270-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, [[Alexandre Desrousseaux]] composed his lullaby ''[[P'tit Quinquin (song)|P'tit quinquin]]''.

In 1858, Lille annexed the adjacent towns of Fives, Wazemmes, and Moulins. Lille's population was 158,000 in 1872, growing to over 200,000 by 1891. In 1896 Lille became the first city in France to be led by a socialist, [[Gustave Delory]].

By 1912, Lille's population stood at 217,000. The city profited from the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly via coal and the [[steam engine]]. The entire region grew wealthy thanks to its mines and textile industry.

===First World War===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S30293, Frankreich, Lille, Militärparade.jpg|thumb|German military parade in Lille, 1915]]
Lille's occupation by the Germans began on 13 October 1914 after a ten-day siege and heavy shelling, which destroyed 882 apartment and office blocks and 1,500 houses, mostly around the railway station and in the centre. By the end of October, the city was being run by German authorities.
Because Lille was only 20&amp;nbsp;km from the battlefield, German troops passed through the city regularly on their way to and from the front. As a result, occupied Lille became a place for the hospitalisation and the treatment of wounded soldiers as well as a place for soldiers' relaxation and entertainment. Many buildings, homes and businesses were requisitioned to those ends.&lt;ref&gt;Wallart, Claudine. [http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/history/the-department-of-nord-and-the-coal-basin-under-german-occupation/lille-under-german-rule.html ''Lille under German Rule.''] Remembrance Trails of the Great War. Retrieved 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lille was liberated by the Allies on 17 October 1918, when [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|General Sir William Birdwood]] and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October.

The only audio recording known to have been made during World War I was recorded near Lille in October 1918. The two-minute recording captured the Royal Garrison Artillery conducting a gas shell bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOOgEE1e2XM&amp;t=3s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://soundstudiesblog.com/2014/07/07/listening-to-traces-of-war-gas-shell-bombardment-1918/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lille was also the hunting ground of the German World War I flying ace [[Max Immelmann]], who was nicknamed &quot;the Eagle of Lille&quot;.

===''Années Folles'', Great Depression and Popular Front===

In July 1921, at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Lille, [[Albert Calmette]] and [[Camille Guérin]] discovered the first anti-[[tuberculosis]] [[vaccine]], known as [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] (&quot;Bacille de Calmette et Guérin&quot;). The [[Opéra de Lille]], designed by Lille architect [[Louis M. Cordonnier]], was dedicated in 1923.

From 1931, Lille felt the repercussions of the [[Great Depression]], and by 1935, a third of the city's population lived in poverty. In 1936, the city's mayor, [[Roger Salengro]], became [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] but eventually killed himself after right-wing groups led a slanderous campaign against him.

===Second World War===

{{main|Lille during World War II}}
During the [[Battle of France]], Lille was besieged by German forces for several days. When Belgium was invaded, the citizens of Lille, still haunted by the events of World War I, began to flee the city in large numbers. Lille was part of the zone under control of the German commander in Brussels, and was never controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in [[German occupation of France during World War II|France]]. Lille was instead controlled under the [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|military administration in Northern France]]. The ''départments'' of Nord and [[Pas-de-Calais]] (with the exception of the coast, notably [[Dunkirk]]) were for the most part liberated from 1 to 5 September 1944, by British, Canadian and Polish troops. On 3 September, German troops began to leave Lille out of fear of the British, who were on their way from Brussels. The city was liberated by a British force consisting largely of tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Landry, Gérard (1982). Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing sous l'occupation (in French). Rennes: Ouest-France. {{ISBN|9782858824236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationing came to an end in 1947, and by 1948, normality had returned to Lille.

===Postwar===

In 1967, the Chambers of Commerce of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing were joined, and in 1969&lt; the ''Communauté urbaine de Lille'' (Lille urban community) was created, linking 87 ''[[communes of France|communes]]'' with Lille.

Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the region was faced with some problems after the decline of the coal, mining and textile industries. From the early 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the [[tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]].

Pierre Mauroy served as Mayor of Lille for 28 years from 1973 to 2001. Mauroy was Prime Minister for part of the term of Francois Mitterrand. 

In 1983, the [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]], the world's first automated [[rapid transit]] underground network, opened. In 1993, a high-speed [[TGV]] train line was opened connecting Paris with Lille in one hour. This, with the opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] in 1994 and the arrival of the [[Eurostar]] train put Lille at the centre of a triangle connecting Paris, London and Brussels.

Work on Euralille, an urban remodelling project, began in 1991. The Euralille Centre was opened in 1994, and the remodeled district is now full of parks and modern buildings containing offices, shops and apartments. In 1994 the &quot;Grand Palais&quot; was also opened for the general public, which is free for the public to enter on the first Sunday of every month.

===21st Century===

Lille was chosen as [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/Culture-leisure/european-capital-of-culture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615231323/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/Culture-leisure/european-capital-of-culture |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2013 |title=Lille 2004 European Capital of Culture |work=mairie-lille.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Genoa]].

Lille and Roubaix were affected by the [[2005 French riots|2005 riots]], like all of France's other urban centres.

In 2007 and again in 2010, Lille was awarded the label &quot;Internet City&quot;.{{by whom|date=January 2020}}{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Climate==
Lille can be described as having a temperate [[oceanic climate]]; summers normally do not reach high average temperatures, but winters can fall below freezing temperatures, but with averages quite a bit above the freezing mark. Precipitation is plentiful year round.

The table below gives average temperatures and precipitation levels for the 1981-2010 reference period.

{{Lille weatherbox}}

==Environment==
Lille is noted for its air pollution, with a 2018 study attributing 1,700 deaths per year in the agglomeration of Lille to pollution. In 2018, Lille held France's record pollution peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lavdn.lavoixdunord.fr/507534/article/2018-12-15/lille-60e-jour-de-pollution-cette-annee-l-oms-en-recommande-3 |title=Particules fines À Lille, un 60e jour de pollution cette année alors que l'OMS en recommande 3 maximum... |language=fr|website=lavoixdunord.fr|date=15 December 2018|access-date=2020-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Lille Chambre de commerce 167.jpg|thumb|upright|Lille chamber of commerce, belfry]]
A former major [[Machine|mechanical]], [[food industry]] and textile manufacturing centre as well as a retail and finance center, Lille is the largest city of a conurbation, built like a network of cities: Lille, [[Roubaix]], Tourcoing and [[Villeneuve d'Ascq]]. The conurbation forms the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] which is France's fourth-largest urban conglomeration with a 2016 population of over 1.15 million.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Boisgibault, Fahad Al Kabbani (2020): [http://www.iste.co.uk/book.php?id=1591 ''Energy Transition in Metropolises, Rural Areas and Deserts'']. [[Wiley - ISTE]]. (Energy series) {{ISBN|9781786304995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenues and taxes===
For centuries, Lille, a city of merchants, has displayed a wide range of incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially until the end of the 1800s. This contrast was noted by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1851 in his poem [[Les Châtiments]]:  « ''Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos plafonds de pierre !'' » (&quot;Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!&quot;)

===Employment===
Employment in Lille has switched over half a century from a predominant industry to tertiary activities and services.
Services account for 91% of employment in 2006.

==Main sights==
[[File:Lille Euratechnologies.JPG|EuraTechnologies cluster|thumb]]Lille features an array of architectural styles with various amounts of Flemish influence, including the use of brown and red brick. In addition, many residential neighborhoods, especially in Greater Lille, consist of attached 2–3 story houses aligned in a row, with narrow gardens in the back. These architectural attributes, many uncommon in France, help make Lille a transition in France to neighboring Belgium, as well as nearby Netherlands and England, where the presence of brick, as well as row houses or the [[terraced house]] is much more prominent.

Points of interest include
* [[Lille Cathedral]] (''Basilique-cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-la-Treille'')
* Citadel of Lille
* [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]]
* [[Jardin botanique de la Faculté de Pharmacie]]
* [[Jardin botanique Nicolas Boulay]]
* [[Jardin des Plantes de Lille]]

===La Braderie===
{{main|Braderie de Lille}}
Lille hosts an annual [[braderie]] on the first weekend in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/discovering-lille/september-braderie |title=The September 'Braderie' |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331065542/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/Welcome/discovering-lille/september-braderie |archivedate=31 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are thought to date back to the twelfth century and between two and three million visitors are drawn into the city. It is one of the largest gatherings of France and the largest [[flea market]] in Europe.

Many of the roads in the inner city (including much of the old town) are closed and local shops, residents and traders set up stalls in the street.

===Public transport===
[[File:Ligne 1 du métro de Lille Métropole - Interstation Triolo ↔ Villeneuve-d'Ascq - Hôtel de Ville (13A).JPG|alt=Lille metro|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Lille metro]]
{{Main|Ilevia}}
The [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] has a mixed mode public transport system, which is considered one of the most modern in the whole of France. It comprises buses, trams and a driverless [[light metro]] system, all of which are operated under the Transpole name. The [[Lille Metro]] is a VAL system (''véhicule automatique léger'' = light automated vehicle) that opened on 16 May 1983, becoming the first automatic light metro line in the world. The system has two lines, with a total length of {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=off}} and 60 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2941.html |title=Public Transport |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908195708/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2941.html |archivedate= 8 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tram system consists of two interurban tram lines, connecting central Lille to the nearby communities of Roubaix and Tourcoing, and has 45 stops. 68 urban bus routes cover the metropolis, 8 of which reach into Belgium.&lt;ref name=somltrav&gt;{{cite web | title = Travel &amp; Transport | url = http://www.mairie-lille.fr/sections/site-en/Lille_pratique/travel-transport | publisher=La mairie de Lille | accessdate =18 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131220539/http://www.mairie-lille.fr/sections/site-en/Lille_pratique/travel-transport &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
[[File:Lille Gare.JPG|thumb|Lille Flandres railway station]]
Lille is an important crossroads in the European [[high-speed rail]] network. It lies on the Eurostar line to London (1:20 hour journey). The French TGV network also puts it only 1 hour from Paris, 38 minutes from Brussels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2942.html |title=Coming by train |work=mairie-lille.fr |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908200024/http://en.mairie-lille.fr/cms/page2942.html |archivedate= 8 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and connects to other major centres in France such as Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse. Lille has two railway stations, which stand next door to one another: Lille-Europe station (''[[Gare de Lille-Europe]]''), which primarily serves high-speed trains and international services (Eurostar), and Lille-Flandres station (''[[Gare de Lille-Flandres]]''), which primarily serves lower speed regional trains and regional [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian]] trains.

===Highways===
[[File:Lille Autouroutes.svg|thumb|right|Lille: motorway network]]
Five ''autoroutes'' pass by Lille, the densest confluence of highways in France after Paris:
* [[A27 autoroute|Autoroute A27]] : Lille – Tournai – Brussels / Liège – Germany
* [[A23 autoroute|Autoroute A23]] : Lille – Valenciennes
* [[A1 autoroute (France)|Autoroute A1]]  : Lille – Arras – Paris / Reims – Lyon / Orléans / Le Havre
* [[A25 autoroute|Autoroute A25]] : Lille – Dunkirk – Calais – England / North Belgium
* [[A22 autoroute|Autoroute A22]] : Lille – Antwerp – Netherlands

A sixth one – the proposed A24 – will link Amiens to Lille if built, but there is opposition to its route.

===Air traffic===
[[Lille Lesquin International Airport]] is 15 minutes from the city centre by car (11&amp;nbsp;km). In terms of shipping, it ranks fourth, with almost 38,000 tonnes of freight which pass through each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lille Lesquin (LFQQ)|url=https://www.avsim.com/pages/1108/FranceVFR/LFQQ.htm|website=AVSIM|accessdate=25 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092124/https://www.avsim.com/pages/1108/FranceVFR/LFQQ.htm|archive-date=25 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its passenger traffic, around 1.2 million in 2010, is modest due to the proximity to Brussels, Charleroi, and Paris-CDG airports. The airport mostly connects other French and European cities (some with [[low-cost airline]]s).

===Waterways===
[[File:Port Lille train peniches (1).jpg|Port de Lille|thumb]]
Lille is the third-largest French river port after Paris and [[Strasbourg]]. The river Deûle is connected to regional waterways with over {{convert|680|km|0|abbr=on}} of navigable waters. The Deûle connects to Northern Europe via the River [[Scarpe (river)|Scarpe]] and the River Scheldt (towards Belgium and the Netherlands), and internationally via the [[Leie River|Lys River]] (to Dunkerque and [[Calais]]).

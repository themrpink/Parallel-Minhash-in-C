In [[gardening]] and [[agronomy|agronomic]] terminology, a '''volunteer''' is a plant that grows on its own, rather than being deliberately planted by a [[farmer]] or [[Gardening|gardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davey|first1=J.|doi=10.1093/aob/mcl244|title=Crop Ferality and Volunteerism|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=99|pages=205–206|year=2007|issue=1|pmid=|pmc=2802985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers often grow from [[seed]]s that float in on the [[wind]], are dropped by [[bird]]s, or are inadvertently mixed into [[compost]]. Unlike [[weed]]s, which are unwanted plants, a volunteer may be encouraged by gardeners once it appears, being watered, fertilized, or otherwise cared for. The action of such plants – to sprout or grow in this fashion – may also be described as '''volunteering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Literature - V|url=https://plantsliteraturelife.tripod.com/v.html|accessdate=18 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305000355/http://plantsliteraturelife.tripod.com/v.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers that grow from the seeds of specific [[cultivar]]s are not reliably identical or similar to their parent, and often differ significantly from it. Such [[Open pollination|open pollinated]] plants, if they show desirable characteristics, may be selected to become new cultivars.

==Agriculture==
[[File:Maize in soybean field, Monroe Township.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maize growing in a soybean field in the central United States]]

In [[Crop rotation|agricultural rotations]], self-set plants from the previous year's crop may become established as weeds in the current crop. For example, volunteer [[winter wheat]] will germinate to quite high levels in a following [[Rapeseed|oilseed rape]] crop, usually requiring chemical control measures. In agricultural research, high purity of a harvested crop is usually desirable. To achieve this, typically a group of temporary workers will walk the crop rows looking for volunteer plants, or &quot;rogue&quot; plants in an exercise often referred to as &quot;[[roguing]]&quot;.

The '''Battle of Chosin Reservoir''', also known as the '''Chosin Reservoir Campaign''' or the '''Battle of Lake Jangjin''' ({{Korean|장진호 전투|長津湖戰鬪|Jangjinho jeontu|Changjinho chŏnt'u}}), was an important battle in the [[Korean War]].{{efn|&quot;The difference between a very serious reverse and a total disaster was a near thing. The most crucial battle was in the northeast, at Chosin.&quot; See {{harvnb|Roe|2000|p=411}}}} The name &quot;Chosin&quot; is derived from the Japanese pronunciation &quot;''Chōshin''{{-&quot;}}, instead of the Korean pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Down in the weeds: close air support in Korea |publisher=DIANE Publishing |isbn=1428990178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84OT-JPx9lYC&amp;q=chosin+choshin&amp;pg=PA22 |quote=Fighting around the Choshin Reservoir*... *This was the Japanese name for the reservoir, the term being derived from the ruling &quot;''Chosŏn''{{-&quot;}} dynasty, which ended just 13 years before the Japanese occupation beginning in 1910. The name American also rendered it as Chosin or Chosen. The proper Korean name is Changjin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official Chinese sources refer to this battle as the eastern part of the [[Second Phase Offensive (Korean War)|Second Phase Campaign]] (or Offensive) ({{zh|s=第二次战役东线|p=Dì'èrcì Zhànyì Dōngxiàn}}). The western half of the Second Phase Campaign resulted in a Chinese victory in the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]].

The battle took place about a month after the [[People's Republic of China]] entered the conflict and sent the [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) 9th Army{{efn|name=nomenclature|In Chinese military nomenclature, the term &quot;army&quot; (军) means [[corps]], while the term &quot;army group&quot; (集团军) means [[Field Army|army]].}} to infiltrate the northeastern part of [[North Korea]]. On 27 November 1950, the Chinese force surprised the US [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] commanded by Major General [[Edward Almond]] at the Chosin Reservoir area. A brutal 17-day battle in freezing weather soon followed. Between 27 November and 13 December, 30,000&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24}} [[United Nations Command]] troops (later nicknamed &quot;The Chosin Few&quot;) under the field command of Major General [[Oliver P. Smith]] were encircled and attacked by about 120,000{{sfn|叶|p=259|2007}} Chinese troops under the command of [[Song Shilun]], who had been ordered by [[Mao Zedong]] to destroy the UN forces. The UN forces were nevertheless able to break out of the encirclement and to make a fighting withdrawal to the port of [[Hungnam]], inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. US Marine units were supported in their withdrawal by the US Army's [[Task Force Faith]] to their east, which suffered heavy casualties and the full brunt of the Chinese offensive. The retreat of the US [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] from northwest Korea in the aftermath of the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River and the [[Hungnam evacuation|evacuation]] of the X Corps from the port of Hungnam in northeast Korea marked the complete withdrawal of UN troops from North Korea.

=== Location, terrain and weather ===
Chosin Reservoir is a man-made lake located in the northeast of the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Russ|1999|p=65}} The name Chosin is the Japanese pronunciation of the Korean place name [[Changjin]], and the name stuck due to the outdated Japanese maps used by UN forces.{{sfn|Tucker et al.|2000|p=108}} The battle's main focus was around the {{convert|78|mi|km|adj=on}} long road that connects [[Hungnam]] and Chosin Reservoir,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|32}} which served as the only retreat route for the UN forces.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|29}} Through these roads, Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni,{{efn|name=Sinhung-ni|The town of Sinhung-ni referred to in this article should not be confused with another identically named town located at south of Yudami-ni on the west side of Chosin Reservoir. See {{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=30, 32, 221, 376}}.}} located at the west and east side of the reservoir respectively, are connected at Hagaru-ri (now Changjin-ŭp) ({{Coord|40.3838|N|127.249|E|display=inline}}). From there, the road passes through Koto-ri ({{Coord|40.284|N|127.3|E|display=inline}}) and eventually leads to the port of Hungnam.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|28–31}} The area around the Chosin Reservoir was sparsely populated.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|25}}

The battle was fought over some of the roughest terrain during some of the harshest winter weather conditions of the Korean War.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24}} The road was created by cutting through the hilly terrain of Korea, with steep climbs and drops. Dominant peaks, such as the Funchilin Pass and the Toktong Pass ({{Coord|40.3938|N|127.161|E|display=inline}}), overlook the entire length of the road. The road's quality was poor, and in some places it was reduced to a one lane gravel trail.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|28–31}} On 14 November 1950, a cold front from [[Siberia]] descended over the Chosin Reservoir, and the temperature plunged, according to estimates, to as low as {{convert|-36|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|xi}} The cold weather was accompanied by frozen ground, creating considerable danger of [[frostbite]] casualties, icy roads, and weapon malfunctions. Medical supplies froze; morphine syrettes had to be defrosted in a medic's mouth before they could be injected; frozen blood plasma was useless on the battlefield. Even cutting off clothing to deal with a wound risked gangrene and frostbite. Batteries used for the Jeeps and radios did not function properly in the temperature and quickly ran down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=James Carl|title = Adventures of a Tennessean|publisher=Author House|date=2013|page=190|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNo8GezPvzUC&amp;q=Battle+of+Chosin+Reservoir+cold+weather&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=9781481741576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lubrication in the guns gelled and rendered them useless in battle. Likewise, the springs on the firing pins would not strike hard enough to fire the round, or would jam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|publisher=McFarland|date=2014|page=192|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_a0zAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Battle+of+Chosin+Reservoir+cold+weather&amp;pg=PA28|isbn=9781476615646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1st Marine Division landed at Wonsan as part of Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General [[Oliver P. Smith]] of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon,{{sfn|Hammel|1994|p=214}} when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings are even though he had never been involved in one.&lt;ref name=Halberstam&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberstam|first=David|title=The Coldest Winter – America and the Korean War|location=New York, New York|publisher=Hyperion|year=2007|isbn=9781401300524|page=[https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/428 428]|url=https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in [[Tokyo]] said otherwise,&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|428}} but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious.&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|434}} The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions.&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|429}} Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|433–4}}

As the US X Corps was pushing towards the reservoir, the Chinese formulated their strategy, based on their experiences in the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}} Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence would be at the reservoir, the Chinese 9th Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}} Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}} The 9th Army initially committed eight{{sfn|叶|2007|p=66}} divisions for the battle,&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|436}} with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}}

The flaw in the Chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence about the UN forces.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|296}} Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th]], [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th]] and [[11th Marine Regiment (United States)|11th Marines]], to be concentrated at Yudami-ni.&lt;ref name=Halberstam/&gt;{{rp|435}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|42}} Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, where a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]-capable airfield was under construction and a supply dump,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|158–62}} was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st]] and 7th Marines.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|158–9}} Only [[Task Force Faith|Regimental Combat Team 31]] (RCT-31), an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|75}} Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults. As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men at the start of the battle,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24, 37}} and it was further reinforced by the British Royal Marines unit [[41 Commando|41 (Independent) Commando]] and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and 7th Army Infantry Divisions.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24}} The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24}} The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|250}} since the [[1st Marine Air Wing|1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] stationed at [[Yonpo Airfield]] and five aircraft carriers from the US Navy's [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]] were able to launch 230 [[sortie]]s daily to provide [[close air support]] during the battle,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|250}} while the US Air Force [[Far East Combat Cargo Command]] in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|182}}

Although the 9th Army was one of China's elite formations, composed of veterans and former [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] from the [[Huaihai Campaign]],&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}} several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army was intended to be outfitted in [[Manchuria]] during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen.{{sfn|Millett|2010|p=338}} As a result, the 9th Army had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter.{{sfn|Shrader|1995|p=174}} Similarly, poor [[Military logistics|logistics]] forced the 9th Army to abandon heavy artillery,{{sfn|Xue &amp; Li Part One|2000}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|36}} while working with little food and ammunition.{{sfn|Shrader|1995|p=174}} The food shortage forced the 9th Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir in reserve,{{sfn|Zhang|1995|p=117}} and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units, since foraging was not an option in the sparsely populated area.{{sfn|Shrader|1995|p=174}} By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.{{sfn|Spurr|1988|p=270}}

The Chinese strength is usually estimated at 120,000{{sfn|叶|2007|p=259}} troops for the battle,{{sfn|Hammel|1994|p=9}} as the 9th Army was composed of 12 divisions with a strength of 10,000 men per division.&lt;ref&gt;Appleman, Roy E. (1992), ''South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu,'' Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 768&lt;/ref&gt; Before arriving in Korea, the 9th Army was also reinforced. Each of its three corps now had four divisions instead of the regular three. Infantry from two formerly ''liberated'' (surrendered) Nationalist divisions were absorbed{{sfn|叶|2007|p=23}} to bring each infantry company up to strength. Some companies had approximately 150 men,{{sfn|叶|2007|p=53}} but other companies were reinforced with more than 200 men.{{sfn|叶|2007|p=15}} However, attrition due to UN air raids, poor logistics and cold weather had also taken a toll on the 9th Army in its attempt to reach the battlefield. On the day 9th Army entered Korea, for example, frostbite immediately inflicted 700 casualties while most of its transport vehicles were destroyed by UN air raid.{{sfn|Xue &amp; Li Part One|2000}} Indeed, during the course of the battle, Chinese prisoners of war reported that most of the 9th Army's divisions had become under strength, numbering about 6,500 to 7,000 men per division.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|17}} These factors, plus uncertainties over Chinese order of battle in western sources,{{efn|&quot;The third uncommitted division of the IX Army Group was the [[94th Division (People's Republic of China)|90th, of the 27th Army]]. It may have been had in reserve somewhere in the Chosin area but never committed, or if elements of it were committed, they were never identified.&quot; See {{harvnb|Appleman|1987|p=353}}}} had also led to some historians to revise the Chinese strength down to as low as 60,000 during the course of battle.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Eventually, all 12 Chinese divisions of the 9th Army were deployed, although the [[78th Division (People's Republic of China)|78th]] and the [[88th Division (People's Republic of China)|88th Divisions]] of the PVA [[26th Army (People's Republic of China)|26th Corps]] did not make contact with UN forces during the course of battle.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|353}} Eight divisions of the PVA 20th and [[27th Army (People's Republic of China)|27th Corps]] served as the main attacking force.{{sfn|叶|2007|p=66}} Four divisions of the PVA 26th Corps initially were held back in reserve, and deployed after 20th and 27th Corps exhausted all their available strength.{{sfn|叶|2007|p=203}}

On the night of 27 November, the PVA 20th and 27th Corps of the 9th Army launched multiple attacks and ambushes along the road between the Chosin Reservoir and Kot'o-ri. At Yudam-ni, the 5th, 7th and 11th Marines were surrounded and attacked by the PVA [[79th Division (People's Republic of China)|79th]] and [[89th Division (People's Republic of China)|89th Divisions]], with the [[59th Division (People's Republic of China)|59th Division]] attacking the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri to cut off communication.  Similarly, RCT-31 was isolated and ambushed at Sinhung-ni by the PVA [[80th Division (People's Republic of China)|80th]] and [[81st Division (People's Republic of China)|81st Divisions]]. At Hagaru-ri, the 1st Marine Division command headquarters was targeted by the PVA [[58th Division (People's Republic of China)|58th Division]]. Finally, the PVA [[60th Division (People's Republic of China)|60th Division]] surrounded elements of the 1st Marines at Kot'o-ri from the north.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|52}} Caught by complete surprise, the UN forces were cut off at Yudam-ni, Sinhung-ni, Hagaru-ri and Kot'o-ri by 28 November.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|72}}

Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith ordered the 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November.&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|52}} The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division and forced the Marines to dig in on the ridges surrounding Yudam-ni.&lt;ref name=Roe/&gt;{{rp|301}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|56}} As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|68}} Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions,&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|64–8}} but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|68–71}}&lt;ref name=Appleman/&gt;{{rp|74}} As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese and Americans were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;{{rp|71}}

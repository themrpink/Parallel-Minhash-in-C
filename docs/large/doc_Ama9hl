[[Luminous efficacy|Luminous ''efficacy'']] of a light source is the ratio of the visible light to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std. 100 definition of &quot;luminous efficacy&quot; pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; Visible light is measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light (see [[luminosity function]]). Not all wavelengths are equally effective at stimulating the human eye. The units of luminous efficacy are &quot;lumens per watt&quot; (lpw). By definition, the maximum efficacy is 683&amp;nbsp;lm/W for monochromatic green light. A white light source with all visible wavelengths present has a lower efficacy, around 250 lumens per watt.

The luminous ''efficiency'' is defined as the ratio of the luminous efficacy to the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy of 683 lpw for green light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yuvaengineers.com/end-of-incandescent-light-bulb/ |title=End of Incandescent Light Bulb |publisher=yuvaengineers.com |date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2017-03-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307124220/http://www.yuvaengineers.com/end-of-incandescent-light-bulb/ |archivedate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kse-lights.co.uk/the-energy-efficiency-of-light-bulbs-today-compared-to-the-past/ |title=The Energy Efficiency of Light Bulbs Today Compared to the Past |publisher=kse-lights.co.uk |date=2017-02-13 |accessdate=2017-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123653/http://www.kse-lights.co.uk/the-energy-efficiency-of-light-bulbs-today-compared-to-the-past/ |archivedate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectrum emitted by a [[blackbody]] radiator at temperatures of incandescent bulbs does not match the characteristics of the human eye, with most of the radiation in the range that the eye can't see. An upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy is around 52 lumens per watt, the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Spectral power distribution of a 25 W incandescent light bulb.png|thumb|Spectral power distribution of a 25&amp;nbsp;W incandescent light bulb.]]

Light sources such as fluorescent lamps, [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s and [[LED lamp]]s have higher luminous efficiency. These devices produce light by [[luminescence]]. Their light has bands of characteristic wavelengths, without the &quot;tail&quot; of invisible infrared emissions, instead of the continuous spectrum produced by a thermal source. By careful selection of fluorescent phosphor coatings or filters which modify the spectral distribution, the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources, or other different [[color temperature]]s of white light. When used for tasks sensitive to color, such as motion picture lighting, these sources may require particular techniques to duplicate the appearance of incandescent lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Blain Brown, ''Motion Picture and Video Lighting'', Routledge, 2018, {{ISBN|0429866666}} Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metamerism (color)|Metamerism]] describes the effect of different light spectrum distributions on the perception of color.

===Cost of lighting===
{{See also|Architectural lighting design}}
The initial cost of an incandescent bulb is small compared to the cost of the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's [[air conditioning]] system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/efficient-lighting-equals-higher-heat-bills-study-1.856047 | publisher=[[CBC News]] | title=Efficient lighting equals higher heat bills: study | date=4 March 2009 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214132113/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/efficient-lighting-equals-higher-heat-bills-study-1.856047 | archivedate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.&lt;ref name=cmhc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmhc.ca/odpub/pdf/65830.pdf |title=Benchmarking Home Energy Savings from Energy-Efficient Lighting |date=January 2008 |author=Anil Parekh |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=2016-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130112609/http://www.cmhc.ca/odpub/pdf/65830.pdf |archivedate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measures to ban use===
{{Main|Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs}}
Since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as [[compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]]s and [[LED lamp]]s, many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps. Measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the European Union, the United States, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia, among others. In Europe, the EC has calculated that the ban contributes 5 to 10 billion euros to the economy and saves 40 TWh of electricity every year, translating in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission reductions of 15 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas A. A.Howarth, Jan Rosenow: ''Banning the bulb: Institutional evolution and the phased ban of incandescent lighting in Germany''. In: ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 67, (2014), 737â€“746, {{DOI|10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.060}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/business/energy-environment/06bulbs.html |author=Leora Broydo Vestel |work=The New York Times |title=Incandescent Bulbs Return to the Cutting Edge |date=6 July 2009|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512214719/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/business/energy-environment/06bulbs.html |archivedate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have concerns about the [[Fluorescent lamps and health|health effects]] of fluorescent lamps.

===Efforts to improve efficacy===
Some research has been carried out to improve the efficacy of commercial incandescent lamps. In 2007, [[General Electric]] announced a &quot;high efficiency incandescent&quot; (HEI) lamp project, which they claimed would ultimately be as much as four times more efficient than current incandescents, although their initial production goal was to be approximately twice as efficient.&lt;ref name=notsodim&gt;{{Cite news |last=Daley |first=Dan |volume=09 |issue=1 |page=46 |publisher=Timeless Communications Corp |date=February 2008 |title=Incandescent's Not-So-Dim Future |url=http://www.plsn.com/current-issue/31-the-biz/2520-incandescents-not-so-dim-future.html |accessdate=17 June 2013 |newspaper=Projection, Lights &amp; Staging News |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306230206/http://www.plsn.com/current-issue/31-the-biz/2520-incandescents-not-so-dim-future.html |archivedate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Announces Advancement in Incandescent Technology; New High-Efficiency Lamps Targeted for Market by 2010 |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/ge/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070223005120 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=23 February 2007|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516151220/http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/ge/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070223005120 |archivedate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HEI program was terminated in 2008 due to slow progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Tyler|title=Why the brightest idea needs tinkering |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2009/04/22/why_the_brightest_idea_needs_tinkering.html|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=22 April 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620083715/http://www.thestar.com/business/2009/04/22/why_the_brightest_idea_needs_tinkering.html|archivedate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rahim |first=Saqib |title=The Incandescent Bulb Heads Offstage After Century-Long Performance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/28/28climatewire-the-incandescent-bulb-heads-offstage-after-c-11795.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518150756/http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/06/28/28climatewire-the-incandescent-bulb-heads-offstage-after-c-11795.html|archivedate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Department of Energy research at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] initially indicated the potential for dramatically improved efficiency from a [[photonic lattice]] filament.&lt;ref name=notsodim/&gt; However, later work indicated that initially promising results were in error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revolutionary tungsten photonic crystal could provide more power for electrical devices |url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2003/other/planck-lin.html |publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]] |date=7 July 2003|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221204348/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2003/other/planck-lin.html |archivedate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency, &quot;hybrid&quot; incandescent bulbs have been introduced by [[Philips]]. The &quot;Halogena Energy Saver&quot; incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_995209|title=Prototype Heat-Mirror Tungsten Lamp |journal=Smithsonian Museum of American History |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223061442/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_995209 |archivedate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Energy Efficient Incandescent Lamp: Final Report |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |date=April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced reflectors based on [[interference filter]]s or [[photonic crystal]]s can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about 270 lm/W (40% of the maximum efficacy possible).&lt;ref name=Ilic&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tailoring high-temperature radiation and the resurrection of the incandescent source |first1=Ognjen |last1=Ilic |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=320â€“4 |year=2016 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2015.309|pmid=26751172 |bibcode=2016NatNa..11..320I |hdl=1721.1/109242 |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/109242/1/Chen_Tailoring%20high-temperature.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lm/W, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=Ilic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35284112 |title=New development could lead to more effective lightbulbs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113031746/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35284112 |archive-date=13 January 2016 |work=BBC News |date=12 January 2016 |author=Matt McGrath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--many paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
Incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of [[tungsten]] wire inside the bulb, through which an [[electric current]] is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.

An electric current heats the filament to typically {{convert|2000|to|3300|K|Â°C Â°F}}, well below tungsten's melting point of {{convert|3695|K|Â°C Â°F}}. Filament temperatures depend on the filament type, shape, size, and amount of current drawn. The heated filament emits light that approximates a [[black body|continuous spectrum]]. The useful part of the emitted energy is [[visible light]], but most energy is given off as heat in the near-[[infrared]] wavelengths.

===Bulbs===

Most light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. Coated glass bulbs have [[kaolin]] clay blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. The powder layer diffuses the light from the filament. Pigments may be added to the clay to adjust the color of the light emitted.  Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for &quot;party bulbs&quot;, [[Christmas tree]] lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by [[Glass coloring and color marking|coloring the glass]] with a [[dopant]]; which is often a metal like [[cobalt]] (blue) or [[chromium]] (green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|title=Lamp Material Information Sheet â€“ Incandescent Lamp|accessdate=20 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521005210/http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.

The glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between {{convert|200|and|260|Â°C|Â°F}}. Lamps intended for high power operation or used for heating purposes will have envelopes made of hard glass or [[fused quartz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt;

If a light bulb envelope leaks, the hot tungsten filament reacts with air, yielding an aerosol of brown [[tungsten nitride]], brown [[tungsten dioxide]], violet-blue [[tungsten pentoxide]], and yellow [[tungsten trioxide]] that then deposits on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior.

===Gas fill===
[[File:GlÃ¼hwendel brennt durch.jpg|thumb|Destruction of a lamp filament due to air penetration]]
Most modern bulbs are filled with an [[inert gas]] to reduce [[evaporation]] of the filament and prevent its [[oxidation]]. The gas is at a pressure of about {{convert|70|kPa|atm|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;argon1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uigi.com/argon.html |title=Argon (Ar) Properties, Uses, Applications Argon Gas and Liquid Argon |website=Gas Properties, Uses, Applications |publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204105153/http://www.uigi.com/argon.html |archive-date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas reduces evaporation of the filament, but the fill must be chosen carefully to avoid introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high [[Relative atomic mass|atomic]] or [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). On the other hand, the presence of the gas leads to heat loss from the filamentâ€”and therefore efficiency loss due to reduced incandescenceâ€”by [[heat conduction]] and [[heat convection]].

Early lamps, and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen. The vacuum increases evaporation of the filament but eliminates two modes of heat loss.

The most commonly used fills are:&lt;ref name=&quot;ChemArtLight&quot;&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0080933153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eaj8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263|title=The Chemistry of Artificial Lighting Devices|publisher=Elsevier Science|last=Ropp|first=Richard C.|date = 22 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206142310/https://books.google.com/books?id=eaj8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=tungsten+wire+drawing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zzfRVI-9F4HqUOX7gfgJ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tungsten%20wire%20drawing&amp;f=false|archivedate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Vacuum]], used in small lamps. Provides best thermal insulation of the filament but does not protect against its evaporation. Used also in larger lamps where the outer bulb surface temperature has to be limited.
* [[Argon]] (93%) and [[nitrogen]] (7%), where argon is used for its inertness, low [[thermal conductivity]] and low cost, and the nitrogen is added to increase the breakdown voltage and prevent arcing between parts of the filament&lt;ref name=&quot;argon1&quot;/&gt;
* Nitrogen, used in some higher-power lamps, e.g. projection lamps, and where higher breakdown voltage is needed due to proximity of filament parts or lead-in wires
* [[Krypton]], which is more advantageous than argon due to its higher atomic weight and lower thermal conductivity (which also allows use of smaller bulbs), but its use is hindered by much higher cost, confining it mostly to smaller-size bulbs.
* Krypton mixed with [[xenon]], where xenon improves the gas properties further due to its higher atomic weight. Its use is however limited by its very high cost. The improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost.
* [[Hydrogen]], in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required; its high thermal conductivity is exploited here.

The gas fill must be free of traces of water, which greatly accelerates bulb blackening (see below).

The gas layer close to the filament (called the Langmuir layer) is stagnant, with heat transfer occurring only by conduction. Only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb's envelope.

The orientation of the filament influences efficiency. Gas flow parallel to the filament, e.g., a vertically oriented bulb with vertical (or axial) filament, reduces convective losses.

The efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter. Thin-filament, low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas, so are often only evacuated.

Early light bulbs with carbon filaments also used [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen]], or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. However, carbon filaments operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones, so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Tantalum light bulb.png|thumb|upright|The 1902 [[tantalum]] filament light bulb was the first one to have a metal filament. This one is from 1908.]]
Early bulbs were laboriously assembled by hand. After automatic machinery was developed, the cost of bulbs fell. Until 1910, when Libbey's Westlake machine went into production, bulbs were generally produced by a team of three workers (two gatherers and a master gaffer) blowing the bulbs into wooden or cast-iron molds, coated with a paste.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Corning and the craft of innovation |last1=Graham |first1=Margaret B.

The Westlake machine, developed by [[Libbey Glass]], was based on an adaptation of the Owens-Libbey bottle-blowing machine. [[Corning Glass Works]] soon began developing competing automated bulb-blowing machines, the first of which to be used in production was the E-Machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Corning continued developing automated bulb-production machines, installing the Ribbon Machine in 1926 in its [[Wellsboro, Pennsylvania|Wellsboro]], Pennsylvania, factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Innovations in glass |date=1999 |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |isbn=0872901467 |location=Corning, New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/innovationsingla0000corn/page/52 52] |oclc=42012660 |url=https://archive.org/details/innovationsingla0000corn/page/52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ribbon Machine surpassed any previous attempts to automate bulb production and was used to produce incandescent bulbs into the 21st century. The inventor, William Woods, along with his colleague at Corning Glass Works, David E. Gray, had created a machine that by 1939 was turning out 1,000 bulbs per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Ribbon Machine works by passing a continuous ribbon of glass along a [[conveyor belt]], heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs or envelopes are created. A typical machine of this sort can produce anywhere from 50,000 to 120,000 bulbs per hour, depending on the size of the bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/light-bulb |title=Light Bulb: How Products are Made |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914105212/http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/light-bulb |archivedate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.cmog.org/2018/01/09/running-the-ribbon-machine-stories-from-the-team/|title=Running the ribbon machine: Stories from the team|date=2018-01-09|work=Behind the Glass|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, 15 ribbon machines installed in factories around the world produced the entire supply of incandescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.cmog.org/2017/01/27/the-machine-that-lit-up-the-world/|title=The machine that lit up the world|date=2017-01-27|work=Behind the Glass|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is then fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested. The 2016 closing of [[Osram Sylvania|Osram-Sylvania]]'s Wellsboro, Pennsylvania plant meant that one of the last remaining ribbon machines in the United States was shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Filament==
The first commercially successful light bulb filaments were made from carbonized paper or [[bamboo]]. Carbon filaments have a negative [[Temperature coefficient of resistivity|temperature coefficient of resistance]]â€”as they get hotter, their electrical resistance decreases. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further.

Carbon filaments were &quot;flashed&quot; by heating in a hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline), to improve their strength and uniformity. Metallized or &quot;graphitized&quot; filaments were first heated to high temperature to transform them into [[graphite]], which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. These filaments have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic [[Conductor (electrical)|conductor]], which stabilized the lamps operating properties against minor variations in supply voltage.

[[File:Light-Bulb-Filament-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|How a tungsten filament is made]]
Metal filaments displaced carbon starting around 1904. Tungsten has the highest available melting point. 
By 1910, a process was developed by [[William D. Coolidge]] at [[General Electric]] for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small &quot;doping&quot; treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.&lt;ref name=tungstendoping&gt;Chapter 2 ''The Potassium Secret Behind Tungsten Wire Production''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coiled coil filament===
To improve the efficiency of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually {{convert|22.8|in|order=flip}},&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; and the filament diameter is {{convert|0.0018|in|order=flip}}. The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source while lasting longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.

Manufacturers designate different forms of lamp filament with an alphanumeric code.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, page 22-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical filaments are also used in [[hot cathode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s as a source of [[electron]]s or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode. When used as a source of electrons, they may have a special coating that increases electron production.

===Reducing filament evaporation===
During ordinary operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.

[[Irving Langmuir]] found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly [[argon]] and some [[nitrogen]],&lt;ref&gt;John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-6&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes [[krypton]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgin. Lighting Research and Technology 1984 16.2 61â€“72&lt;/ref&gt; While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. [[Xenon]] gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|title=Premium Fill Gasses|last=Lipstein|first=Don|accessdate=13 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011122615/http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|archivedate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Filament notching'' is due to uneven evaporation of the filament. Small variations in [[electrical resistivity|resistivity]] along the filament cause &quot;hot spots&quot; to form at points of higher resistivity;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane2001&quot;/&gt; a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point. This creates a [[positive feedback]] that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament. Lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to AC operation; different alloys of tungsten and [[rhenium]] can be used to counteract the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miniature Lamps: Technical Information |publisher=Toshiba Lighting &amp; Technology Corporation |url=https://www.tlt.co.jp/tlt/english/products/industrial_light/miniature_lamp/catalog/info.htm |accessdate=25 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a filament breaking in a gas-filled bulb can form an [[electric arc]], which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore often used as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] built into the light bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teralab.co.uk/Glass_Blowing/Lamp_Autopsy/Lamp_Autopsy_Page1.htm|title=Glass Blowing for Vacuum Devices â€“ Lamp Autopsy|last=Hunt|first=Robert|date=2001â€“2006|publisher=Teralab|accessdate=2 May 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311121008/http://www.teralab.co.uk/Glass_Blowing/Lamp_Autopsy/Lamp_Autopsy_Page1.htm|archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.

===Bulb blackening===
In a conventional lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60064 Tungsten filament lamps for domestic and similar general lighting purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the [[thermionic emission|Edison effect, thermionic emission]] and invention of the [[vacuum tube]].

A very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor [[thermolysis|dissociates]] into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this ''water cycle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane2001&quot;/&gt; The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.&lt;ref name=&quot;GETP110&quot; /&gt; Small amounts of substances such as [[zirconium]] are placed within the lamp as a [[getter]] to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.

Some old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and lighthouse service with heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope. From time to time, the operator would remove the bulb and shake it, allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope, removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again.&lt;ref&gt;John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halogen lamps===
[[File:Tungsten filament in halogen lamp.JPG|thumb|Close-up of a tungsten filament inside a [[halogen lamp]]. The two ring-shaped structures left and right are filament supports.]]
{{Main|Halogen lamp}}

The [[halogen lamp]] reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a [[halogen]] gas at low pressure, along with an inert gas. The [[halogen cycle]] increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] lamps for [[optical microscopy]] is one typical application.

===Incandescent arc lamps===
A variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as [[microscope]]s. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an [[arc lamp]] but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and [[xenon arc lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incandescent Arc Lamps|url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|publisher=Museum of Electric Lamp Technology|year=2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801233142/http://lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|archivedate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

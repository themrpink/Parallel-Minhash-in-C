Aykroyd appeared in five films released in 1988, all of them critical and commercial failures. A sequel to ''Ghostbusters'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another ''Ghostbusters'' film, but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Ghostly Movie|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=May 17, 1987|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-17/entertainment/ca-380_1_david-puttnam|access-date=November 8, 2010|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning {{US$|215{{nbsp}}million}}. Aykroyd was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]''. He was the second ''SNL'' cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, the first being [[Joan Cusack]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Aykroyd's [[film director|directorial]] debut was 1991's ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' starring [[Demi Moore]], Chevy Chase, [[John Candy]], and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box-office flop. Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were mostly similarly poorly received, including ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (also based on a ''SNL'' skit), ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'', ''Blues Brothers 2000'', and ''[[Getting Away with Murder (1996 film)|Getting Away with Murder]]''. Two exceptions were ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'' (1995), which starred ''SNL'' alumni [[David Spade]] and [[Chris Farley]], in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.

In 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]'' as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', which lasted two seasons. In 1998, Aykroyd voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in ''[[Antz]]''. In 2001, he starred in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]''. Most of his film roles since then have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a signals analyst in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and a neurologist in ''[[50 First Dates]]''.

In 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', which also featured Bill Murray, [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Annie Potts]], [[William Atherton]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, [[Yogi Bear]], in the live-action/CGI-animated-film ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]''. That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest-starred in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode &quot;[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]&quot;, an homage to ''Spies Like Us''.

Aykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS's ''[[The Defenders (2010 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', which starred Jim Belushi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Dan-Aykroyd-Defenders-1026196.aspx|title=Dan Aykroyd to Reunite with Jim Belushi on The Defenders|publisher=TVGuide.com|access-date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on ''Top Chef Canada'' as a guest judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/17/AR2011021706507.html|title=TV Highlights: Dan Aykroyd on 'The Defenders'; Dina Lohan on '20/20'; 'Gold Rush: Alaska' finale|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 18, 2011|access-date=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aykroyd voiced the role of [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return]]''. In 2015, he appeared in a [[State Farm]] insurance commercial along with [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Laraine Newman]], as the [[Coneheads]], talking to &quot;Jake&quot;, a State Farm agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/coneheads-statefarm-saturday-night-live-characters-in-commercial-1201492023/|title=Coneheads: ‘Saturday Night Live’ Characters Turn Up in State Farm Ad – Variety|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2015-05-11|website=variety.com|access-date=2019-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd was one of the executive producers of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', a long-discussed reboot of the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]], which was released in 2016. Aykroyd had a cameo appearance in the film, along with many of the rest of the original ''Ghostbusters'' cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/ghostbusters-channing-tatum-joe-and-anthony-russo-drew-pearce-ivan-reitman-dan-aykroyd-1201388917|title=Sony Plans New 'Ghostbusters' Film With Russo Brothers, Channing Tatum &amp; 'IM3' Scribe Drew Pearce|magazine=Deadline|date=March 9, 2015|access-date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/ghostbusters-expanding-franchise|title=Reitman, Aykroyd Team For 'Ghostcorp'; Expanding &quot;GHOSTBUSTERS&quot; Franchise|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|date=March 9, 2015|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907061214/http://www.fangoria.com/new/ghostbusters-expanding-franchise/|archive-date=September 7, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other musical endeavors==
Aykroyd participated in the recording of &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot; in 1985, as a member of the chorus. He wrote the liner notes for fellow Ottawa-born blues musician [[JW-Jones]]'s album ''Bluelisted'' in 2008. Until 2018, he hosted the internationally syndicated radio show &quot;Elwood's BluesMobile&quot;, formerly known as ''House of Blues Radio Hour'', under his Blues Brothers moniker Elwood Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebluesmobile.com/ |title=TheBluesmobile.com |publisher=TheBluesmobile.com|access-date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business ventures==
[[File:Crystal_Head_Vodka.jpg|thumb|Bottle of Crystal Head vodka]]
In 1992, Aykroyd and [[Hard Rock Cafe]] co-founder [[Isaac Tigrett]] founded the [[House of Blues]], a chain of music venues, with the mission to promote African-American cultural contributions of [[blues|blues music]] and [[folk art]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Many other music and Hollywood personalities helped to finance it at its start. It began as a single location in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], although other locations quickly followed, starting with a venue in [[New Orleans]] in 1994. In 2004, House of Blues became the second-largest live music promoter in the world, with seven venues and 22 amphitheatres in the United States and Canada. It was bought by [[Live Nation]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jul-06-fi-live6-story.html|title=House of Blues Sold to Live Nation|last=Duhigg|first=Charles|date=6 July 2006|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Eve, 1994, Aykroyd opened the Aykroyd's Ghetto House Cafe on [[Princess Street (Kingston, Ontario)|Princess Street]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The King of ... Kingston|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/the-king-of-kingston|access-date=2020-11-10|website=National Post|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Aykroyd and artist [[John Alexander (artist)|John Alexander]] founded [[Crystal Head Vodka]], a brand of high-end [[vodka]] known for its distinctive skull-shaped bottle and for being filtered through [[Herkimer diamond]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crystalheadvodka.com/en/faq|title=Crystal Head Vodka FAQ|access-date=May 20, 2016|publisher=Crystal Head Vodka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is also part owner of several wineries in Canada's [[Niagara Peninsula]], and the company that distributes [[Patrón]] tequila in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dan Aykroyd| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-aykroyd|work=Huffington Post Canada| access-date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crystal&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Dan Aykroyd's displeasure crystal clear to observer| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/dan-aykroyd8217s-displeasure-crystal-clear-to-observer/story-fni0cvc9-1226738669101| work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]| date=October 11, 2013| last=Sharp| first=Annette| access-date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Aykroyd partnered with TV producers [[Eric Bischoff]] and [[Jason Hervey]] and game developer [[Ike McFadden]] to release an online-casino game featuring the Blues Brothers. Aykroyd provided the in-game voice of his Elwood Blues character via voiceover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mx-digital-partners-blues-brothers-690840|title=MX Digital Partners With the Blues Brothers Brand, Dan Aykroyd for Online Games (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=June 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable works==
In 2009, Aykroyd contributed a series of reminiscences on his upbringing in Canada for a charity album titled ''Dan Aykroyd's Canada''. He helped start the Blue Line Foundation, which is redeveloping flood-damaged lots in New Orleans and helping [[first responder]]s buy them at reduced prices. Coastal Blue Line LLC, hopes to eventually rebuild 400 properties in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eliot Kamenitz|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/photo_dan_aykroyd_tours_neighb.html|title=Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd launches home building project for first responders|publisher=Nola.com|access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/|title=Artists - Artists Against Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aykroyd was briefly engaged to actress [[Carrie Fisher]]. He proposed to her on the set of ''The Blues Brothers'' film, in which she appeared as a spurned girlfriend of John Belushi's Jake Blues, who was trying to kill both brothers. The engagement ended when she reconciled with her former boyfriend, musician [[Paul Simon]]. In 1983, he married actress [[Donna Dixon]]; they met on the set of ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' released the same year. They went on to appear together in four additional films: ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985); ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983); ''[[The Couch Trip]]'' (1988); and ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'' (1994). They have three daughters, Danielle (known by her stage name, [[Vera Sola]]), Stella, and Belle.

Aykroyd maintains his Canadian roots as a longtime resident of [[Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario|Sydenham, Ontario]], with his estate on [[Loughborough Lake]].

In a 2004 [[NPR]] interview with host [[Terry Gross]], Aykroyd said that he had been diagnosed in childhood with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) as well as [[Asperger syndrome]] (AS). He stated that his TS was successfully treated with therapy.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Comedian -- and Writer -- Dan Aykroyd|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4181931|access-date=2011-05-15|series=Fresh Air|first=Terry|last=Gross|network=NPR|date=2004-11-22|time=29:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he stated during a ''HuffPost Show'' interview with hosts [[Roy Sekoff]] and [[Marc Lamont Hill]] that his AS was &quot;never diagnosed&quot;, but was &quot;sort of a self-diagnosis&quot; based on several of his own characteristics.&lt;ref name=HuffPostShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5rQJpYHIAA|title=Dan Aykroyd – Full Interview|date=2015-04-18|publisher=HuffPost Show|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is a former reserve commander for the police department in [[Harahan, Louisiana]], working for Chief of Police Peter Dale. Aykroyd would carry his badge with him at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CISNMike|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgKHCB7lnog|title=Dan Aykroyd Shows his Badge|publisher=YouTube.com|date=February 14, 2007|access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves as a reserve deputy of the Hinds County Sheriff's Department in [[Hinds County, Mississippi]].  He supports the reserves with a fundraiser concert along with other blues and gospel singers in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnewsnow.com/story/24546885/dan-aykroyd-sworn-in-as-hinds-county-deputy|title=Dan Aykroyd sworn in as Hinds County deputy|website=Msnewsnow.com|access-date=May 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143346/http://www.msnewsnow.com/story/24546885/dan-aykroyd-sworn-in-as-hinds-county-deputy|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd is passionate about the outdoors, geology and paleontology which he attributes to watching his father work on constructing the Gatineau Parkway which included blasting through granite rock formations to run the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackrael |first1=Kim |title=Dan Aykroyd goes from Ghostbuster to bone duster |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/dan-aykroyd-goes-from-ghostbuster-to-bone-duster/article5010895/ |access-date=7 August 2020 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passion has led Aykroyd to join renowned Canadian [[paleontologist]] Dr. [[Philip J. Currie]] on a number of digs, including fundraising digs and galas as fundraisers for the construction of the [[Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum]] in [[Wembley, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Funding shortfall delays Alberta dinosaur museum |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/funding-shortfall-delays-alberta-dinosaur-museum-1.1111378 |access-date=7 August 2020 |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 8, 2011 |location=Edmonton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of Aykroyd's contributions, the museum's theatre was named the ''Aykroyd Family Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cryderman |first1=Kelly |title=Five questions with the Philip J.

===Friendship with John Belushi===
In an appearance on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, Aykroyd referred to  John Belushi and himself as &quot;kindred spirits&quot;. In the biography ''Belushi'', Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man with whom he could ever dance. Aykroyd and Belushi were scheduled to present the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Visual Effects]] in 1982, but Belushi died only a few weeks prior to the ceremony. Though devastated by his friend's death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, remarking from the stage: &quot;My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Link YouTube|id=t8hI5on2jqg|Raiders of the Lost Ark Wins Visual Effects: 1982 Oscars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd was openly hostile to the 1989 film ''[[Wired (film)|Wired]]'', a biopic of Belushi (which featured Aykroyd as a character played by actor Gary Groomes), and has since refused to work with anyone involved in the film. He had actor [[J. T. Walsh]] fired from the film ''[[Loose Cannons (1990 film)|Loose Cannons]]'' after Walsh had already done two days of filming, after finding out that Walsh had been in the cast of ''Wired''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-13/entertainment/ca-1870_1_caa-belushi-friends-wired/2|work=Los Angeles Times|first1=Nina J.|last1=Easton|first2=Jack|last2=Mathews|title=Another Chapter in the Strange Odyssey of 'Wired'|date=April 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Aykroyd considers himself a [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]], stating:
:I am a Spiritualist, a proud wearer of the Spiritualist badge. Mediums and psychic research have gone on for many, many years .... Loads of people have seen spirits, heard a voice, or felt the cold temperature. I believe that they are between here and there, that they exist between the fourth and fifth dimensions, and that they visit us frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychic News|last=Aykroyd|first=Dan|work=[[Psychic News]] Issue #4001|date=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd's great-grandfather, a dentist, was a [[Mysticism|mystic]] who corresponded with author [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] on the subject of Spiritualism, and was a member of the [[Lily Dale, New York|Lily Dale Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Other than Spiritualism, Aykroyd is also interested in various other aspects of the [[paranormal]], particularly [[UFOlogy]]. He is a lifetime member of and official Hollywood consultant for the [[Mutual UFO Network]]. Along these lines, he served, from 1996 to 2000, as &quot;host&quot; of ''[[Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal]]'', which claimed to describe cases drawn from the archives of &quot;The Office of Scientific Investigation and Research&quot;. In 2005, Aykroyd produced the DVD ''Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs''.

Aykroyd is interviewed for 80 minutes by UFOlogist David Sereda discussing in depth many aspects of the UFO phenomenon.&lt;ref name=UNPLUGGED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uforc.com/news/daufo-KlewMedia_060206.htm |title=UFORC News Service: Dan Aykroyd Unplugged on UFOs|access-date=February 9, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219024119/http://www.uforc.com/news/daufo-KlewMedia_060206.htm|archive-date=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2009, Peter Aykroyd Sr., Dan's father, published a book entitled ''A History of Ghosts''. This book chronicled the family's historical involvement in the Spiritualist movement, to which Aykroyd readily refers. Aykroyd wrote the introduction and accompanied his father on a series of promotional activities, including launches in New York and Toronto,  appearances on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'', and various other public-relations initiatives. Aykroyd also read the introduction for the audio version of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 1997, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] &lt;!-- (CSICOP) --&gt; awarded Aykroyd ''in absentia'' the Snuffed Candle Award for hosting ''[[Psi Factor]]'' and being a &quot;long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims&quot;. Following the awards, [[Joe Nickell]] wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the &quot;cases&quot; presented on ''Psi Factor'', particularly a claim that NASA scientists were &quot;killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Candle awards 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nye, Aykroyd Receive Council's First Awards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1997|volume=21|issue=3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Treaty of Portsmouth''' formally ended the 1904–05 [[Russo-Japanese War]]. It was signed on September 5, 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902EFD61431E733A25754C1A9669D946497D6CF&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=order+of+meiji&amp;st=p &quot;Text of Treaty; Signed by the Emperor of Japan and Czar of Russia&quot;], ''The New York Times''. October 17, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; after negotiations from August 6 to August 30, at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Location of shipyard in Maine: {{Cite web| url=http://docs.unh.edu/ME/york93nw.jpg| title=York, ME-NH| work=[[U.S. Geological Survey|USGS]] 15-minute topographic map series| date=1893| access-date=January 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was instrumental in the negotiations and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts.

==Background==
The war of 1904–05 was fought between the [[Empire of Russia]], an international power with one of the largest armies in the world, and the [[Empire of Japan]], a nation that had only recently industrialized after two-and-a-half centuries of isolation. A series of battles in the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] had resulted in Russian armies being driven from southern [[Manchuria]], and the [[Battle of Tsushima]] had resulted in a cataclysm for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. The war was unpopular in Russia, whose government was under increasing threat of revolution at home. On the other hand, the Japanese economy was severely strained by the war, with rapidly mounting foreign debts, and Japanese forces in Manchuria faced the problem of ever-extending supply lines. No Russian territory had been seized, and the Russians continued to build up reinforcements via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Recognizing that a long war was not to Japan's advantage, the Japanese government as early as July 1904 had begun seeking out intermediaries to assist in bringing the war to a negotiated conclusion.&lt;ref name= Kowner&gt;Kowner, '' Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War'', p. 300-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intermediary approached by the Japanese was U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who had publicly expressed a pro-Japanese stance at the beginning of the war. However, as the war progressed, Roosevelt had begun to show concerns on the strengthening military power of Japan and its long-term impact on U.S. interests in Asia. In February 1905, Roosevelt sent messages to the Russian government via the US ambassador in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Initially, the Russians were unresponsive, with Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] still adamant that Russia would eventually prove victorious. The Japanese government was also lukewarm to a peace treaty, as Japanese armies were enjoying an unbroken string of victories. However, after the [[Battle of Mukden]], which was extremely costly to both sides in terms of manpower and resources, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Minister]] [[Komura Jutarō]] judged that it was now critical for Japan to push for a settlement.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

On March 8, 1905, [[Ministry of the Army|Japanese Army Minister]] [[Terauchi Masatake]] met with the American Minister to Japan, [[Lloyd Griscom]], to tell Roosevelt that Japan was ready to negotiate. However, a positive response did not come from Russia until after the loss of the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. Two days later, Nicholas met with his grand dukes and military leadership and agreed to discuss peace. On June 7, 1905, Roosevelt met with [[Kaneko Kentarō]], a Japanese diplomat, and on June 8, he received a positive reply from Russia. Roosevelt chose [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], as the site for the negotiations, primarily because the talks were to begin in August, and the cooler climate in Portsmouth would avoid subjecting the parties to the sweltering [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] summer.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

==Portsmouth Peace Conference==
The Japanese delegation to the Portsmouth Peace Conference was led by Foreign Minister [[Komura Jutarō]] and assisted by Ambassador [[Takahira Kogorō]]. The Russian delegation was led by former Finance Minister [[Sergei Witte]], who was assisted by the former Ambassador to Japan [[Roman Rosen]] and the [[international law]] and [[arbitration]] specialist [[Friedrich Martens]].&lt;ref name= Jukes&gt;Jukes, '' The Russo-Japanese War 1904–1905'', p. 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The delegations arrived in Portsmouth on August 8 and stayed in [[New Castle, New Hampshire]], at the [[Wentworth by the Sea|Hotel Wentworth]], where the [[armistice]] was signed. They were ferried across the [[Piscataqua River]] every day to the naval base in [[Kittery, Maine]], where the negotiations were held.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The negotiations took place at the General Stores Building (now Building 86). [[Mahogany]] furniture patterned after the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] of the [[White House]] was ordered from Washington.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Before the negotiations began, Tsar Nicholas had adopted a hard line and forbidden his delegates to agree to any territorial concessions, reparations, or limitations on the deployment of Russian forces in the Far East.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt; The Japanese initially demanded recognition of their interests in [[Korea]], the removal of all Russian forces from Manchuria, and substantial reparations. They also wanted confirmation of their control of the island of [[Sakhalin]], which Japanese forces had seized in July 1905, partly to use as a [[bargaining chip]] in the negotiations.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

A total of twelve sessions were held between August 9 and August 30. During the first eight sessions, the delegates were able to reach an agreement on eight points. These included an immediate [[ceasefire]], recognition of Japan's claims to Korea, and the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria. Russia also ceded its leases in southern Manchuria (containing [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and [[Dalian|Talien]]) to Japan and turned over the [[South Manchuria Railway]] and its mining concessions to Japan. Russia was allowed to retain the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] in northern Manchuria.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;  
 
The remaining four sessions addressed the most difficult issues: reparations and territorial concessions. On August 18, Roosevelt proposed that Rosen offer to divide Sakhalin to address the territory issue. On August 23, however, Witte proposed that the Japanese keep Sakhalin and drop their claims for reparations. When Komura rejected the proposal, Witte warned that he was instructed to cease negotiations and that the war would resume. The ultimatum came as four new Russian divisions arrived in Manchuria, and the Russian delegation made an ostentatious show of packing their bags and preparing to depart.&lt;ref name= Jukes/&gt; Witte was convinced that the Japanese could not afford to restart the war and so applied pressure via the American media and his American hosts&lt;ref name= Jukes/&gt; to convince the Japanese that monetary compensation was not open for compromise by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;White, J. A.: &quot;Portsmouth 1905: Peace or Truce?&quot;, ''Journal of Peace Research'', 6(4):362&lt;/ref&gt; Outmaneuvered by Witte, Komura yielded, and in exchange for the southern half of Sakhalin, the Japanese dropped their claims for reparations.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

The Treaty of Portsmouth was signed on September 5. The treaty was ratified by the [[Privy Council of Japan]] on October 10,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacar.go.jp/english/nichiro/sumitsuin.htm Partial record of Privy Council meeting to ratify the treaty (from the National Archives of Japan)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Russia on October 14, 1905.

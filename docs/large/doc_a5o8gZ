===Skywalker saga===
{{main|Skywalker saga}}
====Original trilogy era====
{{main|Star Wars Trilogy}}
Fett's theatrical film debut was an unnamed bounty hunter in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' as the &quot;next major villain&quot; besides Darth Vader.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-v/bts/article/f20061019/index.html?page=2|title=Proto-Fett: The Birth of Boba|last=Vilmur|first=Pete|date=October 16, 2006|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825002942/http://www.starwars.com/episode-v/bts/article/f20061019/index.html?page=2|archivedate=August 25, 2011|accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the crew of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Fett tracks the starship to [[Bespin|Cloud City]], where Vader captures its passengers and tortures its captain, [[Han Solo]]. Aiming to collect a bounty on Solo, Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but he survives and Vader turns him over to Fett.

''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' features Boba Fett at [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace where Han Solo's rescuers are captured. He aims his weapon at [[Princess Leia]] (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba's [[sail barge]] to the Great Pit of Carkoon, home of the [[Sarlacc]], where the prisoners are to be executed. When the prisoners revolt and fight back, Fett flies over and intervenes by tying up Luke, who manages to escape. [[Chewbacca]] warns Han Solo, who is still blind after being frozen in carbonite, that Boba Fett is near. Solo turns around and in the process accidentally sets off Fett's rocket pack, sending the bounty hunter falling into the Sarlacc's mouth. In the 1997 [[Return of the Jedi#Special Edition|Special Edition]] release of the film, Fett is featured flirting with some of the crime lord's female dancers while in the palace—this was an entirely new scene, not included in any prior theatrical, broadcast, or home video version. In this film, he does not have any verbal lines.

Fett appears in an episode of the 1985 ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' animated series set before the original trilogy and produced by the same studio as the animated segment of the ''Holiday Special''. In &quot;A Race to the Finish&quot;, Fett is hired by the Fromms to help them get revenge on the masters of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. He later turns on them after failing their request, and decides to accept Jabba's bounty on the Fromms as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwarsmaven.info/bobafett4/|title=Boba Fett in Television &amp; Movies IV: Star Wars Droids episode, &quot;A Race to the Finish&quot;|last=Kaplan|first=Drew|website=Star Wars Maven|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1997 [[Star Wars (film)#Special Edition|Special Edition]] of the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', Fett briefly appears in [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#Jabba the Hutt|a reintroduced cut scene]] outside the ''Millennium Falcon'' while Jabba confronts Han Solo,&lt;ref name=&quot;starwars_bobafett&quot; /&gt; although he is posthumously superimposed, and not part of the original shooting, as the character did not make part of the original script.

====Prequel trilogy era====
{{main|Star Wars prequel trilogy}}
The 2002 prequel film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' revealed that Boba Fett is an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]], who had him created on Kamino to be raised as his son as part of his price to serve as a matrix for the Grand Army of the Republic's [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|clone troopers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starwars_bobafett&quot; /&gt; Boba helps Jango escape from [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Later, on [[Geonosis]] he witnesses Jango's death by [[lightsaber]] at the hands of [[Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starwars_bobafett&quot; /&gt;

Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu are trapped in the crumbling ruins of a crashed ship while searching for survivors, and only R2-D2 can get out a message to save them—if he can elude vicious gundarks and a crew of determined bounty hunters led by Boba Fett and [[Aurra Sing]]. While Anakin and Mace Windu recover from their injuries, [[Plo Koon]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]] track down Boba Fett from the underworld of [[Coruscant]] to the planet [[Florrum]]. Fett's revenge scheme leads to a climactic battle, and the life of a Republic admiral hangs in the balance. Fett is shown working with bounty hunters Aurra Sing, [[Bossk (Star Wars)|Bossk]], and Castas. With their help, Fett attempts to avenge his father's death at the hands of Mace Windu. However, he is unsuccessful, and as a result of his actions, is sentenced to prison along with Bossk. They escape prison in the fourth season, and Fett forms his own syndicate of bounty hunters, called '''Krayt's Claw''', which includes Bossk and [[Dengar]], who first appeared in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' alongside Fett. 

====''The Mandalorian''====

He also appears in many works set during the original trilogy, including Dark Horse's short comic ''Boba Fett: Salvage'' (1997),{{Efn|Originally printed in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine and later collected in the ''Enemy of the Empire'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] as ''Boba Fett'' #0.5|name=|group=}} issues of ''[[Star Wars: Empire|Empire]]'' (2002–2005) and ''Star Wars'' (2013–14), the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot comic]] ''Boba Fett: Overkill'' (2006), ''The Bounty Hunter Wars'' book trilogy, volumes of the young-reader series ''[[Galaxy of Fear]]'' (1997–1998), and the [[Gamebook|choose-your-own-adventure book]] ''The Bounty Hunter'' (1994). He is also notably featured in the 1996 ''[[Shadows of the Empire]]'' multimedia project.

Works such as Dark Horse's ''[[Dark Empire]]'' series (1991–1992) describe Fett surviving the Sarlacc.&lt;ref name=&quot;starwars_bobafett&quot; /&gt; In [[Tales from Jabba's Palace#A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett|a 1995 anthology story]], Fett nearly kills the Sarlacc with explosives, and [[Tales of the Bounty Hunters#Payback: The Tale of Dengar|a 1996 story]] narrates how Dengar finds him and restores him back to health.

The series reveals that Fett became a family man at one point, though he was forcibly separated from his wife after killing his commanding officer for assaulting her. His wife subsequently disappeared and was presumed dead. Their granddaughter later sought Boba out and married a Mandalorian warrior. Boba's wife was discovered to still be alive, having been frozen in carbonite decades earlier.

====''The Bounty Hunter Wars''====
'''''The Bounty Hunter Wars''''' is a trilogy of science-fiction novels by [[K.W. Jeter]] set during the events of the original trilogy. The books were published by [[Bantam Spectra]] in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999. The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show &quot;an ability to convince people as well as kill them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jeterinterview&quot; /&gt;

The first book, '''''{{visible anchor|The Mandalorian Armor}}''''', starts during the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', shortly after Jabba the Hutt's sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter's near-death experience, and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba's palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive. It is related in flashbacks set between ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and [[Zuckuss]] were hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild in order to break it up. The Emperor met with Darth Vader and [[Prince Xizor]], where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild in order to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit.

In the second book, '''''{{visible anchor|Slave Ship}}''''', Fett abandons the ''[[Slave I]]'' to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk's ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship's crew. Fett, Bossk and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod.

In the third and final book, '''''{{visible anchor|Hard Merchandise}}''''', it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him in order to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker's [[Beru Lars|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars|uncle]]. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper's ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive's shipyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Asher-Perrin |first=Emmet |title=Okay, Boba Fett Likes Some People: Hard Merchandise |url=https://www.tor.com/2013/08/29/okay-boba-fett-likes-some-people-hard-merchandise/ |website=TOR.com |accessdate=September 22, 2019 |date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''====
'''''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''''' is an [[e-book|e-novella]] by [[Karen Traviss]], which was published online in August 2006 by [[Del Rey Books]]. Set twenty years after the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaders in ''The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force'' (set a few months later).
A Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on [[Mandalore]] and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion. Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]], but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.
A Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.
The Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225047/http://starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060609.html announcement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618155301/http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 18, 2008|title=Star Wars: Expanded Universe &amp;#124; First Look: A Practical Man|date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/books/reviews/r_apracticalman.asp|title=TheForce.Net - Books - Reviews - A Practical Man|website=www.theforce.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060821214727/http://www.ereader.com/product/book/excerpt/22631?book=Star_Wars%3A_Boba_Fett%3A_A_Practical_Man First eighteen paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and development==
George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April 1978 draft of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', basing the character on [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Man with No Name]] ([[Clint Eastwood]]). The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the ''Star Wars Holiday Special'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Brian Jay |title=George Lucas: A Life |date=2016 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York City |isbn=978-0316257442 |page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;starwars_bobafett&quot; /&gt; While Vader became less a [[mercenary]] and more of a dark [[knight]], the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became &quot;an equally villainous&quot; but &quot;less conspicuous&quot; character.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett2&quot; /&gt; [[Concept artist]] [[Ralph McQuarrie]] influenced Fett's design, which was finalized by and is credited to [[Joe Johnston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/14/DDG94CO3CN1.DTL&amp;hw=fett&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 |title=Forget Anakin – for die-hard 'Star Wars' fans, Boba Fett rules |last=Hartlaub |first=Peter |date=May 14, 2005 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Reynolds]] and the film's art department built the costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ultimate Star Wars|last1=Barr|first1=Patricia|last2=Bray|first2=Adam|last3=Wallace|first3=Daniel|last4=Windham|first4=Ryder|authorlink4=Ryder Windham|page=258|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|date=2015|isbn=9781465436016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fett's armor was originally designed for &quot;super troopers&quot;, and was adapted for Fett as the script developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giant-Robot&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |year=2004 |magazine=[[Giant Robot (magazine)|Giant Robot]] |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ioaAQAAIAAJ |title=Interview |publisher=Eric Nakamura}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Screen-test]]ed in all-white, Fett's armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored &quot;rank-and-file&quot; [[Imperial stormtrooper]]s and Vader, who wears black.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett2&quot; /&gt; This color scheme had the added bonus of conveying the &quot;gray morality&quot; of his character.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett2&quot; /&gt; The character's armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources, and it is adorned with trophies.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett2&quot; /&gt; A description of Fett's armor in the mid-1979 ''Bantha Tracks'' newsletter catalyzed &quot;rampant speculation&quot; about his origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett3&quot; /&gt; By 1979, Fett's backstory included having served in an army of Imperial [[shock troops]] which had battled the [[clone trooper]]s of the Republic during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=The Secret History of Star Wars|edition=3.0|year=2008|origyear=2007|publisher=Legacy Books Press|isbn=978-0-9784652-3-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite two years of widespread publicity about Fett's appearance in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', script rewrites significantly reduced the character's presence in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;protofett3&quot; /&gt; Fett's musical theme, composed by [[John Williams]], is &quot;not music, exactly&quot; but &quot;more of a gurgly, [[viola]]-and-[[bassoon]] thing aurally cross-pollinated with some obscure static sounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bissell&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bissell |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Bissell |chapter=Pale Starship, Pale Rider: The Ambiguous Appeal of Boba Fett |editor=Glenn Kenny |publisher=Macmillan |year=2002 |title=A Galaxy Not So Far Away |pages=10–40 |isbn=978-0-8050-7074-3 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grAvkJhyz30C&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|Sound editor]] [[Ben Burtt]] added the sound of jangling [[spur]]s, created and performed by the foley artist team of [[Robert Rutledge]] and Edward Steidele, to Fett's appearance in Cloud City, intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar [[gunfighter]] appearances in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films.

An official reference book states that Fett charges &quot;famously expensive&quot; fees and that he undertakes only when the mission meets &quot;his harsh sense of justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=David West|first2=James|last2=Luceno|first3=Ryder|last3=Windham|title=Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary&amp;nbsp;— The Ultimate Guide to Characters and Creatures from the Entire Star Wars Saga|publisher=DK Children|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7566-2238-1|url=https://archive.org/details/starwarscomplete00reyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Daniel Keys Moran, who wrote a few stories featuring Boba Fett, cited Westerns as an influence on his development of the character.&lt;ref name=moranint_fanclub/&gt; Moran said:
{{quote|The difficult thing with Fett was finding a worldview for him that permitted him to proclaim a Code&amp;nbsp;— given the stark Evil that permeated the Empire, Fett pretty much had to be either 1) Evil, or 2) an incredibly unforgiving, harsh, &quot;greater good&quot; sort of guy. The second approach worked and has resonated with some readers.&lt;ref name=moranint_fanclub/&gt;}}

Lucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films, but discounted it as too &quot;hokey&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;skywalking287&quot; /&gt; In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others.&lt;ref name=&quot;convergenceculture&quot; /&gt; Lucas considered adding a shot of Fett escaping the Sarlacc in later editions of ''Return of the Jedi'', but decided against it because it would have detracted from the story's focus.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotjcommentary&quot;&gt;''Return of the Jedi'' DVD audio commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas also said that, had he known Fett would be so popular, he would have made the character's death &quot;more exciting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotjcommentary&quot; /&gt; In 2014, ''Star Wars'' historian Jonathan W. Winzler revealed that Lucas had told him that Fett escaped from the Sarlacc, but this has yet to be demonstrated in the film canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2avk5i/hi_reddit_jonathan_rinzler_star_wars_scholar_and/ciz7w38/?context=3|title=JonathanRinzler comments on Hi reddit, Jonathan Rinzler (Star Wars scholar and Lucasfilm historian) here.

===Film casting and production===
Boba Fett is primarily played by [[Jeremy Bulloch]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''.

'''Māori''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aʊ|r|i}}; {{IPAc-mi|lang|pron|'|m|ā|o|r|i|}}&amp;nbsp;{{Audio|Rar-Māori.ogg |listen|help= no}}), also known as '''{{lang|mi|te reo}}''' ('the language'), is an [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian language]] spoken by the [[Māori people]], the indigenous population of [[New Zealand]]. Closely related to [[Cook Islands Māori]], [[Tuamotuan language| Tuamotuan]], and [[Tahitian language| Tahitian]], it gained recognition as one of New Zealand's [[official language]]s in 1987. The number of speakers of the language has declined sharply since 1945,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; but a [[Māori-language revitalisation effort]] slowed the decline, and the language has experienced a revival, particularly since about 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian 28 July 2018&quot;&gt;Compare: {{cite news | last1 = Roy | first1 = Eleanor Ainge | title = Google and Disney join rush to cash in as Māori goes mainstream | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/google-disney-maori-new-zealand | accessdate = 28 July 2018 | work = The Guardian | date = 28 July 2018 | quote = John McCaffery, a language expert at the University of Auckland school of education, says the language is thriving, with other indigenous peoples travelling to New Zealand to learn how Māori has made such a striking comeback. 'It has been really dramatic, the past three years in particular, Māori has gone mainstream,' he said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

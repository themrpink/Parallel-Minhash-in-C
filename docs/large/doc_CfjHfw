''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' creator [[Bill Watterson]] wrote in 2007: &quot;''Peanuts'' pretty much defines the modern comic strip, so even now it's hard to see it with fresh eyes. The clean, minimalist drawings, the sarcastic humor, the unflinching emotional honesty, the inner thoughts of a household pet, the serious treatment of children, the wild fantasies, the merchandising on an enormous scale{{snd}}in countless ways, Schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119214690326956694|title=The Grief That Made 'Peanuts' Good|first=Bill|last=Watterson|date=October 13, 2007|work=WSJ|access-date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peanuts''''' is a [[print syndication|syndicated]] [[daily strip|daily]] and [[Sunday strip|Sunday]] American [[comic strip]] written and illustrated by [[Charles M. Schulz]] that ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. ''Peanuts'' is among the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with 17,897 strips published in all,&lt;ref name=Bethune&gt;{{cite journal|title=The man who recalled everything|journal=Maclean's|date=October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it &quot;arguably the longest story ever told by one human being&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snoopy Moments&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Of The Best Snoopy Moments To Celebrate 'Peanuts' 63rd Anniversary|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/peanuts-anniversary_n_4025927.html|work=3 October 2013|publisher=Huff Post Arts &amp; Culture|accessdate=October 3, 2013|first=Katherine|last=Brooks|date=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peanuts |last=Ray |first=Michael |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=''Peanuts''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Schulz's death in 2000, ''Peanuts'' ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of around 355&amp;nbsp;million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saying Goodbye: Friends and family eulogize cartoonist Charles Schulz|date=February 22, 2000|first=Kaycee J.|last=Hofer|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helped to cement the [[Yonkoma|four-panel gag strip]] as the standard in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The comics: since 1945|first=Brian|last=Walker|year=2002|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Bethune/&gt;

''Peanuts'' focuses entirely on a social circle of young children, where adults [[unseen character|exist but are never seen and rarely heard]]. The main character, [[Charlie Brown]], is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite, win a [[baseball]] game, or kick a [[Football (ball)|football]] held by his irascible friend Lucy, who always pulls it away at the last instant.&lt;ref&gt;''The World Encyclopedia of Comics,'' edited by [[Maurice Horn]], published in 1977 by Avon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peanuts'' is one of the literate strips with philosophical, psychological, and sociological overtones that flourished in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = comic strip :: The first half of the 20th century: the evolution of the form|url = http://www.britannica.com/art/comic-strip/The-first-half-of-the-20th-century-the-evolution-of-the-form|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peanuts''{{'}}s humor is psychologically complex, and the characters' interactions formed a tangle of relationships that drove it.

''Peanuts'' achieved considerable success with its [[Peanuts animated specials|television specials]], several of which, including ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1965/1965_1966emmy.htm |title=ENVELOPE |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 7, 1965 |accessdate=May 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103171851/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1965/1965_1966emmy.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1966/1966_1967emmy.htm |title=ENVELOPE |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 7, 1965 |accessdate=May 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103171903/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1966/1966_1967emmy.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; won or were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = ''Peanuts'' was originally sold under the title of ''Li'l Folks'', but that had been used before, so they said we have to think of another title. I couldn't think of one and somebody at United Features came up with the miserable title ''Peanuts'', which I hate and have always hated. It has no dignity and it's not descriptive. [...] What could I do? Here I was, an unknown kid from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. I couldn't think of anything else. I said, why don't we call it ''Charlie Brown'' and the president said &quot;Well, we can't copyright a name like that.&quot; I didn't ask them about ''[[Nancy (comic strip)|Nancy]]'' or ''[[Steve Canyon]]''.

''Peanuts'' had its origin in ''[[Li'l Folks]]'', a weekly panel cartoon that appeared in Schulz's hometown newspaper, the ''[[Twin Cities Pioneer Press|St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'', from 1947 to 1950. Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to ''Peanuts''. The name &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.{{sfn|Bang|2004|p=5}}

Schulz submitted his ''Li'l Folks'' cartoons to [[United Features Syndicate]] (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in [[New York City]] and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as ''Li'l Folk'', that is ''Li'l Folks'' without an 's', Tack Knight who authored the retired 1930s comic strip ''Little Folks'' sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of ''Little'' to ''Li'l'' was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that ''Little Folks'' was a registered trademark.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=218}} Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program ''[[Howdy Doody]]''. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the &quot;Peanut Gallery&quot;, and were referred to as &quot;Peanuts&quot;. This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=219}}

Schulz hated the title ''Peanuts'', which remained a source of irritation to him throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having even seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named &quot;Peanuts&quot;.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=56}} On the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried ''Peanuts'', to which the newsdealer replied, &quot;no, and we don't have any with popcorn either&quot;; this event confirmed his fears concerning the title.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=87}} Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say &quot;I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog&quot;.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=221}} In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to ''Charlie Brown'' on multiple occasions in the past, but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=216}}

==History==

===1950s===
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of First Peanuts comic.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:First Peanuts comic.png for rationale --&gt;
[[File:First Peanuts comic.png|thumb|500px|The first strip from October 2, 1950. From left to right: Charlie Brown, Shermy, and Patty]]

The strip began as a [[Daily comic strip|daily strip]] on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers: ''[[Minneapolis Tribune]]'', the hometown newspaper of Schulz; ''[[The Washington Post]]''; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''; ''[[The Denver Post]]''; ''[[The Seattle Times]]''; and two newspapers in [[Pennsylvania]], ''Evening Chronicle'' ([[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]) and ''Globe-Times'' ([[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]).{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=220}} The first strip was four panels long and showed Charlie Brown walking by two other young children, Shermy and Patty. Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic strip reference|cartoonist=[[Charles Schulz|Schulz, Charles]]|strip=Peanuts|date=October 4, 1950|syndicate=United Feature Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first [[Sunday strip]] appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), &quot;[[Peppermint Patty|Peppermint]]&quot; Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968) Woodstock (introduced April 1967; officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).

Schulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of ''Peanuts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Nat Gertler |authorlink=Nat Gertler |title=Dale Hale and the 'Peanuts' Comic Book: The Interview | magazine=Hogan's Alley |issue=8 |date=October 2000 |publisher=Cartoonician.com}} Republished in ''[http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/ Hogan's Alley blog]'' by Tom Heintjes, May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing &quot;its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Masters&quot;&gt;''Masters of American Comics'' John Carlin Yale University Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: &quot;This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ |title=Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning &amp;#124; Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date=May 17, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or [[Rugby union ball|rugby football]]. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. &lt;!--need facts for the entire paragraph--&gt;

===1960s===
The 1960s is generally considered to be the &quot;golden age&quot; for ''Peanuts''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; During this period, some of the strip's best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, August 22, 1966 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snoopy as the &quot;World War One Flying Ace&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 10, 1965 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/10/10|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frieda and her &quot;naturally curly hair&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, March 06, 1961 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/03/06|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, July 29, 1968 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/29|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peanuts'' is remarkable for its deft [[social commentary]], especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty's athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin's presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin's creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz's 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015). [http://www.snopes.com/charlie-brown-racist-franklin/ &quot;You're a Racist, Charlie Brown?: A closer look at allegations of racism in the comic strip 'Peanuts'&quot;]. [[Snopes.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;) The fact that Charlie Brown's baseball team had three girls on it was also at least ten years ahead of its time. The 1966 prime time television special ''[[Charlie Brown's All Stars!]]'' dealt with Charlie Brown refusing sponsorship of his team on the condition he fire the girls and Snoopy, because the league does not allow girls or dogs to play.&lt;!--need facts for the entire paragraph--&gt;

Schulz threw satirical barbs at any number of topics when he chose. Over the years he tackled everything from the [[Vietnam War]] to school dress codes to &quot;[[New Math]].&quot; One strip on May 20, 1962, even had an icon that stated &quot;Defend Freedom, Buy US Savings Bonds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, May 20, 1962 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1962/05/20|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he added a little boy named &quot;5&quot; to the cast,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, September 30, 1963 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1963/09/30|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose sisters were named &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 01, 1963 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1963/10/01|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose father had changed their [[family name]] to their [[ZIP Code]], giving in to the way numbers were taking over people's identities. In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2's launch of [[Laika]] the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned [[Little League]]s and &quot;organized&quot; play when all the neighborhood kids join [[snowman]]-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.&lt;!--need facts for the entire paragraph--&gt;

''Peanuts'' touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' from 1965, features the character [[Linus van Pelt]] quoting the [[King James Version]] of the Bible (Luke 2:8–14) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', many have interpreted Schulz's work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/ |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=[[ImageTexT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown's beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with Sally.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}&lt;ref name=Snopes/&gt;

===1970s–1990s===
In 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily ''Peanuts'' strips were formatted in a four-panel &quot;space saving&quot; format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on [[Leap Day]] in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Schulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process.&lt;ref&gt;Yoe, Craig, ''Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings.'' San Francisco, Calif.: Last Gasp, 2007, p. 36; Michaelis, David, ''Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography.'' New York: HarperPerennial, 2008, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Each sentence of this section requires separate citations/references:  Starting in the 1980s his artistic line started to shake. This became more noticeable in the 1990s, along with his format change; depending on one's view, the art deteriorated at this point, especially where character expression was concerned, however this is highly subjective and difficult to estimate.--&gt;

In the late 1970s, during Schulz's negotiations with [[United Feature Syndicate]] over a new contract, syndicate president William C. Payette hired superhero comic artist [[Al Plastino]] to draw a backlog of ''Peanuts'' strips to hold in reserve in case Schulz left the strip. When Schulz and the syndicate reached a successful agreement, United Media stored these unpublished strips, the existence of which eventually became public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Comic Book Legends Revealed #401 | first = Brian | last = Cronin |date = January 11, 2013 | website = [[Comic Book Resources]] | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/11/comic-book-legends-revealed-401/ | accessdate = May 7, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130116063259/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/11/comic-book-legends-revealed-401/ | archivedate = January 16, 2013 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastino himself also claimed to have ghostwritten for Schulz while Schulz underwent heart surgery in 1983.&lt;ref name=Al&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alplastino.com/alplastino/About_Al.html |title=About Al|publisher=Al Plastino (official site) | archivedate= July 7, 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707115920/http://www.alplastino.com/alplastino/About_Al.html | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and the 1990s, the strip remained the most popular comic in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.4to40.com/recordbook/index.asp?id=322&amp;category=human | title=Most Syndicated Comic Strip, Peanuts, Charles Schulz, USA | accessdate=June 9, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181330/http://www.4to40.com/recordbook/index.asp?id=322&amp;category=human | archive-date=September 30, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though other comics, such as ''[[Garfield]]'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', rivaled ''Peanuts'' in popularity. Schulz continued to write the strip until announcing his retirement on December 14, 1999, due to his failing health.

===2000: End of ''Peanuts''===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Last peanuts comic.png|thumb|Final [[Sunday strip]], which came out February 13, 2000: a day after the death of Charles M. Schulz]]

The final daily original ''Peanuts'' comic strip was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that ran past January 3, he had drawn five Sunday strips that had yet to run. The first of these appeared six days after the last daily, on January 9.

On February 13, 2000, the day after Schulz's death, the last-ever new ''Peanuts'' strip ran in papers. Three panels long, it begins with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the other end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responds with &quot;No, I think he's writing.&quot; The next panel shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter addressed to &quot;Dear Friends&quot;. The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to fans, which reads as follows:

''{{quote|Dear Friends,&lt;br/&gt;
''I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition.&lt;br/&gt;
''Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip. My family does not wish &quot;Peanuts&quot; to be [[Zombie strip|continued by anyone else]], therefore I am announcing my retirement.&lt;br/&gt;
''I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip.&lt;br/&gt;
''Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy ... how can I ever forget them ... &lt;br/&gt;
— Charles M. Schulz}}''

Many other cartoonists paid tribute to ''Peanuts'' and Schulz by homages in their own strips, appearing on February 13, 2000, or in the week beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=May 28, 2000 | title=Comic strips hail spark of 'Peanuts' creator | newspaper=[[Deseret News]] | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/762780/Comic-strips-hail-spark-of-Peanuts-creator.html | access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic was reprinted the day after that, but only had the farewell letter. After ''Peanuts'' ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title ''Classic Peanuts''. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.

''Peanuts'' continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of ''The Complete Peanuts'', the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]''. Additionally, [[BOOM! Studios]] has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.

Universal Uclick's website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015 that they would be launching &quot;Peanuts Begins&quot;, a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form. This was done to honor the 65th anniversary of the strip's debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gocomics.com/2015/01/new-comic-alert-peanuts-begins-by-charles-schulz-.html|title=New Comic Alert!

==Characters==

===Charlie Brown===
{{Main|Charlie Brown}}

Charlie Brown is a young boy. He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip's world and serving as an [[everyman]].{{sfn|Boxer|2015}}{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Warner|2018}} While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an [[inferiority complex]]. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully build a kite.{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can either be interpreted as self-defeating stubbornness, or admirable persistence. When he fails however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity.{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} The journalist [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] observed this tension between Charlie Brown's negative and positive attitudes, stating: &quot;What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth.&quot;{{sfn|Caldwell 2000}} Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at [[Art Instruction Schools|Art Instruction]], whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=38}}

Readers and critics have explored the question as to whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behaviour of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz's own life or childhood experiences.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=44}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview that &quot;I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I'm really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.&quot;{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=62}} He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz's &quot;wishy-washiness and determination&quot;.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=258}} Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=65}}

===Snoopy===
{{Main|Snoopy}}

Snoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a [[beagle]].{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=387}} While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=389}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=172}} He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through alter egos. Many are throwaway alter egos, such as a &quot;World-Famous&quot; magician, attorney, or surgeon.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}} His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while also being slightly selfish.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=391}} He has an arrogant committent to his independence, but is shown to be dependent on humans.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}} Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog, and that of a fantastical character.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=50}} While the inside of Snoopy's doghouse is described in the strip as being adorned with paintings of [[Andrew Wyeth|Wyeth]] and [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of [[suspension of disbelief]] from readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=25}}

===Linus and Lucy===
{{Main|Linus van Pelt|Lucy van Pelt}}

Linus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother and Lucy is the older sister.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=70}}

Lucy is bossy and opinionated, and is used to deliver commentary on offence and honesty, as well as sarcasm.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=196}} Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but having the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=52}} He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=45}} Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and gives psychiatric advice to another character from her &quot;psychiatric booth&quot;, a booth parodying the setup of a [[lemonade stand]].{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=89}} Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist [[Athar Yawar]] playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterised as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting &quot;Lucy is very much the modern doctor&quot;.{{sfn|Yawar|2015}}

Linus introduces intellectual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, and [[theology]]. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be &quot;very smart&quot; as well as &quot;dumb&quot;.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|pp=252–253}} He has a tendency of expressing pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}} He finds psychological security from [[thumb sucking]] and holding a blanket for comfort, referred to as his &quot;security blanket&quot;. The idea of his security blanket originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus' blanket as &quot;probably the single best thing that I ever thought of&quot;. He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase &quot;security blanket&quot; entered the dictionary.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=91}}

===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===
{{Main|Peppermint Patty|Marcie}}

Peppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends with each other. They attend a different school from Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}}

Peppermint Patty is a [[tomboy]] who is forthright, loyal, and has what Schulz described as a &quot;devastating singleness of purpose&quot;.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that it serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepares for a &quot;skating&quot; competition, only to learn with disastrous results that it is for [[roller skating]] and not [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=94}} She struggles at school and with her homework, and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.{{sfn|J Schulz|2016}}

Marcie is bookish, and a good student.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}} Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that &quot;she sees the truth in things&quot;.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as &quot;the unassuming one with sage-like insights&quot;.{{sfn|Bradley|2015}}

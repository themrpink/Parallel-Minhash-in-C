The [[Warren Court]] made a series of rulings that helped bring an end to the McCarthyism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, the Warren Court heard the case of ''[[Slochower v. Board of Education]]''. Harry Slochower was a professor at Brooklyn College who had been fired by New York City for invoking the Fifth Amendment when McCarthy's committee questioned him about his past membership in the Communist Party. The court prohibited such actions, ruling &quot;...we must condemn the practice of imputing a sinister meaning to the exercise of a person's constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment…  The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 1956 ''Cole v. Young'' ruling also greatly weakened the ability to discriminate in the federal civilian workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/351/536/|title= Cole v. Young 351 U.S. 536 (1956)|work= Justia|access-date= 2016-10-01|archive-date= 2019-03-27|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190327162048/https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/351/536/|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key decision was in the 1957 case ''[[Yates v. United States]]'', in which the convictions of fourteen Communists were reversed. In Justice Black's opinion, he wrote of the original &quot;Smith Act&quot; trials: &quot;The testimony of witnesses is comparatively insignificant. Guilt or innocence may turn on what Marx or Engels or someone else wrote or advocated as much as a hundred years or more ago…  When the propriety of obnoxious or unfamiliar view about government is in reality made the crucial issue, …prejudice makes conviction inevitable except in the rarest circumstances.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1957, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'', curtailing the power of HUAC to punish uncooperative witnesses by finding them in contempt of Congress. Justice Warren wrote in the decision: &quot;The mere summoning of a witness and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be disastrous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/354/178.html full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614022238/https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/354/178.html |date=2018-06-14 }}, ''Caselaw'', Findlaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1958 decision in ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'', the Supreme Court halted the [[State Department]] from using the authority of its own regulations to refuse or revoke passports based on an applicant's communist beliefs or associations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
The political divisions McCarthyism created in the United States continue to make themselves manifest, and the politics and history of anti-communism in the United States are still contentious. Portions of the massive security apparatus established during the McCarthy era still exist. [[Loyalty oath]]s are still required by the [[California Constitution]] for all officials and employees of the [[government of California]] (which is highly problematic for [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Jehovah's Witness]]es whose beliefs preclude them from pledging absolute loyalty to the state).&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, Richard C. (May 11, 2008), [http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-05-11/news/17152368_1_loyalty-oath-wendy-gonaver-speech-and-religious-freedom &quot;Loyalty oath poses ethical dilemmas&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707063049/http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-05-11/news/17152368_1_loyalty-oath-wendy-gonaver-speech-and-religious-freedom |date=2012-07-07 }}, ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, a few portions of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] remain in effect.

A number of observers have compared the oppression of liberals and leftists during the McCarthy period to recent actions against suspected terrorists, most of them Muslims. In ''The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism'', author Haynes Johnson compares the &quot;abuses suffered by aliens thrown into high-security U.S. prisons in the wake of 9/11&quot; to the excesses of the McCarthy era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Johnson, Haynes | title = The Age of Anxiety: McCarthyism to Terrorism | url = https://archive.org/details/ageofanxietymcca00john_0 | url-access = registration | publisher =Harcourt | year =2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/ageofanxietymcca00john_0/page/471 471] | isbn = 0-15-101062-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[David D. Cole]] has written that the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] &quot;in effect resurrects the philosophy of McCarthyism, simply substituting 'terrorist' for 'communist'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, David, &quot;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011217/cole National Security State] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211044858/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011217/cole |date=2007-02-11 }}&quot;, ''The Nation'' (December 17, 2001). See also Cole, David, &quot;The New McCarthyism: Repeating History in the War on Terrorism&quot;, ''Harvard Civil Rights–Civil Liberties Law Review'' 38, no. 1 (Winter 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the opposite pole, conservative writer [[Ann Coulter]] devotes much of her book ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism|Treason]]'' to drawing parallels between past opposition to McCarthy and McCarthyism and the policies and beliefs of modern-day liberals, arguing that the former hindered the anti-communist cause and the latter hinder the [[War on Terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Coulter, Ann | title = Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism | publisher = Three Rivers Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-4000-5032-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/treason00annc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who have drawn on a comparison between current [[Anti-terrorism legislation#United States|anti-terrorism policies]] and McCarthyism include [[Geoffrey R. Stone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Geoffrey R.

McCarthyism also attracts controversy purely as a historical issue. Through declassified documents from Soviet archives and [[Venona project]] decryptions of coded Soviet messages, the Soviet Union was found to have engaged in substantial espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s. The [[Communist Party USA]] also was substantially funded and its policies controlled by the Soviet Union, and accusations existed that CPUSA members were often recruited as spies.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Joshua, [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=exhuming_mccarthy &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot;]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''American Prospect'' 10, no. 43 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of some contemporary commentators, these revelations stand as at least a partial vindication of McCarthyism.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Aaronovitch]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7hhf McCarthy: There Were Reds Under the Bed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330094927/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7hhf |date=2015-03-30 }} ''[[BBC Radio 4]]'' airdate 9 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that a genuinely dangerous subversive element was in the United States, and that this danger justified extreme measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg&quot; /&gt; [[John Earl Haynes]], while acknowledging that inexcusable excesses occurred during McCarthyism, argues that some contemporary historians of McCarthyism underplay the undemocratic nature of the CPUSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Haynes  | first = John Earl  | author-link = John Earl Haynes  | title = Reflections on Ellen Schrecker and Maurice Isserman's essay, &quot;The Right's Cold War Revision&quot;  | url = http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page47.html  | access-date = 2010-09-09  | archive-date = 2015-03-15  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150315132843/http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page47.html  | url-status = live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter concern being shared by some [[Trotskyites]] who felt that they, and anti-Stalin socialists in general, were persecuted by the CPUSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trotskyites&quot;&gt;Shannon Jones [http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/mar1999/crim-m24.shtml Account of McCarthy period slanders socialist opponents of Stalinism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927013752/http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/mar1999/crim-m24.shtml |date=2012-09-27 }} [[International Committee of the Fourth International]] 24 March 1999&lt;br /&gt;''Any serious assessment of McCarthyism must consider fore and center the criminal role played by the Stalinist Communist Party, which, by associating socialism with terrible crimes against the working class, helped create the political climate in which red-baiting could flourish.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing view holds that, recent revelations notwithstanding, by the time McCarthyism began in the late 1940s, the CPUSA was an ineffectual fringe group, and the damage done to U.S. interests by Soviet spies after World War II was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Theoharis, Athan  | title = Chasing Spies: How the FBI Failed in Counter-Intelligence But Promoted the Politics of McCarthyism in the Cold War Years  | publisher = Ivan R.

===Later use of the term===
Since the time of McCarthy, the word ''McCarthyism'' has entered American speech as a general term for a variety of practices: aggressively questioning a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting [[civil and political rights]] in the name of national security, and the use of [[demagoguery]] are all often referred to as ''McCarthyism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Jack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/books/president-vs-demagogue.html |title=President vs. Demagogue |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 7, 1984 |access-date=December 20, 2017 |archive-date=September 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904111135/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/books/president-vs-demagogue.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boot |first=Max |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/joseph-mccarthy-by-arthur-herman-9160 |title=Joseph McCarthy by Arthur Herman |journal=Commentary |date=April 2000 |access-date=April 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721122049/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/joseph-mccarthy-by-arthur-herman-9160 |archive-date=July 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/7603.html |author=What Qualifies as Demagoguery? |title=What Qualifies as Demagoguery? |publisher=History News Network |date=October 19, 2004 |access-date=December 20, 2017 |archive-date=July 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725015101/http://hnn.us/articles/7603.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1951 novel ''[[The Troubled Air]]'' by [[Irwin Shaw]] tells the story of the director of a (fictional) radio show, broadcast live at the time, who is given a deadline to investigate his cast for alleged links to communism. The novel recounts the devastating effects on all concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openroadmedia.com/ebook/the-troubled-air/|title=The Troubled Air|publisher=Open Road Media|access-date=2016-09-09|archive-date=2016-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911193938/http://www.openroadmedia.com/ebook/the-troubled-air/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 [[Arthur Miller]] play ''[[The Crucible]]'' used the [[Salem witch trials]] as a metaphor for McCarthyism, suggesting that the process of McCarthyism-style persecution can occur at any time or place. The play focused on the fact that once accused, a person had little chance of exoneration, given the irrational and circular reasoning of both the courts and the public. Miller later wrote: &quot;The more I read into the Salem panic, the more it touched off corresponding images of common experiences in the fifties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Arthur |date=October 21, 1996 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/10/21/1996_10_21_158_TNY_CARDS_000373902 |title=Why I Wrote The Crucible |magazine=The New Yorker |access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928033947/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/10/21/1996_10_21_158_TNY_CARDS_000373902 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1976 film ''[[The Front]]'' starring [[Woody Allen]] dealt with the McCarthy-era Hollywood blacklist. The film was made by those blacklisted: producer and director [[Martin Ritt]]; writer [[Walter Bernstein]]; and actors [[Zero Mostel]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]], [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]], [[Lloyd Gough]], and [[Joshua Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/mccarthy/blacklist.html|title=The Hollywood Blacklist|last=Georgakas|first=Dan|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-08-15|archive-date=2018-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826102811/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/mccarthy/blacklist.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Guilty by Suspicion]]'' is a 1991 American drama film about the Hollywood blacklist, McCarthyism, and the activities of the HUAC. Written and directed by Irwin Winkler, it starred [[Robert De Niro]], [[Annette Bening]], and [[George Wendt]].

The 2005 film ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' by [[George Clooney]] starred [[David Strathairn]] as broadcast journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] and contained archival footage of McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4949041|title='Good Night and Good Luck': Murrow vs. McCarthy|website=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-date=2017-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111018/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4949041|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Lombardy'' comes from ''Lombard'', which in turn is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Longobardus, Langobardus}}'' (&quot;a Lombard&quot;), derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] elements ''*langaz + *bardaz''; equivalent to ''long beard''. Some scholars suggest the second element instead derives from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*bardǭ, *barduz'' (&quot;axe&quot;), related to German ''{{lang|de| Barte}}'' (&quot;axe&quot;) or that the whole word comes from the [[Proto-Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]] *''Lum bardhi'' &quot;white river&quot; (Compare modern [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''lum i bardhë'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Partridge 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=Origins: an etymological dictionary of modern English|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415474337|edition=[Paperback ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early Middle Ages, &quot;Lombardy&quot; referred to the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] ({{lang-la|Regnum Langobardorum}}), a kingdom ruled by the [[List of ancient Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Lombards]] who had controlled most of Italy since [[Lombard invasion of Italy|their invasion]] of [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Byzantine Italy]] in 568. As such &quot;Lombardy&quot; and &quot;Italy&quot; were almost interchangeable; by the mid-8th century the Lombards ruled everywhere except the [[Papal States|Papal possessions around Rome]] (roughly modern [[Lazio]] and northern [[Umbria]]), [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and some [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] possessions in the south (southern [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]; some coastal settlements including [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]] and [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]]; [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]). The Kingdom was divided between [[Longobardia Major]] in the north and [[Langobardia Minor]] in the south by the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] (roughly [[Romagna]] and northern [[Marche]], and initially also [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] and [[Liguria]]) until the 8th century and later the Papacy (which was initially part of the Exarchate). During the late Middle Ages, after the fall of the northern part of the Kingdom to [[Charlemagne]], the term shifted to mean [[Northern Italy]]. (''See: [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)]]''). The term was also used until around 965 in the form {{lang|el|Λογγοβαρδία}} (''{{transl|el|Longobardia}}'') as the name for [[Longobardia|the territory]] roughly covering modern Apulia which the Byzantines had recovered from the Lombard [[rump state|rump]] [[Duchy of Benevento]].

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Lombardy}}

With a surface of {{convert|23861|km²|0|abbr=on}}, Lombardy is the [[Regions of Italy|fourth-largest region of Italy]]. It is bordered by [[Switzerland]] (north: [[Canton Ticino]] and [[Grisons|Canton Graubünden]]) and by the Italian regions of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] and [[Veneto]] (east), [[Emilia-Romagna]] (south), and [[Piedmont]] (west). Three distinct natural zones can be easily distinguished in Lombardy: mountains, hills, and plains—the last being divided into ''Alta'' (high plains) and ''Bassa'' (low plains).

===Soils===

The [[orography]] of Lombardy is characterised by the presence of three distinct belts: a northern mountainous belt constituted by the Alpine relief, a central piedmont area of mostly pebbly soils of alluvial origin, and the Lombard section of the [[Padan Plain]] in the southernmost part of the region.

The most important mountainous area is the [[Alps|Alpine]] zone including the [[Lepontine Alps|Lepontine]] and [[Rhaetian Alps]] ([[Piz Bernina]], 4,020 m), the [[Bergamo Alps]], the [[Ortler Alps]] and the [[Adamello]] massif. It is followed by the Alpine foothills zone [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealpi]], the main peaks of which are the [[Grigna]] Group (2,410 m), [[Resegone]] (1,875 m), and [[Presolana]] (2,521 m).

The plains of Lombardy, formed by [[alluvial]] deposits, can be divided into the ''Alta—''an upper, permeable ground zone in the north—and the ''Bassa''—a lower zone dotted by the so-called line of ''fontanili'', spring waters rising from impermeable ground. Inconsistent with the three distinctions above is the small subregion of [[Oltrepò Pavese]], formed by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] foothills beyond the [[Po (river)|Po River]].

===Hydrography===

The mighty [[Po river]] marks the southern border of the region for a length of about {{convert|210|km|0|abbr=on}}. In its progress, it receives the waters of the [[Ticino River]], which rises in the [[Bedretto]] valley (Switzerland) and joins the Po near [[Pavia]]. The other streams which contribute to the great river are the [[Olona]], the [[Lambro]], the [[Adda (river)|Adda]], the [[Oglio]] and the [[Mincio]].

The numerous lakes of Lombardy, all of glacial origin, lie in the northern highlands. From west to east these are [[Lake Maggiore]], [[Lake Lugano]] (both shared with Switzerland), [[Lake Como]], [[Lake Iseo]], [[Lake Idro]], and [[Lake Garda]] (the largest lake in Italy). South of the Alps lie the hills characterised by a succession of low heights of morainic origin formed during the last [[Ice Age]] and small barely fertile plateaux with typical heaths and conifer woods. A minor mountainous area, the [[Oltrepò Pavese]], lies south of the Po, in the [[Apennines]] range.

===Flora and fauna===

In the plains, intensively cultivated for centuries, little of the original environment remains. The most common trees are [[elm]], [[alder]], [[sycamore]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]] and [[hornbeam]]. In the area of the foothills lakes, however, grow [[olive]] trees, [[cypress]]es and [[larch]]es, as well as varieties of subtropical flora such as [[magnolias]], [[azaleas]], [[acacia]]s. Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some kinds of [[saxifrage]], the Lombard garlic, groundsels bellflowers and the cottony bellflowers.

The highlands are characterised by the typical vegetation of the whole range of the [[Italian Alps]]. At lower levels (up to approximately 1,100 m), oak woods or broadleafed trees grow; on the mountain slopes (up to 2,000–2,200 m), beech trees grow at the lowest limits, with conifer woods higher up. Shrubs such as [[rhododendron]], dwarf pine and [[juniper]] are native to the summital zone (beyond 2,200 m).

Lombardy counts many protected areas: the most important are the [[Stelvio National Park]] (the largest Italian natural park), with typically alpine wildlife: [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], [[ibex]], [[chamois]], foxes, [[ermine]] and also [[golden eagle]]s; and the Ticino Valley Natural Park, instituted in 1974 on the Lombard side of the [[Ticino River]] to protect and conserve one of the last major examples of fluvial forest in [[northern Italy]].

Other Parks situated in the region are the [[Campo dei Fiori di Varese|Campo dei Fiori ]] and the Cinque Vette Park, both of them are located in the Province of [[Varese]].

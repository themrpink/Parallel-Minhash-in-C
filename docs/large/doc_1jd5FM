At the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.

When Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: &quot;By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two‑thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics&lt;/ref&gt; While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.

[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]
Mondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president—73 at the time—while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.&quot;

Mondale was defeated in a landslide, receiving 37,577,352 votes (40.6% of the popular vote), and winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data—Minnesota |access-date=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archive-date=July 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].

===Private citizen and ambassador===
Mondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.

Until his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.

Mondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate &quot;Leaders Lecture Series&quot; that ran from 1998 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===
{{Main|2002 United States Senate elections|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}
[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]
In 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.

During his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. &quot;We have seen you shift around, Norman&quot;, Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.

Mondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election; George McGovern also lost statewide elections in all 50 states, 49 of them as a major party nominee in the 1972 presidential election, but the only statewide election he lost in Massachusetts was the ''primary'' in 1984). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, &quot;At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/mondale-concedes-to-coleman|title=Mondale Concedes to Coleman|publisher=[[Fox News]] |access-date=28 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the [[Constitution Project]]'s bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&amp;categoryId=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814000144/http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&amp;categoryId=6|date=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127223358/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039|date=November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.

Following the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2004]] and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen talking with [[Al Franken]] about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for Senate in 2008 in the documentary ''[[Al Franken: God Spoke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Al Franken: God Spoke'' at the Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman's allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him. Franken ultimately ran and won the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008 Senate election]] by 312 votes, with Coleman contesting the election results until June 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/senate/42221767.html|title=Senate recount trial: Judges' ruling is boon to Franken|work=Star Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondale and Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] stood with Franken in the [[United States Senate chamber]] when Franken was sworn in on July 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Democrat Franken sworn in as Minnesota senator|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8024266&amp;page=1|last=Kim|first=Seung Min|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=ABC News|language=en|access-date=May 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mondale then stood again with Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] when [[Tina Smith]] was sworn in on January 3, 2018. He endorsed Klobuchar for president in February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4567736-mondale-backs-klobuchar-bid-former-vp-likes-senators-chances&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
His wife, [[Joan Mondale]], was a national advocate for the arts and was the Honorary Chairman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities during the Carter Administration. On February 3, 2014, she died at a hospice in Minneapolis surrounded by members of their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/02/03/news/joan-mondale-obit |title=Joan Mondale, wife of former VP Walter, dies at 83 |publisher=Mprnews.org |date=December 15, 2011 |access-date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mondales' eldest son [[Ted Mondale|Ted]] is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Nazca Solutions, a technology fulfillment venture. He is also a former Minnesota state senator. In 1998, Ted Mondale unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Minnesota governor, running as a fiscal moderate who had distanced himself from labor.

The Mondales' daughter, [[Eleanor Mondale|Eleanor]], was a television personality. She also had radio talk shows in [[Chicago]] and a long-running program on [[WCCO (AM)]] in [[Minneapolis]]. She died of brain cancer at her home in Minnesota on September 17, 2011, at age 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-mondale-kennedy-obits-story,0,3709527.story |title=Kara Kennedy, Eleanor Mondale dead at 51 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=September 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918212020/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-mondale-kennedy-obits-story,0,3709527.story |archive-date=September 18, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their younger son is William Hall Mondale, former assistant [[Attorney General of Minnesota]] (1990–2000).

Mondale has a residence near [[Lake of the Isles]] in Minneapolis. He is a [[Presbyterian]]. He enjoys fishing, reading [[Shakespeare]] and historical accounts, barbecuing, skiing, watching ''[[Monty Python]]'', and playing tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnc.net/norway/Mondale.htm|title=Biography of Walter F. Mondale|work=mnc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mondale has maintained strong ties to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]]. In 2002 the school renamed its building Walter F. Mondale Hall. Mondale has contributed cameo appearances to the law school's annual T.O.R.T. (&quot;Theater of the Relatively Talentless&quot;) productions and has allowed his name to be used as the nickname of the school's hockey team: the &quot;Fighting Mondales&quot;.

Mondale has deep connections to his ancestral [[Norway]]. Upon entering the Senate in 1964, he took over the seat of vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]], another [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian-American]]. In later years, Mondale served on the executive committee of the Peace Prize Forum, an annual conference co-sponsored by the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] and five Midwestern colleges of Norwegian heritage. During Norway's Centennial Celebration in 2005, he chaired the committee to promote and develop cultural activities between Norway and Norwegian-American organizations.

On December 5, 2007, Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] announced that Mondale would be named Honorary Consul-General of Norway, representing the Norwegian state in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ud/Press-Contacts/News/2007/mondale_gc.html?id=493351|title=Walter Mondale to be new Consul General in Minneapolis|work=Government.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Mondale, who lost both his wife and daughter to brain diseases, was awarded the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the [[American Academy of Neurology]] for raising awareness for brain health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Former Vice President Walter Mondale Receives Public Leadership in Neurology Award|url=https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/1374|access-date=2020-11-20|website=www.aan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People who have portrayed Mondale in visual media==
* [[Bill Murray]] played Mondale on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the late 1970s, as did [[Gary Kroeger]], [[Dana Carvey]], and [[Jon Lovitz]] in the mid‑1980s.
* In the 1998 [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', Mondale is portrayed by [[John Slattery]].

===Formation and the Football League (1874−1920)===
Aston Villa Football Club were formed in March 1874, by members of the Villa Cross [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] Chapel in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] which is now part of [[Birmingham]]. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2007/11/26/cup-presented-to-aston-villa-founder-member-jack-hughes-is-back-with-his-family-97319-20162107/ |title=Cup presented to Aston Villa founder member Jack Hughes is back with his family |first=Nick |last=McCarthy |date=26 November 2007 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125091142/http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2007/11/26/cup-presented-to-aston-villa-founder-member-jack-hughes-is-back-with-his-family-97319-20162107/ |archive-date=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aston Villa's first match was against the local [[St Mary's Church, Aston Brook|Aston Brook St Mary's]] [[Rugby football|Rugby]] team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to the [[Wellington Road (Perry Barr)|Wellington Road]] ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]] in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman [[George Ramsay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015041500/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0%2C%2C10265%2C00.html |archive-date=15 October 2007 |title=Aston Villa Hall of Fame |publisher=Aston Villa F.C |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0,,10265,00.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AVilla1899.jpg|thumb|right|The Aston Villa team of 1899 that won the First Division and [[Sheriff of London Charity Shield]] (shared with Queen's Park) as well as a number of [[County Football Association|county cup honours.]]]]

The club won their first FA Cup in 1887 with captain [[Archie Hunter]] becoming one of the game's first household names. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the club's directors, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]] being the league's founder. Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward192&quot;&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, the year Villa won [[Double (association football)|The Double]], they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters coined the name &quot;Villa Park&quot;; no official declaration listed the ground as [[Villa Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Dean; p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ups and downs (1920–1964)===
Aston Villa won their sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline that led to Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This was largely the result of a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] [[Ted Drake]] in an [[Aston Villa 1–7 Arsenal (14 December 1935)|infamous 1–7 defeat]] at Villa Park.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player [[Alex Massie]] for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, [[Eric Houghton]] led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager [[Joe Mercer]] Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relegations and revival in the 80s (1964–1992)===
Mercer's forced retirement from the club in 1964 signalled a period of deep turmoil. The most successful club in England was struggling to keep pace with changes in the modern game, with Villa being relegated for the third time, under manager [[Dick Taylor (football manager)|Dick Taylor]] in 1967. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked [[Tommy Cummings]] (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100&quot;&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who also brought in [[Doug Ellis]] as chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100&quot; /&gt; However, new ownership could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time at the end of the [[1969–70 in English football|1969–70]] season. However, Villa gradually began to recover under the management of former club captain [[Vic Crowe]]. In the [[1971–72 in English football|1971–72 season]] they returned to the Second Division as Champions with a record 70 points.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Ron Saunders]] was appointed manager. His brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, at the end of season 1974–75, he had taken them back into the First Division and into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:82team.jpg|thumb|left|The 1982 European Cup winning squad celebrate the 25th anniversary of their win.|alt=In the foreground is two men holding a large cup, they have claret scarves and a medal around their necks. Around them are ten old players in suits with medals and scarves around their necks]]
Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team. This culminated in a seventh top-flight league title in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]]. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Saunders quit halfway through the [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]] who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1982 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in [[Rotterdam]] courtesy of a [[Peter Withe]] goal. The following season Villa were crowned [[1982 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]] winners, beating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 3–1 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s, culminating in relegation in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by promotion the following year under [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] and a runners-up position in the First Division in the 1989–90 season.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===24 years in the Premier League (1992–2016)===
Villa were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of the Nineties however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved [[UEFA Cup]] qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the last game to be played at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fchd.info/ASTONVIL.HTM |title=Aston Villa |work=Football Club History Database |publisher=Richard Rundle |accessdate=19 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229080020/http://www.fchd.info/ASTONVIL.HTM |archive-date=29 December 2012 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea claim FA Cup glory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_cup/756784.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=20 May 2000 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010152703/http://www.fchd.btinternet.co.uk/ASTONVIL.HTM |archive-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again Villa's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when [[David O'Leary]] left in acrimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5196872.stm |title=O'Leary parts company with Villa |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 September 2008 |date=19 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011091056/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/5196872.stm |archive-date=11 October 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman [[Randy Lerner]], owner of [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise the [[Cleveland Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5356730.stm |title=Lerner set to complete Villa deal |work=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330043727/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5356730.stm |archive-date=30 March 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager [[Martin O'Neill]] marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;new badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=407236&amp;cc=5739|title=Villa secure new kit deal with Nike|publisher=ESPNsoccernet|date=7 February 2007|accessdate=15 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108032246/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=407236|archive-date=8 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the [[2010 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8531179.stm |title=Aston Villa 1–2 Man Utd |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=28 February 2010 |work=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416102805/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/8531179.stm |archive-date=16 April 2012 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 3–0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal.

The club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villa's colours at the outset generally comprised plain shirts (white, grey or a shade of blue), with either white or black shorts. For a few years after that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a red lion embroidered on the chest were introduced by William McGregor. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club's official minute book states:

{{quote|(i) Proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen.
(ii) Proposed and seconded that Mr McGregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation.}}

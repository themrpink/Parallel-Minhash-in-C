Ross ran for [[Wyoming gubernatorial election, 1926|re-election in 1926]], with the help of [[Cecilia Hennel Hendricks]], but was narrowly defeated. She blamed her loss in part on her refusal to campaign for herself and her support for prohibition. Nevertheless, she remained active in the Democratic Party and campaigned for [[Al Smith]] in the 1928 presidential election though the two disagreed on prohibition. At the [[1928 Democrat National Convention|1928 Democratic National Convention]], she received 31 votes from ten states for vice president on the first ballot. She also gave a speech seconding Smith's nomination. After the convention, she served as vice chairman of the [[Democrat National Committee|Democratic National Committee]] and as director of the DNC Women's Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/libraryinfo/displaycase/nellietayloeross.html |title=Nellie Tayloe Ross: The First Woman Governor – Law Library – University of Wyoming |website=www.uwyo.edu |access-date=January 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106051722/http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/libraryinfo/displaycase/nellietayloeross.html |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_wyoming/col2-content/main-content-list/title_ross_nellie.default.html |title=Governor Nellie Tayloe Ross |website=www.nga.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Director of U.S. Mint ==
[[File:Nellie Tayloe Ross medal.png|thumb|Ross, as seen on her Mint medal designed by Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]]]]

=== Appointment by FDR ===
U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Ross as director of the U.S. Mint on May 3, 1933, making her the first woman to hold that position.{{sfn|Burdette 2014|p=30}} Ross and the Mint's Assistant Director [[Mary Margaret O'Reilly]], &quot;the Sweetheart of the Treasury&quot; who had worked at the Mint since 1904, had mutual suspicions to overcome.{{sfn|Scheer|p=182}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sweet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweetheart Of The Treasury |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F11F93D5F1B7A93C5A9178AD95F4C8385F9  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 7, 1938 }}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross, who had endured poor relations with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and others on FDR's campaign, did not trust the career staff. O'Reilly saw another political appointee with no experience at the Mint Bureau replacing [[Robert J. Grant]], who had been [[Denver Mint]] superintendent before his directorship.{{sfn|Scheer|p=182}} After a brief period, the two women came to appreciate each other's merits.{{sfn|Scheer|p=183}}

=== Tenure ===
Ross and O'Reilly soon came to the usual division of labor between director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked on a tour of the mints) &quot;I am so anxious to have your mind at ease about the office here [in Washington] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams.  They are so much more direct and up to date than letters&amp;nbsp;... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions.&quot;{{sfn|Scheer|pp=183–184}} Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Ross, suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.{{sfn|Scheer|pp=176, 184}}

=== O'Reilly's retirement ===
In 1935, O'Reilly reached the mandatory federal retirement age of 70. Ross requested that President Roosevelt exempt O'Reilly from mandatory retirement because her knowledge of bureau affairs was so extensive and was badly needed. A special order of President Roosevelt gave O'Reilly an extra year in the Mint Service. During the extension, Ross hired Frank Leland Howard of the [[University of Virginia]], who had a background in accounting, as O'Reilly's prospective replacement. Howard replaced O'Reilly when she retired on October 29, 1938, after two more extensions.{{sfn|Burdette 2014|pp=32–33}}

=== Legacy ===
Ross' tenure saw the Mint in 1944 investigate how several [[1933 double eagle]]s, never officially released, had come onto the market.{{sfn|Burdette 2014|p=33}} She is known for establishing the [[Franklin half dollar]] and starting the making of [[proof coin]]s for public sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/blog/kpr-staff/female-firsts-april-24-2015|title=Female Firsts – April 24, 2015|date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross served five full terms until her retirement in 1953 and was succeeded by [[William H. Brett]], whom President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] nominated in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: William H. Brett, 95, Former Mint Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/13/obituaries/william-h-brett-95-former-mint-director.html|access-date=October 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years and death ==
After her retirement, Ross contributed articles to various women's magazines and traveled extensively. She made her last trip to Wyoming in 1972 at the age of ninety-six. Five years later, she died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 101; at the time of her death, she was the oldest ex-governor in the United States. She is interred in the family plot in Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.&lt;ref name=&quot;wyo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2008/05/18/featured_story/01top_05-18-08.txt|title=Finding Nellie|work=Wyoming Tribune Eagle|first=Jodi|last=Rogstad|date=May 18, 2005|access-date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SealOfIsabellaOfAngouleme.jpg|thumb|200px|Seal of Isabella of Angoulême (Municipal Archives, Angoulême)]]

'''Isabella of Angoulême''' ({{lang-fr|Isabelle d'Angoulême}}, {{IPA-fr|izabɛl dɑ̃ɡulɛm|IPA}}; c. 1186{{sfn|Barrière|2006|p=384}}/1188{{sfn|Evergates|2007|p=226}} – 4 June 1246) was [[queen consort]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] as the second wife of [[John of England|King John]] from 1200 until John's death in 1216. She was also suo jure Countess of Angoulême from 1202 until 1246.

Isabella had five children by the king, including his heir, later [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. In 1220, Isabella married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]], Count of [[County of La Marche|La Marche]], by whom she had another nine children.

Some of Isabella's contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that Isabella formed a conspiracy against King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, [[Blanche of Castile]], for whom she had a deep-seated hatred.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=144-145}} In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king. To avoid arrest, she sought refuge in [[Fontevraud Abbey]], where she died two years later, but none of this can be confirmed.

==Queen of England==
Isabella was the only daughter and heir of [[Aymer of Angoulême|Aymer Taillefer]], [[Counts and dukes of Angoulême|Count of Angoulême]], by [[Alice of Courtenay]],{{sfn|Vincent|1999|p=171}} who was sister of [[Peter II of Courtenay]], Latin Emperor of Constantinople and granddaughter of King [[Louis VI of France]].

Isabella became Countess of [[Angoulême]] in her own right on 16 June 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to [[John of England|King John]] took place on 24 August 1200, in [[Angoulême]], a year after he [[Annulment|annulled]] his first marriage to [[Isabel of Gloucester]]. She was crowned queen in an elaborate ceremony on 8 October at [[Westminster Abbey]] in London.{{sfn|Church|2015|p=69}} Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan,{{sfn|Vincent|1999|p=171, 177}} son of the [[Count of La Marche]]. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King [[Philip II of France]] confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued.

At the time of her marriage to John, the blonde-haired blue-eyed Isabella was already renowned by some for her beauty{{sfn|Costain|1962|p=251-252}} and has sometimes been called the [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of the [[Middle Ages]] by historians.{{sfn|Costain|1962|p=306}} Isabella was much younger than her husband and possessed a volatile temper similar to his own. King John was infatuated with his young, beautiful wife; however, his acquisition of her had at least as much to do with spiting his enemies as romantic love. She was already engaged to Hugh IX le Brun when she was taken by John. It was said that he neglected his state affairs to spend time with Isabella, often remaining in bed with her until noon. However, these were rumors spread by John's enemies to discredit him as a weak and grossly irresponsible ruler, given that at the time John was engaging in a desperate war against [[King Philip of France]] to hold on to the remaining Plantagenet duchies. The common people began to term her a &quot;siren&quot; or &quot;[[Messalina]]&quot;, which spoke volumes as to popular opinion.{{sfn|Costain|1962|p=253-254}} Her mother-in-law, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], readily accepted her as John's wife.{{sfn|Costain|1962|p=246}}

On 1 October 1207 at [[Winchester Castle]], Isabella gave birth to a son and heir, named [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] after the King's father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. He was quickly followed by another son, [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]], and three daughters, [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan]], [[Isabella of England|Isabella]], and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor]]. All five children survived into adulthood and made illustrious marriages; all but Joan produced offspring of their own.

==Second marriage==
When King John died in October 1216, Isabella's first act was to arrange the speedy coronation of her nine-year-old son at the city of [[Gloucester]] on 28 October. As the royal crown had recently been lost in [[The Wash]], along with the rest of King John's treasure, she supplied her own golden circlet to be used in lieu of a crown.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=11}} The following July, less than a year after his crowning as King Henry III of England, she left him in the care of his [[regent]], [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] and returned to France to assume control of her inheritance of [[Angoulême]].

In the spring of 1220, Isabella married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]], &quot;le Brun&quot;, Seigneur de Luisignan, Count of La Marche, the son of her former fiancé, Hugh IX, to whom she had been betrothed before her marriage to King John. It had been previously arranged that her eldest daughter Joan should marry Hugh, and the little girl was being brought up at the Lusignan court in preparation for her marriage. Hugh, however, upon seeing Isabella, whose beauty had not diminished,{{sfn|Costain|1962|p=341}} preferred the girl's mother. Joan was provided with another husband, King [[Alexander II of Scotland]], whom she wed in 1221.

Isabella had married Hugh without the consent of the king's council in England, as was required of a [[queen dowager]].  That council had the power not only to assign to her any subsequent husband, but to decide whether she should be allowed to remarry at all. That Isabella flouted its authority moved the council to confiscate her [[dower]] lands and to stop the payment of her pension.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=38–39}} Isabella and her husband retaliated by threatening to keep Joan, who had been promised in marriage to the King of Scotland, in France. The council first responded by sending furious letters to the Pope, signed in the name of young King Henry, urging him to [[excommunicate]] Isabella and her husband, but then decided to come to terms with Isabella, to avoid conflict with the Scottish king, who was eager to receive his bride. Isabella was granted the stannaries in [[Devon]], and the revenue of Aylesbury for a period of four years, in compensation for her confiscated dower lands in [[Normandy]], as well as the £3,000 arrears for her pension.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=38–39}}

Isabella had nine more children by Hugh X. Their eldest son [[Hugh XI of Lusignan]] succeeded his father as [[Count of La Marche]] and [[Count of Angoulême]] in 1249.

Isabella's children from her royal marriage did not join her in Angoulême, remaining in England with their eldest brother Henry III.

==Rebellion and death==
Described by some contemporaries as &quot;vain, capricious, and troublesome,&quot;{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=149}} Isabella could not reconcile herself with her less prominent position in France. Though Queen mother of England, Isabella was now mostly regarded as a mere Countess of La Marche and had to give precedence to other women.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=144}} In 1241, when Isabella and Hugh were summoned to the French court to swear fealty to King [[Louis IX of France]]'s brother, [[Alfonso, Count of Poitou|Alphonse]], who had been invested as Count of Poitou, their mother, the Queen Dowager [[Blanche of Castile|Blanche]] openly snubbed her. This so infuriated Isabella, who had a deep-seated hatred of Blanche for having fervently supported the French invasion of England during the [[First Barons' War]] in May 1216, that she began to actively conspire against King Louis. Isabella and her husband, along with other disgruntled nobles, including her son-in-law [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], sought to create an English-backed [[Confederation|confederacy]] which united the provinces of the south and west against the French king.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=145-146}} She encouraged her son Henry in his invasion of Normandy in 1230, but then did not provide him the support she had promised.

In 1244, after the confederacy had failed and Hugh had made peace with King Louis, two royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the King; upon questioning they confessed to having been in Isabella's pay.{{sfn|Costain|1959|p=149}} Before Isabella could be taken into custody, she fled to Fontevraud Abbey, where she died on 4 June 1246.{{sfn|Vincent|2004|p=online edition}}

By Isabella's own prior arrangement, she was first buried in the Abbey's churchyard, as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to [[Fontevraud]], her son King [[Henry III of England]] was shocked to find her buried outside the Abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Afterwards, most of her many Lusignan children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of Henry, their half-brother.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Pope Eleutherius''' (died 24 May 189), also known as '''Eleutherus''', was the [[Bishop of Rome]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from c. 174 to his death.{{sfn|Kirsch|1909}} (The [[Holy See|Vatican]] cites 171 or 177 to 185 or 193.) According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he was a [[Greeks|Greek]] born in [[Nicopolis]] in [[Epirus]], [[Greece]].{{sfn|Brusher|1980|p=}}{{sfn|Butler|Attwater|Thurston|1956|p=}} His contemporary [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] wrote that he was a [[deacon]] of the Roman Church under [[Pope Anicetus]] (c. 154–164), and remained so under [[Pope Soter]], whom he succeeded around 174.{{efn|name=Hegesippus}}

He is also linked to some legends, one of them being credited with receiving a letter from &quot;[[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], King of Britain&quot;, but is now generally considered to be a pious [[forgery]].

==Dietary law==
The 6th-century [[recension]] of ''Liber Pontificalis'' ('Book of the Popes') known as the &quot;Felician Catalog&quot;{{efn|name=Felician Catalog}} includes additional commentary to the work's earlier entry on Eleutherius. One addition ascribes to Eleutherius the reissuance of a decree:{{efn|name=Et hoc}}{{Sfn|Davis|1989|p=6}} &quot;And he again affirmed that no food should be repudiated by Christians strong in their faith, as God created it, [provided] however that it is sensible and edible.&quot; Such a decree might have been issued against early continuations of [[Jewish dietary law]] and against similar laws practiced by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] and [[Montanism|Montanists]]. It is also possible, however, that the editor of the passage attributed to Eleutherius a decree similar to another issued around the year 500 in order to give it greater authority.

==British mission==
{{main|Lucius of Britain}}
Another addition credited Eleutherius with receiving a letter from &quot;[[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], [[List of legendary kings of Britain|King of Britain]]&quot; or &quot;[[King of the Britons]]&quot;, declaring an intention to convert to Christianity.{{efn|name=Lucius}} No earlier accounts of this mission have been found. It is now generally considered to be a [[pious forgery]], although there remains disagreement over its original purpose. [[Arthur West Haddan|Haddan]], [[William Stubbs|Stubbs]], and Wilkins{{sfn|Haddan|Stubbs|Wilkins|1869|p=25}} considered the passage &quot;manifestly written in the time and tone&quot; of [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], secretary to [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great]] in the mid-5th century, and supportive of the [[mission (Christianity)|missions]] of [[Germanus of Auxerre]] and [[Palladius of Galatia]].{{sfn|Haddan|Stubbs|Wilkins|1869|p=25}} [[Louis-Marie-Olivier Duchesne|Duchesne]] dated the entry a little later to the pontificate of [[Pope Boniface II|Boniface&amp;nbsp;II]] around 530,{{sfn|Kirsch|1909}} and [[Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] to the early 7th century.{{sfn|Kirsch|1909}} Only the last would support the conjecture that it aimed to support the [[Gregorian mission]] to the [[Anglo-Saxons]] led by [[Augustine of Canterbury]], who [[Gregorian mission#Relations with the British Christians|encountered great difficulty]] with the [[Celtic Christianity|native British Christians]], as at the [[Synod of Chester]]. Indeed, the Celtic Christians invoked the antiquity of their church to generally {{em|avoid}} submission to [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] until the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest]], but no arguments invoking the mission to Lucius appear to have been made by either side during the [[synod]]s among the Welsh and Saxon bishops.

The first Englishman to mention the story was [[Bede]]{{sfn|Bede|1903|loc=Bk I, Ch 4}}{{sfn|Bede|1903|loc=Bk V, Ch 24}} and he seems to have taken it, not from native texts or traditions, but from ''[[Liber Pontificalis|The Book of the Popes]]''. Subsequently, it appeared in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'' traditionally credited to [[Nennius]]: The account relates that a mission from the pope baptised &quot;Lucius, the Britannic king, with all the petty kings of the whole Britannic people&quot;.{{sfn|Nennius|1848|loc=§22}} The account, however, dates this baptism to AD&amp;nbsp;167 (a little before Eleutherius's pontificate) and credits it to [[Pope Evaristus|Evaristus]] (reigned {{circa|lk=no|99|107}}).{{sfn|Nennius|1848|loc=§22}} In the 12th century, more details began to be added to the story. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s [[pseudo-history|pseudohistorical]] ''[[Historia Regnum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' goes into great detail concerning Lucius and names the pope's envoys to him as [[Saint Fagan|Fagan]] and [[Saint Duvian|Duvian]].{{sfn|Geoffrey of Monmouth|1848|loc=Vol.&amp;nbsp;IV, Ch.&amp;nbsp;XIX}} The 12th-century ''[[Liber Landavensis|Book of Llandaf]]'' placed the court of Lucius in southern Wales and names his emissaries to the pope as [[Elfan]] and [[Medwy]].{{sfn|Rees|1840|pp=26, 65}}

An echo of this legend penetrated even to [[Switzerland]]. In a homily preached at [[Chur]] and preserved in an 8th- or 9th-century manuscript, [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] is represented as an [[apostle]] to [[Gaul]], whence he went into [[Roman Britain]] and baptised a king named Lucius, who himself became a missionary to Gaul and finally settled at Chur, where he preached the gospel with great success. In this way Lucius, the early missionary of the Swiss district of Chur, became identified with the alleged British king of the ''Liber Pontificalis''.&lt;ref name=Elsensohn /&gt;

[[Adolf von Harnack|Harnack]] suggests that in the document which the compiler of the ''Liber Pontificalis'' drew his information, the name found was not ''{{lang|la|Britanio}}'', but ''{{lang|la|Britio}}''. Now this is the name (''{{lang|la|[[Birecik|Birtha]]-}}'', ''{{lang|la|Britium}}'') of the fortress of [[Osroene|Edessa]].{{sfn|von Harnack|1904|pp=906-916}} The king in question is, therefore, Lucius Ælius Septimus Megas [[Abgar IX]], of Edessa, a Christian king as is well known. The original statement of the ''Liber Pontificalis'', in this hypothesis, had nothing to do with Britain; the compiler of the ''Liber Pontificalis'' changed ''{{lang|la|Britio}}'' to ''{{lang|la|Brittanio}}'', and in this way made a British king of the [[History of Syria#Medieval era|Syria]]n Lucius.

==Death==
According to the ''Liber Pontificalis'', Pope Eleutherius died on 24 May and was buried on the [[Vatican Hill]] (''{{lang|la|in Vaticano}}'') near the body of [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]]. Later tradition has his body moved to the church of [[San Giovanni della Pigna]], near the [[Pantheon, Rome|pantheon]]. In 1591, his remains were again moved to the church of [[Santa Susanna]] at the request of Camilla Peretti, the sister of [[Pope Sixtus V]]. His feast is celebrated on 26 May.

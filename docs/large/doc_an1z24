'''''Led Zeppelin II''''' is the second [[album]] by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]], released on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter [[Jimmy Page]], and it was also Led Zeppelin's first album on which [[Eddie Kramer]] served as engineer.

The album exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar [[riff]]-based sound. It has been described as the band's heaviest album.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=502}}  Six of the nine songs were written by the band, while the other three were reinterpretations of [[Chicago blues]] songs by [[Willie Dixon]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. One single, &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;, was released outside of the UK (the band would release no UK singles during their career)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schinder|first=Scott|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|publisher=Greenwood|year=2007|isbn=978-0313338472|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and peaked as a top-ten single in over a dozen markets around the world.

''Led Zeppelin II'' was a commercial success, and was the band's first album to reach number one on charts in the UK and the US. The album's cover designer David Juniper was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]] in 1970. On 15 November 1999, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|12× Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales passing 12 million copies. Since its release, various writers and music critics have regularly cited ''Led Zeppelin II'' as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;acclaimed&quot; /&gt;

==Background==
''Led Zeppelin II'' was conceived during a busy period of Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American [[Led Zeppelin concert tour chronology|concert tours]].{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America. The album was written on tour, during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, necessarily resulting in spontaneity and urgency, which is reflected in the sound.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} Several songs resulted from improvisation while touring, including during the instrumental sections of &quot;[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]&quot;, and were recorded mostly live in the studio.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=15,46–47}}

The album used a wide variety of recording studios in the UK and the US. Some of these were ill-equipped; one studio in Vancouver, credited as &quot;a hut&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;mixing&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Cleveland, Barry |url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mixing-led-zeppelin/May-08/36033|title=Guitar Player: Mixing Led Zeppelin II |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915051359/http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mixing-led-zeppelin/may-08/36033 |archive-date=15 September 2008 |date=May 2008 |magazine=Guitar Player |access-date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; had an 8-track set-up without even proper headphone facilities.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} A more favourable set-up was [[Mystic Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]] with Chris Huston engineering.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} Lead singer [[Robert Plant]] later complained that the writing, recording, and mixing sessions were done in many different locations, and criticized the writing and recording process.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=32}} &quot;[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Lemon Song]]&quot; and &quot;[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]&quot; were overdubbed during the tour, while the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]&quot; was also done on tour. Page later stated, &quot;In other words, some of the material came out of rehearsing for the next tour and getting new material together.&quot;&lt;ref name=Schulps&gt;{{cite journal |last==Schulps |first=Dave |url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Interview with Jimmy Page |journal=[[Trouser Press]] |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording sessions for the album took place at [[Olympic Studios|Olympic]] and [[Morgan Studios]] in London, England; [[A&amp;M Studios|A&amp;M]], Quantum, [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset]], Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in Los Angeles; [[Ardent Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[A &amp; R Recording|A&amp;R]], Juggy Sound, Groove and Mayfair Studios in New York City; and R&amp;D Studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ledzeppelin.com/event/may-10-1969|title=R&amp;D Studios (Vancouver), May 10, 1969 &amp;#124; [title]|website=Led Zeppelin &amp;#124; Official Website - Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as a &quot;hut,&quot; in Vancouver.&lt;ref name=lz2&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Led Zeppelin II (Super Deluxe Edition Box) |publisher=Atlantic Records |id=R2-536181 |year=2014 |p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mixing&quot; /&gt; Production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page, with [[Eddie Kramer]] engineering.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}} Kramer later said, &quot;The famous ''Whole Lotta Love'' mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man.&quot;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=15}}

Kramer later gave great credit to Page for the sound that was achieved, despite the inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded: &quot;We cut some of the tracks in some of the most bizarre studios you can imagine ... but in the end it sounded bloody marvellous ... there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page.&quot;&lt;ref name=theirtime&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |title=Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin: Their Time is Gonna Come |year=2008 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A&amp;R Studios.&lt;ref name =theirtime /&gt;

The finished tracks reflect the evolving sound of the band and their live performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11460|pure_url=yes}} |title=Led Zeppelin II |website=AllMusic |access-date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RS2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print |access-date=9 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205000838/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11027261/the_long_shadow_of_led_zeppelin/print |archive-date=5 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant had his first songwriting credits on ''Led Zeppelin II''; he had been unable to have his contributions to the writing process credited for the first album because of a prior contract with [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}

===Side one===
&quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot; was built around a five-note Page riff. The lyrics were taken directly from [[Willie Dixon]]'s &quot;[[You Need Love (Muddy Waters song)|You Need Love]]&quot;, which led to the group being sued for plagiarism, eventually settling out of court. The arrangement also resembles the [[Small Faces]] track &quot;[[You Need Loving]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=57}} With basic tracks recorded on Page's houseboat, the middle section of the song contained a variety of overdubbed instruments and vocals which were mixed live by Page and Kramer, making full use of stereo panning and other controls available on the desk. The song was edited down to a single in the US, where it became a top 5 hit. In the UK, a single release was cancelled; the group never issued any singles there during their active career together.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47–48}} It was finally issued as a single in 1997.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=59}} An instrumental version of the song was recorded by CCS ([[Collective Consciousness Society]]) which was used as the theme tune to the BBC TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', ensuring it was well-known by virtually everyone in Britain.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

Led Zeppelin performed &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; at every gig from June 1969 onwards. It was the closing number of their live shows between 1970 and 1973, often extended to incorporate a rock'n'roll medley towards the end of the set. A different arrangement of the song was played for the Knebworth Fayre concerts in 1979. It was the last song the group ever performed live with Bonham, on 7 July 1980. &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; has since been critically praised as one of the definitive heavy metal tracks, though the group have never considered themselves to fit that specific style.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

&quot;[[What Is and What Should Never Be]]&quot; was primarily written by Plant. It features a variety of dynamics during the track, along with flanged vocals and wide-panned stereo guitars.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

&quot;[[The Lemon Song]]&quot; was a re-arrangement of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s &quot;[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]&quot;, which had become a regular part of the group's live show during 1969. It was mostly recorded live and expanded to include new lyrics, including the sexually-charged phrase &quot;squeeze my lemon&quot; which was borrowed from [[Robert Johnson]]'s &quot;[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]&quot;, which the band had played for the BBC radio show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' broadcast on 29 June 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_dmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |pages=46–47 |title=Led Zeppelin: All the Albums, All the Songs |author=Martin Popoff |publisher=Voyageur Press |date=21 August 2018|isbn=9780760363775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AQLtgOAQcqQC&amp;pg=PT102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 102]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/jimmy-page-on-led-zeppelins-totally-fearless-bbc-sessions-110658/ |work=rollingstone.com |title=Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's 'Totally Fearless' BBC Sessions |author=David Fricke |date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]&quot; was written by Plant as a love song to his wife, Maureen. Page played [[twelve-string guitar]] and Jones played [[Hammond organ]] on the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

&quot;[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]&quot; was mostly written by Page as a showcase for his guitar skills, including an unaccompanied solo in the middle of the song. It quickly became a live favourite, being performed regularly from October 1969 onwards, and throughout the group's career.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

&quot;[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]&quot; was purported to be written about a [[groupie]] the band encountered while touring the US. The group disliked the track, considering it to be little more than filler, and consequently it was never played live by the group. Plant performed the track live on his 1990 solo tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}

&quot;[[Ramble On]]&quot; was written by Plant. The lyrics were inspired by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and similar themes appeared on subsequent Led Zeppelin albums. The track made good use of dynamics, moving from a quiet acoustic guitar in the opening, to a variety of overdubbed electric guitars towards the end.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was never performed live by Led Zeppelin during their main career, but Plant has performed the song regularly on solo tours, and it was part of Page and Plant's live set in the mid-1990s. It was finally performed live for the first time by Led Zeppelin at the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}}

&quot;[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]&quot; was designed as a showcase for Bonham's drum solo. It was originally called &quot;Pat's Delight&quot; (after his wife) and features a variety of drums and percussive instruments played with bare hands as well as drumsticks. It was a regular part of Led Zeppelin's live show, developing to include additional percussion and electronic drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}}

&quot;[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)#Led Zeppelin version|Bring It On Home]]&quot; was a cover of a Willie Dixon song originally performed by [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]. Led Zeppelin's arrangement includes a faster middle section in addition to the straightforward blues structure of the original. It was played live regularly throughout late 1969 and 1970.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}}

==Artwork==

The [[Record sleeve|album sleeve]] design was from a poster by David Juniper, who was simply told by the band to come up with an interesting idea. Juniper was a fellow student of Page's at Sutton Art College in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/biographies/64-reference/biographies/associates-bio/1437-david-juniper |title=David Juniper |date=25 September 2010 |publisher=led-zeppelin.org |access-date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juniper's design was based on a photograph of the [[Jagdstaffel 11]] Division of the [[Luftstreitkräfte|German Air Force]] during World War I, the [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Flying Circus]] led by the [[Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]]. Juniper replaced four of the flyers' heads with photos of the band members, added facial hair and sunglasses to some of the flyers' faces or replaced some with the faces of other people. The blonde-haired woman is French actress Delphine Seyrig in her role as Marie-Magdalene in the film ''[[:fr:Mister Freedom|Mister Freedom]]'', a leftist anti-war satire by William Klein (1969). The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background (similar to the cover of the band's first album), which gave the album its nickname &quot;Brown Bomber&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=55–56}}

==Release and reception==
The album was released on 22 October 1969 on [[Atlantic Records]], with advance orders of 400,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welch&quot;&gt;Welch, Chris (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The advertising campaign was built around the slogans 'Led Zeppelin – The Only Way to Fly' and 'Led Zeppelin II Now Flying'.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} In the United States, some commercially duplicated [[reel-to-reel]] copies of ''Led Zeppelin II'' made by [[Ampex]] bore the title ''Led Zeppelin II – The Only Way to Fly'' on their spine. Commercially, ''Led Zeppelin II'' was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} Meanwhile, the album reached the top spot in other 5 national albums charts (including Canadian, Australian and Spanish albums charts). In November [[Ritchie Yorke]] reported in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that while the album had achieved &quot;staggering&quot; sales, as a [[hard rock]] record it was considered unsuitable for North American [[Top 40]] radio stations, who were &quot;dreary and detached from the mainstream of contemporary rock music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ritchie |last=Yorke |title=Maple Leaf Rock |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=14 November 1970 |volume=82 |issue=46 |page=R-16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22Led+Zeppelin+II%22&amp;pg=PP18 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit, &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;. This song reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], &quot;[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]&quot;, also hit the ''Billboard'' chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4739|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Led Zeppelin&amp;nbsp;– Bio]. All Media Guide, LLC. Retrieved 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reaction to ''Led Zeppelin II'' was not positive initially. [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] wrote a negative review of the record for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that &quot;until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, it seems as if it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendelsohn |first=John |date=13 December 1969 |title=Records |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/led-zeppelin-ii-19691213 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=48 |pages=48 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |access-date=8 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] jokingly referred to the band as &quot;the best of the wah-wah [[wikt:mannerism|mannerist]] groups, so dirty they drool on demand&quot;, while complaining that &quot;all the songs sound alike&quot;, before assigning the album a &quot;B&quot; grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Christgau |date=15 January 1970 |url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg6.php |title=Consumer Guide (6) |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless conceded in 1970 that &quot;Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone&quot; the previous year, &quot;pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, and more and more I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Christgau |date=12 February 1970 |url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/delaney-70.php |title=Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends Featuring Eric Clapton |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1969, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and in 1990 it was certified 5× platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies. By 14 November 1999, ''Led Zeppelin II'' had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;uscert&quot;/&gt; The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the ''Billboard'' Top 10 when it got to {{Numero|9}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200 |title=''Billboard'' 200|page=1 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Led Zeppelin II'' has since been regarded as the quintessential heavy metal album.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=1967}} [[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] said it &quot;provided the blueprint for all the heavy metal bands that followed it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot; /&gt; While crediting the band for essentially inventing metal, [[Tom Hull (critic)|Tom Hull]] said that, after the first album had declared their musical ambition, &quot;the second honed it down to a singular entity, a sound&quot;, with subsequent albums expanding on it in &quot;sophisticated, subtler, often quite intelligent&quot; ways, but still indebted to &quot;the basic dumbness&quot; of ''II'' – &quot;dumb not in the sense of stupid but of non-speaking. Lyrics are there of course, but as an integral part of the music, a music better appropriated tactilely, through incoherent sensation, than intellectually, literarily.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Hull|first=Tom|date=April 1975|url=http://www.tomhull.com/ocston/arch/rekord4.php|title=The Rekord Report: L'Objet Rèpris|magazine=Overdose|access-date=June 26, 2020|via=tomhull.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was described as a &quot;brilliant if heavy-handed blues-rock offensive&quot;, by popular music scholar Ronald Zalkind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zalkind|first=Ronald|year=1980|title=Contemporary Music Almanac|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00zalk|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00zalk/page/255 255]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Santelli's ''The Big Book of Blues: A Biographical Encyclopedia'' (2001), Led Zeppelin &quot;had already begun to move beyond its blues-rock influences, venturing into previously unexplored hard-rock territories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Santelli|first=Robert|year=2001|title=The Big Book of Blues: A Biographical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/bigbookofbluesbi00sant/page/290 290]|isbn=0141001453|url=https://archive.org/details/bigbookofbluesbi00sant/page/290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blues-derived songs like &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;, &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; have been seen as representing standards of the metal genre, where the guitar-based riff (rather than vocal [[Refrain|chorus]] or [[Verse-chorus form|verses]]) defines the song and provides the key hook.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47–48}} Such arrangements and emphasis were at the time atypical in popular music.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot; /&gt; Page's guitar solo in &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; featuring [[tapping|rapid-fire runs]] of notes tapped only by the left hand, was a major inspiration to the later work of metal soloists and &quot;[[shred guitar|shredders]]&quot; such as [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Steve Vai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Pete|year=1997|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|edition=1st|location=San Francisco|publisher=Hal Leonard|page=165|isbn=0-7935-4042-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 95, based on 10 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' journalist Mark Richardson said, &quot;the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork&quot;/&gt; while Julian Marszalek of ''[[The Quietus]]'' noted the bonus disc's &quot;intriguing insight&quot; into the original record's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marszalek|first=Julian|date=2 June 2014|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15412-led-zeppelin-reissue-reviews|title=Led Zeppelin|website=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rolling Stone'', [[David Fricke]] wrote, &quot;the alternate takes highlight Robert Plant's ripening vocal poise and, in a rough mix of 'Ramble On', the decisive, melodic force of John Paul Jones' bass and John Bonham's drumming.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2014&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|author-link=David Fricke|date=3 June 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/led-zeppelin-ii-reissue-88031/|title=Led Zeppelin II (Reissue)|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;As a two-disc set&quot;, ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''{{'}}s Michael Madden wrote, &quot;this reissue is both a reminder of the original album's wallop and a closer look at the alchemy of a band increasingly attuned to ideas of progression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COS&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Madden|first=Michael|date=4 June 2014|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/06/album-review-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-reissue/|title=Led Zeppelin II Reissue|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raoul Hernandez from ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' was more critical of the bonus disc, finding it to be &quot;the thinest of extras&quot; offered by the reissue program.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAC&quot;/&gt;

'''Notes'''
*[[Cassette tape]] releases of the album had &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; ending the first side and &quot;Thank You&quot; starting the second side. On some cassette issues &quot;The Lemon Song&quot; was credited as &quot;Killing Floor&quot;.
*Original LP pressings of the album incorrectly listed the running time of &quot;Thank You&quot; at 3:50, as the song's coda features a false fade at that point.
* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1–9 on CD reissues.

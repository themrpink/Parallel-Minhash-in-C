==History==

===19th century===
In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by [[Christopher Costigan]] in 1835, [[Thomas Howard Molyneux]] in 1847, [[William Francis Lynch]] in 1848, and [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadsea.com/history/|title=History of the Dead Sea - Discover the Dead Sea with Us!|date=1 July 2016|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620102208/http://www.deadsea.com/history/|archive-date=20 June 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book ''[[s:Narrative Of The United States Expedition To The River Jordan And The Dead Sea|Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea]]'' is available online.

===20th century===
[[File:Abbud24C.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coloured postcard of the Jordan River, by [[Karimeh Abbud]], circa 1925]]
In 1964, Israel began operating a pumping station that diverts water from the Sea of Galilee to the [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]]. Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] that diverted water from the [[Yarmouk River]], a main tributary of the Jordan River, to the [[King Abdullah Canal|East Ghor Canal]]. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. Environmentalists blame [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plushnick-Masti&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001354.html|title=Raw Sewage Taints Sacred Jordan River|last=Plushnick-Masti|first=Ramil|date=10 September 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111151807/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001354.html|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the waters are 70% to 90% used for human purposes{{cn|date=May 2019}} and the flow is greatly reduced. Because of this and the high evaporation rate of the [[Dead Sea]], as well as industrial extraction of salts through evaporation ponds, the Dead Sea is rapidly shrinking.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

==Main environmental issues==
===Reduction of water flow===
The flow rate of the Jordan River once was 1.3 billion cubic metres per year; as of 2010, just 20 to 30 million cubic metres per year flow into the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=dry&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.physorg.com/news192044027.html |title= Jordan River could die by 2011: report |access-date= 16 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110926205304/http://www.physorg.com/news192044027.html |archive-date= 26 September 2011 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
A small section of the northernmost portion of the Lower Jordan, the first ca. {{convert|3|km|adj=on}} below the Sea of Galilee, has been kept pristine for baptism and local tourism. Most polluted is the 100-kilometre downstream stretch—a meandering stream from above the confluence with the Yarmouk to the [[Dead Sea]]. Environmentalists say the practice of letting sewage and brackish water flow into the river has almost destroyed its [[ecosystem]]. Rescuing the Jordan could take decades, according to environmentalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plushnick-Masti&quot;/&gt; In 2007, FoEME named the Jordan River as one of the world's 100 most endangered ecological sites, due in part to lack of cooperation between Israel and neighboring Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Endangered Jordan&quot;, ''Dateline World Jewry'', [[World Jewish Congress]], September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water politics==
Recent literature shows the role of power asymmetries and of discourses and narratives in shaping hydropolitics along the Jordan River Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=Hussein, Hussam, and Mattia Grandi. &quot;Dynamic political contexts and power asymmetries: the cases of the Blue Nile and the Yarmouk Rivers.&quot; International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics (2017): 1-20. |doi=10.1007/s10784-017-9364-y |s2cid=67818118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roads, border crossings, bridges==
[[File:RAFTING ON THE JORDAN RIVER.jpg|thumb|Rafting on Jordan River, Northern Galilee]]

===Roads===
[[Highway 90 (Israel–Palestine)|Route 90]], part of which is named after [[Rehavam Zeevi]], connects the northern and southern tips of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parallels the Jordan River on the western side.

===Border crossings (open bridges)===
There are two border crossings between Israel and Jordan which cross the river over bridges. The northern one, [[Jordan River Crossing|Jordan River Crossing or Sheikh Hussein Bridge]] is near [[Beit She'an]]; the southern one, [[Allenby Bridge]] (also King Hussein Bridge), is near [[Jericho]].

===Bridges (historical; modern - open and closed)===
North to south:
* [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: Gesher Bnot Ya'akov, &quot;Daughters of Jacob Bridge&quot;) is the most famous one within Israel
* [[Arik Bridge]] at the northern end of the Sea of Galilee; allows access to the central Golan Heights, was crucial in the [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973 wars]]
* [[Al-Sinnabra]], at the spot where the river used to exit the Sea of Galilee in the past; few remains excavated by archaeologists
* [[Jisr el-Majami']] north of [[Beit She'an|Beit She'an/Beisan]]; closed
* [[Damia Bridge|Damiya or Adam Bridge]] halfway between Jericho and Beit She'an; closed
* [[King Abdullah Bridge]] south of the Allenby Bridge; closed.

==Importance as a water source==
[[File:Jordan River - Dead Sea.png|thumb|River Jordan draining into the [[Dead Sea]]]]

Until the first decade of the 21st century, the waters of the Jordan River had been the largest water resource for Israel; lately, [[Desalination|desalinated]] sea water from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] has taken over this role. Israel's [[National Water Carrier]], completed in 1964, has delivered water from the Sea of Galilee to the Israeli coastal plain for over four decades, until prolonged drought led to abandoning this solution in favour of desalination.

[[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Jordan]] receives {{convert|50,000,000|m3}} of water from the river, a quantity which is regulated by the 1994 [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty]] with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Lawrence|author2=Shafiqul Islam|title=Water Diplomacy: Creating Value and Building Trust in Transboundary Water Negotiations|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|year=2012|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2012/water-diplomacy|access-date=2015-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129073114/http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2012/water-diplomacy|archive-date=2015-11-29|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, one of the main water resources in Jordan was the Jordan River, with a flow of 1.3 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year (BCM/yr). However, after Israel built the National Water Carrier in 1953 and diverted water from Lake Tiberias to Israel's coastal plains and southern desert, the flow of the Lower Jordan River dropped significantly. The 50 MCM/yr that Israel provides from Lake Tiberias as part of the 1994 peace treaty was meant to compensate for this loss. A 2010 study found that the Lower Jordan River has been reduced to 2% of its historic flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Gafny |first1= Sarig |last2= Talozi |first2= Samer |last3= Al Sheikh |first3= Banan |last4= Ya’ari |first4= Elizabeth |title= Towards a Living Jordan River: An Environmental Flows Report on the Rehabilitation of the Lower Jordan River |url= http://ecopeaceme.org/uploads/publications_publ117_1.pdf |publisher= EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME) |website= ecopeaceme.org |date= May 2010 |access-date= 2018-12-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220230732/http://ecopeaceme.org/uploads/publications_publ117_1.pdf |archive-date= 2018-12-20 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality has also deteriorated sharply, with high levels of salinity and pollution from agricultural fertilizer and untreated wastewater upstream in Israel and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface and Groundwater of Jordan|url=https://water.fanack.com/jordan/water-resources/surface-and-groundwater/|website=Fanack Water|publisher=Fanack Water of the Middle East and North Africa|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311210155/https://water.fanack.com/jordan/water-resources/surface-and-groundwater/|archive-date=2018-03-11|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict about the waters of the Jordan River was a contributing factor to the [[Origins of the Six-Day War#Water dispute|Six-Day War]] when, starting in 1965, [[Syria]] attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan.&lt;ref name=mehr&gt;Mehr, Farhang, &quot;The politics of water,&quot; in Antonino Zichichi, Richard C. Ragaini, eds., ''International Seminar on Nuclear War and Planetary Emergencies'', 30th session, Erice, Italy, 18–26 August 2003, Ettore Majorana International Centre for Scientific Culture, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pie. Ltd., 2004, p. 258, 259&lt;/ref&gt; The diversion works would have reduced the water availability for Israel's carrier by about 35%, and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Murakami |year=1995 |url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm |title=Appendix C: Historical review of the political riparian issues in the development of the Jordan River and basin management |access-date=2011-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202062900/http://unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm |archive-date=2010-12-02 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
===Hebrew Bible===
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 067.png|thumb|''Crossing the Jordan'', from ''[[commons:Die Bibel in Bildern|Die Bibel in Bildern]]'']]

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility of a large plain (&quot;Kikkar ha-Yarden&quot;), said to be watered like &quot;the garden of the LORD&quot; ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|13:10|HE}}). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23–24|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the &quot;two tribes and the half tribe&quot; settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the &quot;nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh&quot; that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). 

Opposite [[Jericho]], it was called &quot;the Jordan of Jericho&quot; ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5–6|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that &quot;trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106204816/http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm |date=2018-01-06 }} on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15–17|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as &quot;a witness&quot; between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the &quot;children of the prophets&quot; float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).

[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day, {{lang-he|יום העלייה}}) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as recorded in the Hebrew Bible’s Book of Joshua.

===New Testament===
[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Christian women on pilgrimage to [[Al-Maghtas]] (1913)]]
The [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]–[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).

[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the putative location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]

[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29–36|KJV}}).

The [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1–2|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.

The New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7–8|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39–40|KJV}}).

Scholars have concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage though most current pilgrims go to a location on the west side, [[Qasr el Yahud]], also long'established but not as early. This has led to choosing Al-Maghtas as a UNESCO World Heritage site, which took place in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |title= Baptism Site &quot;Bethany Beyond the Jordan&quot; (Al-Maghtas) |author= UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date= 16 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170119092144/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |archive-date= 19 January 2017 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derived cultural significance===
====Symbolism====
Because, according to Jewish tradition, the [[Israelites]] made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in [[Promised Land|the Promised Land]], the Jordan can refer to freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete.

Among many other references, the Jordan River is given this meaning in the text of ''[[Old Man River (song)|Old Man River]]'': &quot;Let me go 'way from the Mississippi / Let me go 'way from the white man boss / Show me that stream called the River Jordan / That's the old stream that I long to cross&quot;.

====Christening of royals====
Because of the baptism of Jesus, water from the Jordan is employed for the christening of heirs and princes in several Christian royal houses, such as the cases of [[Prince George of Cambridge]], [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon of Bulgaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Kate Connolly, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/worlddispatch.kateconnolly &quot;Once upon a time in Bulgaria&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723170840/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/worlddispatch.kateconnolly |date=2015-07-23 }}, ''The Guardian'', 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Ogilvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Baptized |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871108-1,00.html |quote= water from the River Jordan was sent for the occasion; |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= May 22, 1964 |access-date= 2008-03-11 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090902080032/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871108-1,00.html |archive-date= September 2, 2009 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, On 15 May 1717, the Empress [[Maria Theresa]] was baptised in Vienna by the Papal [[Nuntius]] Giorgio Spinola, representing [[Pope Clement XI]], with baptismal water containing a few drops from the River Jordan.

====Christian poetry and music====
The Jordan is a frequent symbol in [[Folk music|folk]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]], and in [[poetry|poetic]] and [[literature|literary]] works.

The baptism of Jesus is referred to in a hymn by the reformer Martin Luther, &quot;{{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam]]}}&quot; (1541), base for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, {{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam, BWV 7|''Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam'', BWV 7]] |italic=unset}} (1724).

The Jordan River, due primarily to its rich spiritual importance, has provided inspiration for countless songs, hymns, and stories, including the traditional African-American spiritual/folk songs &quot;[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]&quot;, &quot;[[Deep River (song)|Deep River]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Roll, Jordan, Roll]]&quot;.{{cn|date=May 2019}} It is mentioned in the songs &quot;[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]&quot;, &quot;[[Will You Be There]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|The Wayfaring Stranger]]&quot; and in &quot;[[Ol' Man River]]&quot; from the musical ''[[Show Boat]]''. &quot;The Far Side Banks of Jordan&quot; by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]] on June's [[Grammy Award]]-winning studio album, ''[[Press On]]'', mentions the Jordan River as well as the Promised Land.{{cn|date=May 2019}} Jordan River is also the subject of [[roots reggae]] artist [[Burning Spear]]'s song of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jah-lyrics.com/index.php?songid=1135 |title= Jah Lyrics: Burning Spear - Jordan River Lyrics |access-date= 16 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319044550/http://jah-lyrics.com/index.php?songid=1135 |archive-date= 19 March 2015 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belarusian band [[Spasenie]] dedicated its whole album “[[Crossing the Jordan]]” to the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.tut.by/culture/53634.html|title=Интервью с солистом группы &quot;Spasenie&quot; Игорем Мухой накануне концерта 1 июня в клубе &quot;Реактор&quot;|trans-title=Interview with the lead singer of Spasenie Igor Mukha on the eve of the concert at the club “Reactor” on June 1|last=Зробок|first=Ольга|date=2005-05-26|publisher=[[TUT.BY]]|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830072634/https://news.tut.by/culture/53634.html|archive-date=2019-08-30|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hudson River''' is a {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} [[river]] that flows from north to south primarily through eastern [[New York (state)|New York]] in the United States. The river originates in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of [[Upstate New York]], flows southward through the [[Hudson Valley]] to the [[Upper New York Bay]] between [[New York City]] and [[Jersey City]]. It eventually drains into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[New York Harbor]]. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of [[New Jersey]] and New York at its southern end. Farther north, it marks local boundaries between several [[County (New York)|New York counties]]. The lower half of the river is a [[tidal estuary]], deeper than the body of water into which it flows, occupying the Hudson [[Fjord]], an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American [[Quaternary glaciation|glaciation]], estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as the city of [[Troy, New York|Troy]].&lt;!--The river passes alongside cities and rivertowns, most notably [[Glens Falls]], [[Cohoes]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Albany]], [[Saugerties]], [[Kingston]], [[Poughkeepsie]], [[Newburgh]], [[Peekskill]], [[Haverstraw]], [[Yonkers]], New York City,[[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], [[Hoboken]], Jersey City..--&gt;

The river is named after [[Henry Hudson]], an Englishman sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]], who explored it in 1609, and after whom [[Hudson Bay]] in Canada is also named. It had previously been observed by Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailing for King [[Francis I of France]] in 1524, as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary. The Dutch called the river the ''[[North River (Hudson River)|North River]]'' – with the [[Delaware River]] called the ''South River'' – and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson, and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony.

During the eighteenth century, the river valley and its inhabitants were the subject and inspiration of [[Washington Irving]], the first internationally acclaimed American author. In the nineteenth century, the area inspired the [[Hudson River School]] of [[landscape painting]], an American pastoral style, as well as the concepts of [[environmentalism]] and [[wilderness]]. The Hudson was also the eastern outlet for the [[Erie Canal]], which, when completed in 1825, became an important transportation artery for the early-19th-century United States.

==Course==
===Sources===
The source of the Hudson River is [[Lake Tear of the Clouds]] in the [[Adirondack Park]] at an altitude of {{convert|4322|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Water Quality Assessment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes Lake Tear of the Clouds&quot;/&gt; However, the river is not cartographically called the Hudson River until miles downstream. The river is named [[Feldspar Brook]] until its confluence with the [[Opalescent River]], and then is named the Opalescent River until the river reaches [[Calamity Brook]], flowing south from the outlet of [[Henderson Lake (New York)|Henderson Lake]]. From that point on, the stream is cartographically known as the Hudson River.&lt;ref name=&quot;UAlbany Lake Tear of the Clouds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adirondack Park Henderson Lake&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS) uses this cartographical definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;GNIS&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hudson River outflow from Henderson Lake.jpg|left|thumb|The Hudson River flowing out of Henderson Lake in Tahawus]]

The [[River source|longest source]] of the Hudson River as shown on the most detailed USGS maps is the &quot;Opalescent River&quot; on the west slopes of Little Marcy Mountain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Map of Opalescent River and Lake Tear of the Clouds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Opalescent Description&quot;/&gt; originating two miles north of Lake Tear of the Clouds,&lt;ref name=&quot;Opalescent Description&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Opalescent River&quot;/&gt; several miles, past the Flowed Lands, to the Hudson River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opalescent River Length&quot;/&gt; and a mile longer than &quot;Feldspar Brook&quot;, which flows out of that lake in the [[Adirondack Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Highest Source&quot;/&gt; Popular culture and convention, however, more often cite the photogenic Lake Tear of the Clouds as the source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Highest Source&quot;/&gt;

===Upper Hudson River===
Using river names as seen on maps, Indian Pass Brook flows into [[Henderson Lake (New York)|Henderson Lake]], and the outlet from Henderson Lake flows east and meets the southwest flowing Calamity Brook. The [[confluence]] of the two rivers is where maps begin to use the Hudson River name. South of the outlet of Sanford Lake, the Opalescent River flows into the Hudson.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. In the hamlet of [[North River, New York|North River]], the Hudson flows entirely in Warren County and takes in the [[Schroon River]]. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the [[Sacandaga River]] from the [[Great Sacandaga Lake]]. Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under [[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate 87]], and through [[Glens Falls]], just south of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] although receiving no streamflow from the lake. It next goes through [[Hudson Falls]]. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; Here the river has an elevation of {{convert|200|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Water Quality Assessment&quot;/&gt; Just south in [[Fort Edward (town), New York|Fort Edward]], the river reaches its confluence with the [[Champlain Canal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and [[Montreal]] and the rest of [[Eastern Canada]] via the Hudson, [[Lake Champlain]] and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Champlain Canal&quot;/&gt; Further south the Hudson takes in water from the [[Batten Kill River]] and Fish Creek near [[Schuylerville]]. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]]. It takes in water from the [[Hoosic River]], which extends into [[Massachusetts]]. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the [[Mohawk River]], the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Water Quality Assessment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; The river then reaches the [[Federal Dam (Troy)|Federal Dam]] in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], marking an impoundment of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; At an elevation of {{convert|2|ft|m}}, the bottom of the dam marks the [[head of tide|beginning of the tidal]] influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Water Quality Assessment&quot;/&gt;

===Lower Hudson River===
[[File:Bird's-eye view of Hudson River from walkway 5.JPG|thumb|left|The river from [[Poughkeepsie]], looking north.]]
South of the Federal Dam, the Hudson River begins to widen considerably. The river enters the [[Hudson Valley]], flowing along the west bank of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and the east bank of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]]. [[Interstate 90]] crosses the Hudson into Albany at this point in the river. The Hudson then leaves the Capital District, forming the boundary between Greene and Columbia Counties. It then meets its confluence with Schodack Creek, widening considerably at this point. After flowing by [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]], the river forms the boundary between Ulster and Columbia Counties and Ulster and Dutchess Counties, passing [[Germantown (town), New York|Germantown]] and [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]]. The [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] meets the river at this point. The river then flows by [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]], former residence of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and alongside the city of [[Poughkeepsie]], flowing under the [[Walkway over the Hudson]] and the [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]]. Afterwards, the Hudson passes [[Wappingers Falls]] and takes in [[Wappinger Creek]]. The river then forms the boundary between Orange and Dutchess Counties. It flows between [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] and [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]] and under the [[Newburgh Beacon Bridge]], taking in the [[Fishkill Creek]]. In this area, between Gee's Point at the [[US Military Academy]] and [[Constitution Island]], an area known as &quot;World's End&quot; marks the deepest part of the Hudson, at {{convert|202|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;depth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=River Guide to the Hudson Highlands|last=Aimon|first=Alan C.|publisher=[[Hudson River Valley Institute]]|url=http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/library/pdfs/riverguidehudsonhighlands.pdf|date=November 27, 2009|access-date=November 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230052252/http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/library/pdfs/riverguidehudsonhighlands.pdf|archive-date=December 30, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the river enters the [[Hudson Highlands]] between Putnam and Orange Counties, flowing between mountains such as [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]], [[Breakneck Ridge]], and [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. The river narrows considerably here before flowing under the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]], which connects Westchester and Rockland Counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2016 One World Observatory view along Hudson River.jpg|thumb|The river between [[Hudson Waterfront]] in New Jersey (left) and [[Manhattan]] (right)]]
Afterward, leaving the Hudson Highlands, the river enters [[Haverstraw Bay]], the widest point of the river at {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Water Quality Assessment&quot;/&gt; Shortly thereafter, the river forms the [[Tappan Zee]] and flows under the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017–present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], which carries the [[New York State Thruway]] between [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] in Westchester and Rockland Counties respectively. At the state line with [[New Jersey]] the west bank of the Hudson enters [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|The Palisades]] are large, rocky cliffs along the west bank of the river; also known as [[Bergen Hill]] at their lower end in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]]. Further south the east bank of the river becomes [[Yonkers]] and then the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] neighborhood of the [[Bronx]] in New York City. South of the confluence of the Hudson and [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]], the east bank of the river becomes [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt; The river is sometimes still called the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] at this point. The [[George Washington Bridge]] crosses the river between [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]] and the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWBridge&quot;/&gt; The [[Lincoln Tunnel]] and the [[Holland Tunnel]] also cross under the river between Manhattan and New Jersey. South of [[the Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]], the river proper ends, meeting the [[East River]] to form [[Upper New York Bay]], also known as New York Harbor. Its outflow continues through [[the Narrows]] between [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]], under the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano Bridge]], and into [[Lower New York Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson River Map&quot;/&gt;

The lower Hudson is actually a tidal estuary, with tidal influence extending as far as the [[Federal Dam (Troy)|Federal Dam]] in [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. There are about two high tides and two low tides per day. As the tide rises, the tidal current moves northward, taking enough time that part of the river can be at high tide while another part can be at the bottom of its low tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;RP&quot;/&gt;

Strong tides make parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate. During the winter, ice floes may drift south or north, depending upon the tides. The [[Mahican]] name of the river represents its partially estuarine nature: ''muh-he-kun-ne-tuk'' means &quot;the river that flows both ways.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rittner&quot;/&gt; Due to tidal influence from the ocean extending to Troy, NY,&lt;ref name=&quot;RP&quot;/&gt; freshwater discharge is only about {{convert|17400|cuft}} per second on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Island Discharge&quot;/&gt; The mean fresh water discharge at the river's mouth in New York is approximately {{convert|21900|cuft}} per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discharge&quot;/&gt;

The Hudson River is {{convert|315|mi|km}} long, with depths of {{convert|30|ft}} for the stretch south of the Federal Dam, dredged to maintain the river as a shipping route. Some sections there are around 160 feet deep,&lt;ref name=&quot;RP&quot;/&gt; and the deepest part of the Hudson, known as &quot;World's End&quot; (between the [[US Military Academy]] and [[Constitution Island]]) has a depth of {{convert|202|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;depth&quot;/&gt;

The Hudson and its tributaries, notably the Mohawk River, drain an area of {{convert|13000|sqmi}}, the Hudson River Watershed. It covers much of New York, as well as parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont.&lt;ref name=&quot;RP&quot;/&gt;

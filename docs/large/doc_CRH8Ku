In 1880 Sullivan was appointed director of the triennial [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier been commissioned to write a sacred choral work for the festival and chose, as its subject, [[Henry Hart Milman]]'s 1822 dramatic poem based on the life and death of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]].

This is a rather subtle conductor who makes his effects almost unexpectedly, so reticent is his manner and so quiet his method.  Yet effects are there, and … are marked by a great smoothness in the linking of phrase with phrase, and in consequence by a wonderful fluent continuousness of melody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Vernon. &quot;Leeds Musical Festival&quot;, ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 7 October 1898, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but ''Martyr'' had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 190, 195, 203, 215, 255–56 and 390&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics and performers had favorable reactions to Sullivan's conducting, and he had a busy conducting career in parallel with his composing career, including seven Leeds Festivals among many other appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan invariably conducted the opening nights of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 3–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte opened the next Gilbert and Sullivan piece, ''[[Patience (operetta)|Patience]]'', in April 1881 at London's [[Opera Comique]], where their past three operas had played. In October, ''Patience'' transferred to the new, larger, state-of-the-art [[Savoy Theatre]], built with the profits of the previous Gilbert and Sullivan works. The rest of the partnership's collaborations were produced at the Savoy, and are widely known as the &quot;[[Savoy opera]]s&quot;.{{refn|The term came to be applied to all 13 surviving Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and extended, by some writers, to the other comic operas and companion pieces produced at the Savoy Theatre until 1909.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 September 1910, p. 1; Fitz-Gerald, ''The Story of the Savoy Opera'', ''passim''; Rollins and Witts, ''passim''; and Farrell, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines the phrase as: &quot;Designating any of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas originally presented at the Savoy Theatre in London by the D'Oyly Carte company.

After ''Iolanthe'', Sullivan had not intended to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882. Therefore, he concluded that his financial needs obliged him to continue writing Savoy operas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1883, he and Gilbert signed a five-year agreement with Carte, requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 1883 Sullivan was [[Knight bachelor|knighted]] by [[Queen Victoria]] for his &quot;services&amp;nbsp;... rendered to the promotion of the art of music&quot; in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should end his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or [[grand opera]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;Dailey, p. 28; and Lawrence, pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884, the duo's only three-act, [[blank verse]] work), had a shorter run than its four predecessors; Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's close friend, the composer [[Frederic Clay]], had recently suffered a career-ending stroke at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own long-standing kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, &quot;[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

Gilbert had already started work on a new opera in which the characters fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. Sullivan wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had &quot;come to the end of my tether&quot; with the operas: &quot;I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost.&amp;nbsp;...  I should like to set a story of human interest &amp; probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, &amp; where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the &quot;lozenge&quot; element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque &quot;elements of topsyturveydom&quot; and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially ''The Sorcerer''.{{refn|Even after Gilbert made changes (but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be), Sullivan did not accept it.&lt;ref name=j190/&gt;|group= n}} He repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject.&lt;ref name=j190&gt;Jacobs, pp. 190–93&lt;/ref&gt; The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.{{refn| The longest-running piece of musical theatre was [[Robert Planquette]]'s 1877 [[opéra-comique]] ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which held the record until [[Alfred Cellier]]'s operetta ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' ran for 931 performances beginning in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Mackerness, E.D.

In 1886 Sullivan composed his second and last large-scale choral work of the decade. It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'', based on [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan's best received full-length work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 242–43&lt;/ref&gt; It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen.

''[[Ruddigore]]'' followed ''The Mikado'' at the Savoy in 1887. It was profitable, but its nine-month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 259–61&lt;/ref&gt; For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot, which Sullivan again rejected. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 265, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was not a grand opera, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 281–82; and Jacobs, pp. 274–75&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1883 Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885 he told an interviewer, &quot;The opera of the future is a compromise [among the French, German and Italian schools] – a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school.&amp;nbsp;... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=sfc&gt;&quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Talk With the Composer of ''Pinafore''&quot;, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 22 July 1885, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; After ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' opened, Sullivan turned again to Shakespeare, composing incidental music for [[Henry Irving]]'s [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' had &quot;not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still&quot;.&lt;ref name=WriteTwoOperas/&gt; He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy.{{refn|Gilbert wrote, &quot;We have a name, jointly, for humorous work, tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama. I think we should do unwisely if we left, altogether, the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully. I can quite understand your desire to write a big work, well, why not write one? But why abandon the Savoy business? Cannot the two things be done concurrently? If you can write an oratorio like ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' while you are occupied by pieces like ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and ''[[Iolanthe]]'', can't you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like ''The Yeomen of the Guard''?&quot;&lt;ref name=WriteTwoOperas&gt;Letter from Gilbert to Sullivan, 20 February 1889, quoted in Jacobs, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, &quot;I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.&quot;{{refn|Sullivan continued, &quot;I have lost the necessary nerve for it, and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me. The types used over and over again (unavoidable in such a company as ours), the [[George Grossmith|Grossmith]] part, the middle-aged woman with fading charms, cannot again be clothed in music by me. Nor can I again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest.&amp;nbsp;... You say that in serious opera, ''you'' must more or less sacrifice yourself. I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful. Business and syllabic setting assume an importance which, however much they fetter me, cannot be overlooked. I am bound, in the interests of the piece, to give way. Hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music, not govern it, and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Sullivan to Gilbert, 12 March 1889, quoted in Jacobs, pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from [[Julian Sturgis]] (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 282–83 and 288; and Ainger, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The comic opera was completed first: ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889) was a piece described by [[Gervase Hughes]] as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes, p. 24&quot;&gt;Hughes, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, going so far as to sign an affidavit that contained erroneous information about old debts of the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 315–16&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan, vowing to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was &quot;physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled&amp;nbsp;... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew.

Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', based on [[Walter Scott]]'s [[Ivanhoe|novel]], opened at Carte's new [[Royal English Opera House]] on 31 January 1891. Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of £3,000 ({{Inflation|UK|3000|1899|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-3}}) for his delay.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 328–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a grand opera, and earned good notices for its music.&lt;ref name=GP&gt;Gordon-Powell, Robin. ''Ivanhoe'', full score, Introduction, vol. I, pp. XII–XIV, 2008, The Amber Ring&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions and sold the theatre. Despite the initial success of ''Ivanhoe'', some writers blamed it for the failure of the opera house, and it soon passed into obscurity.&lt;ref name=GP/&gt; [[Herman Klein]] called the episode &quot;the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Herman.

Sullivan returned to comic opera, but because of the fracture with Gilbert, he and Carte sought other collaborators. Sullivan's next piece was ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' (1892), with a libretto by [[Sydney Grundy]] based loosely on the legend of the elopement of [[Dorothy Vernon]] with John Manners.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 336–42&lt;/ref&gt; Although still comic, the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert. It ran for 204 performances, and was praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 341–42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum, this time for [[J. Comyns Carr]]'s ''[[Media:Arthur Sullivan - Incidental music to King Arthur.pdf|King Arthur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt;

With the aid of an intermediary, Sullivan's music publisher [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], the three partners were reunited in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Their next opera, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Clifton. [https://gsarchive.net/savoy/mirette/intro.html &quot;''Mirette'': Introduction&quot;], the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 May 1998, accessed 28 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, [[Nancy McIntosh]], and refused to write another piece featuring her; Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. ''[[The Chieftain]]'' (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, ''The Contrabandista'', flopped.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896). It failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1897 Sullivan's full-length ballet, ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]'', opened at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] to celebrate the Queen's [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The work celebrates English history and culture, with the Victorian period as the grand finale. Its six-month run was considered a great achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 372–76&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898), with a libretto by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and J. Comyns Carr, was based on mediaeval [[morality play]]s. The collaboration did not go well: Sullivan wrote that Pinero and Comyns Carr were &quot;gifted and brilliant men, with ''no'' experience in writing for music&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Entry from Sullivan's diary, quoted in Jacobs p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; and, when he asked for alterations to improve the structure, they refused.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; The opera, moreover, was too serious for the Savoy audiences' tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Clifton. [https://gsarchive.net/sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_notes.html &quot;''The Beauty Stone'': Notes on the Text&quot;], the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2004, accessed 18 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical failure and ran for only seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 379–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, to benefit &quot;the wives and children of soldiers and sailors&quot; on active service in the [[South African War|Boer War]], Sullivan composed the music of a song, &quot;[[The Absent-Minded Beggar]]&quot;, to a text by [[Rudyard Kipling]], which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £300,000 ({{Inflation|UK|300000|1899|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-5}}) for the fund from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Lycett, p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by [[Basil Hood]] that combined an exotic ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' setting with plot elements of ''The Mikado''. Sullivan's tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 387, 391–92&lt;/ref&gt; Another opera with Hood, ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died before it was completed. The score was finished by [[Edward German]], and produced in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Arthur Sullivan Memorial, Victoria Embankment Gardens|monument]] in the composer's memory featuring a weeping [[Muse]] was erected in the [[Victoria Embankment]] Gardens in London and is inscribed with Gilbert's words from ''The Yeomen of the Guard'': &quot;Is life a boon?

Sullivan's operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces&lt;ref name=DanceArr/&gt; and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets (''[[Pineapple Poll]]'' (1951) and ''[[Pirates of Penzance – The Ballet!]]'' (1991)) and musicals (''[[The Swing Mikado]]'' (1938), ''[[The Hot Mikado (1939 production)|The Hot Mikado]]'' (1939) and ''[[Hot Mikado]]'' (1986), ''[[Hollywood Pinafore]]'' and ''[[Memphis Bound]]'' (both 1945), ''[[The Black Mikado]]'' (1975), etc.).

===Romantic life===

Sullivan never married, but he had serious love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845–1882), the daughter of the engineer [[John Scott Russell]]. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer of uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868 Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships ended by early 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 87; and Jacobs, pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| Some two hundred love letters from the two Scott Russell women survive and are excerpted in detail in Wolfson.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Sullivan's longest love affair was with the American socialite [[Fanny Ronalds]], a woman three years his senior, who had two children.&lt;ref name=ainger128&gt;Ainger, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London in 1871.&lt;ref name=ainger128/&gt; According to a contemporary description of Ronalds, &quot;Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – ''châtain foncé'' [deep chestnut] – and very abundant&amp;nbsp;... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan called her &quot;the best amateur singer in London&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirées.&lt;ref name=ainger128/&gt; She became particularly associated with &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;, singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronalds was separated from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private.{{refn|In Sullivan's diary, she appears as &quot;Mrs. Ronalds&quot; when he refers to their meetings in public, and &quot;L. W.&quot; (for &quot;Little Woman&quot;) or &quot;D. H.&quot; (possibly &quot;Dear Heart&quot;) for when they were alone together. When noting their private meetings, Sullivan indicated with tick marks the number of sexual acts completed. After the relationship with Ronalds had ceased to be sexual the tick marks no longer appeared alongside mentions of her, but continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified, and who were always referred to by their initials.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 161; and Ainger, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} She apparently became pregnant at least twice and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 178, 203–04; and Ainger, pp. 210 and 237–38&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrels when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her.{{refn|One such flirtation was with &quot;Anna&quot;, whom he met in Paris in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Around 1889 or 1890 the sexual relationship evidently ended – he started to refer to her in his diary as &quot;Auntie&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; – but she remained a constant companion for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 306 and 342&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 the 54-year-old Sullivan proposed marriage to the 22-year-old Violet Beddington (1874–1962), but she refused him.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 364–65&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Beddington later married [[Sydney Schiff]], who used elements of her relationship with Sullivan in his 1925 novel ''Myrtle''.

Sullivan was devoted to his parents, particularly his mother. He corresponded regularly with her when away from London, until her death in 1882. [[Henry Lytton]] wrote, &quot;I believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between [Sullivan] and his mother, a very witty old lady, and one who took an exceptional pride in her son's accomplishments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry (1922).

Three of Sullivan's cousins, the daughters of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, performed with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]: Rose, Jane (&quot;Jennie&quot;) and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey.

Sullivan's works comprise 24 operas, 11 full orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, more than 70 hymns and anthems, over 80 songs and parlour ballads, and a body of part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic output spanned his whole career, as did that of his songs and religious music. The solo piano and chamber pieces are mostly from his early years, and are generally in a Mendelssohnian style.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of his ''Imperial March'', composed for a royal occasion in 1893, the large-scale orchestral concert works also date from early in the composer's career.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp, 271–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers and scholars often cite Mendelssohn as the most important influence on Sullivan.&lt;ref name=y22/&gt; The music for ''The Tempest'' and the ''Irish Symphony'', among other works, was seen by contemporary writers as strikingly Mendelssohnian.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 1, 3rd and 4th page&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Young writes that Sullivan's early affection for Mendelssohn remained evident throughout his composing career.&lt;ref name=y22&gt;Young, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes remarks that although Sullivan emulated Mendelssohn in certain ways he seldom &quot;lapsed into those harmonic clichés which mar some of Mendelssohn's more sentimental effusions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Tempest'' music was first presented the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' identified [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] as a stronger influence, and Benedict Taylor, writing in 2017, concurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 study Taylor adds Schubert as another major influence on Sullivan in his orchestral works, although &quot;from the beginning ... there is the peculiar, intangible stamp of Sullivan emerging confidently&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Meinhard Saremba notes that from Sullivan's first meeting with [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris, in 1862, Rossini's output became a model for Sullivan's comic opera music, &quot;as evidenced in several rhythmic patterns and constructions of long finales&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, Sullivan's conservative musical education led him to follow in the conventions of his predecessors. Later he became more adventurous; Richard Silverman, writing in 2009, points to the influence of Liszt in later works – a harmonic ambiguity and [[chromaticism]] – so that by the time of ''The Golden Legend'' Sullivan had abandoned a [[Tonic (music)|home]] key altogether for the prelude.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan disliked much of Wagner's [[Musikdrama]], but he modelled the overture to ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' on the prelude of ''[[Die Meistersinger]]'', which he described as &quot;the greatest comic opera ever written&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, p. 57; and Klein, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Saremba writes that in works from his middle and later years, Sullivan was inspired by Verdi's example both in details of orchestration, and in ''la tinta musical'' – the individual musical character of a piece – ranging from the &quot;nautical air of ''H.M.S Pinafore''&quot; to &quot;the swift Mediterranean lightness of ''The Gondoliers''&quot; and &quot;the bleakness of Torquilstone in ''Ivanhoe''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of composition and text setting===
Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, &quot;I don't use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly&quot;. Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but &quot;to dig for it.&amp;nbsp;... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody.&amp;nbsp;... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lawrence2&gt;Lawrence, Arthur H. [http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/interviews/lawrence.html &quot;An Illustrated interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan, Part I&quot;], ''The Strand Magazine'', vol. xiv, No. 84, December 1897&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was &quot;vastly more sensitive.&amp;nbsp;... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis&quot;, and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve &quot;the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fink, Robert. [http://www.sullivan-forschung.de/html/f1-analysen.html &quot;Rhythm and Text Setting in ''The Mikado''&quot;], ''19th Century Music'', vol. XIV No. 1, Summer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In composing the Savoy operas, Sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first, and these were given to the actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be.&lt;ref name=Lawrence2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; He left the overtures until last and sometimes delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/sullivan/interviews/gazette.html &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan&quot;], interviewed by ''The Pall Mall Gazette'', 5 December 1889, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; often adding his suggestions or corrections.&lt;ref name=Hughes130&gt;Hughes, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Those Sullivan wrote himself include ''Thespis'',&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iolanthe'', ''Princess Ida'', ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', ''The Gondoliers'', ''The Grand Duke'' and probably ''Utopia, Limited''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 130–41&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the overtures are structured as a [[potpourri (music)|pot-pourri]] of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast.&lt;ref name=Hughes130/&gt; Those for ''Iolanthe'' and ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' are written in a modified [[sonata form]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melody and rhythm===
''The Musical Times'' noted that Sullivan's tunes, at least in the comic operas, appeal to the professional as much as to the layman: his continental contemporaries such as [[Saint-Saëns]] and the Viennese critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] held the Savoy operas in high regard.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 244; and Harding, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes writes, &quot;When Sullivan wrote what we call 'a good tune' it was nearly always 'good music' as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hughes129/&gt; Although his melodies sprang from rhythm,&lt;ref name=Lawrence2/&gt; some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.&lt;ref name=Hughes129&gt;Hughes, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:If-you-go-in-verse-refrain.tif|thumb|upright=2.75|Climaxes of verse and refrain of &quot;If You Go In&quot; (''[[Iolanthe]]'')|alt=Excerpt of music – part of Tolloller's line]]
In the comic operas, where many numbers are in verse-plus-refrain form, Sullivan shaped his melodies to provide a climax for the verse, capped by an overall climax in the refrain.&lt;ref name=h128/&gt; Hughes cites &quot;If you go in&quot; (''Iolanthe'') as an example. He adds that Sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence in instrumental works, where he had no librettist to feed his imagination.&lt;ref name=h128&gt;Hughes, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Even with Gilbert, on those occasions when the librettist wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as in &quot;Love Is a Plaintive Song&quot; (''Patience'') and &quot;A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid&quot; (''The Yeomen of the Guard'').&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan preferred to write in [[major key]]s, overwhelmingly in the Savoy operas, and even in his serious works.&lt;ref name=Hughes52&gt;Hughes, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the ''Irish Symphony'', &quot;Go Away, Madam&quot; in the Act I finale of ''Iolanthe'' (echoing [[Verdi]] and [[Beethoven]]) and the execution march in the Act I finale of ''The Yeomen of the Guard''.&lt;ref name=Hughes52/&gt;

===Harmony and counterpoint===
Sullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him.&lt;ref name=Hughes44&gt;Hughes, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of early-nineteenth-century composers including Mendelssohn, [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]] and Schubert.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 44 and 49&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in &quot;Expressive Glances&quot; (''Princess Ida''), where he negotiates smoothly E major, C sharp minor and C major, or &quot;Then One of Us will Be a Queen&quot; (''The Gondoliers''), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

When reproached for using [[consecutive fifths]] in ''Cox and Box'', Sullivan replied &quot;if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, so long as there is no offence to the ear.&quot;&lt;ref name=musicaltimes/&gt; Both Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacobs in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; comment adversely on Sullivan's overuse of [[Pedal point|tonic pedals]], usually in the bass, which Hughes attributes to &quot;lack of enterprise or even downright laziness&quot;. Another Sullivan trademark criticised by Hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the [[augmented fourth]] at moments of pathos.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; In his serious works, Sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the Savoy operas, with the result, according to Hughes, that ''The Golden Legend'' is a &quot;hotch-potch of harmonic styles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Mikado-trio.tif|thumb|upright=2.75|Characteristic &quot;counterpoint of characters&quot; from ''The Mikado'', Act 1|alt=Excerpt of music – part of &quot;I Am So Proud&quot;]]
One of Sullivan's best-known devices is what Jacobs terms his &quot;'counterpoint of characters': the presentation by different personages of two seemingly independent tunes which later come together&quot; simultaneously. He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way,{{refn|An earlier exponent of the device was [[Hector Berlioz]], who called it the ''réunion de deux thèmes''. The article on Berlioz in ''Grove'' cites examples including the finale of the ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', where the &quot;witches' sabbath&quot; theme is combined with the [[Dies irae]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Macdonald|Macdonald, Hugh]]. [https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.51424 &quot;Berlioz, (Louis-)Hector&quot;], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, 2001 accessed 11 October 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but in Jacobs's phrase it became almost &quot;the trademark of Sullivan's operetta style&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=h78&gt;Hughes, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in &quot;I Am So Proud&quot; (''The Mikado''), which combines three melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 79 and 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the women is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include &quot;When the Foeman Bares his Steel&quot; (''The Pirates of Penzance''), &quot;In a Doleful Train&quot; (''Patience'') and &quot;Welcome, Gentry&quot; (''Ruddigore'').&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;How Beautifully Blue the Sky&quot; (''The Pirates of Penzance''), one theme is given to the chorus (in 2/4 time) and the other to solo voices (in 3/4).&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan rarely composed [[fugue]]s. Examples are from the &quot;Epilogue&quot; to ''The Golden Legend'' and ''Victoria and Merrie England''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Iolanthe'' (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's [[leitmotif]] in the latter).&lt;ref name=h75/&gt; Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as &quot;Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day&quot; (''The Mikado'') and &quot;When the Buds Are Blossoming&quot; (''Ruddigore'').&lt;ref name=h75&gt;Hughes, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orchestration===
Hughes concludes his chapter on Sullivan's orchestration: &quot;[I]n this vitally important sector of the composer's art he deserves to rank as a master.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and technically a most skilful orchestrator.{{refn|Sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon, but less proficiently.&lt;ref name=young4/&gt;|group= n}} Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: &quot;Sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan's orchestra for the Savoy operas was typical of the theatre orchestra of his era: 2 flutes (+ [[piccolo]]), oboe, 2 clarinets, [[bassoon]], 2 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[cornet]]s, 2 trombones, [[timpani]], percussion and strings. According to [[Geoffrey Toye]], the number of players in Sullivan's Savoy Theatre orchestras was a &quot;minimum&quot; of 31.&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, Paul. &quot;Authentic Sullivan&quot;, ''[[Opera (British magazine)|Opera]]'', November 2016, p. 1372; and &quot;The Savoy Opera Revival&quot;, ''The Observer'', 28 September 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestra's size, and, starting with ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment, noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging, so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music.&lt;ref&gt;Findon, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; For his large-scale orchestral pieces, which often employed very large forces, Sullivan added a second oboe part, sometimes [[double bassoon]] and [[bass clarinet]], more horns, trumpets, tuba, and occasionally an organ and/or a harp.&lt;ref&gt;Eden and Saremba, Appendix: The orchestration of Sullivan's major works&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recognisable features in Sullivan's orchestration is his woodwind scoring. Hughes especially notes Sullivan's clarinet writing, exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument, and his particular fondness for oboe solos. For instance, the ''Irish Symphony'' contains two long solo oboe passages in succession, and in the Savoy operas there are many shorter examples.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In the operas, and also in concert works, another characteristic Sullivan touch is his fondness for [[pizzicato]] passages for the string sections. Hughes instances &quot;Kind Sir, You Cannot Have the Heart&quot; (''The Gondoliers''), &quot;Free From his Fetters Grim&quot; (''The Yeomen of the Guard'') and &quot;In Vain to Us You Plead&quot; (''Iolanthe'').&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical quotations and parodies===
[[File:sullivan-1870.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Sullivan in about 1870|alt=Head and shoulders of Sullivan as a young man, wearing a moustache, long sideburns and a serious expression]]
Throughout the Savoy operas, and occasionally in other works, Sullivan quotes or imitates well-known themes or parodies the styles of famous composers.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Martin. &quot;Sullivan&quot;, ''Opera News'', April 1960, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion he may have echoed his predecessors unconsciously: Hughes cites a [[George Frederick Handel|Handelian]] influence in &quot;Hereupon We're Both Agreed&quot; (''The Yeomen of the Guard''), and [[Rodney Milnes]] called &quot;Sighing Softly&quot; in ''The Pirates of Penzance'' &quot;a song plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan's hero, Schubert&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes, p. 152&quot;&gt;Hughes, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milnes, Rodney. &quot;Putting the Jolly in Roger&quot;, ''The Times'', 26 April 2001, Section 2, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Greenfield]] found a theme in the slow movement of the ''Irish Symphony'' &quot;an outrageous crib&quot; from Schubert's [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|''Unfinished'' Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. &quot;Sullivan – Symphony in E major&quot;, ''The Gramophone'', February 1969, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In early pieces, Sullivan drew on Mendelssohn's style in his music for ''The Tempest'', Auber's in his ''Henry VIII'' music and [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s in ''The Light of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;De Ternant, Andrew. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/911932 &quot;Debussy and Others on Sullivan&quot;], ''The Musical Times'', 1 December 1924, pp. 1089–90 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Mendelssohn pervades the fairy music in ''Iolanthe''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 46–47 and 152&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Legend'' shows the influence of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 221; and Burton, Nigel. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/964387 &quot;100 Years of a Legend&quot;], ''The Musical Times'', 1 October 1986 pp. 554–57 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan adopted traditional musical forms, such as [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] in ''The Mikado'', ''Ruddigore'' and ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' and [[glee (music)|glees]] in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Mikado'', and the Venetian [[barcarolle]] in ''The Gondoliers''. He made use of dance styles to enhance the sense of time or place in various scenes: [[gavotte]]s in ''Ruddigore'' and ''The Gondoliers'';&lt;ref name=h144&gt;Hughes, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; a country dance in ''The Sorcerer''; a nautical hornpipe in ''Ruddigore''; and the Spanish [[cachucha]] and Italian [[saltarello]] and [[tarantella]] in ''The Gondoliers''.&lt;ref name=h144/&gt; Occasionally he drew on influences from further afield. In ''The Mikado'', he used an old Japanese war song, and his 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera ''The Rose of Persia''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Rose of Persia; Or, the Story-teller and the Slave&quot;, ''The Era'', 2 December 1899, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Sullivan wrote undisguised parody. Of the sextet &quot;I Hear the Soft Note&quot; in ''Patience'', he said to the singers, &quot;I think you will like this. It is [[Michael Arne|Dr. Arne]] and [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]] at their best.&quot;&lt;ref name=GGReminiscence/&gt; In his comic operas, he followed [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s lead in lampooning the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and Verdi.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 150–51; and Jacobs, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his operatic parody include Mabel's aria &quot;Poor Wand'ring One&quot; in ''The Pirates of Penzance'', the duet &quot;Who Are You, Sir?&quot; from ''Cox and Box'',&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 151 and 80&lt;/ref&gt; and the whispered plans for elopement in &quot;This Very Night&quot; in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', parodying the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Rigoletto]]''.&lt;ref name=Scherer&gt;Scherer, Barrymore Laurence. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304186404576390112252351044 &quot;Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, Parody's Patresfamilias&quot;], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 23 June 2011, accessed 19 December 2017 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mock-jingoistic &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot; in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and choral passages in ''The Zoo'' satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's &quot;[[Rule, Britannia!]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Scherer/&gt; The chorus &quot;With Catlike Tread&quot; from ''The Pirates'' parodies Verdi's &quot;[[Anvil Chorus]]&quot; from ''Il trovatore''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 150–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes calls Bouncer's song in ''Cox and Box'' &quot;a jolly Handelian parody&quot; and notes a strong Handelian flavour to Arac's song in Act III of ''Princess Ida''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes, p. 152&quot;/&gt; In &quot;A More Humane Mikado&quot;, at the words &quot;Bach interwoven with [[Louis Spohr|Spohr]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]&quot;, the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of Bach's [[Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542|Fantasia and Fugue in G minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan sometimes used Wagnerian [[leitmotif]]s for both comic and dramatic effect. In ''Iolanthe'', a distinctive four-note theme is associated with the title character, the Lord Chancellor has a fugal motif, and the Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagner heroines such as [[Brünnhilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' the [[Tower of London]] is evoked by its own motif.&lt;ref name=h143&gt;Hughes, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the leitmotif technique is repeated and developed further in ''Ivanhoe''.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

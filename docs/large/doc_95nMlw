Historians theorise that had Warwick's force joined Margaret's before challenging Edward, the combined Lancastrian army would have overwhelmed the Yorkists. Instead, Warwick's defeat gave the Yorkists a victory so decisive that it, along with the Battle of Tewkesbury, secured the English throne for Edward IV.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172, 175–176}} Historian Colin Richmond believes that Edward's return to power was assured at Barnet—Tewkesbury was &quot;merely an epilogue&quot;.{{Sfn|Richmond|2000|p=143}} Without having to contend with Warwick's popularity and political influence, the young Yorkist king could fully exert his will and rule the land unchallenged. Ballads composed during Edward's reign celebrated his victory as sanctioned by God: &quot;Man proposes, oftimes in veyn, But God disposes, the boke telleth pleyn&quot;.{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|p=311}} Barnet was a disaster for the Nevilles; their lands given away and their offices reduced. The family never again reached the prominence in English politics that they had enjoyed before the battle.{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|p=312}}

===Shakespearian dramatisation===
[[File:The Death of the Earl of Warwick (frame, bw).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man, wearing armour and a surcoat, lies on the ground. His helmet is off, and his face is turned towards a kneeling knight, who is supporting him. Standing behind the two is another knight, whose sword and shield are held at the ready.|''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'': Warwick, dying at the Battle of Barnet, speaks his last words.]]

The battle is alluded to in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' (1595).{{Sfn|Martin|Shakespeare|2001|pp=9–10}} The end of Act V, scene one depicts the events leading up to the battle; scenes two and three portray the conclusion, in which the characters discuss the combat and the fates of its participants. Shakespeare uses few details reported by contemporary chroniclers and ignores notable incidents, such as the confusion over Oxford's and Edward's badges.{{Sfn|Goy-Blanquet|2003|p=131}} His play is based mostly on poetic and dramatic sources. In the play, Montagu is killed while trying to save his brother (Shakespeare's source material included Hall's 1548 ''The Union of the Two Noble and Illustrate Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke''),{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=xlvi}}{{Sfn|Goy-Blanquet|2003|p=169}} and Warwick is dragged in by Edward IV and left to speak his dying words to Oxford and Somerset.{{Sfn|Goy-Blanquet|2003|p=124}} Warwick's death dominates the scenes, reflecting Hall's vivid portrayal of the earl's passing as a valiant death.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=78}} Furthermore, whereas several chronicles mention Edward's desire to capture Warwick, Shakespeare has the Yorkist king lustily demand Warwick's skin.{{Sfn|Goy-Blanquet|2003|p=169}}

Shakespeare presents the Nevilles as brothers who are willing to die for each other, whereas the three sons of York—Edward, Gloucester, and Clarence—are slowly driven apart by their own goals and ideas.{{Sfn|Martin|Shakespeare|2001|pp=51–63}} Professor of English John Cox suggests that Shakespeare did not share the impression given in post-battle ballads that Edward's triumph was divinely ordained. He argues that Shakespeare's placement of Clarence's last act of betrayal immediately before the battle suggests that Edward's rule stems from his military aggression, luck, and &quot;policy&quot;.{{Sfn|Cox|2007|p=112}} Shakespeare also explicitly excludes Edward from action sequences, a departure from Hall's depictions.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=79}}

===Battlefield===
[[File:Hadley Highstone cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A column of stone stands on a square base.|Hadley Highstone, [[Monken Hadley]]: an obelisk erected to mark the battle and the spot where Warwick the Kingmaker died]]

[[English Heritage]], a government body in charge of conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600&amp;nbsp;metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north of the town of Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain has changed, and records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to conclude the exact location of the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.{{refn|Gravett, however, states that due to the extensive build-up and remodelling of the town, even these elements are suspect and may not correlate to 15th-century features.{{Sfn|Gravett|2003|pp=89–90}}|group=nb}}

English Heritage suggests that a 15th-century letter from a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchant, Gerhard von Wessel, helps to identify the battlefield via geological features. It mentions a &quot;broad green&quot; which corresponds to [[Hadley Green]], and the marsh on the right flank of the Yorkist line is likely to be in the valley of the [[Monken Mead Brook]]. The letter also mentions St Albans road, which has remained largely the same, winding through the fields. Urbanisation over the 18th and 19th centuries, however, has populated much of the area with buildings. By the 20th century, the suburb of [[Monken Hadley]] covered part of the fields where the Battle of Barnet was fought.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=1–2}} A hedge in the local golf course, as suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Alfred Burne|Alfred H. Burne]], is likely the row of shrubs behind which Oxford's men lined up and took cover.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}}

In 1740 Sir Jeremy Sambroke erected an obelisk to commemorate the battle about {{convert|200|m|ft}} south of the junction between the Great North Road and Kitts End Road. It was later moved just north of the junction on the grass between the two roads. Known as Hadley Highstone, it stands {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} tall and marks its location with the inscription:{{Sfn|Brooke|1857|p=211}}
{{quote|&quot;Here was fought the Famous Battle Between Edward the 4th and the Earl of Warwick April the 14th ANNO 1471 in which the Earl was Defeated And Slain.&quot;{{Sfn|Haigh|1995|p=120}}}}

The battle is referred to in the [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Barnet]] which display a red and a silver rose in the top of the shield and two crossed swords in the crest.

{{Weapons of mass destruction}}

[[File:USChemicalWeaponsStockpiles082808.jpg|thumb|Stockpile/disposal site locations for the United States' chemical weapons and the sites operating status as of August 28, 2008.]]
'''Chemical warfare''' ('''CW''') involves using the [[toxic properties]] of [[chemical substance]]s as [[Chemical weapon|weapons]]. This type of warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]], [[biological warfare]] and [[radiological warfare]], which together make up [[CBRN defense|CBRN]], the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical (warfare or weapons), all of which are considered &quot;[[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]&quot; (WMDs). None of these fall under the term [[conventional weapon]]s which are primarily effective due to their destructive potential. In theory, with proper protective equipment, training, and decontamination measures, the primary effects of chemical weapons can be overcome. In practice, they continue to cause much suffering, as most victims are defenseless. Many nations possess vast stockpiles of weaponized agents in preparation for wartime use. The threat and the perceived threat have become strategic tools in planning both measures and counter-measures.

The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under [[Customary international law|customary]] [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule74 Rule 74. The use of chemical weapons is prohibited.], ''Customary IHL Database'', [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC)/[[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Definition==
Chemical warfare is different from the use of [[conventional weapon]]s or [[nuclear weapon]]s because the destructive effects of [[chemical weapon]]s are not primarily due to any [[explosion|explosive]] force. The offensive use of living [[organism]]s (such as [[anthrax disease|anthrax]]) is considered [[biological warfare]] rather than chemical warfare; however, the use of nonliving toxic products produced by living organisms (e.g. [[toxin]]s such as [[botulinum toxin]], [[ricin]], and [[saxitoxin]]) ''is'' considered chemical warfare under the provisions of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC). Under this convention, any toxic chemical, regardless of its origin, is considered a chemical weapon unless it is used for purposes that are not prohibited (an important legal definition known as the [[General Purpose Criterion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (CWC): Annexes and Original Signatories|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/trty/175492.htm|publisher=Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 70 different chemicals have been used or [[Stockpile (military)|stockpiled]] as chemical warfare agents during the 20th century. The entire class known as [[Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions]] have been scheduled for elimination by the CWC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/disarmament-lessons-the-chemical-weapons-convention Disarmament lessons from the Chemical Weapons Convention] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035236/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/disarmament-lessons-the-chemical-weapons-convention |date=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the convention, chemicals that are toxic enough to be used as chemical weapons, or that may be used to manufacture such chemicals, are divided into three groups according to their purpose and treatment:
* [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1]] – Have few, if any, legitimate uses. These may only be produced or used for research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective purposes (i.e. testing of chemical weapons sensors and protective clothing). Examples include [[nerve agents]], [[ricin]], [[lewisite]] and [[mustard gas]]. Any production over 100 g must be reported to the [[OPCW]] and a country can have a stockpile of no more than one tonne of these chemicals.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* [[List of Schedule 2 substances (CWC)|Schedule 2]] – Have no large-scale industrial uses, but may have legitimate small-scale uses. Examples include [[dimethyl methylphosphonate]], a [[wikt:precursor|precursor]] to [[sarin]]  also used as a [[flame retardant]], and [[thiodiglycol]], a precursor chemical used in the manufacture of mustard gas but also widely used as a solvent in [[ink]]s.
* [[List of Schedule 3 substances (CWC)|Schedule 3]] – Have legitimate large-scale industrial uses. Examples include [[phosgene]] and [[chloropicrin]]. Both have been used as chemical weapons but phosgene is an important precursor in the manufacture of plastics and chloropicrin is used as a fumigant. The OPCW must be notified of, and may inspect, any plant producing more than 30 tons per year.

{{Main|History of chemical warfare}}
[[File:Sargent,_John_Singer_(RA)_-_Gassed_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|alt=Men walk in a line with hands on each other's backs|left|thumb|[[John Singer Sargent]]'s iconic World War I painting: [[Gassed (painting)|''Gassed'']], showing blind casualties on a battlefield after a mustard gas attack]]
Simple chemical weapons were used sporadically throughout antiquity and into the Industrial age.&lt;ref&gt;Samir S. Patel, “Early Chemical Warfare – Dura-Europos, Syria,” Archaeology, Vol. 63, No. 1, January/February 2010, http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/syria.html (accessed October 3, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 19th century that the modern conception of chemical warfare emerged, as various scientists and nations proposed the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gasses.

So alarmed were nations that multiple international treaties were passed {{En dash}} banning chemical weapons. This however did not prevent the extensive [[Chemical weapons in World War I|use of chemical weapons in World War I]]. The development of [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]], among others, was used by both sides to try to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]]. Though largely ineffective over the long run, it decidedly changed the nature of the war. In many cases the gasses used did not kill, but instead horribly maimed, injured, or disfigured casualties. Some 1.3&amp;nbsp;million gas casualties were recorded, which may have included up to 260,000 civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

[[File:Fritz_Haber.png|alt=|thumb|[[Fritz Haber]] is considered the &quot;father of chemical warfare&quot; for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing [[Chlorine#Use as a weapon|chlorine]] and other poisonous gases during [[World War I]].]]
The interwar years saw occasional use of chemical weapons, mainly to put down rebellions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EthiopiaHistorical&quot;&gt;&quot;Chemical Weapons&quot; in ''Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia'', 2d ed. (eds. David H. Shinn &amp; Thomas P. Ofcansky: Scarecrow Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In Nazi Germany, much research went into developing new chemical weapons, such as potent [[nerve agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Corum, James S., ''The Roots of Blitzkrieg'', University Press of Kansas, 1992, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; However, chemical weapons saw little battlefield use in World War II. Both sides were prepared to use such weapons, but the Allied powers never did, and the Axis used them only very sparingly. The reason for the lack of use by the Nazis, despite the considerable efforts that had gone into developing new varieties, might have been a lack of technical ability or fears that the Allies would retaliate with their own chemical weapons. Those fears were not unfounded: the Allies made comprehensive plans for defensive and retaliatory use of chemical weapons, and stockpiled large quantities.&lt;ref name=&quot;PandH132135&quot;&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/churchills-plans-drench-germany-poison-gas-anthrax-robert-harris-jeremy-paxman &quot;Paxman and Harris&quot;], Pakistan p. 132–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers&quot;&gt;Callum Borchers, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/11/sean-spicer-someone-as-despicable-as-hitler-didnt-even-sink-to-using-chemical-weapons/ Sean Spicer takes his questionable claims to a new level in Hitler-Assad comparison], ''The Washington Post'' (April 11, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forces used them more widely, though only against their Asian enemies, as they also feared that using it on Western powers would result in retaliation.

The post-war era has seen limited, though devastating, use of chemical weapons. During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly 20,000,000 U.S. gallons (76,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of various chemicals – the &quot;[[rainbow herbicides]]&quot; and defoliants – in Vietnam, eastern Laos, and parts of Cambodia as part of Operation Ranch Hand, reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=2014-05-11|title=Agent Orange's Long Legacy, for Vietnam and Veterans|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/us/agent-oranges-long-legacy-for-vietnam-and-veterans.html|access-date=2020-08-07|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;Some 100,000 Iranian troops were casualties of Iraqi chemical weapons during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fassihi|first=Farnaz|title=In Iran, grim reminders of Saddam's arsenal|date=October 27, 2002|url=http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?/specialprojects/mideaststories/me1209.html|journal=New Jersey Star Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul Hughes|title=It's like a knife stabbing into me|date=January 21, 2003|url=http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=39470|work=The Star (South Africa)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sciolino|first=Elaine|title=Iraq Chemical Arms Condemned, but West Once Looked the Other Way|date=February 13, 2003|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0213-05.htm|journal=[[The New York Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527105217/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0213-05.htm|archivedate=May 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq used mustard gas and nerve agents against its own civilians in the 1988 [[Halabja chemical attack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCHalabja&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/16/newsid_4304000/4304853.stm On this day: 1988: Thousands die in Halabja gas attack], BBC News (March 16, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuban intervention in Angola]] saw limited use of [[organophosphate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angola&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bush War: The Road to Cuito Cuanavale: Soviet Soldiers' Accounts of the Angolan War|publisher=Jacana Media (Pty) Ltd|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4314-0185-7|editor1=Tokarev, Andrei|location=Auckland Park|pages=128–130|editor2=Shubin, Gennady}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government has used [[sarin]], chlorine, and mustard gas in the [[Syrian civil war]] {{En dash}} generally against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp|title=CDC {{!}} Facts About Sarin|website=www.bt.cdc.gov|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/syria-used-chlorine-in-bombs-against-civilians-report-says.html Syria Used Chlorine in Bombs Against Civilians, Report Says], ''The New York Times'', Rick Gladstone, August 24, 2016 retrieved August 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist groups have also used chemical weapons, notably in the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]] and the [[Matsumoto incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/japan-executes-sarin-gas-attack-cult-leader-shoko-asahara-and-six-members-reports|title=Japan executes sarin gas attack cult leader Shoko Asahara and six members|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622032307/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/japan-executes-sarin-gas-attack-cult-leader-shoko-asahara-and-six-members-reports|archive-date=22 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seto, Yasuo. &quot;[https://www.opcw.org/news/article/the-sarin-gas-attack-in-japan-and-the-related-forensic-investigation/ The Sarin Gas Attack in Japan and the Related Forensic Investigation.]&quot; The Sarin Gas Attack in Japan and the Related Forensic Investigation.

Although crude chemical warfare has been employed in many parts of the world for thousands of years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Syed|first=Tanya|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7837826.stm|title=Ancient Persians 'gassed Romans'|publisher=BBC|date=January 19, 2009|accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;modern&quot; chemical warfare began during [[World War I]] – see [[Chemical weapons in World War I]].

Initially, only well-known commercially available chemicals and their variants were used. These included [[chlorine]] and [[phosgene]] gas. The methods used to disperse these agents during battle were relatively unrefined and inefficient. Even so, casualties could be heavy, due to the mainly static troop positions which were characteristic features of [[trench warfare]].

[[Germany]], the first side to employ chemical warfare on the battlefield,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Soon after, the [[France|French]] modified [[artillery]] [[munition]]s to contain phosgene – a much more effective method that became the principal means of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Since the development of modern chemical warfare in World War I, nations have pursued [[research and development]] on chemical weapons that falls into four major categories: new and more deadly agents; more efficient methods of delivering agents to the target (dissemination); more reliable means of defense against chemical weapons; and more sensitive and accurate means of detecting chemical agents.

===Chemical warfare agents===
{{See also|List of chemical warfare agents}}
A chemical used in warfare is called a ''chemical warfare agent'' (''CWA''). About 70 different chemicals have been used or stockpiled as chemical warfare agents during the 20th and 21st centuries. These agents may be in liquid, gas or solid form. Liquid agents that evaporate quickly are said to be ''volatile'' or have a ''high [[vapor pressure]]''. Many chemical agents are made volatile so they can be dispersed over a large region quickly.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The earliest target of chemical warfare agent research was not toxicity, but development of agents that can affect a target through the skin and clothing, rendering protective [[WWI gas mask|gas mask]]s useless. In July 1917, the Germans employed [[sulfur mustard]]. Mustard agents easily penetrates leather and fabric to inflict painful burns on the skin.

Chemical warfare agents are divided into ''lethal'' and ''incapacitating'' categories. A substance is classified as incapacitating if less than 1/100 of the [[lethal dose]] causes incapacitation, e.g., through nausea or visual problems. The distinction between lethal and incapacitating substances is not fixed, but relies on a statistical average called the {{LD50}}.

====Persistency====
Chemical warfare agents can be classified according to their ''persistency'', a measure of the length of time that a chemical agent remains effective after dissemination. Chemical agents are classified as ''persistent'' or ''nonpersistent''.

Agents classified as ''nonpersistent'' lose effectiveness after only a few minutes or hours or even only a few seconds. Purely gaseous agents such as chlorine are nonpersistent, as are highly volatile agents such as [[sarin]]. Tactically, nonpersistent agents are very useful against targets that are to be taken over and controlled very quickly.

Apart from the agent used, the delivery mode is very important. To achieve a nonpersistent deployment, the agent is dispersed into very small droplets comparable with the mist produced by an aerosol can. In this form not only the gaseous part of the agent (around 50%) but also the fine aerosol can be inhaled or absorbed through pores in the skin.

Modern doctrine requires very high concentrations almost instantly in order to be effective (one breath should contain a lethal dose of the agent). To achieve this, the primary weapons used would be rocket artillery or bombs and large ballistic missiles with cluster warheads. The contamination in the target area is only low or not existent and after four hours sarin or similar agents are not detectable anymore.

By contrast, ''persistent'' agents tend to remain in the environment for as long as several weeks, complicating decontamination. Defense against persistent agents requires shielding for extended periods of time. Non-volatile liquid agents, such as blister agents and the oily [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve agent, do not easily evaporate into a gas, and therefore present primarily a contact hazard.

The droplet size used for persistent delivery goes up to 1&amp;nbsp;mm increasing the falling speed and therefore about 80% of the deployed agent reaches the ground, resulting in heavy contamination. Deployment of persistent agents is intended to constrain enemy operations by denying access to contaminated areas.

Possible targets include enemy flank positions (averting possible counterattacks), artillery regiments, commando posts or supply lines. Because it is not necessary to deliver large quantities of the agent in a short period of time, a wide variety of weapons systems can be used.

A special form of persistent agents are thickened agents. These comprise a common agent mixed with thickeners to provide gelatinous, sticky agents. Primary targets for this kind of use include airfields, due to the increased persistency and difficulty of decontaminating affected areas.

====Classes====
Chemical weapons are agents that come in four categories: [[Pulmonary agent|choking]], [[Vesicant|blister]], [[Blood agent|blood]] and [[Nerve agent|nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Colin. (2007). ''Another Bloody Century: Future Warfare''. p. 269. Phoenix. {{ISBN|0-304-36734-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The agents are organized into several categories according to the manner in which they affect the human body. The names and number of categories varies slightly from source to source, but in general, types of chemical warfare agents are as follows:

{{Chemical warfare/CW table}}
There are other chemicals used militarily that are not scheduled by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], and thus are not controlled under the CWC treaties. These include:
* [[Defoliant]]s and [[herbicide]]s that destroy vegetation, but are not immediately toxic or poisonous to human beings. Their use is classified as [[herbicidal warfare]]. Some batches of [[Agent Orange]], for instance, used by the British during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the United States during the [[Vietnam War]], contained [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] as manufacturing impurities. Dioxins, rather than Agent Orange itself, have long-term cancer effects and for causing genetic damage leading to serious birth defects.
* [[Incendiary device|Incendiary]] or [[Explosive material|explosive]] chemicals (such as [[napalm]], extensively used by the United States during the [[Korean War]] and the Vietnam War, or [[dynamite]]) because their destructive effects are primarily due to fire or explosive force, and not direct chemical action. Their use is classified as [[conventional warfare]].
* [[Virus]]es, [[bacteria]], or other organisms. Their use is classified as [[biological warfare]]. [[Toxin]]s produced by living organisms are considered chemical weapons, although the boundary is blurry. Toxins are covered by the [[Biological Weapons Convention]].

====Designations====
{{details |chemical weapon designation}}

Most chemical weapons are assigned a one- to three-letter &quot;[[NATO]] weapon designation&quot; in addition to, or in place of, a common name. [[Binary chemical weapon|Binary munitions]], in which precursors for chemical warfare agents are automatically mixed in shell to produce the agent just prior to its use, are indicated by a &quot;-2&quot; following the agent's designation (for example, GB-2 and VX-2).

Some examples are given below:

===Delivery===
The most important factor in the effectiveness of chemical weapons is the efficiency of its delivery, or dissemination, to a target. The most common techniques include munitions (such as bombs, projectiles, warheads) that allow dissemination at a distance and spray tanks which disseminate from low-flying aircraft. Developments in the techniques of filling and storage of munitions have also been important.

The higher amount of African-Americans voting in elections was taken into account by the Ravenel campaign, which sought to gain this group of voters by reviving interest in older statements by Thurmond. Thurmond was noted, in his courting of black voters, to have not undergone &quot;any ideological transformation&quot; but instead devote himself to making personal contact with members of the minority group. Thurmond's influence in national politics allowed him to have correspondence with staffers from the Nixon administration which gave him &quot;a unique advantage in announcing federal grants and bird-dogging federal projects of particular interest to black voters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/03/17/thurmonds-black-hope/49fe22d8-a223-4e9a-aa07-7d8b452fe395/|title=Thurmond's Black Hope|date=March 17, 1978|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 1978, Thurmond held a 30-point lead over Ravenel among double digits of undecided voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polls Shows Thurmond Is Landsliding Ravenel|date=May 23, 1978|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond won a fifth term with 351,733 votes to Ravenel's 281,119. The race would later be assessed as the last serious challenge to Thurmond during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-14/news/mn-35881_1_strom-thurmond|title=Campaign '96 / THE SENATE : Thurmond Thinking of an Eighth Term; Voters Aren't So Sure : Though popular, the 93-year-old Republican risks handing his seat to a Democrat if he runs again, observers say.|date=February 14, 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Billy Carter controversy also was favored by Democrats wishing to replace Carter as the party's nominee in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/08/05/no-impropriety-in-billy-affair-carter-says-no-impropriety-committed-in-billy-affair-president-says/364efcf7-1271-4f8f-bea7-68fb7a2fe549/|title=No 'Impropriety' in Billy Affair, Carter Says, No 'Impropriety' Committed In Billy Affair, President Says|date=August 5, 1980|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond questioned Carter over his prior refusal to disclose the amount of funds he had received from public appearances following the 1976 election of his brother as president,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billy Claims $20,000 Not Gift From Libyans|date=August 22, 1980|publisher=Altoona Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated his skepticism with some of the points made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Billy: $20,000 was not Libyan gift|date=August 22, 1980|publisher=Ukiah Daily Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I had to sentence four people to the electric chair. I did not make the decision; the jury made it. It was my duty to pass sentence, because the jury had found them guilty and did not recommend mercy.

U.S. Bureau of the Census&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Population Division.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of black people left the state during the first half of the 20th century in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to escape the Jim Crow laws and seek opportunities in the industrial cities of the North and Midwest. After the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] was implemented, African Americans were legally protected in exercising their constitutional rights as United States citizens to register to vote in South Carolina without harassment or discrimination. State politicians could no longer ignore this voting bloc, who were allied with increasing numbers of white residents who supported civil rights.

Thurmond appointed Thomas Moss, an African American, to his Senate staff in 1971. It has been described as the first such appointment by a member of the South Carolinian congressional delegation (it was incorrectly reported by many sources as the first senatorial appointment of an African American, but Mississippi Senator [[Pat Harrison]] had hired clerk-librarian Jesse Nichols in 1937). In 1983, he supported legislation to make the birthday of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|federal holiday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Noah&quot;/&gt; In South Carolina, the honor was diluted; until 2000 the state offered employees the option to celebrate this holiday or substitute one of three Confederate holidays instead.  Despite this, Thurmond never explicitly renounced his earlier views on racial segregation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO_071298&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Margaret Thatcher Strom Thurmond 1981.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Thatcher]] and Thurmond at a state dinner in 1981]]
Thurmond became [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate]] in 1981, and was part of the U.S. delegation to the funeral of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]], Thurmond being accompanied by Sadat's pen pal Sam Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/10/08/President-Reagan-invited-three-former-presidents-to-the-White/1243371361600/|title=President Reagan invited three former presidents to the White...|date=October 8, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1982, Thurmond and Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] were met with protestors while Thurmond was being inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame, the protestors holding signs charging Thurmond with racism and attacking the Voting Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/01/07/Vice-President-George-Bush-and-Sen-Strom-Thurmond-were/8978379227600/|title=Vice President George Bush and Sen.

In the 1984 presidential election, Thurmond was cited along with [[Carroll Campbell]] and South Carolina Republican Party Director [[Warren Tompkins]] by Republicans as the forces binding the Reagan-Bush ticket to South Carolina's electoral votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Both sides in presidential battle agree turnout is key|date=October 28, 1984|publisher=The Index-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond attended President Reagan's October 15 re-election campaign speech in the Allied Health Building on the Greenville Technical College campus in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39247|title=Remarks at a Reagan-Bush Rally in Greenville, South Carolina|date=October 15, 1984|first=Ronald|last=Reagan|authorlink=Ronald Reagan|quote=And Dr. Thomas Barton, a Clemson Tiger; Mayor Bill Workman, and Senator Strom Thurmond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond attended the September 7, 1985 dedication of the Richard B. Russell Dam, praising the dam with having met &quot;the ever increasing needs of the Southeast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/09/07/Former-President-Jimmy-Carter-snubbed-dedication-ceremonies-Saturday-for/6739494913600/|title=Former President Jimmy Carter snubbed dedication ceremonies Saturday for...|date=September 7, 1985|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1986, Thurmond sent a letter to Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] requesting &quot;an inquiry into the activities of former Commerce Department official Walter Lenahan, and expressed concern about an alleged leak of U.S. trade information to textile-exporting nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/06/04/Thurmond-requests-probe-of-former-trade-official/6775518241600/|title=Thurmond requests probe of former trade official|first=Timothy|last=Bannon|date=June 4, 1986|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1987, Thurmond swore in [[Carroll A. Campbell Jr.]] as the 112th Governor of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/us/south-carolina-inducts-republican-governor.html|title=South Carolina Inducts Republican Governor|date=January 15, 1987|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 1988, Thurmond endorsed fellow senator [[Bob Dole]] in the Republican presidential primary, acknowledging his previous intent to remain neutral during the nominating process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/us/dole-endorsed-by-thurmond.html|title=Dole Endorsed by Thurmond|date=February 23, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thurmond endorsement served to change the Dole campaign's initial plans of skipping the South Carolina primary, where Vice President Bush defeated Dole. The Bush campaign subsequently won other Southern states and the nomination, leading Michael Oreskes to reflect that Dole &quot;was hurt by an endorsement that led him astray.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/weekinreview/the-nation-dukakis-and-bush-why-the-candidates-love-to-be-endorsed.html|title=THE NATION; Dukakis and Bush; WHY THE CANDIDATES LOVE TO BE ENDORSED|date=March 27, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988, as the Senate voted on the nomination of [[Dick Thornburgh]] as U.S. Attorney General, Thurmond stated that Thornburgh had the qualities necessary for an Attorney General to possess, citing his &quot;integrity, honesty, professionalism and independence.&quot; Thornburgh was confirmed, and served for the remainder of the Reagan administration as well as the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/12/us/thornburgh-confirmed-as-attorney-general.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=96E424C69E43A5D1EFC26E9F5EBCC97E&amp;gwt=pay|title=Thornburgh Confirmed as Attorney General|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1988 Presidential election, George H. W. Bush nominated [[John Tower]] for [[United States Secretary of Defense]]. After Tower's nomination was rejected by the Senate, Thurmond asked, &quot;What does it say when the leader of the free world can't get a Cabinet member confirmed?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/11/us/an-attempt-to-recover-bush-seeks-to-end-rancor-over-tower.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=21EA011AD667CC8A812319CE918CE471&amp;gwt=pay|title=An Attempt To Recover; Bush Seeks to End Rancor Over Tower|date=March 11, 1989|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1989, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted evenly on the nomination of William C. Lucas for Assist Attorney General for Civil Rights, terminating the nomination that required a majority to proceed to the entirety of the chamber. Among his support, Thurmond noted that Lucas was a minority, and reflected on their lack of opportunities in years prior, adding, &quot;I know down South they didn't and up North either. We had de jure segregation and up North you had de facto segregation. There was segregation in both places, and black people didn't have the chance in either place that they should have had. Now's the chance to give them a chance.&quot; Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee [[Joe Biden]] refuted Thurmond's argument by mentioning that Senate critics of Lucas were civil rights supporters who had a problem with his lack of qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/us/senate-committee-bars-bush-s-choice-from-rights-post.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=3E2FFC8773271D31D56BBF1178BAE3CB&amp;gwt=pay|title=Senate Committee Bars Bush's Choice From Rights Post|date=August 2, 1989|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1989, [[Hurricane Hugo]] hit the Southeast United States, causing twenty-seven deaths in South Carolina. In response, Congress approved a $1.1 billion emergency aid package for victims of the hurricane in what was the largest disaster relief package in American history. Before the vote, Thurmond said of the hurricane, &quot;I have never seen so much damage in my life. It looked like there had been a war there. We need all the help we can get.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-29/news/mn-279_1_hurricane-hugo|title=$1 Billion in Hurricane Aid OKd; Bush to Sign It|date=September 29, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond accompanied President Bush aboard Air Force One when he visited the state at the end of the month, and revealed that Bush had written a check of $1,000 to South Carolina Red Cross as a showing of personal support for those effected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-30/news/mn-190_1_south-carolina|title=Bush Tours S.

===Domestic policy===
In 1980, Thurmond and Democratic Representative [[John Conyers]] jointly sponsored a constitutional amendment to change the tenure of the President to a single six-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Sense Changing Something That Works|newspaper=The Burlington Free Press|date=December 16, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19801204&amp;id=fC8dAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2350,999571|title=Thurmond, Conyers Unite|date=December 4, 1980|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1981, Thurmond as the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and President Reagan were seen as obstacles to any gun laws passing in the Senate. Thurmond publicly stated his belief that any measures introduced would be defeated in his committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sen.

But if you take guns away from people who need them to protect their homes, that is unreasonable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Administration unlikely to drop opposition to handgun|journal=Stevens Point Journal|date=April 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond's announcement indicating his support for gun control legislation in the wake of the assassination attempt was seen as possibly indicating a change in the debate of regulations relating to firearms in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/02/us/kennedy-set-to-compromise-to-obtain-gun-control-bill.html|title=KENNEDY SET TO COMPROMISE TO OBTAIN GUN CONTROL BILL|date=April 2, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced plans to hold hearings on the seven-point proposal intended to address the questions surrounding the Reagan assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/04/01/Senate-Judiciary-Committee-chairman-Strom-Thurmond-R-SC-said-Tuesday/4627354949200/|title=Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said Tuesday...|date=April 1, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1989, when the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill by Democrat [[Dennis DeConcini]] that imposed a ban of three years on sales of several domestic assault rifles, it rejected an amendment by Thurmond that would have substituted the DeConcini bill with the Bush administration's anti-crime package, which did not include a ban on rifles produced in the United States. Failure to implement the Thurmond amendment was seen as &quot;a preliminary test of Senate support for extending President Bush's ban on foreign-made assault weapons to domestic makes&quot; and a loss for the [[National Rifle Association]] which had previously protested banning domestic assault rifles. Following the vote, Thurmond and NRA officials pledged to bring the same issue up before the full chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-21/news/mn-4248_1_assault-weapon|title=Senate Panel OKs U.S.-Made Assault Rifle Ban|date=July 21, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1981, Thurmond stated his support for a balanced budget amendment as he believed Reagan's successor would unbalance the budget in spite of what Reagan did while in office. He added that there was not a timetable for getting it passed and that Congress was ahead of the newly formed Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/15/Thurmond-presses-for-balanced-budget-amendment/5043351061200/|title=Thurmond presses for balanced-budget amendment|first=Ed|last=Rogers|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond attended the July 12, 1982 Rose Garden speech by President Reagan on the balanced budget amendment. President Reagan stated the administration was &quot;asking Majority Leader Baker, Senators Thurmond, Hatch, DeConcini, and Helms, as leaders of the 61 cosponsors, to help us secure its passage as rapidly as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=42725|title=Remarks to Reporters on the Proposed Constitutional Amendment for a Balanced Federal Budget|date=July 12, 1982|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 1982, the Senate approved adopting a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/04/nyregion/news-summary-wednesday-august-4-1982.html|title=News Summary; WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the vote, Thurmond said, &quot;This is a great day for America.

Thurmond's remarks included calling for a haste to its enactment: &quot;Congress has shown it is unable to control federal spending and, in doing so, has conceded it must be forced to do so. That is why this amendment is so urgently needed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/26/A-constitutional-amendment-to-require-a-balanced-budget-was/1743412405200/|title=A constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget was...|date=January 26, 1983|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1985, Thurmond supported a plan to require a balanced budget by 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/10/us/how-senate-voted-on-budget-plan.html|title=HOW SENATE VOTED ON BUDGET PLAN|date=October 10, 1985|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout early 1981, Thurmond and Helms urged President Reagan to curb textile imports, with Thurmond saying later that year that the first four months of 1981 had seen a 16 percent increase in textile imports &quot;over a similar period in 1980.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/06/04/Republican-Sens-Jesse-Helms-of-North-Carolina-and-Strom/7618360475200/ph|title=Republican Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom...|date=June 4, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, President Reagan pledged in a letter to Thurmond to help South Carolina textile mills against their foreign competitors. The letter was pulled out by Chief of Staff [[James Baker]] during a December 1983 White House Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade meeting, and was credited by two White House aides with ending &quot;the council debate cold.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1984/04/01/reagan-is-the-real-king-of-special-interest-groups/5d0958ba-3df6-49a7-8988-3b7b0861f91d/|title=Reagan is the Real King Of Special Interest Groups|date=April 1, 1984|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan stated his support for tightening control of textile imports in December 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/business/reagan-decides-to-tighten-controls-on-textile-imports.html|title=REAGAN DECIDES TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON TEXTILE IMPORTS|date=December 17, 1983|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1984, President Reagan vetoed H.R. 1562,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1985/121785d.htm|title=Message to the House of Representatives Returning Without Approval the Textile and Apparel Industries Bill|date=December 17, 1985|first=Ronald|last=Reagan|authorlink=Ronald Reagan|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum|access-date=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072456/https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1985/121785d.htm|archive-date=April 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond responded to the decision by stating that Reagan had heeded bad advice and predicted the veto would produce &quot;more layoffs, more plant shutdowns and more long-term economic damage to an industry that is crucial to this nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/12/18/President-Reagan-in-a-blow-to-the-import-battered-textile/6904503730000/|title=President Reagan, in a blow to the import-battered textile,...|date=December 18, 1985|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1981, Thurmond stated that MX missiles could potentially disrupt southwest lifestyles and called for a &quot;reassessment of the country's commitment to a joint land, sea and air-based ballistic missile deterrent.&quot; Thurmond believed billions of dollars could potentially be saved in the event that military experts look into the sea-based missiles and the missiles would be less likely to attack if not based on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/06/27/Sen-Strom-Thurmond-R-SC-said-Saturday-that-the-MX/6390362462400/|title=Sen.

In 1983, Thurmond supported legislation for the MX missile, voting for its development being funded by $625 million in May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/26/us/roll-call-in-senate-on-money-for-mx.html|title=ROLL CALL IN SENATE ON MONEY FOR M|date=May 26, 1983|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Gary Hart]] amendment that if enacted would have removed production for the missile from the military authorization bill of 1984 two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/27/us/roll-call-in-senate-on-producing-mx.html|title=ROLL-CALL IN SENATE ON PRODUCING MX|date=July 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1981, Thurmond sent Attorney General [[William French Smith]] a twelve-person list of candidates to be considered for federal district judgeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19810728&amp;id=VRwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1302,3541269|title=2 From Area On Judgeship List|publisher=The Sumter Daily Item|date=July 28, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of 1981 also saw the Voting Rights Act come up for another extension. Thurmond was one of the leaders in opposition to portions of the act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/08/us/congress-begins-fight-over-extension-of-voting-rights-act.html|title=CONGRESS BEGINS FIGHT OVER EXTENSION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT|date=April 8, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said parts of the law were discriminatory toward states' rights as well as too strict toward communities that had adhered to it in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/magazine/once-again-a-clash-over-voting-rights.html|title=ONCE AGAIN, A CLASH OVER VOTING RIGHTS|date=September 27, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1982, Thurmond voted in favor of a measure sponsored by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] that sought to reverse ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and allow Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortions. Its passage was the first time a congressional committee supported an anti-abortion amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/us/abortion-curbs-endorsed-10-7-by-senate-panel.html|title=ABORTION CURBS ENDORSED, 10-7, BY SENATE PANEL|date=March 11, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/howard-baker-trying-to-tame-an-unruly-senate.html|title=HOWARD BAKER TRYING TO TAME AN UNRULY SENATE|date=March 28, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1982, the House and Senate overrode President Reagan's veto of copyright legislation intended to retain employment in the American printing and publishing industries. Thurmond stated he could not understand President Reagan's authorization of recommendation on the part of what he called &quot;middle-level bureaucrats&quot; and how he could take advice from members of the aforementioned group amid a Labor Department report on the thousands of jobs that would be lost without the bill. Thurmond added that the legislation would retain &quot;jobs for Americans&quot;, a rebuff of claims to the contrary on the part of Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/14/arts/first-override-of-reagan-veto-comes-on-extension-of-printing-copyrights.html|title=FIRST OVERRIDE OF REAGAN VETO COMES ON EXTENSION OF PRINTING COPYRIGHTS|date=July 14, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the [[National Taxpayers Union]], a conservative group that bestowed points to politicians who voted for measures to reduce federal spending, gave Thurmond a 58 percent spending score, three points down from his rating two years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RqEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1440,5751513 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[The Item|The Sumter Daily Item]] |title=Group Says Hollings Best of Big Spenders |date=April 2, 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Senate voted on a bill granting federal prosecution to weapon-carrying career robbers and giving 15 years of incarceration to those convicted. Along with Senator Ted Kennedy, Thurmond sponsored an amendment limiting the bill to third-time federal offenders. The amendment passed 77 to 12, and was sent to the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/us/bill-to-permit-federal-prosecution-of-career-criminals-passes-senate.html|title=BILL TO PERMIT FEDERAL PROSECUTION OF CAREER CRIMINALS PASSES SENATE|date=February 24, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1985, Thurmond introduced legislation providing stiffer federal penalties for individuals and financial institutions engaged in laundering money earned from activities of illegality. The bill, supported by the Reagan administration as it sought to expose the financial activities of criminals, was hailed by Thurmond as &quot;an important step in our continuing war on organized crime and those financial institutions and individuals which hide the ill-gotten assets of law-breakers, especially drug traffickers.&quot; American Bar Association, American Bankers Association and American Civil Liberties Union officials charged the proposal with largely removing privacy laws imposed by the federal government and state governments that were established to prevent unchecked examinations of the bank records of individuals from authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/us/money-laundering-bill-seen-as-privacy-threat.html|title=MONEY-LAUNDERING BILL SEEN AS PRIVACY THREAT|date=June 23, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Thurmond introduced an amendment to a bill by [[Chris Dodd]] calling for granting unpaid leaves for workers with either a newborn, newly adopted, or seriously ill child. The amendment called for severe penalties to individuals involved in the selling, transferring of control or buying of a child so he or she can be used in pornography. Thurmond forced a vote and the amendment passed 97 to 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/us/pornography-measure-passes.html|title=Pornography Measure Passes|date=September 29, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989, as the Senate approved a bill that made burning of the American flag a federal crime in an attempt to counter a Supreme Court ruling asserting that flag-burning was protected by the First Amendment, Thurmond opined that securing flag burning as a federal crime through a constitutional amendment was &quot;the only sure and foolproof way to protect the integrity of the American flag&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-06/news/mn-679_1_constitutional-amendment|title=Senate Passes Ban on Burning U.S. Flag, 91 to 9 : Measure Provides for Up to a Year in Jail; Some Still Pressing for Amendment|date=October 10, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-crime and drug policies ===
In May 1982, Thurmond introduced anti-crime legislation that included provisions altering the bail system to allow a judge to deny bond to defendants the judge considered a danger to society along a &quot;presumption&quot; that defendants charged with drug trafficking or the use of a weapon in a violent crime are a danger to the community in addition to imposing fines and penalties for individuals convicted of dealing &quot;large amounts of the most dangerous drugs.&quot; Under the legislation, the acts of killing, kidnapping or assaulting certain White House officials, Cabinet members of Supreme Court justices would be made federal crimes and witnesses and victims would be granted protection during and following a federal trial. The measure was considered a last-ditch effort to push a crime bill through Congress by the end of the year and the White House responded with praise of the legislation as containing &quot;several statutory reforms that are long overdue&quot; within hours of Thurmond unveiling it. Thurmond referred to the measure as a &quot;big step toward controlling the number one threat to organized society ‚Äì crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/05/26/Chairman-Strom-Thurmond-of-the-Senate-Judiciary-Committee-introduced/7520391233600/|title=Chairman Strom Thurmond of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced...|date=May 26, 1982|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Thurmond served as a sponsor of an anti-crime bill that included a measure that would form a Cabinet-level post to oversee drug investigations. President Reagan pocket vetoed the bill on the grounds that it would have created &quot;another layer of bureaucracy&quot; in attempts to combat narcotics. Though saying he was not angered by the president's opposition, Thurmond admitted Reagan's approval would have been a better alternative and called on the newly commenced [[98th United States Congress]] to compose anti-crime legislation that the administration would support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/15/Congress-to-press-anti-crime-bill/6168411454800/|title=Congress to press anti-crime bill|date=January 15, 1983|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1986, Thurmond sponsored a drug law package that included a provision imposing the death penalty for some drug offenses and federal crimes of &quot;treason, espionage and killing American hostages in a terrorist attack&quot;; it followed another measure passed in the House authorizing introduction of certain evidence in drug-related cases that was seized illegally, and increased the difficulty for criminal defendants to use writs of habeas corpus. The legislation omitted a provision of the House bill that granted American military personnel the authority to arrest individuals in drug-trafficking cases, and the legislation's other sponsors conceded that it would provoke a filibuster and possibly need revising in light of opposition to its more controversial proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/20/us/senate-gop-adds-its-own-drug-bill.html|title=SENATE G.O.P. ADDS ITS OWN DRUG BILL|date=September 20, 1986|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the Senate opened debate on proposals aimed at ending both the supply of dangerous drugs as well as their demand. Thurmond offered changes to criminal law in the form of amendments that would include imposing the death penalty for drug traffickers guilty of murder and an expansion of the proposal that would add the death penalty for other federal crimes, such as espionage and hostage taking. Thurmond additionally favored altering rules of evidence so that evidence gathered illegally would not be removed from criminal proceedings if it was obtained in &quot;good faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/us/senate-takes-up-drug-bill-with-session-waning.html|title=SENATE TAKES UP DRUG BILL WITH SESSION WANING|date=September 27, 1986|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan signed the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]] on October 27, 1986, noting Thurmond as one of the &quot;real champions in the battle to get this legislation through Congress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=36654|title=Remarks on Signing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|date=October 27, 1986|publisher=American Presidency Project|first=Ronald|last=Reagan|authorlink=Ronald Reagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1987, Thurmond introduced legislation that if enacted would require &quot;alcoholic beverages to carry health warning labels similar to those on cigarettes&quot;, saying the legislation would be effective if it prevented anyone from drinking while being in a compromising position of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/11/18/Sen-Strom-Thurmond-R-SC-continued-his-attack-on-alcohol/7822564210000/|title=Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., continued his attack on alcohol...|first=Karen Lee|last=Scrivo|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Thurmond sponsored legislation designed to impose &quot;five rotating warning labels on alcoholic beverages cautioning pregnant women not to drink, warning that alcohol is addictive and can increase the risks of hypertension, liver disease and cancer, that it impairs a person's ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and that alcohol consumption can be hazardous in combination with some drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/08/10/Health-warning-on-liquor-bottles-urged/1575587188800/ph|title=Health warning on liquor bottles urged|first=Mary Beth|last=Franklin|date=August 10, 1988|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1989, Thurmond was one of nine Republican senators appointed by Senate Republican leader [[Robert Dole]] to negotiate a dispute with Democrats over financing of President Bush's anti-drug plan that called for spending $7.8 billion by the following year as part of the president's efforts to address narcotics nationwide and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/09/14/Senate-drug-funding-dispute-threatens-money-bills/3024621748800/|title=Senate drug funding dispute threatens money bills|first=Steve|last=Gerstel|date=September 14, 1989|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagan nominees===
In late 1981, Thurmond presided over the hearings of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who President Reagan had nominated for Associate Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. National Archives|title=Reagan's Nomination of O'Connor|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oconnor.html|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1981 Year in Review: Reagan Foreign Policy Speech/O'Connor Appointed to Supreme Court |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1981/Reagan-Foreign-Policy-Speach/O%27Connor-Appointed-to-Supreme-Court/12311754163167-10/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond granted Alabama Senator [[Jeremiah Denton]] an hour of questioning of O'Connor, twice the time allotted for other members of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/12/us/abortion-foes-assail-judge-o-connor.html|title=ABORTION FOES ASSAIL JUDGE O'CONNOR|date=September 12, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thurmond stated that O'Connor was &quot;one of the choice nominees&quot; for the Supreme Court that he had seen in all of his Senate career, furthering that she had all the qualities he believed &quot;a judge needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/panel-approves-judge-o-connor.html|title=PANEL APPROVES JUDGE O'CONNOR|date=September 16, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor was confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reagan's Nomination of O'Connor|url = https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oconnor.html|publisher = archives.gov|accessdate = November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982, President Reagan selected [[Harry N. Walters]] as his choice for [[Administrator of Veterans Affairs]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/23/us/reagan-picks-pentagon-aide-as-head-of-veterans-agency.html|title=REAGAN PICKS PENTAGON AIDE AS HEAD OF VETERANS AGENCY|date=November 23, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/22/President-Reagan-Monday-tapped-Assistant-Army-Secretary-Harry-Walters/1012406789200/|title=President Reagan Monday tapped Assistant Army Secretary Harry Walters...|date=November 22, 1982|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond and [[Wyoming]] senator [[Alan Simpson (U.S. politician)|Alan Simpson]] were both critical of the president's lack of consultation with them prior to the announcement. Thurmond shortly afterward stated publicly his support for Walters, citing him as having &quot;the education and experience to fill the position&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/22/President-Reagan-announced-Monday-he-has-nominated-Harry-Walters/8643406789200/|title=President Reagan announced Monday he has nominated Harry Walters,...|date=November 22, 1982|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters was confirmed for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/us/director-of-veterans-administration-steps-down.html|title=DIRECTOR OF VETERANS ADMINISTRATION STEPS DOWN|date=January 24, 1986|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1984, President Reagan nominated of [[Edwin Meese]] for U.S. Attorney General to replace the resigning [[William French Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/research/speeches/12384b|title=Nomination of Edwin Meese III To Be Attorney General of the United States|date=January 23, 1984|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meese agreed for a second round of questioning from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Thurmond felt &quot;would be productive all the way around&quot; to have another appearance by the nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/03/13/White-House-counselor-Edwin-Meese-under-pressure-from-Democrats/8523448002000/|title=White House counselor Edwin Meese, under pressure from Democrats,...|first=Barbara|last=Rosewicz|date=March 13, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference that month, Thurmond stated a lack of evident wrongdoing and his confidence in Meese stemming from Reagan having selected him: &quot;Up to now, there's been nothing I've come across that would damage Mr. Meese.

In November 1985, after President Reagan nominated [[Alex Kozinski]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jackson, Robert L.|author2=Hager, Philip|title=Senate Narrowly Confirms Kozinski as Appeals Judge|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-08/news/mn-2758_1_alex-kozinski|accessdate=August 11, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 8, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond assailed a day-long questioning of Kozinski by Democratic members of the Senate as &quot;the puniest, most nit-picking charges&quot; he had heard from members of that ideology in all of his time in Congress and called Kozinski &quot;a man of integrity and dedication, with a magnificent record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/us/angry-democrats-examine-nominee-6-hours.html|title=ANGRY DEMOCRATS EXAMINE NOMINEE 6 HOURS|date=November 3, 1985|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, [[Daniel Anthony Manion]], President Reagan's choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, answered a question by Thurmond at the beginning of a session before a Senate panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-13/news/8601190000_1_aba-discrimination-case-daniel-manion|title=Nominee Questioned On Creationist Bill|date=March 13, 1986|first=Glen|last=Elsasser|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Thurmond called for a bipartisan vote for cloture, citing Manion as &quot;entitled to have a vote by the Senate&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/06/25/senate-gop-leaders-attempting-to-limit-debate-on-manion/4e6c58d9-f08e-4aed-82e1-fb7358ac213d/|title=Senate GOP Leaders Attempting to Limit Debate on Manion|date=June 25, 1986|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and predicted there were enough votes to confirm him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-24/news/8602140935_1_mr-manion-senate-floor-debate-nomination-of-daniel-manion|title=Judge Nominee's Verdict Near|date=June 24, 1986|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1986, after President Reagan nominated Associate Justice [[William Rehnquist]] for [[Chief Justice of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/burger-retiring-rehnquist-named-chief-scalia-appeals-judge-chosen-for-court.html|title=BURGER RETIRING, REHNQUIST NAMED CHIEF; SCALIA, APPEALS JUDGE, CHOSEN FOR COURT|date=June 18, 1986|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/01/us/president-asserts-he-will-withhold-rehnquist-memos.html|title=PRESIDENT ASSERTS HE WILL WITHHOLD REHNQUIST MEMOS|date=August 1, 1986|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond said the questions poised toward Rehnquist during his confirmation hearings were disgraceful as well as part of an attempt to smear him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/05/Sen-Strom-Thurmond-R-SC-said-Tuesday-the-questioning-of/9953523598400/|title=Sen.

In July 1987, President Reagan nominated [[Robert Bork]] as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1987/070187d.htm|title=Nomination of Robert H.

===Foreign policy===
In April 1981, Thurmond stated that the U.S. could move some of its West Germany soldiers to the East German and Czechoslovak borders in an attempt to improve both morale and combat readiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/19/world/us-may-shift-gi-s-in-germany.html|title=U.S. May Shift G.I.'s in Germany|date=April 19, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1983, Thurmond stated his support for the [[United States invasion of Grenada]], saying American efforts with other countries were &quot;providing an opportunity for Grenadan citizens to regain control over their lives&quot; and the U.S. would be forced to watch centuries of progress crumble if the country was unwilling to make sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/us/required-reading-sampling-of-opinions-on-invasion-of-grenada.html|title=REQUIRED READING; SAMPLING OF OPINIONS ON INVASION OF GRENADA|date=October 29, 1983|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond voted against the Senate resolution declaring that American troops in Grenada would be &quot;withdrawn no more than 60 days later unless Congress authorized their continued presence there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/world/o-neill-criticizes-president-war-powers-act-is-invoked.html|title=O'NEILL CRITICIZES PRESIDENT; WAR POWERS ACT IS INVOKED|date=October 29, 1983|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan sent Thurmond a letter containing a report in line with the War Powers Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/10/25/Reagan-gives-Congress-war-powers-notice/4017435902400/|title=Reagan gives Congress war powers notice|first=Ira A.|last=Allen|publisher=UPI|date=October 25, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond said the &quot;ruling junta in Grenada&quot; was directly threatening American lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/10/25/Congress-gave-cautious-support-to-the-invasion-of-Grenada/4533435902400/|title=Congress gave cautious support to the invasion of Grenada...|first=John F.|last=Barton|publisher=UPI|date=October 25, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1984, as the United States and [[Israel]] moved to negotiate a free-trade pact where tariffs between the two countries would eventually be wiped out following the Reagan administration receiving congressional approval to negotiate such an agreement, Thurmond wrote a letter to United States trade representative Bill Brock calling on Brock to &quot;reformulate&quot; the negotiating position of the US as the senator had been informed by his aides that the American position in the negotiation was &quot;more generous&quot; than the one specified to Congress. Brock replied to Thurmond weeks later, asserting that he had &quot;every intention&quot; of fulfilling his commitment to Congress &quot;to take account of the import sensitivity of specific products&quot; in the agreement and that Israel had acknowledged the irregularity of export subsidy programs &quot;with the concept of a free-trade area.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/business/israel-and-us-facing-hurdles-on-trade-pact.html|title=ISRAEL AND U.S. FACING HURDLES ON TRADE PACT|date=January 10, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1985, Thurmond was one of eight members of a delegation that met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The delegation agreed on viewing Gorbachev as an impressive leader and that he had refused any discussion of human rights issues and repeated Soviet formulas in a response to Afghanistan questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/04/world/gorbachev-hints-he-ll-be-flexible.html|title=GORBACHEV HINTS HE'LL BE FLEXIBLE|date=September 4, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, after American warplanes took action against Libyan land, Thurmond stated the U.S. &quot;has the right and the duty to protect and defend itself when attacked, as it was today, without provocation.&quot; He opposed statements by the Libyan government that the attacks on U.S. ships occurred in international waters and named [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as the individual who had orchestrated the acts of aggression toward the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/world/lawmakers-back-actions-on-libya.html|title=LAWMAKERS BACK ACTIONS ON LIBYA|date=March 25, 1986|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond was a supporter of the Nicaragua rebels, saying that support for the group on the part of the United States was central to furthering America's view &quot;in freedom and in protecting ourselves against Soviet totalitarianism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/19/world/senate-votes-52-48-not-to-block-aid-to-contras.html|title=Senate Votes, 52-48 Not to Block Aid to Contras|date=March 19, 1987|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1988, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] presented the White House with a modified version of the Democratic proposal on Contra aid. Thurmond responded to the plan by calling it unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/09/world/republicans-object-to-new-contra-deal.html|title=Republicans Object to New Contra Deal|date=August 9, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, some members of the Senate gave support to a law that would impose American participation in an international treaty outlawing genocide. Thurmond stated his intent to add a death penalty amendment in the event the bill reached the Senate floor, the maximum punishment of the bill in the United States being incarceration and Thurmond's measure conflicting with the anti-death penalty views of the bill's leading advocates. Democrats charged Thurmond with using parliamentary devices and Senate traditions to prevent a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1988/09/27/world/bill-banning-genocide-still-snagged-in-senate.html|title=Bill Banning Genocide Still Snagged in Senate|date=September 27, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond dropped the death penalty amendment when Democrats agreed to proceed with the confirmation of Republican judges. Several Democrats espoused the view that Thurmond had only been adamant in including the death penalty amendment to get something out of the Senate Democrats during the debate over the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/world/senate-votes-to-carry-out-treaty-banning-genocide.html|title=Senate Votes to Carry Out Treaty Banning Genocide|date=October 15, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as [[sexual jealousy in humans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo | year = 1982 | title = Male Sexual Jealousy | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(82)90027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo I | year = 1981 | title = Child Maltreatment from a Sociobiological Perspective | journal = New Directions for Child Development | volume = 1981 | issue = 11| pages = 93–112 |doi=10.1002/cd.23219811107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Margo, and Martin Daly. Homicide. Hawthorne: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most [[mammal]] species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that &quot;Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children.&quot;&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goetz | first1 = A. T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20100422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz writes that most [[homicide]]s seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;

=== Media ===
{{further|Media violence research}}
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson Craig A. |author2=Berkowitz Leonard |author3=Donnerstein Edward |author4=Huesmann L. Rowell |author5=Johnson James D. |author6=Linz Daniel |author7=Malamuth Neil M. |author8=Wartella Ellen | year = 2003 | title = The Influence of Media Violence on Youth | journal = [[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3|pages=81–110 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x | pmid=26151870|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferguson Christopher J | year = 2010| title = Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?

Entertainment Merchants Association|Brown v EMA]] case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.

== Prevention ==
The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|title=Code of Hammurabi {{!}} Summary &amp; History|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-30|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313150613/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|archive-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in various degrees in most countries.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
A review of scientific literature by the [[World Health Organization]] on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ &quot;Violence Prevention: the evidence&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, World Health Organization/Liverpool John Moores University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.

==== Child–caregiver relationships ====
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olds DL, Sadler L, Kitzman H | year = 2007| title = Programs for parents of infants and toddlers: recent evidence from randomized trials | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/efaf3053ab1dd811c7f5909f9e3825871764fb30| journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 48| issue = 3–4| pages = 355–391 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x | pmid=17355402| s2cid = 1083174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Triple P (Parenting Program)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prinz | year = 2009 | title = Population-based prevention of child maltreatment: the US Triple P system population trial | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 10| issue = 1| pages = 1–12| doi = 10.1007/s11121-009-0123-3 | pmid = 19160053 |display-authors=etal| pmc =4258219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caldera D, etal | year = 2007 | title = Impact of a statewide home visiting program on parenting and on child health and development | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 829–852 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.02.008| pmid = 17822765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caldera | year = 1997 | title = Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect: 15 year follow-up of a randomized trial | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03550080047038 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 278 | issue = 8| pages = 637–643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the [[life skills]] acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent [[violence against women]] by promoting [[gender equality]]. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pronyk PM, etal | year = 2006| title = Effect of a structural intervention for the prevention of intimate-partner violence and HIV in rural South Africa: a cluster randomised trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 368| issue = 9551| pages = 1973–83 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69744-4 | pmid=17141704| s2cid = 14146492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim JC, Watts CH, Hargreaves JR, etal | year = 2007| title = Understanding the impact of a microfinance-based intervention on women's empowerment and the reduction of intimate partner violence in South Africa | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97| issue = 10| pages = 1794–1802 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.095521 | pmid=17761566 | pmc=1994170}}&lt;/ref&gt; School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foshee VA, etal | year = 1998| title = An evaluation of safe dates an adolescent dating violence prevention programme | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 1998 | issue = 88| pages = 45–50 | doi=10.2105/ajph.88.1.45| pmc = 1508378 | pmid=9584032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee| year = 2005 | title = Safe Dates&quot; using random coefficient regression modelling | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 245–257 |display-authors=etal| doi = 10.1007/s11121-005-0007-0 | pmid = 16047088 | s2cid = 21288936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolfe D, etal | year = 2009 | title = Dating violence prevention with at risk youth: a controlled outcome evaluation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dfb5502aebfba0b3832b32028775604e01a2df3e| journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 279–291 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.279| pmid = 12699022 | s2cid = 11004108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and [[social norms]] supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing [[dating violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fabiano P | year = 2003 | title = Engaging men as social justice allies in ending violence against women: evidence for a social norms approach | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c12139d8798f5240a300392722f728598e517a92| journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1080/07448480309595732| pmid = 14992295 | s2cid = 28099487 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S.

Little Falls, NJ, PaperClip Communications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olive P | year = 2007 | title = Care for emergency department patients who have experienced domestic violence: a review of the evidence base | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1eed23908de1551977751c626e1322c8c2e60c50| journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 1736–1748 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01746.x| pmid = 17727592 | s2cid = 37110679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; psychosocial interventions – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roberts GL | year = 1997 | title = Impact of an education program about domestic violence on nurses and doctors in an Australian emergency department | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 220–226 | doi=10.1016/s0099-1767(97)90011-8| pmid = 9283357 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holt VL, etal | year = 2003| title = Do protection orders affect the likelihood of future partner violence and injury? | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 24| pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00576-7| pmid = 12554019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McFarlane J, etal | year = 2004| title = Protection orders and intimate partner violence: an 18-month study of 150 Black, Hispanic, and White women | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 2004 | issue = 94| pages = 613–618 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.613| pmc = 1448307 | pmid=15054014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health, WHO&lt;/ref&gt; However, policies that facilitate [[poverty reduction|reductions in poverty]], that make [[decision-making]] more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal justice ===
One of the main functions of [[law]] is to regulate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Joseph E | year = 2006 | title = The One who is More Violent Prevails – Law and Violence from a Talmudic Legal Perspective | journal = Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 385–406 | doi = 10.1017/S0841820900004161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Max Weber]] stated that the state claims the [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] practised within the confines of a specific territory. [[Law]] enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through [[legal system]]s governing individuals and political authorities, including the [[police]] and [[military]]. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] noted: &quot;Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | title = On Violence | publisher = Harvest Book | page = 52 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1972) On Violence in Crises in the Republic, Florida, Harcourt, Brace and Company, pp 134-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century in acts of [[democide]] governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[massacre]], slave [[labour camps]], and sometimes through intentional [[List of famines#20th century|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|title=20th Century Democide|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301064559/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|archive-date=2006-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|title=Atlas – Wars and Democide of the Twentieth Century|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130810/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|archive-date=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in [[self-defense]] are usually classified as [[crimes]], although not all crimes are [[violent crime]]s. [[Property damage|Damage to property]] is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) classifies violence resulting in [[homicide]] into [[murder|criminal homicide]] and [[justifiable homicide]] (e.g. self-defense).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|year=2004|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055659/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that &quot;justice is done&quot;. The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to &quot;do justice&quot;, i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore &quot;Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention.&quot;1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes – through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82–94 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 | s2cid = 11995691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it – and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile justice systems – an important component of criminal justice systems – are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the &quot;Blueprints for violence prevention&quot; programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints &quot;Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt; Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely &quot;criminal&quot; or &quot;medical&quot; problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible &quot;symptoms&quot;. This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon JE, &quot;The epidemiology of accidents,&quot; ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to &quot;extending life&quot; or to a &quot;complete state of well-being&quot;. He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | journal = Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167–172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf &quot;WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared violence &quot;a leading worldwide public health problem&quot; and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt;

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3938be88dc32dacf1e139dc19639d332fd956bc| journal = Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics | volume = 32 | pages = 82–88 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x| pmid = 15152429 | s2cid = 11995691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places – which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries – than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse – which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===

The [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment|inhuman and degrading treatment]] or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===
Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, &quot;appears whenever power is in jeopardy&quot; and &quot;in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot;&gt;Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories – direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot; /&gt; Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that &quot;geography came late to theorizing violence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot; /&gt; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When &quot;modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot; /&gt; the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot; /&gt; Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this &quot;in limbo&quot; reality is designed to be in place &quot;until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agamben, G. 1998&quot;&gt;Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; For Agamben, the physical space of the camp &quot;is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agamben, G. 1998&quot; /&gt; At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by &quot;juridical procedures and deployments of power&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agamben, G. 1998&quot; /&gt; that &quot;no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agamben, G. 1998&quot; /&gt; in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot;&gt;Ringer, G. (2002) &quot;Killing Fields&quot;, in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.&lt;/ref&gt; About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot; /&gt; The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's &quot;ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot; /&gt; he &quot;dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot; /&gt; Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When &quot;symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot; /&gt; cultural violence (defined as when &quot;any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyndman, J. 2009&quot; /&gt;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, G. 2002&quot; /&gt; continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, &quot;as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavarero, A. 2009&quot;&gt;Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as &quot;horrorism&quot;; that is, &quot;as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavarero, A. 2009&quot; /&gt; With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence]]
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozano|first1=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29|url=http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30050819/ortblad-globalandregional-2012.pdf|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819|s2cid=1541253}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt; Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt;

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html &quot;Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=World Health Organization |title=Preventing Suicide: A Global Imperative |url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/131056/9789241564779_eng.pdf;jsessionid=35392AC9D454752889C2650049045812?sequence=1 |website=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=25 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf &quot;World Health Statistics&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030212923/http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html &quot;Global Burden of Disease&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg ML, Butchart A, Mercy J, Narasimhan V, Waters H, Marshall MS. Interpersonal violence. In Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans DB, Prabhat J, Mills A, Musgrove P (eds.) Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd Edition. Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press and The World Bank, 2006: 755-770.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt;

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html &quot;Child maltreatment&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124411/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html |date=2011-12-29 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html &quot;Violence against women&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228151643/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, [[African American]]s were victims of 329,825 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide trends in the United States |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |url=http://www1.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010151657/http://www.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Victims by Race and Sex |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173400/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |archive-date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Krause, Robert Muggah, and Achim Wennmann, &quot;Global Burden of Armed Violence,&quot; Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry]] writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: {{quote|There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|page=168|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eJoAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22one+of+the+critical+issues%22|isbn=978-0-19-985900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jared Diamond]] in his books ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' and ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'' posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.
[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies. (Lawrence H. Keeley, Archeologist, ''[[War Before Civilization]]'')]]
In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial perspective]]. The trend, starting in [[archaeology]] and spreading to [[anthropology]] reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Keely1&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. War before Civilization. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some newer research in archaeology and [[bioarchaeology]] may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|access-date=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} According to the book &quot;The Bioarchaeology of Violence&quot; violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that 87% of [[tribal societies]] were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize [[endemic warfare]], produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. &quot;Primitive Warfare&quot; of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html Review of book &quot;War Before Civilization&quot; by Lawrence H. Keeley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514081056/http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html |date=2008-05-14 }}, July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, &quot;by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states&quot; and that &quot;many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|pages=171–3|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively peaceful period since [[World War II]] is known as the [[Long Peace]].

=== ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' ===
[[Steven Pinker]]'s 2011 book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. [[Cannibalism]] and [[slavery]] have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years, and [[capital punishment]] is now banned in many countries. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Pinker |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3 |year=2011 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/betterangelsofou00pink |author-link=Steven Pinker }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker's analyses have also been criticized, concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |magazine=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archive-date=2016-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laws&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archive-date=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill – By John Arquilla |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |access-date=2013-01-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archive-date=2013-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of [[Norbert Elias]], who attributes the decline to a &quot;civilizing process&quot;, in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or &quot;figurations&quot;, and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CaWFQgAACAAJ | last = Elias | first = N. | year = 1994 | title = The Civilizing Process | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 978-0-631-19222-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 study, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Finkelhor D., Turner H., Ormrod R., Hamby S. | year = 2010 | title = Structural Trends in childhood violence and abuse exposure: Evidence from 2 national surveys | journal = Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine | volume = 164 | issue = 3| pages = 238–242 | doi = 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.283 | pmid = 20194256 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at [[homicide]] rates of death due to [[warfare]], but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik, G., Shackelford, T.K., Weekes-Shackelford, V.A., 2012.

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm &quot;Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study&quot;] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

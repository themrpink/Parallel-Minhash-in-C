W. Keller &amp; Co. | year =1893 | location =Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Chicago World's Fair''') was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Chicago]] in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the [[New World]] in 1492.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11369/ |title = Bird's-Eye View of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1893 |access-date = 2013-07-17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014070106/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11369/ |archive-date = 2013-10-14 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of the Fair, held in Jackson Park, was a large water pool representing the voyage Columbus took to the New World. Chicago had won the right to host the fair over several other cities, including [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[St. Louis]]. The exposition was an influential social and cultural event and had a profound effect on [[Architecture of the United States|architecture]], sanitation, the arts, Chicago's self-image,  and American industrial optimism.

The layout of the Chicago Columbian Exposition was, in large part, designed by [[John Wellborn Root]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Charles B. Atwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=World's Columbian Exposition|url=https://global.britannica.com/event/Worlds-Columbian-Exposition|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713022723/https://global.britannica.com/event/Worlds-Columbian-Exposition|archive-date=2017-07-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;/&gt; It was the prototype of what Burnham and his colleagues thought a city should be. It was designed to follow [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] principles of design, namely [[neoclassical architecture]] principles based on symmetry, balance, and splendor. The color of the material generally used to cover the buildings’ façades (white [[Staff (building material)|staff]]) gave the fairgrounds its nickname, the White City.  Many prominent architects designed its 14 &quot;great buildings.” Artists and musicians were featured in exhibits and many also made depictions and works of art inspired by the exposition.

The exposition covered {{convert|690|acre|km2|1}}, featuring nearly 200 new (but deliberately temporary) buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture, [[canal]]s and [[lagoon]]s, and people and cultures from 46 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; More than 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month run. Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other [[list of world's fairs|world's fairs]], and it became a symbol of the emerging [[American Exceptionalism]], much in the same way that [[the Great Exhibition]] became a symbol of the [[Victorian era]] United Kingdom.

Dedication ceremonies for the fair were held on October 21, 1892, but the fairgrounds were not actually opened to the public until May 1, 1893. The fair continued until October 30, 1893. In addition to recognizing the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by Europeans, the fair also served to show the world that Chicago had risen from the ashes of the [[Great Chicago Fire]], which had destroyed much of the city in 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt;

On October 9, 1893, the day designated as Chicago Day, the fair set a world record for outdoor event attendance, drawing 751,026 people. The debt for the fair was soon paid off with a check for $1.5 million (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1500000|1893}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America|last = Larson|first = Erik|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 2003|isbn = 0-609-60844-4|location = New York|pages = 318–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago has commemorated the fair with one of the stars on [[Flag of Chicago|the Municipal Flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Municipal Flag of Chicago | publisher =Chicago Public Library | year =2009 | url =http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/symbols/flag.php | access-date =2009-03-04 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130615003832/http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/symbols/flag.php | archive-date =2013-06-15 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent civic, professional, and commercial leaders from around the United States participated in the financing, coordination, and management of the Fair, including Chicago shoe company owner Charles H. Schwab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baker Has Resigned|date=19 August 1892|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago railroad and manufacturing magnate [[John Whitfield Bunn]], and Connecticut banking, insurance, and iron products magnate [[Milo Barnum Richardson]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Moses Purnell |last=Handy|title =The Official Directory of the World's Columbian Exposition, May 1st to October 30th, 1893: A Reference Book of Exhibitors and Exhibits, and of the Officers and Members of the World's Columbian Commission Books of the Fairs|publisher =William B. Conkey Co.|date= 1893|page= [https://archive.org/details/officialdirector00worl/page/75 75] |url = https://archive.org/details/officialdirector00worl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; See also: Memorial Volume. Joint Committee on Ceremonies, ''Dedicatory And Opening Ceremonies of the World's Columbian Exposition: Historical and Descriptive'', A. L. Stone: Chicago, 1893. p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair was planned in the early 1890s during the [[Gilded Age]] of rapid industrial growth, immigration, and class tension. World's fairs, such as London's 1851 [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]], had been successful in Europe as a way to bring together societies fragmented along class lines.

The first American attempt at a [[Centennial Exposition|world's fair in Philadelphia in 1876]] drew crowds but was a financial failure. Nonetheless, ideas about distinguishing the 400th anniversary of Columbus' landing started in the late 1880s. Civic leaders in St. Louis, New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago expressed interest in hosting a fair to generate profits, boost real estate values, and promote their cities. Congress was called on to decide the location. New York financiers [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], and [[William Waldorf Astor]], among others, pledged $15 million to finance the fair if Congress awarded it to New York, while Chicagoans [[Charles T. Yerkes]], [[Marshall Field]], [[Philip Armour]], [[Gustavus Swift]], and [[Cyrus McCormick, Jr.|Cyrus McCormick]], offered to finance a Chicago fair. What finally persuaded Congress was Chicago banker [[Lyman Gage]], who raised several million additional dollars in a 24-hour period, over and above New York's final offer.&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1386.html |title=&quot;World's Columbian Exposition&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Chicago'' |access-date=2011-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121144300/http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1386.html |archive-date=2011-11-21 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago representatives not only fought for the world's fair for monetary reasons, but also for reasons of practicality. In a Senate hearing held in January 1890, representative [[Thomas Barbour Bryan|Thomas B. Bryan]] argued that the most important qualities for a world's fair were “abundant supplies of good air and pure water,...ample space, accommodations and transportation for all exhibits and visitors....&quot; He argued that New York had too many obstructions, and Chicago would be able to use large amounts of land around the city where there was &quot;not a house to buy and not a rock to blast....&quot; and that it would be so located that &quot;the artisan and the farmer and the shopkeeper and the man of humble means&quot; would be able to access the fair easily. Bryan continued to say that the fair was of “vital interest” to the West, and that the West wanted the location to be Chicago. The city spokesmen would continue to stress the essentials of a successful Exposition and that only Chicago was fit to fill these exposition requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, F. (1972). Competition for the World's Columbian Exposition: The Chicago Campaign. Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, 65(4), 382–394&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the fair was decided through several rounds of voting by the United States House of Representatives. The first ballot showed Chicago with a large lead over New York, St. Louis, and Washington, DC, but short of a majority. Chicago broke the 154-vote majority threshold on the eighth ballot, receiving 157 votes to New York's 107.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume XXI, First Session 1664-1665&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposition corporation and national exposition commission settled on [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] and an area around it as the fair site. [[Burnham and Root|Daniel H. Burnham]] was selected as director of works, and [[George R. Davis]] as director-general. Burnham emphasized architecture and sculpture as central to the fair and assembled the period's top talent to design the buildings and grounds including [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] for the grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; The temporary buildings were designed in an ornate [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style and painted white, resulting in the fair site being referred to as the &quot;White City&quot;.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

The Exposition's offices set up shop in the upper floors of the [[Rand McNally Building]] on Adams Street, the world's first all-steel-framed skyscraper. Davis's team organized the exhibits with the help of [[G. Brown Goode]] of the [[Smithsonian]]. The Midway was inspired by the [[1889 Paris Universal Exposition]], which included ethnological &quot;villages.”
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma96/wce/history.html|title=World's Columbian Exposition: The Official Fair--A History|access-date=2011-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109103830/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma96/wce/history.html|archive-date=2011-11-09|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights leaders protested the refusal to include an African-American exhibit. [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and [[Ferdinand Lee Barnett (Chicago)|Ferdinand Lee Barnet]] co-authored a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the World's Columbian Exposition – The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature&quot; addressing the issue. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by black  individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor [[Edmonia Lewis]], a painting exhibit by scientist [[George Washington Carver]], and a statistical exhibit by [[Joan Imogen Howard]]. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as [[Nancy Green]]'s portrayal of the character [[Aunt Jemima]] for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.&lt;ref&gt;see introduction of 2013 edition of Rydell, Robert W. All the world's a fair: Visions of empire at American international expositions, 1876–1916.

The fair opened in May and ran through October 30, 1893.  Forty-six nations participated in the fair (it was the first world's fair to have national pavilions),&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Breugal for the EXPO2000 Hannover GmbH Hannover, the EXPO-BOOK The Official Catalogue of EXPO2000 with CDROM&lt;/ref&gt; constructing exhibits and pavilions and naming national &quot;delegates&quot; (for example, Haiti selected [[Frederick Douglass]] to be its delegate).&lt;ref&gt;Rydell, Robert W.

The exposition was located in [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] and on the [[Midway Plaisance]] on {{convert|630|acre|km2}} in the neighborhoods of South Shore, Jackson Park Highlands, [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], and [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]]. [[Charles H. Wacker]] was the director of the fair. The layout of the fairgrounds was created by Frederick Law Olmsted, and the Beaux-Arts architecture of the buildings was under the direction of Daniel Burnham, Director of Works for the fair. Renowned local architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]] designed several buildings for the exposition. The director of the American Academy in Rome, [[Francis Davis Millet]], directed the painted mural decorations. Indeed, it was a coming-of-age for the arts and architecture of the &quot;[[American Renaissance]],&quot; and it showcased the burgeoning [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] styles.

===Assassination of mayor and end of fair===

The fair ended with the city in shock, as popular mayor [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]] was assassinated by [[Patrick Eugene Prendergast]] two days before the fair's closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-10-09-8802060487-story.html|title='HE DESERVED TO BE SHOT,' SAID THE MAYOR'S ASSASSIN|last=Sawyers|first=June|date=October 9, 1988|website=Chicago Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closing ceremonies were canceled in favor of a public memorial service.

Jackson Park was returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form. The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight-line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts/Museum of Science &amp; Industry building. The [[Midway Plaisance]], a park-like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the [[University of Chicago]], which was being built as the fair was closing (the university has since developed south of the Midway). The university's football team, the Maroons, were the original &quot;[[Monsters of the Midway]].&quot; The exposition is mentioned in the university's [[alma mater (song)|alma mater]]: &quot;The City White hath fled the earth,/But where the azure waters lie,/A nobler city hath its birth,/The City Gray that ne'er shall die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uchicagoadmissions.tumblr.com/post/37229385082/today-we-gladly-sing-the-praise-of-her-whose|title=UChicago College Admissions|website=UChicago College Admissions|access-date=2019-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World's Columbian Exposition was the first world's fair with an [[Amusement park|area for amusements]] that was strictly separated from the exhibition halls.  This area, developed by a young music promoter, [[Sol Bloom]], concentrated on [[Midway Plaisance]] and introduced the term &quot;midway&quot; to American English to describe the area of a carnival or fair where [[sideshow]]s are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|midway|accessdate=2019-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It included carnival rides, among them the original [[Ferris Wheel]], built by [[George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; This wheel was {{convert|264|ft|m|0}} high and had 36 cars, each of which could accommodate 40 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buel, James William. ''The Magic City: A Massive Portfolio of Original Photographic Views of the Great World's Fair'', Historical Publishing Company, St. Louis MO, 1894 reprinted by Arno Press, NY,  1974&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of the Columbian Exposition is highlighted by the use of ''{{lang|es|rueda de Chicago}}'' (&quot;Chicago wheel&quot;) in many Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Chile in reference to the [[Ferris wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Carol Styles and Horwood, Jane. Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary: Spanish-English/English-Spanish. Oxford Press, 2004, page 578.&lt;/ref&gt; One attendee, George C. Tilyou, later credited the sights he saw on the Chicago midway for inspiring him to create America's first major amusement park, [[Steeplechase Park]] in [[Coney Island]], New York.

The fair included life-size reproductions of Christopher Columbus' three ships, the ''[[Niña]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', and the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]''. These were intended to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas.  The ships, a joint project of the governments of Spain and the United States, were constructed in Spain and then sailed to America for the exposition.  The ships were a very popular exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Trumble White, William Iglehart, and George R. Davis, The World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago 1893 (1893), at 493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; James C. Clark, &quot;What Happened to the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria that Sailed in 1892?&quot;, ''Orlando Sentinel'', May 10, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eadweard Muybridge]] gave a series of lectures on the Science of Animal Locomotion in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose on Midway Plaisance. He used his [[zoopraxiscope]] to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public. The hall was the first commercial movie theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Clegg | first =Brian | title =The Man Who Stopped Time | publisher =[[Joseph Henry Press]] | year =2007 | isbn =978-0-309-10112-7 | url =https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Street in Cairo&quot; included the popular dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The World's Columbian Exposition (1893) | work =The American Experience | publisher =PBS | year =1999 | url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/houdini/peopleevents/pande08.html | access-date =2009-12-21 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090416091304/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/houdini/peopleevents/pande08.html | archive-date =2009-04-16 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced America to the suggestive version of the [[belly dance]] known as the &quot;[[The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid|hootchy-kootchy]],&quot; to a tune said to have been improvised by Sol Bloom (and now more commonly associated with snake charmers) which he had composed when his dancers had no music to dance to.&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last =Larson | first =Erik | author-link =Erik Larson (author) | title =The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair that Changed America | publisher =Crown | year =2003 | location =New York, NY | isbn =0-609-60844-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Adams | first =Cecil | author-link =Cecil Adams | title =What is the origin of the song &quot;There's a place in France/Where the naked ladies dance?&quot; Are bay leaves poisonous? | work =The Straight Dope | date =2007-02-27 | url =http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2695/what-is-the-origin-of-the-song-theres-a-place-in-france-where-the-naked-ladies-dance | access-date =2009-12-21 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100401080433/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2695/what-is-the-origin-of-the-song-theres-a-place-in-france-where-the-naked-ladies-dance | archive-date =2010-04-01 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom did not copyright the song, putting it immediately in the [[public domain]].

Also included was the first [[moving walkway]] or travelator, which was designed by architect [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]]. It had two different divisions: one where passengers were seated, and one where riders could stand or walk. It ran in a loop down the length of a lakefront pier to a casino.

Although denied a spot at the fair, [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] decided to come to Chicago anyway, setting up his ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show'' just outside the edge of the exposition. Nearby, historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] gave academic lectures reflecting on the end of the frontier which Buffalo Bill represented.

The [[electrotachyscope]] of [[Ottomar Anschütz]] was demonstrated, which used a [[Geissler tube]] to project the [[illusion]] of [[history of cinema|moving images]].

[[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] made his reputation with a stunning chapel designed and built for the Exposition. After the Exposition the [[Tiffany Chapel]] was sold on several times, even going back to Tiffany's estate. It was eventually reconstructed and restored and in 1999 it was installed at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]].

[[Image:Idaho State Building at World's Columbian Exposition 1893 Kirtland Cutter.jpg|thumb|[[Idaho Building (Chicago World's Fair)|Idaho Building]]]]

Architect [[Kirtland Cutter]]'s [[Idaho Building (Chicago World's Fair)|Idaho Building]], a rustic log construction, was a popular favorite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=115|title=Cutter, Kirtland Kelsey (1860–1939), Architect|access-date=2005-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119133915/http://historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=115|archive-date=2005-11-19|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; visited by an estimated 18 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burrows.com/founders/furniture.html|title=Arts &amp; Crafts Movement Furniture|access-date=2005-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827084743/http://www.burrows.com/founders/furniture.html|archive-date=2005-08-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's design and interior furnishings were a major precursor of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].

Among the other attractions at the fair, several products that are well-known today were introduced. These products included Juicy Fruit Gum, Cream of Wheat, and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, among many others.

===Anthropology===
There was an Anthropology Building at the World's Fair. Nearby, &quot;The Cliff Dwellers&quot; featured a rock and timber structure that was painted to recreate [[Battle Rock Mountain]] in Colorado, a stylized recreation of an American Indian cliff dwelling with pottery, weapons, and other relics on display.&lt;ref name=DCS&gt;Joseph M. Di Cola &amp; David Stone (2012) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=c7cdCGzfv8MC Chicago's 1893 World's Fair], page 21&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an [[Eskimo]] display. There were also birch bark [[wigwam]]s of the [[Penobscot]] tribe. Nearby was a working model Indian school, organized by the Office of Indian Affairs, that housed delegations of Native American students and their teachers from schools around the country for weeks at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Christopher T. |title=A Stage Set for Assimilation: The Model Indian School at the World's Columbian Exposition |journal=Winterthur Portfolio |date=2017 |volume=51 |issue=2/3 |pages=95–133 |doi=10.1086/694225 |s2cid=166160942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
The ''[[John Bull (locomotive)|John Bull]]'' locomotive was displayed. It was only 62 years old, having been built in 1831. It was the first locomotive acquisition by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The locomotive ran under its own power from [[Washington, DC]], to Chicago to participate, and returned to Washington under its own power again when the exposition closed. In 1981 it was the oldest surviving operable [[steam locomotive]] in the world when it ran under its own power again.

A [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] [[2-4-2]] locomotive was showcased at the exposition, and subsequently the {{nowrap|2-4-2}} type was known as the ''Columbia''.

An original [[Switch frog|frog]] switch and portion of the superstructure of the famous 1826 [[Granite Railway]] in Massachusetts could be viewed. This was the first commercial railroad in the United States to evolve into a [[common carrier]] without an intervening closure. The railway brought granite stones from a rock quarry in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], so that the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] could be erected in Boston. The frog switch is now on public view in [[Milton, Massachusetts|East Milton Square, Massachusetts]], on the original [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of the Granite Railway.

===Country and state exhibition buildings===
Forty-six countries had pavilions at the exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; [[Norway]] participated by sending the ''[[Viking (replica Viking longship)|Viking]]'', a replica of the [[Gokstad ship]].  It was built in Norway and sailed across the [[Atlantic]] by 12 men, led by Captain Magnus Andersen. In 1919 this ship was moved to [[Lincoln Park]]. It was relocated in 1996 to Good Templar Park in [[Geneva, Illinois]], where it awaits renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Nepstad | first =Peter | author-link =Peter Nepstad | title =The Viking Shop in Jackson Park | publisher =Hyde Park Historical Society | url =http://www.hydeparkhistory.org/herald/VikingShip.pdf | access-date =2009-01-24 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090205134102/http://www.hydeparkhistory.org/herald/VikingShip.pdf | archive-date =2009-02-05 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Smith | first =Gerry | author-link =Gerry Smith | title =Viking ship from 1893 Chicago world's fair begins much-needed voyage to restoration | work =[[Chicago Tribune]] | publisher =Tribune Company | date =2008-06-26 | url =http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2008/06/viking-ship-fro.html | access-date =2009-01-24 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160821020041/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2008/06/viking-ship-fro.html | archive-date =2016-08-21 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-four U.S. states also had their own pavilions.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; The work of noted feminist author [[Kate McPhelim Cleary]] was featured during the opening of the Nebraska Day ceremonies at the fair, which included a reading of her poem &quot;Nebraska&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lopers.net/faculty/b/bloomfields/cleary/KCLitBio.htm |title =Kate McPhelim Cleary: A Gallant Lady Reclaimed|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107134359/http://www.lopers.net/faculty/b/bloomfields/cleary/KCLitBio.htm |archive-date=2009-01-07 |website= Lopers.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the state buildings present at the fair were California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas; each was meant to be architecturally representative of the corresponding states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behling|first=Laura L.|date=October 2002|title=Reification and Resistance: The Rhetoric of Black Womanhood at the Columbian Exposition, 1893|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/07491409.2002.10162445|s2cid=144977109|issn=0749-1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[United States territories]] also had pavilions located in one building: [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot; /&gt;

Visitors to the Louisiana Pavilion were each given a seedling of a cypress tree. This resulted in the spread of cypress trees to areas where they were not native.  Cypress trees from those seedlings can be found in many areas of West Virginia, where they flourish in the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine = Wonderful West Virginia|date= August 2007 |page= 6|first = Kenneth L. |last = Carvell|title = Arboreal Mysteries Unraveled|url = http://www.wvdnr.gov/wwvmagazine/Archive/Batch2007/2007%20-%2008%20August.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Battleship Illinois (replica)|''Illinois'']] was a detailed, full-scale mockup of an [[Indiana-class battleship|''Indiana''-class battleship]], constructed as a naval exhibit.

===Guns and artillery===
[[File:The great Krupp building, Columbian Exposition, by Kilburn, B. W. (Benjamin West), 1827-1909.jpg|thumb|[[Stereoscopic]] image of the Great [[Krupp]] Building]]
The German firm [[Krupp]] had a pavilion of artillery, which apparently had cost one million dollars to stage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg2008&quot;/&gt; including a coastal gun of 42&amp;nbsp;cm in bore (16.54&amp;nbsp;inches) and a length of 33 calibres (45.93 feet, 14 meters). A breech-loaded gun, it weighed 120.46 [[long tons]] (122.4 metric tons). According to the company's marketing: &quot;It carried a charge projectile weighing from 2,200 to 2,500 pounds which, when driven by 900 pounds of [[brown powder]], was claimed to be able to penetrate at 2,200 yards a wrought-iron plate three feet thick if placed at right angles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Birkinbine (1893) &quot;Prominent Features of the World's Columbian Exposition&quot;, ''Engineers and engineering'', Volume 10, p. 292; for the metric values see {{cite book|author=Ludwig Beck|title=Die geschichte des eisens in technischer und kulturgeschiehtlicher beziehung: abt.

===Religions===
The 1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], which ran from September 11 to September 27, marked the first formal gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions from around the world. According to [[Eric J. Sharpe]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], and others, the event was considered radical at the time, since it allowed non-Christian faiths to speak on their own behalf; it was not taken seriously by European scholars until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tomoko |last=Masuzawa |title=The Invention of World Religions |location=Chicago [[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-50989-1|pages=270–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moving walkway===
[[File:The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk.PNG|thumb|The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk]]

Along the banks of the lake, patrons on the way to the casino were taken on a [[moving walkway]] designed by architect [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]], the first of its kind open to the public,&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, Norman, and Christine Laing.  ''The World's Columbian Exposition: the Chicago World's Fair of 1893''. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; called ''The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk'', it allowed people to walk along or ride in seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman1893&quot; /&gt;

===Horticulture===
Horticultural exhibits at the Horticultural Hall included [[cacti]] and [[orchid]]s as well as other plants in a [[greenhouse]].

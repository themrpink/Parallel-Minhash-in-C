Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called [[Corfiot Italians]], and until the second half of the 20th century the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer [[Felice Beato]] (1832–1909) is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu. Also many [[Italian Jews]] took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language ([[Italkian]]), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.

Venetians promoted the [[Catholic Church]] during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today the majority of Corfiots are [[Greek Orthodox]], but the small Catholic minority (5%), living harmoniously with the Orthodox community, owes its faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from [[Malta]], but also from [[Italy]], and today the Catholic community numbers about 4,000 ({{frac|2|3}} of Maltese descent), who live almost exclusively in the Venetian &quot;Citadel&quot; of [[Corfu City]]. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate Easter using the same calendar as the [[Greek Orthodox]] church. The [[Cathedral of Saint James and Saint Christopher|Cathedral of St. James and St. Christopher]] in Corfu City is the see of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Corfu, Zakynthos and Cephalonia]].

The island served also as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732, it became the home of the first academy of modern Greece.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; A Corfu cleric and scholar, [[Nikephoros Theotokis]] (1732–1800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in Russia (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.

The island's culture absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways; like other Ionian islands (see [[Cuisine of the Ionian islands]]), its local cuisine took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking includes Venetian delicacies and recipes: &quot;[[Pastitsada]]&quot;, deriving from the Venetian &quot;Pastissada&quot; (Italian: &quot;Spezzatino&quot;) and the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, &quot;[[Sofrito]]&quot;, &quot;[[Strapatsada]]&quot;, &quot;Savoro&quot;, &quot;Bianco&quot; and &quot;Mandolato&quot;.

[[File:Russian-Gun-on-Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|A Russian gun from the Russian-Ottoman occupation of Corfu in the beginning of the 19th century, [[Paleokastritsa]]]]

By the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Corfu was ceded to the [[French Revolution|French]], who occupied it for two years as the ''[[French departments of Greece|département]]'' of [[Corcyre]], until they were [[Siege of Corfu (1798–1799)|expelled]] by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n-Ottoman squadron under [[Admiral Ushakov]]. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the [[Septinsular Republic|Heptanesos]] (&quot;Seven Islands&quot;), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor [[François-Xavier Donzelot]], and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Following the final defeat of [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 5 November 1815 as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]. Corfu became the seat of the British [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The period of British rule is sometimes considered a prosperous period for Corfu when we consider new roads, an improved water supply system, and the building of the first Greek university to be a sign of prosperity. During this period the [[Greek language]] became official.

Following a plebiscite the [[Second National Assembly of the Greeks at Athens]] elected a new king, Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]], pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 21 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt;

=== First World War ===
{{further|Serbian army's retreat through Albania}}[[File:Serbs Corfu1916-1918.jpg|thumb|Serbian soldiers in Corfu during WWI]]

During the [[First World War]], the island served as a refuge for the Serbian army that retreated there on [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces' ships from a homeland occupied by the Austrians, Germans and [[Bulgarians]]. During their stay, a large portion of Serbian soldiers died from exhaustion, food shortage, and various diseases. Most of their remains were buried at sea near the island of [[Vido]], a small island at the mouth of Corfu port, and a monument of thanks to the Greek nation has been erected at Vido by the grateful Serbs; consequently, the waters around Vido Island are known by the Serbian people as the [[Blue Tomb]] (in Serbian, Плава Гробница, [[Plava Grobnica]]), after a poem written by [[Milutin Bojić]] following World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serbs in Corfu&quot;&gt;

===Interwar period===
In 1923, after a diplomatic dispute between Italy and Greece, Italian forces bombarded and occupied Corfu. The [[League of Nations]] settled this [[Corfu incident]].

====Italian occupation and resistance====
[[File:Bay of Garitsa.png|thumb|Bay of Garitsa]]

During the [[Greco-Italian War]], Corfu was occupied by the Italians in April 1941. They administered Corfu and the Ionian islands as a separate entity from Greece until September 1943, following [[Benito Mussolini]]'s orders of fulfilling Italian [[Italia irredenta|Irredentism]] and making Corfu part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During the Second World War the [[10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|10th infantry regiment]] of the [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]], composed mainly of Corfiot soldiers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot;&gt;[http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106230616/http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |date=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned the task of defending Corfu. The regiment took part in ''Operation Latzides'', which was a heroic but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stem the forces of the Italians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot; /&gt; After Greece's surrender to the Axis, the island came under Italian control and occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot; /&gt; On the first Sunday of November 1941, high school students from all over Corfu took part in [[student protest]]s against the occupying Italian army; these student protests of the island were among the first acts of overt popular [[Greek Resistance|Resistance]] in occupied Greece and a rare phenomenon even by wartime European standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot; /&gt; Subsequently, a considerable number of Corfiots escaped to [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in mainland Greece and enlisted as [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in [[Ethnikos Laikos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]] and [[Ethnikos Dimokratikos Ellinikos Syndesmos|EDES]], in order to join the resistance movement gathering in the mainland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot; /&gt;

====German bombing and occupation====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1459-32, Korfu, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|220px|Italian soldiers taken prisoner by the Germans in Corfu, September 1943]]

Upon the fall of [[Italian fascism]] in 1943, the Nazis moved to take control of the island. On 14 September 1943, Corfu was bombarded by the [[Luftwaffe]]. The Nazi bombing raids destroyed most of the city's buildings, including churches, homes, and whole city blocks, especially in the Jewish quarter Evraiki. Other losses included ithe city's market (αγορά) and the hotel Bella Venezia. The worst losses were the historic buildings of the [[Ionian Academy]] (Ιόνιος Ακαδημία), the [[Municipal Theatre of Corfu|Municipal Theatre]] (which in 1901 had replaced the ''[[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]]''), the Municipal Library, and the Ionian Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu cityhall history page&quot;/&gt;

Following the Nazi invasion, the Italians capitulated, and the island came under German occupation. Corfu's mayor at the time, Kollas, was a known collaborator and various anti-semitic laws were passed by the Nazis that now formed the [[Military occupation|occupation]] government of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;USHMM&quot;&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/greece/eng/corfu.htm United States Holocaust Memorial Museum] on the Holocaust in Corfu.

====Liberation====
[[File:Douglas Column in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Douglas' column at the suburb of Garitsa. Built to commemorate [[Howard Douglas]].]]

Corfu was liberated by British troops, specifically the [[40th Royal Marine Commando]], which landed in Corfu on 14 October 1944, as the Germans were evacuating Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/74/a3855774.shtml BBC WW2 People's War] Quote: &quot;By the time I got back to camp the troop had returned from Corfu full of stories about the wonderful reception they’d had from the locals as the liberators of the island.&quot; Bill Sanderson's Wartime Experiences -Part 4 – 40 Commando by Bill Sanderson (junior) Bill Sanderson's Wartime Experiences -Part 4 – 40 Commando by Bill Sanderson (junior) Retrieved 31 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Navy]] swept the Corfu Channel for mines in 1944 and 1945, and found it to be free of mines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu channel&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2193642|title = The Corfu Channel Case|journal = The American Journal of International Law|volume = 43|issue = 3|pages = 491–494|last1 = Wright|first1 = Quincy|year = 1949|doi = 10.2307/2193642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large minefield was laid there shortly afterwards by the newly communist Albania and gave rise to the [[Corfu Channel Incident]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfu channel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=4548923&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;CATREF=ADM+116%2F5759 Corfu Channel Incident] Records of the Admiralty, Naval Forces, Royal Marines, Coastguard, and related bodies U.K. Retrieved 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1226351|title = The Corfu Channel Case: Judgment on the Preliminary Objection|journal = Stanford Law Review|volume = 1|issue = 4|pages = 646–657|last1 = Bancroft|first1 = Harding F.|last2 = Stein|first2 = Eric|year = 1949|doi = 10.2307/1226351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;q=Royal+Navy+Corfu+Channel&amp;pg=PA224 | title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9780815340577| year=2001| last1=Cook| first1=Bernard A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident led to the [[The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

===Post–World War and modern Corfu===
After World War II and the [[Greek Civil War]], the island was rebuilt under the general programme of reconstruction of the Greek Government (Ανοικοδόμησις) and many elements of its classical architecture remain. Its economy grew but a portion of its inhabitants left the island for other parts of the country; buildings erected during Italian occupation – such as schools or government buildings – were put back to civic use. In 1956 [[Maria Desylla Kapodistria]], relative of first Governor (head of state) of Greece [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], was elected mayor of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] and became the first female mayor in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041015102214/http://www.corfu.gr/en/proties/desila.htm Municipality of Corfu from the Internet archive] Quote: &quot;In the elections of 1954 Stamatios Desillas was elected Mayor for a second term and remained in office until his death, Christmas Day 1955.

===Venetian influence===
[[File:Corfu city by the sea.jpg|thumb|Old Corfu town as seen from the sea]]
Corfu's urban architecture influence derives from Venice, reflecting the fact that from 1386 to 1797 the island was ruled by the Venetians. The architecture of the Old Town of Corfu along with its narrow streets, the {{transl|grc|kantounia}}, has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. Other notable Venetian-era buildings include the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]], the first Greek opera house, and ''Liston'', a multi-level commercial and residential building, with an arched colonnade at ground level, lined with cafes and restaurants on its east side, and restaurants and other stores on its west side. Liston's main thoroughfare is often the site of parades and other mass gatherings. Liston is on the edge of the ''[[Spianada]]'' (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a [[cricket]] field, a pavilion, and Maitland's monument. Also notable are the Old and New forts, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British governor and the seat of the [[Ionian Senate]], and the summer Palace of ''[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]]'', formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. The Park of Mon Repos is built on part of the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with academics and universities internationally. Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos and at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Artifacts&quot;&gt;R. Winkes (editor), Kerkyra. Artifacts from the Palaiopolis, Providence 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Achilleion===
{{Main|Achilleion (Corfu)}}
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Statue of ''Achilleús Thnēskōn'' (''[[Achilles]] Dying'') in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

In 1889, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elizabeth of Austria]] built a summer palace in the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city, naming it [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achílleion]] (Αχίλλειον) after the [[Homer]]ic hero Achilles.  The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting scenes of the [[Trojan War]].  The palace, with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to [[Platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]] as well as [[escapism]]. It served as a refuge for the grieving Empress following the tragic death of her only son and [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince, Rudolf]].

[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the Achilleion. He gazes northward, toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles. It was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II.]]

The Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hills and valleys and the [[Ionian sea]]. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αχιλλεύς Θνήσκων, ''Achilleús Thnēskōn'', Achilles Dying) without [[hubris]] and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek [[hoplite]] helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]].

The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]'s arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]]. According to [[Greek mythology]], his mother [[Thetis]] was a goddess.

In 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Lucheni]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiser]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of [[hubris|pride]]. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of [[Hector of Troy]] in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.

Following the Kaiser's purchase of the Achilleion, he invited archaeologist [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]], a friend and advisor, to come to Corfu to advise him where to position the huge statue of Achilles which he commissioned. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue's base, was also created by Kekulé. The inscription read:&lt;ref name=&quot;Röhl1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. G. Röhl|title=Young Wilhelm: The Kaiser's Early Life, 1859–1888|url=https://archive.org/details/youngwilhelmkais00rohl|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 May 2013|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49752-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/youngwilhelmkais00rohl/page/297 297]|quote=After the purchase of the 'Achilleion', Kekule was invited by the Kaiser to go to Corfu to provide advice on the positioning of the ... 94 Without a doubt, Wilhelm's lifelong obsession with the statue of the Gorgon unearthed in Corfu stems from the ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|To the Greatest Greek from the Greatest German}} The inscription was subsequently removed after World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkerBowman2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sherry Marker|author2=John S.

The Achilleion was eventually acquired by the Greek state and has now been converted into a museum.

===Kaiser's Bridge===
[[File:Kaiser's Bridge in Corfu.jpg|thumb|View of the Kaiser's bridge]]

German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was also fond of taking holidays in Corfu. Having purchased the Achilleion in 1907 after Sissi's death, he appointed [[Carl Ludwig Sprenger]] as the botanical architect of the Palace, and also built a bridge later named by the locals after him—the &quot;Kaiser's bridge&quot; (Greek: η γέφυρα του Κάιζερ transliterated as: i gefyra tou Kaizer)—to access the beach without traversing the road forming the island's main artery to the south. The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was demolished by the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1944, during the German occupation of World War II, to allow for the passage of an enormous cannon, forming part of the Nazi defences in the southeastern coast of Corfu.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesFlamburiari1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Giles|author2=Spiro Flamburiari|author3=Fritz Von der Schulenburg|title=Corfu: the garden isle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Evs-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=1 September 1994|page=109|publisher=J.

The Old Town of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu city]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. In several parts of the old city, buildings of the [[Venice|Venetian]] era are to be found. The old city's architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient side streets, and the old buildings' trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of [[Venice]].

The city of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|Παλαιό Φρούριο}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; that now serves as a [[marina]] and is called the ''Contrafossa''. In the old town there are many narrow streets paved with cobblestones. These streets are known as {{transl|grc|kantoúnia}} ({{lang-el|καντούνια}}), and the older amongst them sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground; while many are too narrow for vehicular traffic. A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (Γαρίτσα), together with an esplanade between the city and the citadel known as ''Spianada'' with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} arcade ({{lang-el|Λιστόν}}) to its west side, where restaurants and bistros abound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/holidays/family-holidays/the-complete-guide-to-corfu-851348.html The Independent] Complete Guide to Corfu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===

Near the old Venetian Citadel a large square called ''Spianada'' is also to be found, divided by a street in two parts: &quot;Ano Plateia&quot; (literally: &quot;Upper square&quot;) and &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; (literally: &quot;Lower square&quot;), (Ανω Πλατεία and Κάτω Πλατεία in Greek). This is the biggest square in South-Eastern Europe and one of the largest in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corfulife.co.uk/corfutown.html Corfu Life UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004235752/http://www.corfulife.co.uk/corfutown.html |date=4 October 2008 }} Quote: &quot;The French were the ones who turned the Spianada into a public square and park – one of the biggest in Europe&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sognefk.no/viktige%20filer/BROCHURE%20OF%20KERKYRA%20CUP%20IN%20ENGLISH.pdf Brohure of Kerkyra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003065731/http://www.sognefk.no/viktige%20filer/BROCHURE%20OF%20KERKYRA%20CUP%20IN%20ENGLISH.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }} Quote: &quot;SOCCER The tournament will start on Wednesday 04 of July An Open Ceremony and a parade of all the teams will take place in the biggest square in the Balkansand one of the most impressive ones in the whole continent, to the square Spianada itself which is constructed similarlyto the Royal Gardens of Europe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and replete with green spaces and interesting structures, such as a Roman-style rotunda from the era of British administration, known as the ''Maitland monument'', built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]]. An ornate music pavilion is also present, where the local &quot;Philharmonikes&quot; (Philharmonic Orchestras) (Φιλαρμονικές), mount classical performances in the artistic and musical tradition for which the island is well known. &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; also serves as a venue where [[cricket]] matches are held from time to time. In Greece, cricket is unique to Corfu, as it was once a British protectorate.

Just to the north of &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; lie the &quot;Palaia Anaktora&quot; (Παλαιά Ανάκτορα: literally &quot;Old Palaces&quot;): a large complex of buildings of Roman architectural style which formerly housed the Kings of Greece, and prior to that the [[List of Lord High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands|British Governors]] of the island. It was then called the Palace of Saints Michael and George. The [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]] was founded here in 1818 with motto ''auspicium melioris aevi'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Stamatopoulos1993a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nondas Stamatopoulos|title=Old Corfu: history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6m0-AQAAIAAJ |year=1993 |publisher=N.

Today the palace is open to the public and forms a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a [[Museum of Asian Art (Corfu)|Museum of Asian Art]], unique across Southern Europe in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (Μπάνια τ' Αλέκου) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A café on the grounds includes its own [[art gallery]], with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Café. From the same spot, the viewer can observe ships passing through the narrow channel of the historic [[Vido|Vido island]] (Νησί Βίδου) to the north, on their way to Corfu harbour (Νέο Λιμάνι), with high speed retractable [[aerofoil]] ferries from [[Igoumenitsa]] also cutting across the panorama. A wrought-iron aerial staircase, closed to visitors, descends to the sea from the gardens; the Greek royal family used it as a shortcut to the baths. Rewriting history, locals now refer to the old Royal Gardens as the &quot;Garden of the People&quot; (Ο Κήπος του Λαού).

===Churches===
In the city, there are thirty-seven Greek churches, the most important of which are the city's cathedral, the church dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave (η Παναγία Σπηλιώτισσα (hē Panagia Spēliōtissa)); [[Saint Spyridon Church]], wherein lies the preserved body of the patron saint of the island; and finally the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater (Αγιοι Ιάσων και Σωσίπατρος), reputedly the oldest in the island,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and named after the two saints probably the first to preach Christianity to the Corfiots.

=== Pontikonisi ===
The nearby island, known as [[Pontikonisi]] (Greek meaning &quot;mouse island&quot;), though small is very green with abundant trees, and at its highest natural elevation (excluding its trees or man-made structures, such as the monastery), stands at about {{convert|2|m|2|abbr=on}}. Pontikonisi is home of the monastery of Pantokrator (Μοναστήρι του Παντοκράτορος); the white stone staircase of the monastery, viewed from afar, gives the impression of a (mouse) tail, which lent the island its name.

==Archaeology==
===Palaiopolis===

In the city of Corfu, the ruins of the ancient city of Korkyra, also known as ''Palaiopolis'', include ancient temples which were excavated at the location of the palace of Mon Repos, which was built on the ruins of the Palaiopolis. The temples are: [[Kardaki Temple]], [[Temple of Artemis, Corfu|Temple of Artemis]], and the [[Temple of Hera, Mon Repos|Temple of Hera]]. Hera's temple is situated at the western limits of Mon Repos, close to [[Kardaki Temple]] and to the northwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSTOR2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Philip Sapirstein |title=The Monumental Archaic Roof of the Temple of Hera at Mon Repos, Corfu |journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|date=1 January 2012 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=31–91 |jstor=10.2972/hesperia.81.1.0031 |doi=10.2972/hesperia.81.1.0031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately 700 m. to the southeast of the [[Temple of Artemis, Corfu|Temple of Artemis in Corfu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JSTOR2&quot;/&gt; Hera's Temple was built at the top of Analipsis Hill, and, because of its prominent location, it was highly visible to ships passing close to the waterfront of ancient [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JSTOR2&quot;/&gt;

Its association with the worship of [[Apollo]] or [[Poseidon]] has not been established.

===Temple of Artemis===
{{main|Temple of Artemis, Corfu}}
[[File:Full Medusa pediment at the Archaelogical museum of Corfu.jpg|thumb|The full pediment of the temple of Artemis]]
The Temple of Artemis is an [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] [[Greek temple]] in Corfu, built in around 580 BC in the ancient city of [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]] (or Corcyra), in what is known today as the suburb of Garitsa. The temple was dedicated to [[Artemis]]. It is known as the first [[Doric order|Doric]] temple exclusively built with [[limestone|stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling&quot;/&gt; It is also considered the first building to have incorporated all of the elements of the [[Doric order|Doric architectural style]].&lt;ref name=Excerpt&gt;{{harvnb|Cruickshank|2000|loc=Chapter One: &quot;Temple of Artemis, Corcyra&quot;, p. [http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=0823002896&amp;standardNoType=1&amp;excerpt=true 18]}}: &quot;The island of Corfu, to the northwest of present-day Greece, off the coast of Albania, was an early colony of the city of Corinth and was under Corinthian control when its Temple of Artemis was constructed. A milestone in Greek architecture, this was the first building that was truly Doric. Many if not all of its Doric characteristics had appeared in earlier structures but here they were used for the first time as an ensemble.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Very few Greek temple [[relief]]s from the Archaic period have survived, and the large fragments of the group from the [[pediment]] are the earliest significant survivals.

[[BWI Rail Station]] is located about a mile from the airport terminal; the free [[BWI Marshall Airport Shuttle]] connects the train station and airport terminals. The station is served by [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] trains, including the high-speed [[Acela Express]], and the [[MARC Train|MARC]] [[MARC Train#Penn Line|Penn Line]] commuter rail service. Travel time by train is about twenty minutes to [[Baltimore]]'s [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] and thirty-five minutes to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.

In August 2014, BWI launched a new bicycle sharing system with the Boston-based company [[Zagster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-08-07/news/bs-md-bwi-zagster-20140807_1_rail-station-international-terminal-airport-travelers|title=BWI introduces bike-share pilot program for airport trail|publisher=|access-date=December 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002906/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-08-07/news/bs-md-bwi-zagster-20140807_1_rail-station-international-terminal-airport-travelers|archive-date=March 5, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located adjacent to the light rail station, the bike sharing service connects terminal passengers to the nearby [[Airport Loop|BWI Trail]], as well as other local destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/press-releases/1136|title=Zagster Brings Pilot Bike Share Program to BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport - BWI Airport - Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|website=www.bwiairport.com|access-date=December 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123442/http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/press-releases/1136|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[BWI Business District]] was established as a way to formalize businesses and hotels operating adjacent to the airport. The district comprises two smaller districts located to the north (West Nursery Hotel District) and west (Stoney Run District) of the airport. Numerous traveler resources and employment centers are located within both districts, such as the [[BWI Rail Station]] and BWI Rental Car Facility in the Stoney Run District, and the [[BWI Business District (Baltimore Light Rail station)|BWI Business District Light Rail Station]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] [[Friendship Annex]], and dozens of hotel facilities in the West Nursery District.

A DHS facility is located in the lower level of the main terminal, near the international arrivals area / Concourse E Baggage Claim. This facility also includes a Global Entry Enrollment Center, as well as a TSA PreCheck enrollment facility.

In the early 1990s, BWI Airport opened the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area at Friendship Park. The observation plaza features a playground and a terrace overlooking the southern approach to the airport's 15R-33L runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/press-releases/1190|title=BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport Announces New Playground is Open - BWI Airport - Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|website=www.bwiairport.com|access-date=September 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922013143/http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/press-releases/1190|archive-date=September 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this vantage point, several planes can be viewed simultaneously as they prepare for landing. The southern loop of the 13.3 mile [[Airport Loop|BWI Trail]] travels through the park, providing cyclist and pedestrian access to the park.

In addition to the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area, which provides spotters with views of aircraft landing on runway 33L, spotters can use one of several parking garages to view arrivals to runway 15R, with some arrivals appearing to be below the spotter.

==Accidents and Incidents==
* On February 22, 1974, [[Samuel Byck]] entered BWI, shot and killed an aviation police officer and stormed onto [[Delta Air Lines Flight 523]]. He killed the first officer and severely wounded the captain. He intended to hijack the plane and crash it into the [[White House]]. A gunfight ensued, and Byck was mortally wounded by a police officer from outside the aircraft. Byck killed himself before police stormed the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ranter |first1=Harro |title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-9 registration unknown Baltimore/Washington International Airport, MD (BWI) |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19740222-0 |website=aviation-safety.net |accessdate=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009144351/https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19740222-0 |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 10, 1992, a [[Volpar Turboliner]] operated by [[Connie Kalitta Services]] crashed {{convert|3|mi}} west of BWI in [[Elkridge, Maryland|Elkridge]] due to a shift in cargo in the aircraft during final approach. The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ranter |first1=Harro |title=ASN Aircraft accident Volpar Turboliner II N7770B Elkridge, MD |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19921210-1 |website=aviation-safety.net |accessdate=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310021805/http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19921210-1 |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 6, 2009, [[World Airways]] Flight 8535, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]-30ER, experienced a hard landing at BWI which caused the left nose tire to fail. A go-around was executed and the aircraft landed safely. The flight was a contract Defense Department [[Air Mobility Command]] flight from [[Leipzig, Germany]]. Out of the 168 passengers and 12 crew on board, 4 passengers were taken to a local hospital and the first officer suffered a serious injury. The aircraft suffered substantial damage and was written off.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id=20090506-0|accessdate=November 23, 2020|title=N139WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Holbein was born in [[free imperial city]] of [[Augsburg]] ([[Germany]]), and died in [[Isenheim]], [[Alsace]] (now [[France]]). He belonged to a celebrated family of painters; his father was [[Michael Holbein]]; his brother was [[Sigmund Holbein]] (died 1540). He had two sons, both artists and printmakers: [[Ambrosius Holbein]] (c. 1494 – c. 1519) and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (c. 1497 – 1543), who both had their first painting lessons from their father.

The date of Holbein's birth is unknown. His name appears in the Augsburg tax books in 1494, superseding that of his father. As early as 1493, Holbein had a following, and he worked that year at the abbey at [[Weingarten Abbey|Weingarten]], creating the wings of an altarpiece representing Joachim's Offering, the Nativity of the Virgin Mary's Presentation in the Temple, and the Presentation of Christ. Today they hang in separate panels in the cathedral of Augsburg.

Holbein painted richly colored religious works. His later paintings show how he pioneered and led the transformation of German art from the (Late) [[International Gothic]] to the [[Renaissance]] style. In addition to the altar paintings that are his principal works, he also designed church windows and woodcuts. The surviving prints that can be attributed to him are few and a new one has recently been added to the group, an ''Annunciation to the Virgin'' in the collection of the Universitätbibliothek in [[Erlangen]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Messling, ‘The Annunciation to the Virgin by Hans Holbein the Elder’, [[Print Quarterly]], XXXVI, no.3 (September 2019), pp. 286–293.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a number of portrait drawings that foreshadow the work of his famous son, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].

Holbein first appears at Augsburg, partnered with his brother Sigismund (who died in 1540 at [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]). Augsburg, at the time of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], cultivated art with a Flemish style, and felt the influence of the schools of [[Bruges]] and [[Brussels]], even though it was near [[Italy]], with close commercial connections to [[Venice]]. Sigismund was also a painter, but Hans had the lead of the partnership and signed all the works they produced.

After 1516 Holbein was declared a tax defaulter in Augsburg, which forced him to accept commissions abroad. At [[Issenheim]] in [[Alsace]], where [[Matthias Grünewald]] was employed at the time, Holbein found patrons and was contracted to complete an altarpiece. His brother Sigismund and others sued him in Augsburg for unpaid debts. Pursued by Augsburg authorities, he fled Issenheim, abandoning his work and equipment, and went to [[Basel]]. He died two years later at an unknown location. After 1524 his name no longer appeared on the register of the Augsburg guild.

[[Image:Ambrosius Holbein 002.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''Portrait of a Young Man'', 1518, oil on wood, 43 x 32 cm, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.]]
'''Ambrosius Holbein''' (c. 1494 – c. 1519) was a [[Germany|German]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist in painting, [[drawing]] and [[printmaking]]. He was the elder brother, by about three years, of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], but he appears to have died in his mid twenties leaving behind only a small body of work.

==Biography==
Like his younger brother, he was born in [[Augsburg]] (which today is in [[Bavaria]], but then was a [[free imperial city]]), a center of art, culture and trade at that time. His father [[Hans Holbein the Elder]] was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] to the [[Renaissance]] style.  In his studio both his sons, Ambrosius and Hans, received their first painting lessons as well as an introduction to the crafts of the [[goldsmith]], jeweller and printmaker.

The young Holbein, alongside his brother and his father, is pictured in the left-hand panel of Holbein the Elder's 1504 altar-piece [[triptych]] the ''Basilica of St. Paul'', which is displayed at the Staatsgalerie in Augsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02h9c5v/p02h9bfz|title=Paintings featured in Holbein: Eye of the Tudors|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=22 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515, Ambrosius lived in the Swiss town of [[Stein am Rhein]], where he helped a [[Schaffhausen]] painter named Thomas Schmid with the murals in the main hall of the St George monastery. The next year saw Ambrosius, as well as his brother Hans, in [[Basel]], where he initially worked as a [[journeyman]] in Hans Herbster's studio. In 1517 he was enrolled in a register of the Basel [[painters' guild]] and in 1518 he was naturalized as a citizen there. However he disappears from records soon after, and is assumed to have died around 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Derek. ''Hans Holbein: Portrait of an Unknown Man''. London: Pimlico, Revised Edition, 200, pp. 69–70. Wilson cautions against too readily accepting that Ambrosius died, since other explanations for his disappearance from the record are possible. However, only Hans Holbein claimed their father's estate when he died in 1524.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Portrait of a Boy with Blond Hair'' and its companion, the ''Portrait of a Boy with Brown Hair'', are among Ambrosius’ best works of this period. Both are now in the [[Basel Kunstmuseum]].

Ambrosius Holbein ranks among the most important of Basel's illustrators and prominent &quot;small format&quot; artists.

The '''Lagomorphs''' are the members of the taxonomic [[order (biology)|order]] '''Lagomorpha''', of which there are two living [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Leporidae]] ([[hare]]s and [[rabbit]]s) and the [[Ochotonidae]] ([[pika]]s). The name of the order is derived from the Ancient Greek ''lagos'' (λαγώς, &quot;hare&quot;) + ''morphē'' (μορφή, &quot;form&quot;). There are 102 extant species of lagomorph, including 37 species of pika, 33 species of rabbit and cottontail, and 32 species of hare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = lagomorph {{!}} mammal|url = https://www.britannica.com/animal/lagomorph |accessdate = 2020-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and evolutionary history ==
Other names used for this order, now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]], include: ''Duplicidentata'' - Illiger, 1811; ''Leporida'' - Averianov, 1999; ''Neolagomorpha'' - Averianov, 1999; ''Ochotonida'' - Averianov, 1999; and ''Palarodentia'' - Haeckel, 1895, Lilian, 2016.&lt;ref name=MSW/&gt;

The evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood. Until recently, it was generally agreed that ''[[Eurymylus]]'', which lived in eastern Asia and dates back to the late [[Paleocene]] or early [[Eocene]], was an ancestor of the lagomorphs.&lt;ref name=EoDP&gt;{{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|pages= 285|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examination of the fossil evidence suggests that the lagomorphs may have instead descended from [[Anagaloidea]], also known as &quot;mimotonids&quot;, while ''Eurymylus'' was more closely related to rodents (although not a direct ancestor).&lt;ref name=BAoM&gt;{{cite book |author=Rose, Kenneth David|year=2006|title=The Beginning of the Age of Mammals|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|pages = 315|isbn=0-8018-8472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leporids first appeared in the late Eocene and rapidly spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere; they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern leaping gait developed. The pikas appeared somewhat later in the [[Oligocene]] of eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=MamEv&gt;{{cite book|author= Savage, RJG, &amp; Long, MR|year= 1986|title= Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|publisher= Facts on File|location= New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava/page/128 128–129]|isbn= 0-8160-1194-X|url= https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava/page/128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagomorphs were certainly more diverse in the past than in the present, with around 75 genera and over 230 species represented in the fossil record and many more species in a single biome. This is evidence that lagomorph lineages are declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lagomorph Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent finds suggest an [[India]]n origin for the clade, having possibly evolved in isolation when India was an island continent in the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose K.D., Deleon V.B., Mmissian P., Rana R.S., Sahni A., Singh L. &amp; Smith T.

Lagomorphs are similar to other [[mammal]]s in that they all have hair, four limbs (i.e., they are [[tetrapod]]s), and [[mammary gland]]s and are [[endotherm]]s. Lagomorphs possess a moderately fused [[postorbital process]] to the [[cranium]], unlike other small mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wible|first=John R.|date=January 2007|title=On the Cranial Osteology of the Lagomorpha|journal=Bulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural History|volume=2007|issue=39|pages=213–234|doi=10.2992/0145-9058(2007)39[213:OTCOOT]2.0.CO;2|issn=0145-9058}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ in that they have a mixture of &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; physical traits.

===Differences between lagomorphs and other mammals===
Despite the evolutionary relationship between lagomorphs and rodents, the two orders have some major differences. One of the ways in which lagomorphs differ from rodents is that the former have four [[incisor]]s in the upper jaw (not two, as in the ''Rodentia''). Also, lagomorphs are almost strictly [[herbivorous]], unlike rodents, many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter. They are similar to rodents in that their incisor teeth grow continuously throughout their lives, thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Best, T.

Similarly to the rodents, [[bat]]s, and some mammalian [[insectivore]]s, they have a [[Gyrification|smooth-surfaced cerebrum]].&lt;ref name=Ferrer1986&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferrer, I., Fabregues, I. &amp; Condom, E. | year = 1986 | title = A Golgi study of the sixth layer of the cerebral cortex I: The lissencephalic brain of Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Chiroptera, and Insectivora | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 145 | url=http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1166506/pdf/janat00188-0215.pdf | pages = 217–234 | pmc=1166506 | pmid=3429306}}{{request quotation |date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- I didn't see anything about gross structure in the paper, only stuff about fine structure.

===Differences between families of lagomorphs===
Rabbits and hares move by jumping, pushing off with their strong hind legs and using their forelimbs to soften the impact on landing. Pikas lack certain skeletal modifications present in [[leporids]], such as a highly arched skull, an upright posture of the head, strong hind limbs and pelvic girdle, and long limbs.&lt;ref name=Britanniapika/&gt; Also, pikas have a short nasal region and entirely lack a [[supraorbital foramen]], while leporids have prominent supraorbital foramina and nasal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IUCN - Lagomorph specialist group|url = http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/who_we_are/ssc_specialist_groups_and_red_list_authorities_directory/mammals/lagomorph_specialist_group/|website = www.iucn.org|accessdate = 2015-08-18|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150803095103/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/who_we_are/ssc_specialist_groups_and_red_list_authorities_directory/mammals/lagomorph_specialist_group/|archivedate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pikas===
[[File:Pika.jpg|thumb|right|[[American pika]] in Alberta]]
[[Pika]]s, also known as conies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lagomorphs - EnchantedLearning.com|url = http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/mammals/lagomorphs/|website = www.enchantedlearning.com|accessdate = 2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; are entirely represented by the family Ochotonidae and are small mammals native to mountainous regions of western North America, and Central Asia. They are mostly about {{cvt|15|cm|0}} long and have greyish-brown, silky fur, small rounded ears, and almost no tail. Their four legs are nearly equal in length. Some species live in [[scree]], making their homes in the crevices between broken rocks, while others construct burrows in upland areas. The rock-dwelling species are typically long-lived and solitary, having one or two small litters each year contributing to stable populations. The burrowing species, in contrast, are short-lived, [[wiktionary:gregarious|gregarious]] and have multiple large litters during the year. These species tend to have large swings in population size. The gestation period of the pika is around one month long, and the newborns are altricial—they require parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/American-Pika|title=American Pika {{!}} National Wildlife Federation|website=National Wildlife Federation|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social behaviour of the two groups also differs: the rock dwellers aggressively maintain scent-marked territories, while the burrowers live in family groups, interact vocally with each other and defend a mutual territory. Pikas are diurnal and are active early and late in the day during hot weather. They feed on all sorts of plant material. As they do not hibernate, they make &quot;haypiles&quot; of dried vegetation which they collect and carry back to their homes to store for use during winter.&lt;ref name=Britanniapika&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/pika |title=Pika |author=Smith, Andrew T. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2020-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the mid-19th century, engineer [[Jules Dupuit]] first propounded the concept of economic surplus, but it was the economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who gave the concept its fame in the field of [[economics]].

On a standard [[supply and demand]] diagram, consumer surplus is the area (triangular if the supply and demand curves are linear) above the equilibrium price of the good and below the demand curve. This reflects the fact that consumers would have been willing to buy a single unit of the good at a price higher than the equilibrium price, a second unit at a price below that but still above the equilibrium price, etc., yet they in fact pay just the equilibrium price for each unit they buy.

Likewise, in the supply-demand diagram, producer surplus is the area below the equilibrium price but above the supply curve. This reflects the fact that producers would have been willing to supply the first unit at a price lower than the equilibrium price, the second unit at a price above that but still below the [[equilibrium price]], etc., yet they in fact receive the equilibrium price for all the units they sell.

==Consumer surplus==

Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they do pay. If a consumer is willing to pay more for a unit of a good than the current asking price, they are getting more benefit from the purchased product than they would if the price was their maximum willingness to pay. They are receiving the same benefit, the obtainment of the good, with a smaller cost as they are spending less than they would if they were charged their maximum willingness to pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slesnick 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | doi=10.1057/978-1-349-95121-5_626-2|chapter=Consumer Surplus|encyclopedia=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics| pages=1–7| year=2008| last1=Slesnick| first1=Daniel T.| isbn=978-1-349-95121-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a good with generally high consumer surplus is drinking water. People would pay very high prices for drinking water, as they need it to survive. The difference in the price that they would pay, if they had to, and the amount that they pay now is their consumer surplus. The utility of the first few litres of drinking water is very high (as it prevents death), so the first few litres would likely have more consumer surplus than subsequent litres.

The maximum amount a consumer would be willing to pay for a given quantity of a good is the sum of the maximum price they would pay for the first unit, the (lower) maximum price they would be willing to pay for the second unit, etc. Typically these prices are decreasing; they are given by the individual [[demand curve]], which must be generated by a rational consumer who maximizes utility subject to a budget constraint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slesnick 2008&quot;/&gt; Because the demand curve is downward sloping, there is diminishing marginal utility. Diminishing marginal utility means a person receives less additional utility from an additional unit. However, the price of a product is constant for every unit at the equilibrium price. The extra money someone would be willing to pay for the number units of a product less than the equilibrium quantity and at a higher price than the equilibrium price for each of these quantities is the benefit they receive from purchasing these quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp | title=What a Consumer Surplus Tells Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a given price the consumer buys the amount for which the consumer surplus is highest. The consumer's surplus is highest at the largest number of units for which, even for the last unit, the maximum willingness to pay is not below the [[market price]].

Consumer surplus can be used as a measurement of social welfare, first shown by Willig (1976). For a single price change, consumer surplus can provide an approximation of changes in welfare. With multiple price and/or income changes, however, consumer surplus cannot be used to approximate economic welfare because it is not single-valued anymore. More modern methods are developed later to estimate the welfare effect of price changes using consumer surplus.

The aggregate consumers' surplus is the sum of the consumer's surplus for all individual consumers. This can be represented graphically as shown in the above graph of the market demand and supply curves. It can also be said to be the maxim of satisfaction a consumer derives from particular goods and services.

===Calculation from supply and demand===
The consumer surplus (individual or aggregated) is the area under the (individual or aggregated) demand curve  and above a horizontal line at the actual price (in the aggregated case: the equilibrium price).  If the demand curve is a straight line, the consumer surplus is the area of a triangle:

:&lt;math&gt;CS = \frac{1}{2} Q_{\mathit{mkt}} \left( {P_{\mathit{max}} - P_{\mathit{mkt}}} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;mkt&lt;/sub&gt; is the equilibrium price (where supply equals demand), Q&lt;sub&gt;mkt&lt;/sub&gt; is the total quantity purchased at the equilibrium price and P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the price at which the quantity purchased would fall to 0 (that is, where the demand curve intercepts the price axis).   For more general demand and supply functions, these areas are not triangles but can still be found using [[integral]] calculus. Consumer surplus is thus the definite integral of the demand function with respect to price, from the market price to the maximum reservation price (i.e. the price-intercept of the demand function):

:&lt;math&gt;CS = \int^{P_{\mathit{max}}}_{P_{\mathit{mkt}}} D(P)\, dP, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D(P_{\mathit{max}}) = 0. &lt;/math&gt; This shows that if we see a rise in the equilibrium price and a fall in the equilibrium quantity, then consumer surplus falls.

===Calculation of a change in consumer surplus===

The change in consumer surplus is used to measure the changes in prices and income. The demand function used to represent an individual's demand for a certain product is essential in determining the effects of a price change. An individual's demand function is a function of the individual's income, the demographic characteristics of the individual, and the vector of commodity prices. When the price of a product changes, the change in consumer surplus is measured as the negative value of the integral from the original actual price (P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and the new actual price (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the demand for product by the individual. If the change in consumer surplus is positive, the price change is said to have increased the individuals welfare. If the price change in consumer surplus is negative, the price change is said to have decreased the individual's welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slesnick 2008&quot;/&gt;

=== Distribution of benefits when price falls ===

When supply of a good expands, the price falls (assuming the demand curve is downward sloping) and consumer surplus increases.  This benefits two groups of people: consumers who were already willing to buy at the initial price benefit from a price reduction, and they may buy more and receive even more consumer surplus; and additional consumers who were unwilling to buy at the initial price will buy at the new price and also receive some consumer surplus.

Consider an example of linear supply and demand curves.  For an initial supply curve S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, consumer surplus is the triangle above the line formed by price P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the demand line (bounded on the left by the price axis and on the top by the demand line).  If supply expands from S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the consumers' surplus expands to the triangle above P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and below the demand line (still bounded by the price axis).  The change in consumer's surplus is difference in area between the two triangles, and that is the consumer welfare associated with expansion of supply.

Some people were willing to pay the higher price P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  When the price is reduced, their benefit is the area in the rectangle formed on the top by P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, on the bottom by P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, on the left by the price axis and on the right by line extending vertically upwards from Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second set of beneficiaries are consumers who buy more, and new consumers, those who will pay the new lower price (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) but not the higher price (P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  Their additional consumption makes up the difference between Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Their consumer surplus is the triangle bounded on the left by the line extending vertically upwards from Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, on the right and top by the demand line, and on the bottom by the line extending horizontally to the right from P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rule of one-half ===
The '''rule of one-half''' estimates the change in consumer surplus for small changes in supply with a constant demand curve.  Note that in the special case where the consumer demand curve is linear, consumer surplus is the area of the triangle bounded by the vertical line Q=0, the horizontal line &lt;math&gt;P = P_{mkt}&lt;/math&gt; and the linear demand curve.  Hence, the change in consumer surplus is the area of the trapezoid with i) height equal to the change in price and ii) mid-segment length equal to the average of the ex-post and ex-ante equilibrium quantities.  Following the figure above,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta CS = \frac{1}{2} \left( {Q_1  + Q_0 } \right)\left( {P_0 - P_1} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* CS = consumers' surplus;
* Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are, respectively, the quantity demanded before and after a change in supply;
* P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are, respectively, the prices before and after a change in supply.

      <text bytes="28032" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|A fallacy of statistical reasoning typically used by a prosecutor to exaggerate the likelihood of a criminal defendant's guilt}} 
[[File:prosecutor_fallacy.svg|thumb|250px|A simple example illustrating the prosecutor's fallacy]]
The '''prosecutor's fallacy''' is a [[fallacy]] of statistical reasoning involving a test for an occurrence, such as a [[DNA profiling|DNA match]]. A positive result in the test may [[Paradox|paradoxically]] be more likely to be an [[Error|erroneous result]] than an actual occurrence, even if the test is very accurate. The fallacy is named because it is typically used by a prosecutor to exaggerate the [[likelihood]] of a criminal defendant's guilt. The fallacy can be used to support other claims as well – including the innocence of a defendant.

The following claim demonstrates the fallacy in the context of a prosecutor questioning an expert witness: &quot;the odds of finding this evidence on an innocent man are so small that the jury can safely disregard the possibility that this defendant is innocent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Norman|last2=Neil|first2=Martin|last3=Berger|first3=Daniel | date= June 2016 | title = Bayes and the Law|journal=Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application|volume=3|pages=51–77|doi=10.1146/annurev-statistics-041715-033428|pmc=4934658|pmid=27398389|bibcode=2016AnRSA...3...51F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim obscures that the likelihood of the defendant's innocence, given the evidence found on him, in fact depends on the likely quite high [[Prior probability|prior odds]] of the defendant being a random innocent person – as well as the stated low odds of finding the evidence on such a random innocent person, not to mention the underlying high odds that the evidence is indeed indicative of guilt.

At its heart, the fallacy involves assuming that the prior likelihood of a random match is [[Equality (mathematics)|equal to]] the likelihood that the defendant is innocent. For instance, if a perpetrator were known to have the same blood type as a defendant and 10% of the population to share that blood type, then one version of the prosecutor's fallacy would be to claim that on that basis alone the likelihood of the defendant's guilt is 90%. The actual likelihood would depend on the size of the population with a matching blood type and would likely be much lower.

==Concept==
The terms &quot;prosecutor's fallacy&quot; and [[#Defense_attorney's_fallacy|&quot;defense attorney's fallacy&quot;]] were originated by William C. Thompson and Edward Schumann in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;TS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1= W.C. |last1= Thompson |first2= E.L. |last2= Shumann |year= 1987 |title= Interpretation of Statistical Evidence in Criminal Trials: The Prosecutor's Fallacy and the Defense Attorney's Fallacy |journal= Law and Human Behavior |volume=2 |issue=3 |page= 167 |jstor= 1393631 |doi= 10.1007/BF01044641  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uctv.canterbury.ac.nz/viewfile.php/4/sharing/55/74/74/NZEPVersionofImpreciseProbabilitiespaperVersi.pdf |title= Ambiguity, the Certainty Illusion, and Gigerenzer's Natural Frequency Approach to Reasoning with Inverse Probabilities |first1= John |last1= Fountain |first2= Philip |last2= Gunby |date= February 2010 |publisher= [[University of Canterbury]] |page= 6 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fallacy can arise from ''multiple testing'', such as when evidence is compared against a large database.  The size of the database elevates the likelihood of finding a match by pure chance alone; i.e., DNA evidence is soundest when a match is found after a single directed comparison because the existence of matches against a large database where the test sample is of poor quality may be less unlikely by mere chance.

The basic fallacy results from misunderstanding [[conditional probability]] and neglecting the prior odds of a defendant being guilty before that evidence was introduced. When a [[prosecutor]] has collected some [[evidence (law)|evidence]] (for instance a [[DNA]] match) and has an expert testify that the [[probability]] of finding this evidence if the accused were innocent is tiny, the fallacy occurs if it is concluded that the probability of the accused being innocent must be comparably tiny. If the DNA match is used to confirm guilt which is otherwise suspected then it is indeed strong evidence.  However, if the DNA evidence is the sole evidence against the accused and the accused was picked out of a large database of DNA profiles, the odds of the match being made at random may be increased, and less damaging to the defendant. The odds in this scenario do not relate to the odds of being guilty, they relate to the odds of being picked at random. While the odds of being picked at random may be low for an individual condition implying guilt, i.e. a positive DNA match, the probability of being picked at random for ''any'' condition grows to 1 as more conditions are considered, as is the case in multiple testing. It is often the case that both innocence and guilt (i.e., accidental death and murder) are both highly improbable, though naturally one must be true, so the ratio of the likelihood of the &quot;innocent scenario&quot; to the &quot;guilty scenario&quot; is much more informative than the probability of the &quot;guilty scenario&quot; alone.

== Examples ==

===Conditional probability===

In the fallacy of '''argument from rarity''', an explanation for an observed event is said to be unlikely because the prior probability of that explanation is low. Consider this case: a lottery winner is accused of [[cheating]], based on the improbability of winning. At the trial, the prosecutor calculates the (very small) probability of winning the lottery without cheating and argues that this is the chance of innocence. The logical flaw is that the prosecutor has failed to account for the large number of people who play the lottery. While the probability of any singular person winning is quite low, the probability of any person winning the lottery, given the number of people who play it, is very high.

In '''[[Berkson's paradox]]''', [[conditional probability]] is mistaken for unconditional probability. This has led to several [[Type I error|wrongful]] convictions of British mothers, accused of murdering two of their children in infancy, where the primary evidence against them was the statistical improbability of two children dying accidentally in the same household (under &quot;[[Meadow's law]]&quot;). Though multiple accidental ([[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]]) deaths are rare, so are multiple murders; with only the facts of the deaths as evidence, it is the ratio of these (prior) improbabilities that gives the correct &quot;[[posterior probability]]&quot; of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/oct/28/uknews1 |title= Prosecuting and defending by numbers |first= Ben |last= Goldacre   |date= 2006-10-28 |work= [[The Guardian]]  |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |quote= rarity is irrelevant, because double murder is rare too. An entire court process failed to spot the nuance of how the figure should be used. Twice. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple testing===

In another scenario, a crime-scene [[DNA profiling|DNA sample]] is compared against a [[database]] of 20,000 men.  A match is found, that man is accused and at his trial, it is testified that the probability that two DNA profiles match by chance is only 1 in 10,000. This does not mean the probability that the suspect is innocent is 1 in 10,000.  Since 20,000 men were tested, there were 20,000 opportunities to find a match by chance.

Even if none of the men in the database left the crime-scene DNA, a match by chance to an innocent is more likely than not. The chance of getting at least one match among the records is:

: &lt;math&gt;1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{10000}\right)^{20000} \approx 86\%&lt;/math&gt;,
:where, explicitly:
::&lt;math&gt;1/10000&lt;/math&gt; = probability of two DNA profiles matching by chance, after one check,
::&lt;math&gt;(1 - 1/10000)&lt;/math&gt; = probability of not matching, after one check,
::&lt;math&gt;(1 - 1/10000)^{20000}&lt;/math&gt; = probability of not matching, after 20,000 checks, and
::&lt;math&gt;1 - (1 - 1/10000)^{20000}&lt;/math&gt; = probability of matching, after 20,000 checks.

So, this evidence alone is an uncompelling [[data dredging]] result. If the culprit ''were'' in the database then he and one or more other men would probably be matched; in either case, it would be a fallacy to ignore the number of records searched when weighing the evidence. [[DNA profiling#DNA databases|&quot;Cold hits&quot;]] like this on DNA databanks are now understood to require careful presentation as trial evidence.

Finding a person innocent or guilty can be viewed in mathematical terms as a form of [[binary classification]].
If ''E'' is the observed evidence, and ''I'' stands for &quot;accused is innocent&quot; then consider the [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]]: 
* ''P''(''E''|''I'') is the probability that the &quot;damning evidence&quot; would be observed even when the accused is innocent (a [[Type I and type II errors#Usage examples|&quot;false positive&quot;]]).
* ''P''(''I''|''E'') is the probability that the accused is innocent, despite the evidence ''E''.

With [[forensic evidence]], ''P''(''E''|''I'') is tiny. The prosecutor wrongly concludes that ''P''(''I''|''E'') is comparatively tiny. (The [[Lucia de Berk]] prosecution is accused of exactly this error,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1= Meester |first1= R. |last2= Collins |first2= M. |last3= Gill |first3= R. |last4= van Lambalgen |first4= M. |date= 2007-05-05   |title= On the (ab)use of statistics in the legal case against the nurse Lucia de B  |journal= Law, Probability &amp; Risk    |doi= 10.1093/lpr/mgm003  |arxiv= math/0607340   |quote= [page 11]  Writing E for the observed event, and H for the [[null hypothesis|hypothesis of chance]], Elffers calculated P('''E''' {{!}} H) &lt; 0.0342%, while the court seems to have concluded that P('''H''' {{!}} E) &lt;  0.0342% |volume= 5 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 233–250 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; for example.) In [[Bayesian inference|fact]], ''P''(''E''|''I'') and ''P''(''I''|''E'') are quite different; using [[Bayes' theorem]]:
: &lt;math&gt;P(I|E) = P(E|I) \cdot \frac{P(I) }{P(E)}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* ''P''(''I'') is the probability of innocence ''independent of the test result'' (i.e. from all other [[Admissible evidence|evidence]]) and
* ''P''(''E'') is the prior probability that the evidence would be observed (regardless of innocence).
This equation shows that a small &lt;math&gt;P(E|I)&lt;/math&gt; does not imply a small &lt;math&gt;P(I|E)&lt;/math&gt; in case of a large &lt;math&gt;P(I)&lt;/math&gt; and a small &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if the accused is otherwise likely to be innocent and it is unlikely for anyone (guilty or innocent) to exhibit the observed evidence.

Note that
: &lt;math&gt; P(E) = P(E|I) \cdot P(I) + P(E|\sim I) \cdot [1 - P(I)] &lt;/math&gt;
* ''P''(''E''|~''I'') is the probability that the evidence would identify a [[wiktionary:guilty|guilty]] suspect (not give a [[Type I and type II errors#False negative rate|false negative]]). This is usually close to 100%, slightly increasing the inference of innocence over a test with false negatives. That inequality is concisely expressed in terms of [[odds]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Odds}(I|E) \ge \operatorname{Odds}(I)\cdot P(E|I)   &lt;/math&gt;
The prosecutor is claiming a negligible chance of innocence, given the evidence, implying ''Odds''(''I''|''E'') -&gt; ''P''(''I''|''E''), or that:

: &lt;math&gt; P(I|E) \approx P(E|I)\cdot \operatorname{Odds}(I)   &lt;/math&gt;

A prosecutor conflating ''P''(''I''|''E'') with ''P''(''E''|''I'') makes a technical error whenever ''Odds''(''I'') ≫ 1. This may be a [[harmless error]] if ''P''(''I''|''E'') is still negligible, but it is especially [[mislead]]ing otherwise (mistaking low [[statistical significance]] for high [[Confidence (statistics)#Meaning of the term .22confidence.22|confidence]]).

Suppose there is a one-in-a-million chance of a match given that the accused is innocent. The prosecutor says this means there is only a one-in-a-million chance of innocence. But if everyone in a community of 10 million people is tested, one expects 10 matches even if all are innocent. The defense fallacy would be to reason that &quot;10 matches were expected, so the accused is no more likely to be guilty than any of the other matches, thus the evidence suggests a 90% chance that the accused is innocent.&quot; and &quot;As such, this evidence is irrelevant.&quot; The first part of the reasoning would be correct only in the case where there is no further evidence pointing to the defendant. On the second part, Thompson &amp; Schumann wrote that the evidence should still be highly [[Relevance (law)|relevant]] because it &quot;drastically narrows the group of people who are or could have been suspects, while failing to exclude the defendant&quot; (page 171).&lt;ref name=&quot;TS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1539107  |title= Interpretative Arguments of Forensic Match Evidence: An Evidentiary Analysis  |author= N.

Another way of saying this would be to point out that the defense attorney's calculation failed to take into account the prior probability of the defendant's guilt.  If, for example, the police came up with a list of 10 suspects, all of whom had access to the crime scene, then it would be very illogical indeed to suggest that a test that offers a one-in-a-million chance of a match would change the defendant's prior probability from 1 in 10 (10 percent) to 1 in a million (0.0001 percent).  If nine innocent people were to be tested, the likelihood that the test would ''incorrectly'' match one (or more) of those people can be calculated as&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 - ((1 - 1/1000000)^9)&lt;/math&gt;,
or approximately 0.0009%.  If, however, the other 9 suspects  were tested and did ''not'' return a match, then the probability of the defendant's guilt has increased from the prior probability of 10% (1 in 10 suspects) to 99.9991% on the basis of the test.  The defendant might argue that &quot;lists of suspects compiled by police fail to include the guilty person in 50% of cases&quot; — if that were true, then the defendant's guilt would have increased from the prior probability of 5% (50% of 10%) to 49.99955% on the basis of the test — in which case &quot;[[reasonable doubt]]&quot; could be claimed to exist despite the positive test result.

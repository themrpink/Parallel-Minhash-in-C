In 1742, the imperial government at Saint Petersburg ordered a Russian military expedition to conquer the [[Chukchis]] and [[Koryaks]], but the expedition failed and its commander, Major Dmitry Pavlutsky, was killed in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = A history of the peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colong 1581-1990 | first = James | last = Forsyth | page =146 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year =1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1747, a party of 500 Chukchi warriors raided the Russian stockade of [[Anadyrsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Empires Apart: A History of American and Russian Imperialism |last=Landers |first=Brian |year=2010 |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781605981062 |chapter=To the Little Bighorn and Anadyrsk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1750, it had become clear the Chukchi would be difficult to conquer. The Empress then changed her tactical approach and established a formal peace with them.

===Construction projects===

[[File:1 Rouble à l'effigie d'Élisabeth Ire de Russie.jpg|thumb|Coin of Elizabeth of Russia, whose beneficial but numerous buildings required heavy taxation.]]

Elizabeth enjoyed and excelled in architecture, overseeing and financing many construction projects during her reign. One of the many projects from the Italian architect [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] was the reconstruction of [[Peterhof Palace]], adding several wings between 1745 and 1755. Her most famous creations were the [[Winter Palace]], though she died before its completion, and the [[Smolny Convent]]. The Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows, including bureaucratic offices and the Imperial Family's living quarters arranged in two enfilades, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. Regarding the latter building, Robert Nisbet Bain stated that &quot;No other Russian sovereign ever erected so many churches.&quot;{{sfn|Bain|1899|p=138}}

The expedited completion of buildings became a matter of importance to the Empress and work continued throughout the year, even in winter's severest months. 859,555 [[ruble]]s had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a [[tax]] on [[state property|state-owned]] taverns, but work temporaly ceased due to lack of resources. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to completely fund the extra costs. However, Elizabeth's incredible extravagance ended up greatly benefiting the country's [[infrastructure]]. Needing goods shipped from all over the world, numerous [[road]]s in all Russia were modernized at her orders.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=148}}

===Selection of an heir===
[[File:Donationsurkunde B. von Campenhausen.jpg|thumb|Elisabeth's donation to the Russian lieutenant general Balthasar Freiherr von [[Campenhausen]], 27 May 1756]]
As an unmarried and childless empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth to find a legitimate heir to secure the [[Romanov dynasty]]. She chose her nephew, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter of Holstein-Gottorp]]. {{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=103}} The young Peter had lost his mother at three months old and his father at the age of eleven. Elizabeth invited her young nephew to Saint Petersburg, where he was received into the [[Orthodox Church]] and proclaimed the heir to the throne on 7 November 1742.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=110}} Keen to see the dynasty secured, Elizabeth immediately gave Peter the best Russian tutors and settled on [[Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst|Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst]] as a bride for her heir. Incidentally, Sophie's mother, [[Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]], was a sister of Elizabeth's own fiancé, who had died before the wedding. On her conversion to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Sophie was given the name Catherine in memory of Elizabeth's mother. The marriage took place on 21 August 1745. Nine years later a son, the future [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], was born on 20 September 1754.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=119}}

There is considerable speculation as to the actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested that he was not Peter's son at all but that his mother had engaged in an affair, to which Elizabeth had consented, with a young officer, [[Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov]], who would have been Paul's biological father.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=108}} Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone but himself but took no interest in parenthood. Elizabeth most certainly took an active interest and acted as if she were his mother, instead of Catherine.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=111}} The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her, and Catherine did not see her child for another month, for a short churching ceremony. Six months later, Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had, in effect, become a ward of the state and, in a larger sense, the property of the state.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=112}}

==Foreign policy==
[[File:Europe 1740 en.png|thumb|Map of European political borders in 1740]]
===Bestuzhev===
Elizabeth abolished the cabinet council system that had been used under Anna, and reconstituted the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] as it had been under Peter the Great with the chiefs of the departments of state (none of them Germans) attending. Her first task after this was to address the war with [[Sweden]]. On 23 January 1743 direct negotiations between the two powers were opened at [[Turku|Åbo (Turku)]]. In the [[Treaty of Åbo]], on 7 August 1743 (O.S.), Sweden ceded to Russia all of southern [[Finland]] east of the [[Kymmene River]], which became the boundary between the two states. The treaty also gave Russia the fortresses of [[Villmanstrand]] and [[Hamina|Fredrikshamn]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}

This triumphant result can be credited to the diplomatic ability of the new vice chancellor, [[Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]]. His policies would have been impossible without her support.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=57}} Elizabeth had wisely placed Bestuzhev at the head of foreign affairs immediately after her accession. He represented the anti-Franco-Prussian portion of her council, and his object was to bring about an Anglo-Austro-Russian alliance which, at that time, was undoubtedly the most advantageous to Russia. Hence the bogus [[Lopukhina Conspiracy]] and other attempts of [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] to get rid of Bestuzhev failed, but it put the Russian court into the centre of a tangle of intrigue during the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign).{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}
[[Image:Elizabenois.jpg|thumb|''Promenade of Elizaveta Petrovna through the streets of Saint Petersburg'' (1903), watercolour by [[Alexandre Benois]]]]

Ultimately, the minister's strong support from Elizabeth prevailed.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=57}} His faultless diplomacy, and an auxiliary Russian corps of 30,000 men sent to the [[Rhine]], greatly accelerated the peace negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] (18 October 1748). By sheer tenacity of purpose, Bestuzhev had extricated his country from the Swedish imbroglio; reconciled his imperial mistress with the courts of [[Vienna]] and London; enabled Russia to assert herself effectually in [[Poland]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Sweden]]; and isolated the King of [[Prussia]] by forcing him into hostile alliances. All this would have been impossible without the steady support of Elizabeth who trusted him completely in spite of the Chancellor's many enemies, most of whom were her personal friends.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}

However, on 14 February 1758, Bestuzhev was removed from office. The future Catherine II recorded, &quot;He was relieved of all his decorations and rank, without a soul being able to reveal for what crimes or transgressions the first gentleman of the Empire was so despoiled, and sent back to his house as a prisoner.&quot; No specific crime was ever pinned on Bestuzhev. Instead, it was inferred that he had attempted to sow discord between the Empress and her heir and his consort. Enemies of the pro-Austrian Bestuzhev were his rivals; the Shuvalov family, Vice-Chancellor [[Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]], and the French ambassador.{{sfn|Rounding|2006|pp=118–119}}

===Seven-Years War===
[[File:Elizaveta with Black Servant by Grooth (1743, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth on horseback while being attended by a page.]]
The great event of Elizabeth's later years was the [[Seven Years' War]]. Elizabeth regarded the [[Convention of Westminster]] (16 January 1756) in which [[Great Britain]] and [[Prussia]] agreed to unite their forces to oppose the entry of or the passage through [[Germany]] of troops of every foreign power, as utterly subversive of the previous conventions between Great Britain and Russia. Elizabeth sided against Prussia over a personal dislike of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]].{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=107}} She wanted him reduced within proper limits so that he might no longer be a danger to the empire. Elizabeth acceded to the [[Treaty of Versailles (1757)|Second Treaty of Versailles]], thus entering into an alliance with France and [[Austria]] against Prussia. On 17 May 1757 the Russian army, 85,000 strong, advanced against [[Königsberg]].{{sfn|Hoetzsch|1966|}}

The serious illness of the Empress, which began with a fainting-fit at [[Tsarskoe Selo]] (19 September 1757), the fall of Bestuzhev (21 February 1758) and the cabals and intrigues of the various foreign powers at [[Saint Petersburg]], did not interfere with the progress of the war. The crushing defeat of [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]] (12 August 1759){{sfn|Hoetzsch|1966|p=93}} at last brought Frederick to the verge of ruin. From that day, he despaired of success, but he was saved for the moment by the jealousies of the Russian and Austrian commanders, which ruined the military plans of the allies.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}

From the end of 1759 to the end of 1761, the firmness of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force that held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view, her greatness as a stateswoman consisted of her steady appreciation of Russian interests and her determination to promote them against all obstacles. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future and that the only way to do so was to reduce him to the rank of a [[Prince-Elector]].{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}

Frederick himself was quite aware of his danger. &quot;I'm at the end of my resources,&quot; he wrote at the beginning of 1760. &quot;The continuance of this war means for me utter ruin. Things may drag on perhaps till July, but then a catastrophe must come.&quot; On 21 May 1760, a fresh convention was signed between Russia and Austria, a secret clause of which, never communicated to the court of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], guaranteed [[East Prussia]] to Russia as an indemnity for war expenses. The failure of the campaign of 1760, wielded by the inept [[Count Buturlin]], induced the court of Versailles on the evening of 22 January 1761 to present to the court of Saint Petersburg a dispatch to the effect that the king of France, by reason of the condition of his dominions, absolutely desired peace. The Russian empress' reply was delivered to the two ambassadors on 12 February. It was inspired by the most uncompromising hostility towards the king of Prussia. Elizabeth would not consent to any pacific overtures until the original object of the league had been accomplished.{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=284}}

Simultaneously, Elizabeth had conveyed to [[Louis XV]] a confidential letter in which she proposed the signature of a new treaty of alliance of a more comprehensive and explicit nature than the preceding treaties between the two powers without the knowledge of Austria. Elizabeth's object in the mysterious negotiation seems to have been to reconcile France and Great Britain, in return for which signal service France was to throw all her forces into the German war. This project, which lacked neither ability nor audacity, foundered upon Louis XV's invincible jealousy of the growth of Russian influence in [[Eastern Europe]] and his fear of offending the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. It was finally arranged by the allies that their envoys at [[Paris]] should fix the date for the assembling of a peace congress and that in the meantime, the war against Prussia should be vigorously prosecuted. In 1760 a Russian [[flying column]] briefly occupied [[Berlin]]. Russian victories placed Prussia in serious danger.{{sfn|Hoetzsch|1966|p=93}}

The campaign of 1761 was almost as abortive as the campaign of 1760. Frederick acted on the defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian fortress of [[Kolberg]] on Christmas Day 1761, by [[Rumyantsev]], was the sole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to [[Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein]], &quot;We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies&quot;, which meant, if words mean anything, that he was resolved to seek a soldier's death on the first opportunity. A fortnight later, he wrote to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, &quot;The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear fellow. I have received the news of a great event.&quot; The [[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]] that snatched him from destruction was the death of the Russian empress, on 5 January 1762 ([[Gregorian calendar|N.S.]]).{{sfn|Hoetzsch|1966|p=93}}

==Court==

[[File:Elizabeth of Russia's departure.jpg|thumb|Departure of Elizabeth from [[Anichkov Palace]].]]
Elizabeth's court was one of the most splendid in all Europe.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=107}} As historian [[Mikhail Shcherbatov]] stated, the court was &quot;arrayed in cloth of gold, her nobles satisfied with only the most luxurious garments, the most expensive foods, the rarest drinks, that largest number of servants and they applied this standard of lavishness to their dress as well&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;j&quot;&gt;&quot;The Iron-Fisted Fashionista&quot; Russian Life Nov.-Dec. 2009 by Lev Berdnikov, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt; A great number of silver and gold objects were produced, the most the country had seen thus far in its history.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=164}} It was common to order over a thousand bottles of French champagnes and wines to be served at one event and to serve pineapple at all receptions, despite the difficulty of procuring the fruit in such quantities.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=134}}

French plays quickly became the most popular and often were performed twice a week. In tandem, music became very important.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=160}} Many attribute its popularity to Elizabeth's supposed husband, the &quot;Emperor of the Night&quot;, Alexei Razumovsky, who reportedly relished music.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=160}} Elizabeth spared no expense in importing leading musical talents from Germany, France and Italy.{{sfn|Bain|1899|p=151}} She reportedly owned 15,000 dresses, several thousand pairs of shoes and a seemingly unlimited number of stockings.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=107}}

Attractive in her youth and vain as an adult, Elizabeth passed various decrees intended to make herself stand out: she issued an [[Sumptuary_law|edict]] against anyone wearing the same hairstyle, dress, or accessory as the Empress. One woman accidentally wore the same item as the Empress and was lashed across the face for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;&gt;'The Iron-Fisted Fashionista' Russian Life Nov.-
Dec. 2009 by Lev Berdnikov, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Another law required French fabric salesmen to sell to the Empress first, and those who disregarded that law were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; One famous story exemplifying her vanity is that once Elizabeth got a bit of powder in her hair and was unable to remove it except by cutting a patch of her hair. She made all of the Court ladies cut patches out of their hair too, which they did &quot;with tears in their eyes&quot;.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2001|p=24}} That aggressive vanity became a tenet of the court throughout her reign, particularly as she grew older. According to the historian [[Tamara Talbot Rice]], &quot;Later in life her outbursts of anger were directed either against people who were thought to have endangered Russia's security or against women whose beauty rivaled her own&quot;.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=148}}

Despite her volatile, often violent reactions regarding her appearance, Elizabeth was ebullient in most other matters, particularly when it came to Court entertainment. It is reported that she threw two balls a week. One would be a large event with an average of 800 guests in attendance, most of whom were the nation's leading merchants, members of the lower nobility and guards stationed in and around the city of the event. The other ball was a much smaller affair reserved for her closest friends and members of the highest echelons of nobility.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=135}} The smaller gatherings began as masked balls but evolved into the famous Metamorphoses balls by 1744.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=136}} At these Metamorphoses balls, guests were expected to dress as the opposite sex, with Elizabeth often dressing up as Cossack or carpenter in honour of her father.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=136}} The costumes not permitted at the event were those of pilgrims and harlequins, which she considered profane and indecent, respectively.{{sfn|Bain|1899|p=154}} Most courtiers thoroughly disliked the balls since most looked ridiculous, but Elizabeth adored them. As Catherine the Great's advisor Potemkin posited, she adored them because she was &quot;the only woman who looked truly fine and completely a man.... As she was tall and possessed a powerful body, male attire suited her&quot;.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2001|p=26}} [[Kazimierz Waliszewski]] noted that Elizabeth had beautiful legs and loved to wear male attire because of the tight trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Waliszewski &quot;La Dernière Des Romanov, Élisabeth Ire, Impératrice De Russie, 1741–1762&quot;. Plon-Nourrit et cie, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the balls were by far her most personally beloved and lavish events, Elizabeth often threw children's birthday parties and wedding receptions for those affiliated with her Court, going so far as to provide [[dowry|dowries]] for each of her ladies-in-waiting.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=138}}

==Death==
In the late 1750s, Elizabeth's health started to decline. She suffered a series of [[dizzy spell]]s and refused to take the prescribed medicines. The Empress forbade the word &quot;death&quot; in her presence until {{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=109}} she suffered a stroke on December 24, 1761 (O.S.). Knowing that she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying and to say farewell to those few people who wished to be with her, including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and [[Kirill Razumovsky]].{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=193}}
 
The Empress died the next day, [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] Christmas, 1761.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=193}} For her [[lying in state]], she was dressed in a shimmering silver dress. It was said that she was beautiful in death as she had been in life. She was buried in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] in Saint Petersburg on 3 February 1762 (O.S.) six weeks later after her laying in state.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=109}}

'''Commodus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ə|d|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/commodus &quot;Commodus&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 31 August 161 – 31 December 192) was [[Roman emperor]] jointly with his father [[Marcus Aurelius]] from 176 until his father's death in 180, and solely until 192. His reign is commonly considered to mark the end of the golden period of peace in the history of the Roman Empire known as the [[Pax Romana]].

He accompanied his father, Marcus, during the [[Marcomannic Wars]] in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. He was made the youngest [[Roman consul|consul]] in Roman history in 177 and elevated to co-''[[Augustus (title)|augustus]]'' with his father, having been given the title ''[[imperator]]'' in 176.

During his solo reign, the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but intrigues and conspiracies abounded, leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a god-like [[personality cult]], with him performing as a [[gladiator]] in the [[Colosseum]]. His assassination in 192 marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]]. He was succeeded by [[Pertinax]], the first emperor in the tumultuous [[Year of the Five Emperors]].

==Early life and rise to power (161–180)==
===Early life===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:Bust of Commodus 180-192 AD.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A bust of Commodus as a youth ([[Roman-Germanic Museum]], Cologne).]]}}
Commodus was born on 31 August AD{{nbsp}}161 in [[Lanuvium]], near [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HA LOC 1&quot;&gt;''Historia Augusta – Life of Commodus'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the reigning emperor, [[Marcus Aurelius]], and Aurelius's first cousin, [[Faustina the Younger]], the youngest daughter of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], who had died only a few months before. Commodus had an elder twin brother, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, who died in 165. On 12 October 166, Commodus was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] together with his younger brother, [[Marcus Annius Verus Caesar|Marcus Annius Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 12.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;David 1&quot;&gt;David L. Vagi ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' Vol. One: History p.248&lt;/ref&gt; The latter died in 169 having failed to recover from an operation, which left Commodus as Marcus Aurelius's sole surviving son.&lt;ref name=&quot;David 1&quot;/&gt;

He was looked after by his father's physician, [[Galen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SPM&quot;&gt;Susan P. Mattern ''The Prince of Medicine: Galen in the Roman Empire'' p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 71.33.1&lt;/ref&gt; who treated many of Commodus' common illnesses. Commodus received extensive tutoring by a multitude of teachers with a focus on intellectual education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 197&quot;&gt;Anthony R Birley ''Marcus Aurelius: A Biography'' p.197&lt;/ref&gt; Among his teachers, Onesicrates, Antistius Capella, [[Titus Aius Sanctus]], and Pitholaus are mentioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birley 197&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodus is known to have been at [[Carnuntum]], the headquarters of Marcus Aurelius during the [[Marcomannic Wars]], in 172. It was presumably there that, on 15 October 172, he was given the [[victory title]] ''[[Germanicus (disambiguation)|Germanicus]]'', in the presence of the [[Roman army|army]]. The title suggests that Commodus was present at his father's victory over the [[Marcomanni]]. On 20 January 175, Commodus entered the [[College of Pontiffs]], the starting point of a career in public life.

In April 175, [[Avidius Cassius]], Governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], declared himself Emperor following rumours that Marcus Aurelius had died. Having been accepted as Emperor by Syria, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], Cassius carried on his rebellion even after it had become obvious that Marcus was still alive. During the preparations for the campaign against Cassius, Commodus assumed his [[toga virilis]] on the [[Danube|Danubian]] front on 7 July 175, thus formally entering [[adulthood]]. Cassius, however, was killed by one of his [[centurion]]s before the campaign against him could begin.

Commodus subsequently accompanied his father on a lengthy trip to the Eastern provinces, during which he visited [[Antioch]]. The Emperor and his son then traveled to [[Athens]], where they were initiated into the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. They then returned to Rome in the [[autumn]] of 176.

===Joint rule with father (176–180)===
[[File:L%27Image et le Pouvoir - T%C3%AAte de Crispine 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Head of Bruttia Crispina]]
Marcus Aurelius was the first emperor since [[Vespasian]] to have a legitimate biological son and, though he himself was the fifth in the line of the so-called [[Five Good Emperors]], each of whom had adopted his successor, it seems to have been his firm intention that Commodus should be his heir. Commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor &quot;[[born in the purple]],&quot; meaning during his father's reign.{{cn|date=September 2020}} On 27 November 176, Marcus Aurelius granted Commodus the rank of ''[[Imperator]]''  and, in the middle of 177, the title ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', giving his son the same status as his own and formally sharing power.

On 23 December 176, the two ''imperatores'' celebrated a joint [[Roman triumph|triumph]], and Commodus was given [[tribune|tribunician]] power. On 1 January 177, Commodus became [[consul]] for the first time, which made him, aged 15, the youngest consul in Roman history up to that time. He subsequently married [[Bruttia Crispina]] before accompanying his father to the Danubian front once more in 178. Marcus Aurelius died there on 17 March 180, leaving the 18-year-old Commodus sole emperor.

==Solo reign (180–192)==
Upon his ascension, Commodus devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He reduced the weight of the [[denarius]] from 96 per [[Roman pound]] to 105 per Roman pound (3.85&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.35&amp;nbsp;grams).&lt;!-- Note, weights are per pound, so larger numbers are lower weight --&gt; He also reduced the silver purity from 79&amp;nbsp;percent to 76&amp;nbsp;percent&amp;nbsp;– the silver weight dropping from 2.57&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.34&amp;nbsp;grams. In 186 he further reduced the purity and silver weight to 74&amp;nbsp;percent and 2.22&amp;nbsp;grams respectively, being 108 to the Roman pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|title=Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reduction of the denarius during his rule was the largest since the empire's first devaluation during [[Nero]]'s reign.

Whereas the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] had been marked by almost continuous warfare, Commodus' rule was comparatively peaceful in the military sense, but was also characterised by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of [[Dio Cassius]], his accession marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his notoriety, and considering the importance of his reign, Commodus' years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are [[Herodian]], Dio Cassius (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer, [[Senator of Rome|Senator]] during Commodus' reign, but his reports for this period survive only as fragments and abbreviations), and the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' (untrustworthy for its character as a work of literature rather than history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it may well be embroidering upon what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).

[[File:Commodus denier verso ag1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[denarius]] featuring Commodus. Inscription: TR. P. VIII, IMP. VI, COS. IIII, P. P. – S. C.]]
Commodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180. Unlike the preceding Emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and Marcus Aurelius, he seems to have had little interest in the business of administration and tended throughout his reign to leave the practical running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning with [[Saoterus]], a freedman from [[Nicomedia]] who had become his [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner. Nevertheless, though the [[Roman Senate|senatorial order]] came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign, not least because of his lavish shows of largesse (recorded on his coinage) and because he staged and took part in spectacular [[gladiator]]ial combats.

One of the ways he paid for his donatives (imperial handouts) and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'') is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').

===Conspiracies of 182===

At the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 18, inherited many of his father's senior advisers, notably [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus]] (the second husband of Commodus' eldest sister [[Lucilla]]), his father-in-law [[Gaius Bruttius Praesens]], [[Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio]], and [[Gaius Aufidius Victorinus|Aufidius Victorinus]], who was [[Praefectus urbi|Prefect of the City of Rome]]. He also had four surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Lucilla was over ten years his senior and held the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]] as the widow of her first husband, [[Lucius Verus]].

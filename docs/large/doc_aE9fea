In any case, Malraux's participation in events such as the Spanish Civil War has tended to distract attention from his important literary achievement. Malraux saw himself first and foremost as a writer and thinker (and not a &quot;man of action&quot; as biographers so often portray him) but his extremely eventful life – a far cry from the stereotype of the French intellectual confined to his study or a Left Bank café – has tended to obscure this fact. As a result, his literary works, including his important works on the theory of art, have received less attention than one might expect, especially in Anglophone countries.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Malraux joined the [[French Army]]. He was captured in 1940 during the [[Battle of France]] but escaped and later joined the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 278–287&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he was captured by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 328–332&lt;/ref&gt; He later commanded the [[Brigade Alsace-Lorraine]] in defence of [[Strasbourg]] and in the attack on [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 340–349&lt;/ref&gt;

André's half-brother, Claude, a [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) agent, was also captured by the Germans, and executed at [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;see French version of Wikipedia entry: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Malraux&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Abetz]] was the German Ambassador, and produced a series of &quot;black lists&quot; of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. [[Louis Aragon]] and André Malraux were both on these &quot;Otto Lists&quot; of forbidden authors.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Malraux was awarded the ''[[Médaille de la Résistance]]'' and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]. The British awarded him the [[Distinguished Service Order]], for his work with British liaison officers in [[Corrèze]], Dordogne and [[Lot (department)|Lot]]. After Dordogne was liberated, Malraux led a battalion of former resistance fighters to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where they fought alongside the [[First Army (France)|First Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7792088|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Malraux, Andre|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, he worked on his last novel, ''The Struggle with the Angel'', the title drawn from the story of the Biblical [[Jacob]]. The manuscript was destroyed by the Gestapo after his capture in 1944. A surviving first section, titled ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.

===After the war===

Mrs. Kennedy described Malraux as &quot;the most fascinating man I've ever talked to&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/us/12jackie.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | first=Janny | last=Scott | title=In Oral History, Jacqueline Kennedy Speaks Candidly After the Assassination | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Shortly after the war, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] appointed Malraux as his Minister for Information (1945–1946). Soon after, he completed his first book on art, ''The Psychology of Art'', published in three volumes (1947–1949). The work was subsequently revised and republished in one volume as ''The Voices of Silence'' (''Les Voix du Silence''), the first part of which has been published separately as ''The Museum without Walls''. Other important works on the theory of art were to follow. These included the three-volume ''Metamorphosis of the Gods'' and ''Precarious Man and Literature'', the latter published posthumously in 1977. In 1948, Malraux married a second time, to [[Marie-Madeleine Lioux]], a concert pianist and the widow of his half-brother, Roland Malraux. They separated in 1966. Subsequently, Malraux lived with [[Louise de Vilmorin]] in the Vilmorin family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but mordant tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu. Her most famous novel was ''Madame de...'', published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film ''[[The Earrings of Madame de…]]'' (1953), directed by Max Ophüls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin's other works included ''Juliette'', ''La lettre dans un taxi'', ''Les belles amours'', ''Saintes-Unefois'', and ''Intimités''. Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. After Louise's death, Malraux spent his final years with her relative, Sophie de Vilmorin.

In 1957, Malraux published the first volume of his trilogy on art entitled ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods''. The second two volumes (not yet translated into English) were published shortly before he died in 1976. They are entitled ''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'' and discuss artistic developments from the Renaissance to modern times. Malraux also initiated the series ''[[Arts of Mankind]]'', an ambitious survey of world art that generated more than thirty large, illustrated volumes.

When de Gaulle returned to the French presidency in 1958, Malraux became France's first [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]], a post he held from 1958 to 1969. On 7 February 1962, Malraux was the target of an assassination attempt by the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS), which set off a bomb to his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target, but did leave a four-year-old girl who was living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Todd ''The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008 page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Malraux was a lukewarm supporter of de Gaulle's decision to grant [[Évian Accords|independence to Algeria]], but the OAS was not aware of this, and had decided to assassinate Malraux as a high-profile minister.

Among many initiatives, Malraux launched an innovative (and subsequently widely imitated) program to clean the blackened façades of notable French buildings, revealing the natural stone underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian.  Entry for AM in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' (Oxford, 2004).  Accessed on 6/28/11 at: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andre_Malraux.aspx#4&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a number of ''maisons de la culture'' in provincial cities and worked to preserve France's national heritage by promoting [[industrial archaeology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 557&lt;/ref&gt; An intellectual who took the arts very seriously, Malraux saw his mission as Culture Minister to preserve France's heritage and to improve the cultural levels of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 556-557&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's efforts to promote French culture mostly concerned renewing old or building new libraries, art galleries, museums, theatres, opera houses, and ''maisons de la culture'' (centres built in provincial cities that were a mixture of a library, art gallery and theatre).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Film, television and music took less of Malraux's time, and the changing demographics caused by immigration from the Third World stymied his efforts to promote French high culture, as many immigrants from Muslim and African nations did not find French high culture that compelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; A passionate bibliophile, Malraux built up a huge collections of books both as a cultural minister for the nation and as a man for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was an outspoken supporter of the Bangladesh liberation movement during the 1971 [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]] and despite his age seriously considered joining the struggle. When [[Indira Gandhi]] came to Paris in November 1971, there was extensive discussion between them about the situation in Bangladesh.

During this post-war period, Malraux published a series of semi-autobiographical works, the first entitled ''Antimémoires'' (1967). A later volume in the series, ''Lazarus'', is a reflection on death occasioned by his experiences during a serious illness. ''La Tête d'obsidienne'' (1974) (translated as ''Picasso's Mask'') concerns Picasso, and visual art more generally. In his last book, published posthumously in 1977, ''L'Homme précaire et la littérature'', Malraux propounded the theory that there was a ''bibliothèque imaginaire'' where writers created works that influenced subsequent writers much as painters learned their craft by studying the old masters; once they have understood the work of the old masters, writers would sally forth with the knowledge gained to create new works that added to the growing and never-ending  ''bibliothèque imaginaire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; An elitist who appreciated what he saw as the high culture of all the nations of the world, Malraux was especially interested in art history and archaeology, and saw his duty as a writer to share what he knew with ordinary people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; An aesthete, Malraux believed that art was spiritually enriching and necessary for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 557-558&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Malraux died in [[Créteil]], near Paris, on 23 November 1976 from a lung embolism. He was a heavy smoker and had cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/24/archives/andre-malraux-75-dies-in-paris-writer-war-hero-de-gaulle-aide-andre.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (Essonne) cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to French culture, his ashes were moved to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris during 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of his death.

There is now a large and steadily growing body of critical commentary on Malraux's literary ''œuvre'', including his very extensive writings on art. Unfortunately, some of his works, including the last two volumes of ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods'' (''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'') are not yet available in English translation.  Malraux's works on the theory of art contain a revolutionary approach to art that challenges the Enlightenment tradition that treats art simply as a source of &quot;aesthetic pleasure&quot;. However, as French writer [[André Brincourt]] has commented, Malraux's books on art have been &quot;skimmed a lot but very little read&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art, Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; (this is especially true in Anglophone countries) and the radical implications of his thinking are often missed. A particularly important aspect of Malraux's thinking about art is his explanation of the capacity of art to transcend time. In contrast to the traditional notion that art endures because it is timeless (&quot;eternal&quot;), Malraux argues that art lives on through metamorphosis – a process of resuscitation (where the work had fallen into obscurity) and transformation in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan.

[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|A set with upper bounds and its least upper bound]]
In mathematics, particularly in [[order theory]], an '''upper bound''' or '''majorant'''&lt;ref name=schaefer/&gt; of a [[subset]] {{mvar|S}} of some [[Preorder|preordered set]] {{math|(''K'', ≤)}} is an element of {{mvar|K}} which is [[greater than or equal to]] every element of {{mvar|S}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLane-Birkhoff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/upper-bound.html|title=Upper Bound Definition (Illustrated Mathematics Dictionary)|website=www.mathsisfun.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a '''lower bound''' or '''minorant''' of {{mvar|S}} is defined to be an element of {{mvar|K}} which is less than or equal to every element of {{mvar|S}}. 
A set with an upper (respectively, lower) bound is said to be '''bounded from above''' or '''majorized'''&lt;ref name=schaefer/&gt; (respectively '''bounded from below''' or '''minorized''') by that bound. 
The terms '''bounded above''' ('''bounded below''') are also used in the mathematical literature for sets that have upper (respectively lower) bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UpperBound.html|title=Upper Bound|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Examples ==

For example, {{math|5}} is a lower bound for the set {{math|1=''S'' = {{mset|5, 8, 42, 34, 13934}}}} (as a subset of the [[integers]] or of the [[real numbers]], etc.), and so is {{math|4}}. On the other hand, {{math|6}} is not a lower bound for {{mvar|S}} since it is not smaller than every element in {{mvar|S}}.

The set {{math|1=''S'' = {{mset|42}}}} has {{math|42}} as both an upper bound and a lower bound; all other numbers are either an upper bound or a lower bound for that {{mvar|S}}.

Every subset of the [[natural number]]s has a lower bound since the natural numbers have a least element (0 or 1, depending on convention). An infinite subset of the natural numbers cannot be bounded from above. An infinite subset of the [[integer]]s may be bounded from below or bounded from above, but not both. An infinite subset of the [[rational number]]s may or may not be bounded from below, and may or may not be bounded from above.

Every finite subset of a non-empty [[totally ordered set]] has both upper and lower bounds.

==Bounds of functions==

The definitions can be generalized to [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and even to sets of functions.

Given a function {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}} with [[Domain of a function|domain]] {{mvar|D}} and a preordered set {{math|(''K'', ≤)}} as [[codomain]], an element {{mvar|''y''}} of {{mvar|K}} is an upper bound of {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}} if {{math|''y'' ≥ {{italics correction|''f''}}(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|D}}. The upper bound is called ''[[Mathematical jargon#sharp|sharp]]'' if equality holds for at least one value of {{mvar|x}}. It indicates that the constraint is optimal, and thus cannot be further reduced without invalidating the inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#sharp|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon — Sharp|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, function {{mvar|g}} defined on domain {{mvar|D}} and having the same codomain {{math|(''K'', ≤)}} is an upper bound of {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}}, if {{math|''g''(''x'') ≥ {{italics correction|''f''}}(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|D}}. Function {{mvar|g}} is further said to be an upper bound of a set of functions, if it is an upper bound of ''each'' function in that set.

The notion of lower bound for (sets of) functions is defined analogously, by replacing ≥ with  ≤.

==Tight bounds==

An upper bound is said to be a ''tight upper bound'', a ''least upper bound'', or a ''[[supremum]]'', if no smaller value is an upper bound. Similarly, a lower bound is said to be a ''tight lower bound'', a ''greatest lower bound'', or an ''[[infimum]]'', if no greater value is a lower bound.

The '''Gloster Meteor''' was the first British [[jet fighter]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only [[jet aircraft]] to achieve combat operations during the Second World War. The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking [[turbojet]] engines, pioneered by [[Frank Whittle]] and his company, [[Power Jets|Power Jets Ltd]]. Development of the aircraft began in 1940, although work on the engines had been under way since 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with [[No. 616 Squadron RAF]]. The Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in its aerodynamics, but proved to be a successful combat fighter. Gloster's 1946 civil Meteor F.4 demonstrator ''G-AIDC'' was the first [[Aircraft registration|civilian-registered]] jet aircraft in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%200497.html|title=gloster meteor – 1974 – 0497 – Flight Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major variants of the Meteor incorporated technological advances during the 1940s and 1950s. Thousands of Meteors were built to fly with the RAF and other air forces and remained in use for several decades.

The Meteor saw limited action in the Second World War. Meteors of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) fought in the [[Korean War]]. Several other operators such as Argentina, Egypt and Israel flew Meteors in later regional conflicts. Specialised variants of the Meteor were developed for use in photographic [[aerial reconnaissance]] and as [[night fighter]]s.

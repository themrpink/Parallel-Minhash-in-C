====''Star Trek: Phase II''====
The ''[[Star Trek: Phase II (fan series)|Star Trek: Phase II]]'' [[Star Trek fan productions|fan production]], originally titled ''Star Trek: New Voyages'', portrays the further voyages of the original ''Enterprise'' crew. The series' creators feel that &quot;Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest should be treated as 'classic' characters like [[Willy Loman]] from ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', [[Gandalf]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' or even [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], [[Othello (character)|Othello]] or [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]]. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/faq.html |title=Star Trek: Phase II About |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120055134/http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/faq.html |archivedate=November 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Cawley]] played Kirk in most of the ten episode ''Phase II'' series from its beginning in 2004 before replacing himself with actor Brian Gross. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' observes that while Cawley's depiction &quot;lacks Shatner's vulnerability&quot;, the actor has enough swagger &quot;to be passable in the role&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired3&quot; /&gt; Cawley's portrayal was well-known enough at Paramount that a group of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' writers called for Cawley's attention at a science fiction convention by shouting &quot;Hey, Kirk!&quot; at him while Shatner sat nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired3&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |page=3 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/startrek.html?pg=3 |magazine=Wired |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=December 2005 |accessdate=January 13, 2009|title=To Boldly Go Where No Fan Has Gone Before}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |page=2 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/startrek.html?pg=2 |magazine=Wired |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=December 2005 |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |title=To Boldly Go Where No Fan Has Gone Before}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Star Trek Continues''====
First produced in 2013, the 11 episode series ''[[Star Trek Continues]]'' also looked to chronicle the &quot;lost seasons&quot; of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''. The series developer and producer is popular anime voice actor [[Vic Mignogna]], who also plays the role of Kirk. Rounding out the core cast is fellow voice actor [[Todd Haberkorn]] as Spock,  [[Chris Doohan]] (son of the original Scotty actor [[James Doohan]]) as Scotty, and as McCoy first author-producer [[Larry Nemecek]], followed by voice actor [[Chuck Huber]]. It also co-stars [[Grant Imahara]] (''[[MythBusters]]'') as Sulu.

The first episode, &quot;[[Pilgrim of Eternity]]&quot; (with [[Michael Forest]] reprising his role as Apollo from the original series episode &quot;[[Who Mourns for Adonais?]]&quot;) was released in 2013. The second episode, &quot;[[Lolani]]&quot; (featuring guest star [[Lou Ferrigno]]), was released in February 2014, and a third episode, &quot;[[Fairest of Them All]]&quot; was released in June 2014 and won a [[Burbank International Film Festival]] award for &quot;Best New Media – Drama&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Plait, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/06/07/_star_trek_continues_fan_made_episodes_carry_on_on_the_five_year_mission.html The Trek Continues], ''Slate'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startrekcontinues.com/about-us/ &quot;About Us&quot; page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120202930/http://www.startrekcontinues.com/about-us/ |date=November 20, 2013 }}, official website for ''Star Trek Continues''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trekmovie.com/2012/06/19/first-look-and-details-for-star-trek-continues-fan-production/ Exclusive: First Look And Details For ‘Star Trek: Continues’ Fan Series] review, June 19, 2012, terkmovie.com website. accessed 11/26/13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek Continues'' also won a Geekie Award for &quot;Best Web Series&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegeekieawards.com/the-2014-geekie-awards-nominees/ |title=The 2014 Geekie Awards Winners &amp; Nominees |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=The Geekie Awards |accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2015, Episode 4 of the series was posted and titled &quot;White Iris&quot;.

The '''mesosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|s|oʊ|s|f|ɪər}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mesos'', &quot;middle&quot;) is the third layer of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], directly above the [[stratosphere]] and directly below the [[thermosphere]]. In the mesosphere, [[temperature]] decreases as [[altitude]] increases. This characteristic is used to define its limits: it begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the [[stratopause]]), and ends at the [[mesopause]], which is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere with temperatures below {{cvt|-143|C|F K}}. The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season (higher in winter and at the tropics, lower in summer and at the poles), but the lower boundary is usually located at altitudes from {{cvt|50|to|65|km|mi ft}} above the Earth's surface and the upper boundary (the mesopause) is usually around {{cvt|85|to|100|km|mi ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/atmosphere/middle-atmosphere|title=Middle atmosphere|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkat Ratnam|first=M.|last2=Patra|first2=A.

The stratosphere and the mesosphere are sometimes collectively referred to as the &quot;middle atmosphere&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://atmos.washington.edu/academic/midatmos.html|title=Middle Atmosphere Meteorology|website=atmos.washington.edu|access-date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spans altitudes approximately between 12 and 80&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface. The [[mesopause]], at an altitude of {{cvt|80|–|90|km|mi}}, separates the mesosphere from the [[thermosphere]]—the second-outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere. This is the [[turbopause]], below which different chemical species are well-mixed due to turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform because the [[scale height]]s of different chemical species differ according to their [[molecular mass]]es.

The term '''near space''' is also sometimes used to refer to altitudes within the mesosphere. This term does not have a technical definition, but typically refers to the region of the atmosphere up to {{cvt|100|km|mi ft}}, roughly between the [[Armstrong limit]] (above which humans require a [[pressure suit]] in order to survive) and the [[Kármán line]] (where [[astrodynamics]] must take over from [[aerodynamics]] in order to achieve flight); or, by another definition, to the range of altitudes above which commercial [[airliner]]s fly but below which [[satellite]]s orbit the Earth. Some sources distinguish between the terms &quot;near space&quot; and &quot;upper atmosphere&quot;, so that only the layers closest to the Kármán line are described as &quot;near space&quot;.

==Temperature==
Within the mesosphere, [[temperature]] decreases with increasing [[height]], due to decreasing absorption of solar radiation by the rarefied atmosphere and increasing cooling by [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[radiative emission]]. The top of the mesosphere, called the [[mesopause]], is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=mesosphere|file=M03855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as {{convert|-101|C|K F|sigfig=3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mesosphere (Wayback Machine Archive)|url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information ProgGFKDamme (UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]])|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701030705/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html|archivedate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; varying according to [[latitude]] and [[season]].

==Dynamic features==
The main most important features in this region are strong zonal (East-West) winds, [[atmospheric tide]]s, internal atmospheric gravity waves (commonly called &quot;[[gravity waves]]&quot;), and [[planetary wave]]s. Most of these tides and waves start in the [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]], and propagate to the mesosphere. In the mesosphere, gravity-wave amplitudes can become so large that the waves become unstable and dissipate. This dissipation deposits momentum into the mesosphere and largely drives global circulation. This helps the Earth.

[[Noctilucent cloud]]s are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the [[ionosphere]] known as the ''D layer'', which is only present during the day when some [[ionization]] occurs with [[nitric oxide]] being ionized by [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and ion form back into a neutral molecule. The mesosphere has been called the &quot;ignorosphere&quot; because it is poorly studied relative to the stratosphere (which can be accessed with high-altitude balloons) and the thermosphere (in which satellites can orbit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-06-atmosphere_x.htm|title=Upper atmosphere may hold clues in Columbia mystery|date=6 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|5|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} deep [[sodium layer]] is located between {{convert|80|-|105|km|abbr=on|mi ft}}. Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the [[airglow]]. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create &quot;guide stars&quot; as part of the [[adaptive optics|adaptive optical correction process]] used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]&lt;/ref&gt; Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Beginning in October 2018,&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;dunes&quot; were first spotted by photographers in Finland and Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; a distinct type of [[aurora]] has been identified, originating in the mesosphere. Often referred to as 'dunes' due to their resemblance to sandy ripples on a beach, the green undulating lights extend toward the equator. They have been identified as originating about {{convert|96|km|abbr=on|mi ft}} above the surface. Since auroras are caused by ultra-high-speed solar particles interacting with atmospheric molecules, the green color of these dunes has tentatively been explained by the interaction of those solar particles with oxygen molecules. The dunes therefore occur where mesospheric oxygen is more concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-type-aurora-ripples-across-sky-horizontal-green-dunes-180974083/?spMailingID=41658140&amp;spUserID=NzQwNDUzNzY2MzMS1&amp;spJobID=1682695015&amp;spReportId=MTY4MjY5NTAxNQS2 Wu, Katherine J.

[[Image:EarthAtmosphereBig.jpg|thumb|80px|right|Earth atmosphere diagram showing all the layers of the atmosphere to scale]]

The '''thermosphere''' is the layer in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] directly above the [[mesosphere]] and below the [[exosphere]]. Within this layer of the atmosphere, [[ultraviolet radiation]] causes [[photoionization]]/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions; the thermosphere thus constitutes the larger part of the [[ionosphere]]. Taking its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] θερμός (pronounced ''thermos'') meaning heat, the thermosphere begins at about 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi) above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Duxbury &amp; Duxbury. Introduction to the World's Oceans. 5ed. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to [[molecular mass]] (see [[turbosphere]]). Thermospheric [[temperature]]s increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic [[solar radiation]]. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 1,700&amp;nbsp;°C (3,100&amp;nbsp;°F)&lt;ref&gt;The temperature at which iron melts&lt;/ref&gt; or more. Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged particles, enabling [[radio wave]]s to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon. In the exosphere, beginning at about 600&amp;nbsp;km (375&amp;nbsp;mi) above sea level, the atmosphere turns into [[outer space|space]], although, by the judging criteria set for the definition of the [[Kármán line]], the thermosphere itself is part of space.

The highly attenuated gas in this layer can reach {{convert|2500|C|F}} during the day. Despite the high temperature, an observer or object will experience cold temperatures in the thermosphere, because the extremely low density of the gas (practically a hard [[vacuum]]) is insufficient for the molecules to conduct heat. A normal [[thermometer]] will read significantly below {{convert|0|C|F}}, at least at night, because the energy lost by thermal radiation would exceed the energy acquired from the atmospheric gas by direct contact. In the [[anacoustic zone]] above {{convert|160|km|mi}}, the density is so low that molecular interactions are too infrequent to permit the transmission of sound. 
 
The dynamics of the thermosphere are dominated by [[atmospheric tide]]s, which are driven predominantly by [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal heating]]. Atmospheric waves dissipate above this level because of collisions between the neutral gas and the ionospheric plasma.

The thermosphere is completely uninhabited with the exception of the International Space Station. The [[International Space Station]] orbits the Earth within the middle of the thermosphere, between {{convert|408|and|410|km|mi}}. 

==Neutral gas constituents==
It is convenient  to separate the atmospheric regions  according to the two temperature minima at about 12&amp;nbsp;km altitude (the [[tropopause]]) and at about 85&amp;nbsp;km (the [[mesopause]]) (Figure 1). The thermosphere (or the upper atmosphere) is the height region above 85&amp;nbsp; km, while the region between the tropopause and the mesopause is the middle atmosphere ([[stratosphere]] and [[mesosphere]]) where absorption of solar UV radiation generates the temperature maximum near 45&amp;nbsp; km altitude and causes the [[ozone]] layer.
[[File:Nomenclature of Thermosphere.jpg|thumb|500px|Figure 1. Nomenclature of atmospheric regions based on the profiles of electric conductivity (left), temperature (middle), and electron number density in m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;(right)]]
 
The density of the Earth's atmosphere decreases nearly exponentially with altitude. The total mass of the atmosphere  is M = ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; H&amp;nbsp; ≃ 1&amp;nbsp;kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within a column of one square centimeter above the ground (with ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.29&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the atmospheric density on the ground at z = 0 m altitude, and H ≃ 8&amp;nbsp;km the average atmospheric [[scale height]]). 80% of that mass is concentrated within the [[troposphere]]. The mass of the thermosphere above about 85&amp;nbsp;km is only 0.002% of the total mass. Therefore, no significant energetic feedback from the thermosphere to the lower atmospheric regions can be expected.

Turbulence causes the air within the lower atmospheric regions below the [[turbopause]] at about 110&amp;nbsp; km to be a mixture of gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29&amp;nbsp;g/mol with molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the two dominant constituents. Above the turbopause, however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its barometric height structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituent's atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above about 200&amp;nbsp; km altitude and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity.  The ratio
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O which is a measure of the electron density at the ionospheric F region is highly affected by these variations.&lt;ref&gt;Prölss, G.W., and M. K.  Bird, &quot;Physics of the Earth's Space Environment&quot;, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These changes follow from the diffusion of the minor constituents through the major gas component during dynamic processes.

The thermosphere contains an appreciable concentration of elemental [[sodium]] located in a 10-km thick band that occurs at the edge of the mesosphere, 80 to 100&amp;nbsp; km above Earth's surface. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimeter. This band is regularly replenished by sodium sublimating from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create &quot;[[Laser_guide_star|guide stars]]&quot; as part of the optical correction process in producing ultra-sharp ground-based observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-52/issue-07/features/adaptive-optics-eso-s-very-large-telescope-sees-four-times-first-laser-light.html Martin Enderlein et al., ''ESO's Very Large Telescope sees four times first light'', Laser Focus World, July 2016, pp. 22-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy input==

===Energy budget===
The thermospheric temperature can be determined from density observations as well as from direct satellite measurements. The temperature vs. altitude z in Fig. 1 can be simulated by the so-called [[David Bates (physicist)|Bates]] profile:&lt;ref&gt;Rawer, K., Modelling of neutral and ionized atmospheres, in Flügge, S. (ed): Encycl. Phys., '''49/7''', Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) {{pad|4em}} &lt;math&gt;T = T_\infty - (T_\infty- T_0) e^{ -s(z - z_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

with  T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; the exospheric temperature above about 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude, 
T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 355&amp;nbsp;K, and z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 120&amp;nbsp;km reference temperature and height, and s an empirical parameter depending on T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; and decreasing with T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. That formula is derived from a simple equation of heat conduction. One estimates a total heat input of q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;≃ 0.8 to 1.6&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; above z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude. In order to obtain equilibrium conditions, that heat input q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; above z&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is lost to the lower atmospheric regions by heat conduction.

The exospheric temperature T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is a fair measurement of the solar XUV radiation. Since solar radio emission F at 10.7&amp;nbsp; cm wavelength is a good indicator of solar activity, one can apply the empirical formula for quiet magnetospheric conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hedin&quot;&gt;Hedin, A.E., A revised thermospheric model based on the mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter data: MSIS-83 J. Geophys. Res., '''88''', 10170, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

with T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; in K, F&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; in 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (the Covington index) a value of F averaged over several solar cycles.  The Covington index varies typically between 70 and 250 during a solar cycle, and never drops below about 50. Thus, T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; varies between about 740 and 1350&amp;nbsp;K. During very quiet magnetospheric conditions, the still continuously flowing magnetospheric energy input contributes by about 250&amp;nbsp; K to the residual temperature of 500&amp;nbsp; K in eq.(2). The rest of 250&amp;nbsp; K in eq.(2) can be attributed to atmospheric waves generated within the troposphere and dissipated within the lower thermosphere.

===Solar XUV radiation===
The solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) at wavelengths &lt; 170&amp;nbsp; nm is almost completely absorbed within the thermosphere. This radiation causes the various [[ionospheric layer]]s as well as a temperature increase at these heights (Figure 1).
While the solar visible light (380 to 780&amp;nbsp; nm) is nearly constant with the variability of not more than about 0.1% of the [[solar constant]],&lt;ref&gt;Willson, R.C., Measurements of the solar total irradiance and its variability, Space Sci. Rev., '''38''', 203, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; the solar XUV radiation is highly variable in time and space. For instance, X-ray bursts associated with [[solar flares]] can dramatically increase their intensity over preflare levels by many orders of magnitude over some time of tens of minutes. In the extreme ultraviolet, the Lyman α line at 121.6&amp;nbsp;nm represents an important source of [[ionization]] and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] at ionospheric D layer heights.&lt;ref&gt;Brasseur, G., and S. Salomon, &quot;Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere&quot;, Reidel Pub., Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; During quiet periods of [[solar activity]], it alone contains more energy than the rest of the XUV spectrum. Quasi-periodic changes of the order of 100% or greater, with periods of 27 days and 11 years, belong to the prominent variations of solar XUV radiation. However, irregular fluctuations over all time scales are present all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidtke, G., Modelling of the solar radiation for aeronomical applications, in Flügge, S. (ed), Encycl. Phys. ''49/7'', Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 1&lt;/ref&gt; During the low solar activity, about half of the total energy input into the thermosphere is thought to be solar XUV radiation. That solar XUV energy input occurs only during daytime conditions, maximizing at the equator during [[equinox]].

===Solar wind===
The second source of energy input into the thermosphere is [[solar wind]] energy which is transferred to the [[magnetosphere]] by mechanisms that are not well understood. One possible way to transfer energy is via a hydrodynamic dynamo process. Solar wind particles penetrate the polar regions of the magnetosphere where the [[geomagnetic field]] lines are essentially vertically directed. An electric field is generated, directed from dawn to dusk. Along the last closed geomagnetic field lines with their footpoints within the [[auroral]] zones, field-aligned electric currents can flow into the [[ionospheric dynamo region]] where they are closed by electric [[Pedersen current|Pedersen]] and [[Hall current]]s. [[Ohm]]ic losses of the Pedersen currents heat the lower thermosphere (see e.g., [[Magnetospheric electric convection field]]). Also, penetration of high energetic particles from the magnetosphere into the auroral regions enhance drastically the electric conductivity, further increasing the electric currents and thus [[Joule heating]]. During the quiet magnetospheric activity, the magnetosphere contributes perhaps by a quarter to the thermosphere's energy budget.&lt;ref&gt;Knipp, D.J., W.K. Tobiska, and B.A. Emery, Direct and indirect thermospheric heating source for solar cycles, Solar Phys., ''224'', 2506, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 250&amp;nbsp; K of the exospheric temperature in eq.(2). During the very large activity, however, this heat input can increase substantially, by a factor of four or more. That solar wind input occurs mainly in the auroral regions during both day and night.

===Atmospheric waves===
Two kinds of large-scale atmospheric waves within the lower atmosphere exist internal waves with finite vertical wavelengths which can transport wave energy upward; and external waves with infinitely large wavelengths that cannot transport wave energy.&lt;ref name=VollandTP&gt;Volland, H., &quot;Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves&quot;, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atmospheric gravity wave]]s and most of the [[atmospheric tides]] generated within the troposphere belong to the internal waves. Their density amplitudes increase exponentially with height so that at the mesopause these waves become turbulent and their energy is dissipated (similar to breaking of ocean waves at the coast), thus contributing to the heating of the thermosphere by about 250&amp;nbsp; K in eq.(2). On the other hand, the fundamental diurnal tide labeled (1, −2) which is most efficiently excited by solar irradiance is an external wave and plays only a marginal role within the lower and middle atmosphere. However, at thermospheric altitudes, it becomes the predominant wave. It drives the electric Sq-current within the [[ionospheric dynamo region]] between about 100 and 200&amp;nbsp; km height.

Heating, predominately by tidal waves, occurs mainly at lower and middle latitudes. The variability of this heating depends on the meteorological conditions within the troposphere and middle atmosphere, and may not exceed about 50%.

==Dynamics==
[[File:Thermospherewaves.jpg|thumb|500px|Figure 2. Schematic meridian-height cross-section of circulation of (a) symmetric wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), (b) of antisymmetric wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), and (d) of symmetric diurnal wind component (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 3 h and 15 h local time. Upper right pannel (c) shows the horizontal wind vectors of the diurnal component in the northern hemisphere depending on local time.]]
Within the thermosphere above about 150&amp;nbsp; km height, all atmospheric waves successively become external waves, and no significant vertical wave structure is visible. The atmospheric wave modes degenerate to the [[spherical harmonics|spherical functions]] P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; with m a meridional [[wave number]] and n the zonal [[wave number]] (m = 0: zonal mean flow; m = 1: diurnal tides; m = 2: semidiurnal tides; etc.). The thermosphere becomes a damped oscillator system with low-pass filter characteristics. This means that smaller-scale waves (greater numbers of (n,m)) and higher frequencies are suppressed in favor of large-scale waves and lower frequencies. If one considers very quiet magnetospheric disturbances and a constant mean exospheric temperature (averaged over the sphere), the observed temporal and spatial distribution of the exospheric temperature distribution can be described by a sum of spheric functions:&lt;ref&gt;Köhnlein, W., A model of thermospheric temperature and composition, Planet. Space Sci. '''28''', 225, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) {{pad|4em}} &lt;math&gt;T(\varphi, \lambda, t) = T_\infty \{ 1 + \Delta T_2^0 P_2^0(\varphi) + \Delta T_1^0 P_1^0(\varphi) \cos [ \omega_a (t - t_a) ] + \Delta T_1^1 P_1^1(\varphi) \cos (\tau - \tau_d) + \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, it is φ latitude, λ longitude, and t time, ω&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; the [[angular frequency]] of one year,  ω&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; the angular frequency of one solar day, and τ =  ω&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;t + λ  the local time. t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = June 21 is the date of northern summer solstice, and τ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 15:00 is the local time of maximum diurnal temperature.

The first term in (3) on the right is the global mean of the exospheric temperature (of the order of 1000&amp;nbsp; K). The second term [with P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5(3 sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(φ)−1)] represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops with the wind toward the poles in the upper level and winds away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the summer hemisphere and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the winter hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Its relative  amplitude is of the order ΔT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant diurnal wave (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150&amp;nbsp;K. Additional terms (e.g.,  semiannual, semidiurnal terms, and higher-order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hedin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Zahn, U., et al., ESRO-4 model of global thermospheric composition and temperatures during low solar activity, Geophy. Res. Lett., ''4'', 33, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermospheric storms==
In contrast to solar XUV radiation, magnetospheric disturbances, indicated on the ground by geomagnetic variations, show an unpredictable impulsive character, from short periodic disturbances of the order of hours to long-standing giant storms of several days' duration. The reaction of the thermosphere to a large magnetospheric storm is called a thermospheric storm. Since the heat input into the thermosphere occurs at high latitudes (mainly into the auroral regions), the heat transport is represented by the term P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; in eq.(3) is reversed. Also, due to the impulsive form of the disturbance, higher-order terms are generated which, however, possess short decay times and thus quickly disappear. The sum of these modes determines the &quot;travel time&quot; of the disturbance to the lower latitudes, and thus the response time of the thermosphere with respect to the magnetospheric disturbance. Important for the development of an [[ionospheric storm]] is the increase of the ratio N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O  during a thermospheric storm at middle and higher latitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prölss&quot;&gt;Prölss, G.W., Density perturbations in the upper atmosphere caused by dissipation of solar wind energy, Surv. Geophys., ''32'', 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An increase of  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases the loss process of the ionospheric plasma and causes therefore a decrease of the electron density within the ionospheric F-layer (negative ionospheric storm).

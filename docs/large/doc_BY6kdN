In 1948, [[Reginald Bassett]] published an essay disputing the claim that Baldwin &quot;confessed&quot; to putting party before country and claimed that Baldwin was referring to 1933 and 1934 when a general election on rearmament would have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Bassett, 'Telling the truth to the people: the myth of the Baldwin 'confession',' ''Cambridge Journal'', II (1948), pp. 84–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, [[G. M. Young]] published an authorised biography of Baldwin that asserted that Baldwin united the nation and helped moderate the policies of the Labour Party. However, Young accepted the chief criticisms of Baldwin that he failed to rearm early enough and that he put party before country. Young contends that Baldwin should have retired in 1935. Churchill and Beaverbrook deemed several passages in the biography to be defamatory of their own actions and threatened to sue if they were not removed or altered. A settlement was reached to remove the offending sentences, and the publisher [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] had the &quot;hideously expensive&quot; job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hart-Davis |first= Rupert |title= Halfway to Heaven: Concluding memoirs of a literary life |orig-year= First ed. published |year= 1998 |publisher= Sutton |location= Stroud Gloucestershire |isbn= 978-0-7509-1837-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/halfwaytoheavenc0000hart/page/38 38] |url= https://archive.org/details/halfwaytoheavenc0000hart/page/38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Young's biography, [[D. C. Somervell]] published ''Stanley Baldwin: An examination of some features of Mr. G. M. Young's biography'' in 1953 with a foreword by [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]]. This attempted to defend Baldwin against the charges made by Young. Both Young and Somervell were criticised by [[C. L. Mowat]] in 1955, who claimed that they both failed to rehabilitate Baldwin's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mowat, 'Baldwin Restored?', ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (June 1955), pp. 169–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Baldwin's son [[Arthur Baldwin, 3rd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|A. W. Baldwin]] published a biography entitled ''My Father: The True Story''. It has been written that his son &quot;evidently could not decide whether he was answering the charge of inanition and deceit which grew out of the war, or the radical &quot;dissenters&quot; of the early 1930s who thought the Conservatives were warmongers and denounced them for rearming at all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara C. Malament, 'Baldwin Re-restored?', ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 44, No. 1 (Mar. 1972), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article written to commemorate the centenary of Baldwin's birth, in ''[[The Spectator]]'' (&quot;Don't Let's Be Beastly to Baldwin&quot;, 14 July 1967), [[Rab Butler]] defended Baldwin's moderate policies and claimed that it helped heal social divisions. In 1969 the first major biography of Baldwin appeared, of over 1,000 pages, written by [[Keith Middlemas]] and John Barnes, both Conservatives who wished to defend Baldwin.

In 1998, historian [[Andrew Thorpe]] wrote that apart from the questions of war and peace, Baldwin had a mixed reputation. He was moved by social deprivation but not to the point of legislation and systematically avoided intervention in the economy and social system. He had a ruthless style that included insincerity. His advisors were second rank figures like Davidson and Bridgeman. Thorpe wrote, &quot;Essentially, Baldwin was a much more neurotic and insecure character than his public persona would have suggested&quot;, as shown by his nervous breakdown in 1936 that kept him out of action for three months. On the other hand, Thorpe says that Baldwin was a good co-ordinator of his coalition who did not block colleagues who proposed various small reforms.

Thorpe argued that Baldwin's handling of the 1926 general strike was &quot;firm and uncompromising&quot; but disliked the harsh Trade Disputes Act that followed because it was too far to the right of Baldwin's preferred moderation. Thorpe praised Baldwin's handling of the Abdication Crisis in 1936, which allowed Baldwin to leave office in a blaze of glory. Thorpe said that Baldwin often lacked drive and was too easily depressed, too pessimistic and too neglectful of foreign affairs. On the other hand, he achieved his primary goals of preserving capitalism, maintaining the parliamentary system and strengthening the Conservative Party as a leading opponent of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thorpe, &quot;Stanley Baldwin, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley.&quot; in ''Biographical Dictionary of British Prime Ministers'' (1998) pp 278–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Philip Williamson (historian)|Philip Williamson]] published a collection of essays on Baldwin that attempted to explain his beliefs and defended his policies as prime minister. Baldwin's defenders argued that with pacifist appeasement the dominant political view in Britain, France and the United States, he felt he could not start a programme of rearmament without a national consensus on the matter. Williamson argued that Baldwin had helped create &quot;a moral basis for rearmament in the mid 1930s&quot; that contributed greatly to &quot;the national spirit of defiance after Munich&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williamson, ''Stanley Baldwin. Conservative Leadership and National Values'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson admitted that there was a clear postwar consensus that repudiated and denigrated all interwar governments: Baldwin was targeted with the accusation that he had failed to rearm Britain in the 1930s, despite Hitler's threat. Williamson said that the negative reputation was chiefly the product of partisan politics, the bandwagon of praise for Churchill, selective recollections, and the need for scapegoats to blame for Britain's very close call in 1940. Only during the 1960s would political distance and then the opening of government records lead to more balanced historical assessments, but the myth had become so central to larger myths about the 1930s and 1940s that it persists as conventional wisdom about the period.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williamson, &quot;Baldwin's Reputation: Politics and History, 1937–1967,&quot; ''Historical Journal'' (Mar 2004) 47#1 pp 127–168&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, Ball could report, &quot;The pendulum has swung almost completely towards a positive view.&quot; Ball noted, &quot;Baldwin is now seen as having done more than most and perhaps as much as was possible in the context, but the fact remains that it was not enough to deter the aggressors or ensure their defeat. Less equivocal was his rediscovery as a moderate and inclusive Conservative for the modern age, part of a '[[One nation conservatism|one nation tradition]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart_Ball&quot; /&gt;

'''James Longstreet''' (January 8, 1821{{spaced ndash}}January 2, 1904) was one of the foremost [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]]s of the [[American Civil War]] and the principal subordinate to General [[Robert E. Lee]], who called him his &quot;[[Horses in warfare|Old War Horse]]&quot;. He served under Lee as a [[Corps#United States|corps]] commander for most of the famous battles fought by the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], and briefly with [[Braxton Bragg]] in the [[Army of Tennessee]] in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]].

After graduating from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], Longstreet served in the [[Mexican–American War]]. He was wounded in the thigh at the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], and afterward married his first wife, Louise Garland. Throughout the 1850s, he served on frontier duty in the [[American Southwest]]. In June 1861, Longstreet resigned his U.S. Army commission and joined the Confederate Army. He commanded Confederate troops during an early victory at [[Battle of Blackburn's Ford|Blackburn's Ford]] in July and played a minor role at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].

Longstreet made significant contributions to several important Confederate victories, mostly in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at [[Battle of Seven Pines|Seven Pines]] by accidentally marching his men down the wrong road, causing them to be late in arrival, but played an important role in the success of the [[Seven Days Battles]] in the summer of 1862, where he helped supervise repeated attacks which drove the Union army away from the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]. Longstreet's most controversial service was at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks on Union forces, including the disastrous [[Pickett's Charge]]. Afterwards, Longstreet was, at his own request, sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], which carried the day. Afterwards, his performance in semiautonomous command during the [[Knoxville Campaign]] resulted in a Confederate defeat. Longstreet's tenure in the Western Theater was marred by his central role in numerous conflicts amongst Confederate generals. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and the [[Appomattox Campaign]].

Longstreet enjoyed a successful post-war career working for the U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and his cooperation with his old friend, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], as well as critical comments he wrote about Lee's wartime performance, made him [[anathema]] to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-[[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] [[White League]] at the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] in 1874. Authors of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.

==Early life==
===Boyhood===
James Longstreet was born on January 8, 1821 in [[Edgefield Historic District (Edgefield, South Carolina)|Edgefield District]], [[South Carolina]],{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=19}} an area that is now part of North Augusta, [[Edgefield County, South Carolina|Edgefield County]]. He was the fifth child and third son of James Longstreet (1783-1833), of Dutch descent, and Mary Ann Dent (1793-1855) of English descent, originally from New Jersey and Maryland respectively, who owned a cotton plantation close to where the village of [[Gainesville, Georgia|Gainesville]] would be founded in northeastern Georgia. James's ancestor Dirck Stoffels Langestraet immigrated to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colony of [[New Netherland]] in 1657, but the name became Anglicized over the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Longstreet wrote in his memoirs, p. 13, that &quot;It is difficult to determine whether the name sprang from France, Germany, or Holland.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; James's father was impressed by his son's &quot;rocklike&quot; character on the rural plantation, giving him the nickname [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and he was known as Pete or Old Pete for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=19-22}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=13}}{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1213}}

Longstreet's father decided on a military career for his son, but felt that the local education available to him would not be adequate preparation. At the age of nine, James was sent to live with his aunt Frances Eliza and uncle [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]]. James spent eight years on his uncle's plantation, Westover, just outside the city while he attended the [[Academy of Richmond County]]. His father died from a [[cholera]] epidemic while visiting Augusta in 1833. Although James's mother and the rest of the family moved to [[Somerville, Alabama]], following his father's death, James remained with uncle Augustus.{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1213}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=22-26}} As a boy, Longstreet enjoyed swimming, hunting, fishing, and riding horses. He became adept at shooting firearms. Northern Georgia was very rural frontier territory during Longstreet's boyhood, and Southern genteel traditions had not yet taken hold. As a result, Longstreet's manners were sometimes rather rough. He dressed unceremoniously and at times used coarse language, although not in the presence of women. In his old age, Longstreet described his aunt and uncle as caring and loving.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=2-3}} He made no known political statements before the war and seemed largely uninterested in politics. But Augustus, as a lawyer, judge, newspaper editor, and [[Methodist]] minister, was a man of some political prominence, and was a fierce [[states' rights]] partisan who supported South Carolina during the [[Nullification Crisis]]. It is considered likely that Longstreet was exposed to these ideas while living with him.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=3}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=24-25}} Augustus was also known for drinking whiskey and playing card games even though many Americans in this era considered them to be immoral, habits he passed on to Longstreet.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=3}}

===West Point and early military service===
In 1837, Augustus attempted to obtain an appointment for his nephew to the [[United States Military Academy]], but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled. Therefore, Longstreet was appointed in 1838 by a relative, [[Reuben Chapman]], who represented the First District of Alabama, where Mary Longstreet lived. Longstreet was a poor student.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=26-29}} By his own admission in his memoirs, he &quot;had more interest in the school of the soldier, horsemanship, exercise, and the outside game of foot-ball than in the academic courses&quot;.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=15}} He ranked in the bottom third of every subject during his four years at the academy. In January of his third year, Longstreet initially failed his mechanics exam, but took a second test two days later and passed. Longstreet's engineering instructor in his fourth year was [[Dennis Hart Mahan]], a man who stressed swift maneuvering, protection of interior lines, and positioning troops in strategic points rather than attempting to destroy the enemy's army outright. Although Longstreet earned modest grades in the course, his behavior during the Civil War followed similar tactics. In the end, Longstreet ranked 54th out of 56 cadets when he was graduated in 1842.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=30}}

Longstreet was also a disciplinary problem at West Point. He earned a large number of demerits, especially in his final two years. His offenses included visiting after taps, absence at roll call, an untidy room, long hair, causing a disturbance during study time, and disobeying orders. Biographer [[Jeffry D. Wert]] says, &quot;Longstreet was neither a model student nor a gentleman.&quot;{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=30-31}} He was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including [[George Henry Thomas]], [[William Rosecrans]] (his West Point roommate), [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], [[D. H. Hill]], [[Lafayette McLaws]], [[George Pickett]], and [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who was of the Class of 1843. Longstreet was commissioned a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=16-17}}{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}} After a brief furlough, he set out to join the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th U.S. Infantry]] at [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post|Jefferson Barracks]], Missouri.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=32}} Longstreet spent his first two years of service at the post, which was under the command of Lt. Col. [[John Garland (general)|John Garland]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=33}} In 1843, he was joined by his friend, Lieutenant Ulysses Grant.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=34}} In 1844, Longstreet met his future first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. She was the daughter of Longstreet's commander, Lt. Col. Garland.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=34}}

At about the same time as Longstreet began courting Garland, Grant became acquainted with and courted Longstreet's fourth cousin, [[Julia Grant|Julia Dent]], and the couple eventually married. Historians agree that Longstreet attended the Grant wedding on August 22, 1848 in St. Louis, but his role at the ceremony remains unclear. Grant biographers [[Jean Edward Smith]] and [[Ron Chernow]] state that Longstreet served as Grant's best man at the wedding.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=73}}{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=872}} John Y. Simon, editor of Julia Grant's memoirs, concluded that Longstreet &quot;may have been a groomsman&quot;, and Longstreet biographer Donald Brigman Sanger called the role of best man &quot;uncertain&quot; while noting that neither Grant nor Longstreet mentioned such a role in either of their memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1844, the regiment, along with the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|Third Infantry]], was transferred to Camp Salubrity near [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]] as part of Army of Observation under General [[Zachary Taylor]]. On March 8, 1845, Longstreet received a promotion to second lieutenant, and was transferred to the Eighth Infantry, stationed at Fort Marion in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. He served for the month of August on court-martial duty in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. The regiment was then transferred to [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]], where he was reunited with the officers of the Third and Fourth Regiments, including Grant. The men passed the winter by staging plays.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=35-36}}

==Mexican-American War==
Longstreet served with distinction in the [[Mexican–American War]] with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma|Resaca de la Palma]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=37-38}} He recounted both of these battles in his memoirs but wrote nothing about his personal role in them.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=38}} On June 10, Longstreet was given command of Company A of the Eighth Infantry of [[William J. Worth]]'s Second Division. He fought again with Taylor's army at the [[Battle of Monterrey]] in September 1846. During the battle, about 200 Mexican [[lancer]]s drove back a group of American troops. Longstreet, commanding companies A and B, led a counterattack, killing or wounding almost half of the lancers.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=40-41}} On February 23, 1847, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=42}} He served at the [[Battle of Contreras]].{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}} In August, Longstreet served in the [[Battle of Churubusco]], a pivotal battle as the U.S. Army moved closer to capturing the Mexican capital of [[Mexico City]]. The Eighth Infantry was the only force in Worth's division to reach the Mexican earthworks. Longstreet carried the regimental banner under heavy Mexican fire. The troops found themselves stuck in a ditch and could only scale the Mexican defenses by standing on each other. In the fierce hand-to-hand combat that ensued, the Americans prevailed. Longstreet received a brevet promotion to captain for his actions at Churubusco.{{sfn|Mendoza|2008|pp=3-4}}

He received a brevet promotion to major for [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]]. In the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] on September 12, he was wounded in the thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend, Lt. [[George E. Pickett]], who was able to reach the summit.{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=35-45}} Longstreet recovered in the home of the Escandón family, which treated wounded American soldiers. His wound was slow to heal and he did not leave the home until December. After a brief visit with his family, Longstreet went to Missouri to visit Louise.{{sfn|Mendoza|2008|pp=4-5}}

==Subsequent activities==
[[File:Gen. Longstreet LCCN91783856.tif|thumb|right|200px|Antebellum portrait of Longstreet]]
After the war and his recovery from the Chapultepec wound, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848,{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=46}} and the marriage produced 10 children.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=47}} Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet mentions her only rarely in his memoirs, and never revealed any personal details. There are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet's second wife, [[Helen Dortch Longstreet]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=34}} Novelist [[Ben Ames Williams]], a descendant of Longstreet, included Longstreet as a minor character in two of his novels. Williams questioned Longstreet's surviving children and grandchildren, and in the novels depicted him as a very devoted family man with an exceptionally happy marriage.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=4}}

Longstreet's first assignment placed him on recruiting duty in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], where he served for several months. After travelling to St. Louis for the Grant wedding, Longstreet and his wife moved to [[Carlisle Barracks]], Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=46}} On January 1, 1850, he was appointed Chief Commissary for the Department of Texas, responsible for the acquiring and distributing food to the soldiers and animals of the department. The job was complex and consisted mainly of paperwork, although it provided valuable experience in how to manage troops. In June, Longstreet, hoping to find promotion and an income above his $40-per month salary to support his growing family, requested transfer to the cavalry. His request was rejected. He resigned as commissary in March 1851 and returned to the Eighth Infantry.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=47-48}} Longstreet served on frontier duty in Texas at [[Fort Martin Scott]] near [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]]. The primary purpose of the military in Texas was to protect frontier communities against Indians, and Longstreet frequently participated in scouting missions against the [[Comanche]]. His family remained in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], and he saw them regularly.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=47-48}} In 1854, he was transferred to [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], and Louise and the children moved in with him. In 1855, Longstreet was involved in fighting against the [[Mescalero]]. He assumed command of the garrison at Fort Bliss on two occasions between the spring of 1856 and the spring of 1858. The Longstreets' time at Fort Bliss was pleasant. The small size of the garrison allowed for easy socialization with the local people, and the fort's location allowed Louise to visit her parents in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=49}} Longstreet performed scouting missions.{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=48-51}}

On March 29, 1858, Longstreet wrote to the adjutant general's office in Washington, D.C. requesting that he be assigned to recruiting duty in the East, which would allow him to better educate his children. He was granted a six-month leave, but the request for assignment in the East was denied, and he was instead directed to serve as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]]. He left his son Garland in a school at [[Yonkers, New York]], before journeying to Kansas. On the way, Longstreet came across his old friend Grant in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Grant was very poor, but nonetheless asked that Longstreet accept a five dollar gold piece that he had borrowed at West Point. Longstreet initially refused, but Grant insisted and got him to take it. Longstreet's time in Leavenworth lasted about a year until he was transferred to Colonel Garland's department in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], to serve as paymaster, where he was joined by Louise and their children.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=50-51}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=29}}

Knowledge of Longstreet's prewar life is extremely limited. His experience resembles that of many would-be Civil War generals insofar as he went to West Point, served with distinction in the War with Mexico, and continued his career in the peacetime army of the 1850s. But beyond that, there are few details. He left no diary, and his lengthy memoirs focus almost entirely on recounting and defending his Civil War military record. They reveal little of his personal side while providing only a very cursory view of his pre-war activities. Not only that, but an 1889 fire destroyed his personal papers, making it so that the number of &quot;[e]xisting antebellum private letters written by Longstreet [could] be counted on one hand&quot;.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=1-2}}

==American Civil War==
===Joining the Confederacy and initial hostilities===
At the time of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Longstreet was paymaster for the United States Army and stationed in Albuquerque, having not yet resigned his commission. After news of the engagement, he joined his fellow Southerners in leaving the post. In his memoirs, Longstreet calls it a &quot;sad day&quot;, and records that a number of Northern officers attempted to persuade him not to go. He states that he asked one of them &quot;what course he would pursue if his State should pass ordinances of secession and call him to its defence. He confessed that he would obey the call.&quot;{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=29-30}}
 
Longstreet was not enthusiastic about [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], but he had long been infused with the concept of states' rights, and felt he could not go against his homeland.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=51-52}} Although he was born in South Carolina and reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=52}} After settling his accounts, he resigned from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] on May 8, 1861, to cast his lot with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=53}}

[[File:Gen. Longstreet, C.S.A. LCCN2004678555.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sketch of Longstreet, 1861]]
Longstreet arrived in [[Richmond, Virginia]] with a commission as a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Confederate States Army]]. He met with [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] at the executive mansion on June 22, 1861, where he was informed that he had been appointed a [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] with date of rank on June 17, a commission he accepted on June 25. He was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], where he was given command of a brigade of three Virginia regiments&amp;mdash;the [[1st Virginia Infantry|1st]], [[11th Virginia Infantry|11th]], and [[17th Virginia Infantry]] regiments in the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=58-61}}&lt;ref&gt;Longstreet, pp. 32-33, claimed that he sought only appointment as a paymaster, but historians such as Wert believe this was falsely modest and that he sought the glory of infantry command from the earliest days. See Wert 1993 pp. 58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstreet assembled his staff and trained his brigade incessantly. On July 16, Union General [[Irvin McDowell]] began marching his army toward [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas Junction]]. Longstreet's brigade first saw action at [[Battle of Blackburn's Ford|Blackburn's Ford]] on July 18, when it collided with McDowell's advance division under Brigadier General [[Daniel Tyler]]. An infantry charge pushed Longstreet's men back, and in his own words Longstreet &quot;rode with sabre in hand for the leading files, determined to give them all that was in the sword and my horse’s heels, or stop the break&quot;. A second attack soon began, but Confederate successes were hampered when inexperienced soldiers from Colonel [[Jubal Early]]'s brigade sent to reinforce Longstreet began firing on their own men. Tyler eventually withdrew, as he had orders not to bring on a general engagement.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=37-41}} The battle preceded the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Manassas). When the main attack came at the opposite end of the line on July 21, the brigade played a relatively minor role, although it endured artillery fire for nine hours.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=62-67}}{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=204}} Between 5 and 6 in the evening, Longstreet received an order from General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] instructing him to take part in pursuit of the Federal troops, who had been defeated and were fleeing the battlefield. He obeyed, but when he met the brigade of Brigadier General [[Milledge Bonham]], Bonham, who outranked Longstreet, ordered him to retreat. An order soon arrived from Johnston ordering the same. Longstreet was infuriated that his commanders would not allow a vigorous pursuit of the defeated Union Army.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=76-77}} His trusted Chief of Staff, [[Moxley Sorrel]], recorded that he was &quot;in a fine rage. He dashed his hat furiously to the ground, stamped, and bitter words escaped him.&quot; He quoted Longstreet as saying afterwards, &quot;Retreat! Hell, the Federal army has broken to pieces.&quot;{{sfn|Sorrel|1992|p=9}}

On October 7, Longstreet was promoted to [[Major General (CSA)|major general]] and assumed command of a division in the newly reorganized and renamed Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under Johnston (formed from the previous Army of the Potomac and the [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]]) &amp;mdash; with four infantry brigades commanded by Generals [[Daniel Harvey Hill]], [[David Rumph Jones|David R. Jones]], Bonham, and [[Louis Wigfall]], as well as [[Hampton's Legion]] commanded by [[Wade Hampton III]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=90-91}}

===Family tragedy===
On January 10, 1862, Longstreet traveled under orders from Johnston to Richmond, where he discussed with Davis the creation of a draft or conscription program. He spent much of the intervening time with Louise and their children, and was back at army headquarters in [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]] by the 20th. After only a day or two, he received a telegram informing him that all four of his children were extremely sick in an outbreak of [[scarlet fever]]. Longstreet immediately returned to Richmond.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=96-97}}

Longstreet arrived in Richmond before the death of his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne on January 25. Four-year old James died the following day. Eleven-year-old Augustus Baldwin (&quot;Gus&quot;) died on February 1. His 13-year-old son Garland remained ill but appeared to be out of mortal danger. [[George Pickett]] and his future wife [[LaSalle Corbell Pickett|LaSalle Corbell]] were in the Longstreet's company throughout the affair. They arranged the funeral and burial, which for unknown reasons neither Longstreet nor his wife attended. Longstreet waited a very short time to return to the army, doing so on February 5. He rushed back to Richmond later in the month when Garland took a turn for the worse, but came back after he recovered. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and his religious devotion increased.{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=205}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=97}}

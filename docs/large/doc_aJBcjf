'''St John's College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|constituent college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] (the full, formal name of the college is the '''College of St John the Evangelist in the University of Cambridge'''&lt;ref&gt;''A History of St John's College'', produced by [[Tim Rawle]] Associates, Cloister Press, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;) founded by the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] matriarch [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. In constitutional terms, the college is a charitable corporation established by a charter dated 9 April 1511. The aims of the college, as specified by its statutes, are the promotion of education, religion, learning and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|website=St John's College, Cambridge|year=2014|url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/research/|accessdate=15 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222201345/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/research|archivedate=22 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the larger [[Oxbridge]] colleges in terms of student numbers. For 2018, St. John's was ranked 9th of 29 colleges in the [[Tompkins Table]] (the annual league table of Cambridge colleges) with over 30 per cent of its students earning [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|first-class honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15936|title=Exclusive: Christ's and Pembroke victorious over Trinity in Tompkins Table|website=|accessdate=18 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college's alumni comprise the winners of 12 Nobel Prizes (including physicists [[Paul Dirac]], [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Max Born]], the latter having been affiliated with the college in the 1930s), seven prime ministers and 12 archbishops of various countries, at least two princes and three [[saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographical History page|website=St John's College, Cambridge|year=2014|url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/biographical/bioghistory/|accessdate=15 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927004149/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/library/biographical/bioghistory/|archivedate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joh.cam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;&quot;Johnian Nobel Laureates&quot;.

St John's is well known for its [[Choir of St John's College, Cambridge|choir]], its members' success in a wide variety of inter-collegiate sporting competitions and its annual [[May Ball]]. The [[Cambridge Apostles]] and the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club]] were both founded by members of the college. The [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]] tradition furthermore began with a St John's student and the college boat club, [[Lady Margaret Boat Club]], is the oldest in the university. In 2011, the college celebrated its quincentenary, an event marked by a visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-13209080|work=BBC News|title=In Pictures: The Queen in Cambridge|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:St John's College, Cambridge by Loggan 1690.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of St John's College, [[David Loggan]], c. 1685]]

The site was originally occupied by the Hospital of St John the Evangelist, probably founded around 1200.&lt;ref name=&quot;VictoriaV2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|section=Hospitals: St John the Evangelist, Cambridge|title=A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely|volume=2|editor=Salzman, L.F.|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1948|pages=303–307|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/cambs/vol2/pp303-307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital infirmary was located where the east end of the current chapel now stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/architecturalhi02willgoog/page/n88|title=The architectural history of the University of Cambridge and of the colleges of Cambridge and Eton: Volume 4|year=1886|authors=Robert Willis &amp; John Willis Clark|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1470 [[Thomas Rotherham]] Chancellor of the university, extended to the hospital the privileges of membership of the university.&lt;ref name=VictoriaV2 /&gt; This led to St. John's House, as it was then known, being conferred the status of a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annals of Cambridge|volume=1|author=Cooper, Charles Henry|publisher=Warwick and Co|year=1842|pages=[https://archive.org/details/annalsofcambridg01coopuoft/page/254 254]|url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofcambridg01coopuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 16th century the hospital was dilapidated and suffering from a lack of funds. [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], having endowed [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] sought to found a new college, and chose the hospital site at the suggestion of [[Saint John Fisher|John Fisher]], her chaplain and [[Bishop of Rochester]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaV2 /&gt; However, Lady Margaret died without having mentioned the foundation of St John's in her will, and it was largely the work of Fisher that ensured that the college was founded. He had to obtain the approval of King [[Henry VIII of England]], the [[Pope Julius II|Pope]] through the intermediary [[Polydore Vergil]], and the [[Bishop of Ely]] to suppress the religious hospital, by which time held only a Master and three Augustinian brethren, and convert it to a college.

The college received its charter on 9 April 1511. Further complications arose in obtaining money from the estate of Lady Margaret to pay for the foundation and it was not until 22 October 1512 that a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] was obtained in the court of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In November 1512 the [[Court of Chancery]] allowed Lady Margaret's executors to pay for the foundation of the college from her estates. When Lady Margaret's executors took over they found most of the old Hospital buildings beyond repair, but repaired and incorporated the Chapel into the new college. A kitchen and hall were added, and an imposing gate tower was constructed for the College Treasury. The doors were to be closed each day at dusk, sealing the monastic community from the outside world.

Over the course of the following five hundred years, the college expanded westwards towards the [[River Cam]], and now has twelve courts, the most of any Oxford or Cambridge College. The first three courts are arranged in [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]].

The college has retained its relationship with [[Shrewsbury School]] since 1578, when the headmaster [[Thomas Ashton (schoolmaster)|Thomas Ashton]] assisted in drawing up ordinances to govern the school. Under these rulings, the [[List of mayors of Shrewsbury|borough bailiffs]] (mayors after 1638) had power to appoint masters, along with Ashton's old college, St John's, having an academic veto. Since then, the appointment of Johnian academics to the Governing Body, and the historic awarding of 'closed' Shrewsbury Exhibitions, has continued. The most recent Master of St. John's, the late [[Chris Dobson]], was an ex officio Governor of [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] from 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrewsbury.org.uk/page/governing-body-members-details|title=Governing Body Members' Details|date=20 December 2012|website=Shrewsbury School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
St John's College first admitted women in October 1981, when K. M. Wheeler was admitted to the fellowship, along with nine female graduate students. The first women undergraduates arrived a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linehan|first=Peter|title=St John's College Cambridge: A History|pages=626–7|year=2011|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1843836087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and grounds==
[[File:St Johns main gate.jpg|thumb|The Main Gate of St John's College on [[St John's Street, Cambridge|St John's Street]], decorated with the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the foundress.]]

===The Great Gate===
St John's distinctive Great Gate follows the standard contemporary pattern employed previously at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]]. The gatehouse is crenelated and adorned with the arms of the foundress [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. Above these are displayed her ensigns, the Red Rose of Lancaster and Portcullis. The college arms are flanked by curious creatures known as [[yale (mythical creature)|yales]], mythical beasts with elephants' tails, antelopes' bodies, goats' heads, and swivelling horns. Above them is a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] containing a [[socle (architecture)|socle]] figure of St John the Evangelist, an Eagle at his feet and symbolic, poisoned chalice in his hands. The fan vaulting above is contemporary with tower, and may have been designed by William Swayne, a master mason of King's College Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;'A History of St John's College', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Court===
First Court is entered via the Great Gate, and is highly architecturally varied. First Court was converted from the hospital on the foundation of the college, and constructed between 1511 and 1520. Though it has since been gradually changed, the front (east) range is still much as it appeared when first erected in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;'A History of St John's College', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The south range was refaced between 1772–6 in the Georgian style by the local architect, James Essex, as part of an abortive attempt to modernise the entire court in the same fashion. The most dramatic alteration to the original, Tudor court, however, remains the Victorian amendment of the north range, which involved the demolition of the original medieval chapel and the construction of a new, far larger set of buildings in the 1860s. These included the Chapel, designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], which includes in its interior some pieces saved from the original chapel. It is the third tallest building in Cambridge. The alteration of the north range necessitated the restructuring of the connective sections of First Court; another bay window was added to enlarge the college's hall, and a new building constructed to the north of Great Gate. Parts of First Court were used as a prison in 1643 during the [[English Civil War]]. In April 2011, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] visited St John's college to inaugurate a new pathway in First Court, which passes close to the ruins of the Old Chapel.

===Dining hall===
[[File:Cam formal dinner st johns hall 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The 16th-century dining hall has a [[hammerbeam roof]]]]

The college's hall has a fine hammerbeam roof, painted in black and gold and decorated with the armorial devices of its benefactors. The hall is lined to cill level with linenfold panelling which dates from 1528–9, and has a five-bay screen, surmounted by the Royal Arms. Above is a hexagonal louvre, dating to 1703. The room was extended from five to eight bays according to designs by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] in 1863. It has two bay windows, containing heraldic glass dating from the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;imagesofengland.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=St Johns College|website=historicengland.org.uk|year=2014|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1332216|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, Queen Elizabeth rode into the college's Hall on horseback, during a state visit to Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHbPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |magazine=[[The Gentleman's Magazine|The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle]] |first=Sylvanus |last=Urban (ed.) |volume=18 |page=22 |year=1773 |title=The Gentleman's Magazine |accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St John's College Second Court, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The tower of Second Court leading to Third Court]]

===Second Court===
Second Court, built from 1598 to 1602, has been described as 'the finest [[Tudor period|Tudor]] court in England'. Built atop the demolished foundations of an earlier, far smaller court, Second Court was begun in 1598 to the plans of [[Ralph Symons]] of Westminster, and Gilbert Wigge of Cambridge. Their original architectural drawings are housed in the college's library, and are the oldest surviving plans for an Oxford or Cambridge college building.&lt;ref&gt;'A History of St John's College', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It was financed by the [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|Countess of Shrewsbury]], whose arms and statue stand above the court's western gatehouse. The court's Oriel windows are perhaps its most striking feature, though the dominating Shrewsbury Tower to the west is undoubtedly the most imposing. This gatehouse, built as a mirror image of the college's Great Gate, contains a statue of the benefactress [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury]], added in 1671. Behind the [[Oriel window]] of the north range lies the Long Gallery, a promenading room that was, prior to its segmentation, 148 feet long. In this room, the treaty between England and France was signed that established the marriage of King [[Charles I of England]] to Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. In the 1940s, parts of the [[D-day]] landings were planned there. Second Court is also home to the college's famous 'triple set', K6.

[[File:St John's College, Cambridge, third court 04.JPG|thumb|left|View of Third Court and the Old Library]]
[[File:St John's College Old Library interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the Old Library]]

===Library===
The [[St John's College Old Library, Cambridge|Old Library]] was built in 1624, largely with funds donated by [[John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln]]. Hearing of the college's urgent need for greater library space, Williams donated £1,200 anonymously, later revealing his identity and donating a total of £2,011 towards the library's total cost of £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;'A History of St John's College', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The library's bay window overlooks the River Cam and bears the letters &quot;ILCS&quot; on it, standing for Iohannes Lincolniensis Custos Sigilli, or &quot;John of Lincoln, Keeper of the Seal&quot;. The original intention of the college had been to construct an elegant classical building supported by pillared porticos, but Bishop Williams insisted on a more traditional design. Thus, though the college lays claim to few examples of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] design, the library stands as one of the earliest examples of English [[neo-Gothic]] architecture.

===Third Court===
Third Court is entered through Shrewsbury Tower, which from 1765 to 1859 housed an observatory. Each of its ranges was built in a different style. Following the completion of the college library in 1624, the final sides of Third Court were added between 1669 and 1672, after the college had recovered from the trauma of the [[English Civil War]]. The additions included a fine set of Dutch-gabled buildings backing onto the River Cam, and a 'window-with-nothing-behind-it' that was designed to solve the problem of connecting the windowed library with the remainder of the court.

===Kitchen or Wren Bridge===
[[File:Bridge over the River Cam, Cambridge, 2008-03-31.jpg|thumb|View of Wren Bridge from the Backs]]
[[File:Bridge of Sighs, St John's College, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|St John's College Bridge of Sighs]]

This was the first stone bridge erected at St John's college, continuing on from Kitchen lane. The crossing's chief distinction is the use of illusory [[Intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]; Wren's bridge is carved from a limestone [[monolith]] incised to give the appearance of masonry.&lt;ref&gt;'An Architectural History of the University of Cambridge', Willis p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; The crossing lies south of the Bridge of Sighs, and was a replacement for a wooden bridge that had stood on the site since the foundation's early days as a hospital. Though [[Sir Christopher Wren]] submitted designs for the bridge, it was eventually built on a different site by a local mason, Robert Grumbold, who also built Trinity College Library. As with the Library, Grumbold's work was based on Wren's designs, and the bridge has become known more famously as 'the Wren Bridge'.

===Kitchen Court===
This tiny court, formed within the walls of the old Kitchen Lane, is used as an outdoor dining area.

===The Bridge of Sighs===
Though it bears little resemblance to its namesake in Venice, the bridge connecting Third Court to New Court, originally known as New Bridge, is now commonly known as the [[Bridge of Sighs (Cambridge)|Bridge of Sighs]]. It is one of the most photographed buildings in Cambridge, and was described by the visiting Queen Victoria as &quot;so pretty and picturesque&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of St John's College'', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is a single-span bridge of stone with highly decorative Neo-Gothic covered footwalk over with traceried openings. There is a three-bay arcade at the east end of the bridge. The architect was [[Henry Hutchinson]].

===New Court===
The 19th-century neo-Gothic New Court, probably one of the best known buildings in Cambridge, was the first major building built by any of the colleges on the west side of the river. Designed by [[Thomas Rickman]] and [[Henry Hutchinson]], New Court was built between 1826 and 1831 to accommodate the college's rapidly increasing numbers of students. Despite the college's original intention to get the architects to build another copy of Second Court, plans were eventually accepted for a fashionably romantic building in the 'Gothic' style. It is a three-sided court of tall Gothic Revival buildings, closed on the fourth side by an open, seven-bayed cross-vaulted cloister and gateway. It is four storeys high, has battlements and is pinnacled. The main portal has a fan vault with a large octagonal pendant, and the interior of the main building retains many of its original features including ribbed plaster ceilings in the mock-Gothic style. Its prominent location (especially when seen from the river) and flamboyant design have led it to be nicknamed &quot;The Wedding Cake&quot;. Hutchinson was suitably proud of his creation, and it is said that he once dashed up a staircase to reprimand an undergraduate for spoiling its symmetry by sitting too near one of its windows.

===Chapel===
[[File:LeKeux - Cambridge, c1840 - St John's 05, Chapel - memorialsofcambr01wriguoft 0214.jpg|thumb|Old College Chapel]]
[[File:St John's College Chapel, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Inside St John's College Chapel]]
The Chapel of St John's College is entered by the northwest corner of First Court. It was constructed between 1866 and 1869 to replace the smaller mediaeval chapel which dated back to the 13th century. When in 1861 the college's administration decided that a new building was needed, Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] was selected as architect. He had recently finished work on the chapel at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and went about constructing the chapel of St John's College along similar lines, drawing inspiration from the [[Saint Chapelle]] church in Paris.

[[File:St John's College Chapel Court, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|St John's College Chapel was designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]]]

The benefactor [[Henry Hoare (1807–1866)|Henry Hoare]] offered a downpayment of £3000 to finance the chapel's construction, in addition to which he promised to pay £1000 a year if a tower were added to Scott's original plans, which had included only a small [[fleche]]. Work began, but Hoare's death from a railway accident left the college £3000 short of his expected benefaction. The tower was completed, replete with [[Louver|louvres]] but left without bells. It is based on [[Pershore Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;'A History of St John's College', produced by Tim Rawle Associates, Cloister Press, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is {{convert|163|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Chapel of St John's College |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1869|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5tZAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel's antechamber contains statues of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]] and [[John Fisher]]. Inside the building is a stone-vaulted antechapel, at the end of which hangs a 'Deposition of the Cross' by [[Anton Rafael Mengs]], completed around 1777. The misericordes and panelling date from 1516, and were salvaged from the old chapel. The chapel contains some fifteenth-century glass, but most was cast by Clayton and Bell, Hardman, and Wailes, in around 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;imagesofengland.org.uk&quot;/&gt; Freestanding statues and plaques commemorate college benefactors such as James Wood, Master 1815–39, as well as alumni including [[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Clarkson]] and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]. The college tower can be climbed, and is accessed via a small door on First Court. However, this access was closed in 2016 for the duration that important structural repairs were carried out to the tower [[Pinnacle]]s and roof.

The Chapel is surrounded on three sides by large [[church tabernacle|tabernacles]] which form part of the external buttresses. Each contains a statue of a prominent college alumnus, alumna or benefactor. The persons commemorated are, beginning with the buttress next to the transept on the south side:

&lt;div class=&quot;hlist&quot;&gt;
* [[Sir William Cecil]], Lord Burleigh
* Lucius, [[Viscount Falkland]]
* John Williams, Archbishop of York
* [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], Earl of Strafford
* [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], natural philosopher
* [[Roger Ascham]], instructor to Elizabeth I
* [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|Mary Cavendish]], Countess of Shrewsbury
* [[Richard Bentley]], classicist
* [[Edward Stillingfleet]], bishop of Worcester
* [[John Overall (bishop)|John Overall]], Bishop of Coventry, Lichfield and Norwich
* [[Peter Gunning]], Bishop of Chichester and Ely
* Sarah Alston, Duchess of Somerset
* [[Thomas Clarkson]], abolitionist
* [[Brook Taylor]], natural philosopher and mathematician
* [[Thomas Linacre]], founder of the Royal College of Physicians
* ''Two plinths left vacant''
* [[Thomas Baker (historian)|Thomas Baker]], historian
&lt;/div&gt;

===The Master's lodge and garden===
St John's Master's lodge is located in a grassy clearing to the north of Third Court. It was built at the same time as the new chapel was being constructed, and has Tudor fittings, wainscot, portraits and other relics from the demolished north wing of First Court. It has a large garden, and in the winter its westmost rooms have excellent views of the college's old library, the River Cam, and the Bridge of Sighs. The architect was [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]].

Located to the west of the chapel tower lies Chapel Court, which was constructed together with North Court' and Forecourt in the 1930s to account for an increase in student numbers. North Court is located just north of Chapel Court and Forecourt is situated to the east, facing [[St John's Street, Cambridge|St John's Street]]. The latter is used partly as a car park for fellows and night entrance to the college. All three courts were designed by the architect [[Edward Maufe]].

Further increases in student numbers following WWII prompted the college to again increase the number of accommodation buildings. Cripps Court was built in the late 1960s to satisfy this demand. It is located just behind New Court and forms two courts (Upper &amp; Lower River Court). Designed by architects [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], the building is Grade II* listed&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLE1393223&quot;&gt;{{National Heritage List for England| num=1393223 |desc=Cripps Building at St John's College |grade=II* |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having received an award from the British Architectural Institution. It is considered an exemplar of late 20th-century architectural style and is named after its main benefactor, [[Humphrey Cripps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/default.asp?MIS=864] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925004705/http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/default.asp?MIS=864 |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the building went through an extensive refurbishment program, which saw renovated accommodation and structural repairs, including the cleaning of the [[Portland stone]] which the building is made of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/cripps-building-1|title=The Cripps Building {{!}} St John's College, Cambridge|website=St John|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west of Cripps Court lies the [[School of Pythagoras]]. Built around 1200, it predates the college with 300 years and is both the oldest secular building in Cambridge and the oldest building continuously in use by a university in Britain. The building now serves as the location for the College Archives. Next to the School of Pythagoras lies [[Merton Hall]]. From 1266 until 1959 both the School of Pythagoras and Merton Hall were property of [[Merton College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Merton College | author = Martin, G.H | year = 1997 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0-19-920183-8 | pages = 17 and 342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton Court is the college's eleventh and westernmost court.

In 1987 the construction of the Fisher Building was completed. Named after Cardinal [[John Fisher]], the building contains teaching rooms, conference facilities, and the student-run college cinema. It was designed by the architect [[Peter Boston]].

Located directly opposite the college's Great Gate is All Saints' Yard. The complex is formed from the buildings of the so-called &quot;Triangle Site&quot;, a collection of structures owned by the college. An extensive renovation project finished in Michaelmas Term 2012 had a budget of approximately £9.75 million. The centrepiece of the Yard is Corfield Court, named after the project's chief benefactor, [[Charles Corfield]]. The site can be entered through one of two card-activated gates, or through the School of Divinity. The School of Divinity is the largest building on the site, and was built between 1878 and 1879 by [[Basil Champneys]] for the University of Cambridge's divinity faculty on land leased by St John's College. Control of the building reverted to St John's when the faculty of divinity moved to a new building on the Sidgwick site in 2000.

==College choirs==
{{main|Choir of St John's College, Cambridge}}

The Choir of St John's College has a tradition of religious music and has sung the daily services in the College Chapel since the 1670s. The services follow the cathedral tradition of the Church of England, [[Evening Prayer (Book of Common Prayer)|Evensong]] being sung during Term six days a week and Sung [[Eucharist]] on Sunday mornings. The choir is currently directed by Mr Andrew Nethsingha, who has previously been Director of Music at Gloucester and Truro Cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjcchoir.co.uk/about/choir/director-music|title=Director of Music – The Choir of St John's College, Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys of the choir are all educated and board at [[St John's College School]]. During university vacations the choir carries out engagements elsewhere. Recent tours have taken it to places including the Netherlands, the US and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John's College Choir Website |url=https://www.sjcchoir.co.uk/about/choir |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choir has an extensive discography of nearly 100 commercial releases dating back to the 1950s, when it was signed to the Decca/[[Argo Records (UK)|Argo]] label under [[George Guest]]. The Choir has since had successful recording contracts with [[Hyperion Records]] and [[Chandos Records]], resulting in many critical accolades including a [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] Editor's Choice selection for 2015's collection ''The Call''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/editors-choice-recordings-october-2015|title=Editor's Choice recordings – October 2015|last=Gramophone|date=12 October 2015|website=www.gramophone.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the choir signed to Signum Records on its own St John's College imprint.  The first recording of this new venture was a collection of music by the contemporary composer [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)]] released in May 2016 to a number two position in the UK specialist classical charts. The imprint will also release non-choral recordings by current and former members of the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/first-st-john%E2%80%99s-release-reaches-2-classical-charts|title=First St John's release reaches No. 2 in classical charts – St John's College, Cambridge|access-date=26 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100820/https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/first-st-john%E2%80%99s-release-reaches-2-classical-charts|archive-date=1 January 2019|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men of the choir, or choral scholars, also form their own close harmony group, The Gentlemen of St John's. Their repertoire spans the 15th century through to the modern day, and concert tours have taken them to Europe, the US and Japan. They provide a mixture of classical a cappella music and folksongs, as well as covers of recently chart hits and light-hearted entertainment, and host an annual Christmas concert and garden party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentlemenofstjohns.co.uk/the-group/|title=About The Group – The Gentlemen of St. John's College, Cambridge|access-date=6 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427143616/http://www.gentlemenofstjohns.co.uk/the-group/|archive-date=27 April 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college also has a mixed-voice choir, St John's Voices, which was founded in 2013 to allow female members of the college to take part in the college's choral tradition. It comprises around 30 members, and has premiered 3 works thus far&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John's Voices |url=https://intranet.joh.cam.ac.uk/st-john%E2%80%99s-voices |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112095022/https://intranet.joh.cam.ac.uk/st-john%E2%80%99s-voices |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2019 |website=St John's College Cambridge |accessdate=11 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions and legends==

===Consumption of Swan===
Fellows of St John's College are the only people outside the Royal Family in the United Kingdom legally allowed to eat unmarked [[mute swan]]s. Swan traps were originally built into the walls of the college alongside the river, but these are no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/interviews/interview/957/|title=St John's College – Sarah Castor-Perry – The Naked Scientists|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown (the [[British monarch]]) retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but the Queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries. This ownership is shared with the Vintners' and Dyers' Companies, who were granted rights of ownership by the Crown in the fifteenth century, and was extended to the college via ancient [[Royalist]] ties.

===Ghosts===
According to popular legend, St John's College is inhabited by a number of ghosts. In 1706, four fellows exorcised some ghosts from a house opposite the college by the simple method of threatening to fire their pistols at the positions the moans and groans were coming from. Second court is apparently still haunted by the ghost of the former undergraduate and master, [[James Wood (mathematician)|James Wood]]. Wood was so poor that he could not afford to light his room, and would often do his work in the well-lit stairway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegestuddedmarsh.com/St%20Johns.html |title=St. John's |accessdate=11 April 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305170835/http://collegestuddedmarsh.com/St%20Johns.html |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Court's Clock Tower===
[[File:St John's College New Court 1, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|St John's College New Court and blank clock tower face]]
New Court's central [[cupola]] has four blank clock-faces. These are subject to various apocryphal explanations. One legend maintains that a statute limiting the number of chiming clocks in Cambridge rendered the addition of a mechanism illegal. No such limitation is known to exist. More likely explanations include Hutchinson's fear that the installation of a clockface would spoil the building's symmetry, and that the college's financial situation in the early nineteenth century made completion impossible.

Other legends explaining the absence of clockfaces claim that St John's College and its neighbour, [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] were engaged in a race to build the final (or tallest) clocktower in Cambridge. Supposedly, whichever was finished first (or was tallest) would be permitted to house the 'final' chiming clock in Cambridge. Trinity's Tower was finished first (or, in another version of the same story, was made taller overnight by the addition of a wooden cupola), and its clock was allowed to remain. In truth, the completion of New Court and Trinity's Clock (which is in King Edward's Tower) was separated by nearly two centuries. Trinity's famous double-striking was installed in the seventeenth century by its then-Master, [[Richard Bentley]], a former student of St John's, who dictated that the clock chime once for Trinity, and once for his alma mater, St John's.

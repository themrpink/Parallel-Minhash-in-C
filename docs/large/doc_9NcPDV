In the latter case, there are usually countermeasures that can be employed against tractor beams. These may include pressor beams (a stronger pressor beam will counteract a weaker tractor beam) or ''plane shears'' aka ''shearing planes'' (a device to &quot;cut&quot; the tractor beam and render it ineffective). In some fictional realities, [[energy shield|shields]] can block tractor beams, or the generators can be disabled by sending a large amount of energy back up the beam to its source.

Tractor beams and pressor beams can be used together as a weapon: by attracting one side of an enemy spaceship while repelling the other, one can create severely damaging shear effects in its hull. Another mode of destructive use of such beams is rapid alternating between pressing and pulling force in order to cause structural damage to the ship as well as inflicting lethal forces on its crew.

Two objects being brought together by a tractor beam are usually attracted toward their common centre of gravity. This means that if a small spaceship applies a tractor beam to a large object such as a planet, the ship will be drawn towards the planet, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[Star Trek]]'', tractor beams are imagined to work by placing a target in the focus of a subspace/graviton interference pattern created by two beams from an emitter. When the beams are manipulated correctly the target is drawn along with the interference pattern. The target may be moved toward or away from the emitter by changing the polarity of the beams. Range of the beam affects the maximum mass that can be moved by the emitter, and the emitter subjects its anchoring structure to significant force.&lt;ref&gt;Startrek Reference Manual, Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, pages 89 – 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
* [[E. E. Smith]] coined the term &quot;tractor beam&quot; (an update of his earlier &quot;attractor beam&quot;) in his novel ''[[Spacehounds of IPC]]'', originally serialized in [[Amazing Stories]] magazine in 1931.  The hero of his ''[[Skylark of Space]]'' books (1929 onwards), had invented &quot;attractor beams&quot; and &quot;repellor beams.&quot; Repellors can also be emitted [[isotropy|isotropically]] as a sort of defensive [[Force field (fiction)|force field]] against material projectiles.
* In [[Philip Francis Nowlan]]'s [[Buck Rogers]] novel, ''[[Armageddon 2419 A.D.]]'' (1928), the enemy airships used &quot;repellor beams&quot; for support and propulsion,&lt;ref&gt;Nowlan, P. F. (1962). ''Armageddon 2419 A. D.'' [pp. 37–41]. New York, NY: Ace Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the &quot;eighth ray&quot; beams used for support and propulsion of Martian airships in the [[Barsoom]]/John Carter of Mars series by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], first published 1912–1943.
* The ''[[Lensman]]'' books by [[E. E. Smith]].
* ''[[Tom Swift]]'' – In the new Tom Swift Jr. book ''Tom Swift and The Deep-Sea Hydrodome'' (1958), Tom invents the &quot;repellatron&quot;. The device can be set to repel specific chemical elements. It was used to create a bubble habitat on the ocean floor, and as the propulsion system for his spacecraft ''Challenger''.
* The ''[[Honor Harrington]]'' books by [[David Weber]]
* The ''[[Sector General]]'' books by [[James White (author)|James White]] The 1963 novel ''[[Star Surgeon]]'' is the source of the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon, the so-called &quot;Rattler&quot;. These weapons attract then repel the target (entire ship or a segment of the ship's hull) at 80 gs, several times a minute. The novel also featured a type of [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] called a &quot;repulsion screen&quot;.
* [[David Weber#Steve White|Starfire series]] – the combined tractor/pressor beam weapon
* ''[[Starplex]]'' by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]
* ''[[The Trigger]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] involves the development of tractor beams in the early part of the novel.
* ''[[Sixth Column]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] describes tractor/pressor beams as a product of the physics of a &quot;newly-discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra&quot; featured in the novel.
*[[Star Wars: Aftermath: Empire's End|Aftermath: Empire's End]] A New Republic Star Hawk uses a tractor beam to drag an enemy Dreadnought down to the surface of Jakku.
* [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s &quot;As Easy as A.B.C.&quot; (1912) made use of the &quot;flying loop,&quot; generated by one of the airships of the [[Aerial Board of Control]], when a woman tried, as a political statement, to publicly kill herself. The loop pulled the knife from her hand and, instead of drawing it toward the airship, flung it fifty yards away; it also continued to hold her arm rigid for a second or so afterward. [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in the foreword to a collection of Kipling's science fiction, said this may be the first-ever depiction of a tractor beam. 

===Comics===
* ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' comic strip – originally just repulsor beams; tractors appeared by the 1970s
* [[Archie Comics]], where it is caricatured as a literal &quot;tractor&quot;
* [[Iron Man]]'s various armor suits usually feature repulsor beam projectors mounted in the palms as one of the main weapon systems.

===Movies and television series===
* ''[[Star Trek]]'' (TV series, films, books and games). One of the most visible and iconic uses of the concept. One of the few prominent fictitious depictions which used such beams repeatedly and referred to them consistently as tractor beams.

:The Original Series used the tractor beam several times. In the first episode produced for the series, &quot;[[The Corbomite Maneuver]]&quot;, the Enterprise was captured and towed by a tractor beam which they attempted to escape by shearing away at a 90 degree course. In &quot;[[Space Seed]]&quot;, it was used to tow Khan Noonien Singh's ship, the SS ''Botany Bay''. In &quot;[[Tomorrow Is Yesterday]]&quot;, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Starship Enterprise]] attempts to capture Captain John Christopher's 20th century [[F-104 Starfighter]] jet, &quot;Bluejay 4&quot;, using a tractor beam.

* ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars]]'' The Predacons capture the Decepticon flagship ''Nemesis'' and use its tractor beam to attempt to destroy the Maximals and the ''Ark''. It appeared to be powered by spinning grinders, gears blades, etc.
* ''[[District 9]]'' (2009) Near the climax, the command module and an assortment of dirt and rocks were pulled towards the mothership using a mildly illuminated array of tractor beams.
* ''[[Star Wars]]'' (films, TV series, books, games) In ''Episode IV'' (1977), the [[Millennium Falcon]] becomes caught in the Death Star's tractor beam after arriving at the former location of Alderaan and following a lone [[TIE fighter]] towards what they first believe to be a moon.
* ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980)
* ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (TV series). The Minbari Federation is known to use &quot;gravity nets&quot; which wrap a bubble around its target allowing the ship creating the net to &quot;grapple&quot; the target. They also have some sort of &quot;levitation beams&quot; seen in the television film &quot;In the Beginning&quot; wherein Lennier and a group of Minbari emissaries from the Grey Council are levitated from a platform on the ground up to ship high above them.
* The ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' episode &quot;[[Splashdown (seaQuest DSV)|Splashdown]]&quot;.
* In ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987), ''Spaceball One'' uses a tractor beam – referred to as a &quot;magnetic beam&quot; in the film – to intercept Princess Vespa's Mercedes space cruiser.
* The [[Taelon]] mothership on ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'' used tractor beams on several occasions.
* In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004), Syndrome uses [[zero-point energy]] to mimic tractor and pressor beam behaviors.
* In ''[[Recess: School's Out]]'' (2001), the film's main [[antagonist]] attempted to use a tractor beam to move the moon to create a new [[ice age]].
* The anime ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (known as ''[[Star Blazers]]'' outside Japan). In one episode, multiple magnetic beam projectors on planet Gamilon were used to drag the ''Yamato'' into a trap.
* [[Pixar]]'s short film ''[[Lifted (2006 film)|Lifted]]'' (2006) is based on an alien character who is in a tractor beam usage test.
* In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002), [[Dr. Evil]]'s evil plan involved using a tractor beam to crash a golden asteroid into the Earth, causing a torrential flood.
* In the animated series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', one of Dr. Weird's inventions is a rainbow shooting machine, which actually turns out to be a tractor beam, but Dr. Weird simply calls it, &quot;this thing&quot;.
* In ''[[This Island Earth]]'' (1955), a small airplane was drawn into a Metalunan flying saucer by a visible and audible tractor beam that engulfed the entire aircraft.
* In ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), Garth says &quot;Stacy alert. We've been spotted and are being pulled in by her tractor beam&quot; when Wayne's obsessed ex-girlfriend approaches them at a bar.
* In ''[[Fire in the Sky]]'' (1993), [[Travis Walton UFO incident|Travis Walton]] gets moved up in the air by a blue-green light from a UFO. After some time, the beam smashes him to the ground.
* In ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004), the Xilien's UFO uses a tractor beam to transport the kaiju to destroy the Earth's major cities.
* In ''[[The Orville]]'' (TV series), the Planetary Union starship ''Orville'' uses a tractor beam on a number of occasions.
* In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', the Black Order's Q-Ships are equipped with a tractor beam. It was shown used by the Q-Ship of Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian to attract an unconscious Doctor Strange, in order to get his Time Stone, and Spider-Man who was trapped by the beam as well.

===Games===
* ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'' – After Jimmy gives the Hobo all 6 transistors and he completes the machine, he is pulled away to the sky by a brightly colored tractor beam while a sinister laugh echoes. He is never seen again, but the tractor beam can be seen shining from his lot at night afterwards.
* ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' (Half Life 2 Mod) – The Physics Gun is used in the sandbox game to build using props by freezing them in mid-air with an adjustable distance tractor beam
* ''[[Galaga]]'' – used by the Galagas to steal the player's ship.
* The &quot;Grabber&quot; in ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]''
* The Salvage Corvette's &quot;Salvage Field&quot; in ''[[Homeworld]]''
* The Grapple Beam from the [[Metroid series|''Metroid'' series]], which allows the player to attach to and swing from special points or surfaces, as well as the Charge Beam from ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' and its sequels, which allows the player to draw power-ups in from a distance.
* One Crystal Eres (magic spell) in ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'' and a magic spell in ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]'' is named Tractor Beam, that launches the enemy in the air.
* In ''[[Time Crisis 4]]'', [[Wild Dog (Time Crisis)|Wild Dog]] uses a Tractor Beam at one point to direct crates and other heavy objects at the players.
* ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando]]'', it is used as a gadget to move marked objects from one place to another, often to advance the plot.
* In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', [[Gordon Freeman]] is armed with a device called the &quot;Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator&quot; or simply the &quot;[[Gravity gun|Gravity Gun]]&quot;, which can pick up, throw, and &quot;punt&quot; heavy or sharp objects with little or no physical effort. In the last mission, it is accidentally modified to manipulate organic matter, and can throw [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] soldiers to their deaths. In addition, on E3 2003 the &quot;Physics Gun&quot; that allows to move objects freely in three dimensions was shown.
* A similar gun to the one in ''Half-Life 2'', called the &quot;Uplink&quot;, appears in ''[[TimeSplitters: Future Perfect]]'', available to the player beginning with the second mission. In addition to a &quot;gravity gun&quot;, the item also serves as a map and a [[Time travel|time machine]] for the player's character, [[Sergeant Cortez]].
* In [[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]], each ship is fitted with a tractor beam, with which it salvages cargo, weapons and mission items from destroyed ships.
* In the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', yet another similar gun to ''Half-Life 2''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, which is titled the &quot;Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device&quot;, can create a weaker zero-point energy field by simply lifting objects and carrying them, but cannot throw or pull in from a distance. These items can also be dropped through the portals it can create. Unstationary Scaffolds and chamberlock elevators move on tractor beams. A tractor beam known as the &quot;Aperture Science Excursion Funnel&quot; appears in the second game in the series, ''[[Portal 2]]''. [[Razer Hydra]] owners get upgraded version of the Portal Device in ''Portal 2'' which can freely move objects in three dimensions.
*In the [[MMORPG]] [[EVE Online]] tractor beams can be used to retrieve wrecks of enemy ships and cargo containers in space.
*Another similar gun to Half-Life 2's gravity gun called the &quot;Capture gun&quot; appears as the primary tool in the [[Wii]] video game [[Elebits]], where it is used to manipulate objects and capture the titular creatures.
* In the MMORPG Star Sonata, tractor beams can be used to push and pull enemy ships, collect debris from space, and are also a valid form of transportation.
* [[Star Control 2]]: ships of [[Chmmr]] are equipped with tractor beams that work on practically infinite range.
* [[The Simpsons Game]], in the &quot;Invasion of the Yokel Snatchers&quot; level.
* In [[Sword of the Stars]] you are able to equip your ships with tractor beams.
* [[The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run]] features a tractor beam throughout level 7. It is first seen in Level 2, which abducts Bart from the Honour Roller. In level 7, it can be driven into and your car will be abducted, before being destroyed. This will drop the empty chassis to the ground, which can still be driven. This works to the players advantage, as it can be used to send up barrels of nuclear waste, which destroys the space ship, taking Homer Simpson's '70's Sports Car', Snake and Bandit, John Frink and the Hover Car {trademark}, and finally Abraham Simpson and a modified WWII Vehicle, which eventually destroys it. Comic Book Guy remarks that such a thing is the 'Worst Effect Ever!'
* In the Space stage of spore, the player acquires the Tractor Beam tool very early in the stage. This tool is used only for picking up objects on the ground that are not vehicles or buildings.
* in [[Minecraft: Story Mode]], the first main antagonist, the Wither Storm, emits a large purple tractor beam from its eyes to pull debris and organisms alike into its body to add more mass to itself.

'''Wilhelm Johannsen''' (3 February 1857 – 11 November 1927) was a Danish pharmacist, [[botanist]], plant physiologist, and [[geneticist]]. He is best known for coining the terms [[gene]], [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]], and for his 1903 [[Mutationism#Johannsen.27s .22pure line.22 experiments.2C 1903|&quot;pure line&quot; experiments]] in [[genetics]].

==Biography==
Johannsen was born in Copenhagen.  While very young, he was apprenticed to a [[pharmacist]] and worked in [[Denmark]] and Germany beginning in 1872 until passing his pharmacist's exam in 1879. In 1881, he became assistant in the chemistry department at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] under the chemist [[Johan Kjeldahl]]. Johannsen studied the [[metabolism]] of [[dormancy]] and [[germination]] in [[seed]]s, [[tuber]]s and [[bud]]s. He showed that [[dormancy]] could be broken by various [[anesthetic]] compounds, such as [[diethyl ether]] and  [[chloroform]].

In 1892, he was appointed lecturer at [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] and later became professor of [[botany]] and [[plant physiology]]. He taught plant physiology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenius Warming|Warming, Eug.]] &amp; W. Johannsen (1895) Den almindelige Botanik (General Botany): En Lærebog, nærmest til Brug for Studerende og Lærere. 3rd edn, [[Copenhagen|Kjøbenhavn]]. 4th edn by Warming and Johannsen 1900-01). German edn 1907-09: Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Botanik (from the 4th edn, by E. P. Meinecke). Berlin, Borntraeger. 667 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known research concerned so-called ''pure lines'' of the self-fertile [[common bean]]. He was able to show that even in [[population]]s [[homozygote|homozygous]] for all traits, i.e. without genetic variation, seed size followed a [[normal distribution]]. This was attributable to resource provision to the mother plant and to the position of seeds in [[Legume|pod]]s and of pods on the plant. This led him to coin the terms ''[[phenotype]]'' and ''[[genotype]]''.

Johannsen's findings led him to oppose contemporary [[Darwinism|Darwinists]], most notably [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who held the occurrence of [[normal distribution|normal distributed]] trait variation in [[population]]s as proof of gradual genetic variation on which selection could act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roll-Hansen | first1 = Nils | year = 1979 | title = The Genotype Theory of Wilhelm Johannsen and its Relation to Plant Breeding and the Study of Evolution | url = | journal = Centaurus | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 201–235 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0498.1979.tb00589.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], was it established that variation needed to be [[heritable]] to act as the raw material for [[Selection (biology)|selection]].

He created the terms ''[[phenotype]]'' and ''[[genotype]]'', first using them in his book in German as ''Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre''.&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W. (1909) Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre. Gustav Fischer, Jena. [http://caliban.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/~stueber/johannsen/elemente/index.html Scanned full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; This book was based in large part on ''Om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier'' (&quot;On heredity in society and in pure lines&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W. (1903) Om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier. Oversigt over det [[Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]]s Forhandlinger, vol. 3: 247-270. German ed. ''Erblichkeit in Populationen und in reinen Linien'' (1903) Gustav Fischer, Jena. [http://caliban.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/~stueber/johannsen/erblichkeit/index.html Scanned full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Arvelighedslærens Elementer''.&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W.L. (1905) Arvelighedslærens elementer (The Elements of Heredity). Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in this book Johannsen also introduced the term ''[[gene]]''. This term was coined in opposition to the then common ''pangene'' that stemmed from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[pangenesis]]. The book became one of the founding texts of genetics.

Also in 1905, Johannsen was appointed professor of [[plant physiology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], becoming vice-chancellor in 1917. In December 1910, Johannsen was invited to give an address before the [[American Society of Naturalists]]. This talk was printed in the [[American Naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/279202 | title = The Genotype Conception of Heredity | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 45 | issue = 531 | pages = 129–59 | year = 1911 | last1 = Johannsen | first1 = W. | jstor=2455747 | pmc = 4258772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he was invited to give a series of four lectures at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anon | first1 =  | year = 1911 | title = Professor Johannsen's Columbia Lectures | url = | journal = Science | volume = 34 | issue = 876| page = 484 | jstor=1637692 | doi=10.1126/science.34.876.484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannsen was a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] (elected 1915).

Johannsen died from work poisoning in 1927.

'''''The Great Ziegfeld''''' is a 1936 American [[epic film | epic]] [[musical film | musical]] and [[drama film]] directed by [[Robert Z. Leonard]] and produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]]. It stars [[William Powell]] as the theatrical [[impresario]] [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz &quot;Flo&quot; Ziegfeld Jr.]], [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]], and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Billie Burke]].

The film, shot at MGM Studios in Culver City, California in the fall of 1935, is a fictionalized tribute to [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.]] and a cinematic adaptation of Broadway's [[Ziegfeld Follies]], with highly elaborate costumes, dances and sets. Many of the performers of the theatrical Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including [[Fanny Brice]] and [[Harriet Hoctor]], and the real Billie Burke acted as a supervisor for the film. The &quot;[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]&quot; set alone was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|220000|1936}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}),{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} featuring a towering rotating volute of {{convert|70| ft|abbr=on}} diameter with 175 spiral steps, weighing 100 tons. The music to the film was provided by [[Walter Donaldson]], [[Irving Berlin]], and lyricist [[Harold Adamson]], with choreographed scenes. The extravagant costumes were designed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], taking some 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to prepare them using {{convert|50|lb}} of silver sequins and {{convert|12|yd|m}} of white ostrich plumes. Over a thousand people were employed in the production of the film, which required 16 reels of film after the cutting.

One of the biggest successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was acclaimed as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for producer [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Luise Rainer]], and [[Academy Award for Best Dance Direction|Best Dance Direction]] for [[Seymour Felix]], and was nominated for four others. Although the film still is praised for its lavish production and as a symbol of glamour and excess during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], today ''The Great Ziegfeld'' is generally seen less favorably and is considered by many critics to be excessively showy and too lengthy at over three hours.

MGM made two more ''Ziegfeld'' films – one titled ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'' (1941), starring [[James Stewart]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Lana Turner]], which recycled some footage from ''The Great Ziegfeld'', and in 1946, ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. In 1951, the studio produced a Technicolor remake of ''[[Show Boat]]'', which Ziegfeld had presented as a stage musical.

The son of a highly respected music professor, [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz &quot;Flo&quot; Ziegfeld Jr.]] yearns to make his mark in show business. He begins by promoting [[Eugen Sandow]], the &quot;world's strongest man&quot;, at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Chicago World's Fair]], overcoming the competition of rival Billings and his popular attraction, belly dancer [[Little Egypt (dancer)#Farida Mazar Spyropoulos|Little Egypt]], with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow's muscles).

Ziegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the [[Chicago Musical College]], and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.

Flo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star [[Anna Held]]. Despite losing all his money gambling at Monte Carlo, Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn't know Billings. Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty. Ziegfeld promises to give her &quot;more publicity than she ever dreams of&quot; and to feature her alongside America's most prominent theatrical performers.

At first, Anna's performance at the [[Herald Square Theatre]] is not a success. However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill. The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her. Audience members comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success. Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying &quot;you were magnificent my wife&quot;, and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers.

However, one success is not enough for the showman. He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will &quot;glorify&quot; the American girl. The new show, the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies.

Ziegfeld tries to make a star out of Audrey Dane, who is plagued with alcoholism, and he lures [[Fanny Brice]] from [[vaudeville]], showering both with lavish gifts. He gives stagehand [[Ray Bolger]] his break as well. Mary Lou, now a young woman, visits Ziegfeld, who doesn't recognize her initially, and hires her as a dancer.

The new production upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo's world does not revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey at the wrong moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings for a third time for the new show.

Flo meets the red-headed Broadway star [[Billie Burke]] and soon marries her. When she hears the news, a heartbroken Anna telephones Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named Patricia.

Flo's new shows are a success, but after a while, the public's taste changes, and people begin to wonder if the times have not passed him by. After a string of negative reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber's shop saying that he'll &quot;never produce another hit&quot;. Stung, he vows to have ''four'' hits on Broadway at the same time.

He achieves his goal, with the hits ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927), ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee!]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Three Musketeers (musical)|The Three Musketeers]]'', and invests over $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1929}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) of his earnings in the stock market. However, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] bankrupts him, forcing Billie to return to the stage.

Shaken by the reversal of his financial fortunes and the growing popularity of movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of ''The Ziegfeld Follies''. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]], in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, &quot;I've got to have more steps, higher, higher&quot;, before dying in his chair.

==Production==
Ziegfeld's widow, [[Billie Burke]], was keen to pay off Ziegfeld's debts without filing for bankruptcy, and sold the rights to a biopic of him to [[Universal Pictures]] in late 1933. As a result, the film went into the pre-production phase in January 1934.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} Macguire had initially proposed the biographical film to them in the form of a &quot;filmusical entertainment&quot; set in a &quot;theatrical tradition&quot; and William Powell was cast as Ziegfeld. However, by February 1935, Macguire had fallen into disagreement with Universal over financial problems at the studio,{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} and the entire production, including some already constructed sets and musical arrangements, was sold to MGM for US$300,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). As part of the deal however, Universal retained the services of Powell for the classic screwball comedy ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'', which was released the same year as ''The Great Ziegfeld''.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}

The film was shot at MGM Studios in Culver City, California mostly in the latter half of 1935 under a budget of US$1,500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}&lt;ref name=Media&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1936/film/reviews/the-great-ziegfeld-2-1200411276/|title=Review: &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;|work=Variety|date=April 15, 1936|access-date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost exceeded US$2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) by the end of the production in early 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Hanie, Jonathan, ''Great Ziegfeld – Mesmerizing Best Picture of 1936'', ''Orlando Movie Examiner'', Retrieved on August 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; exorbitant for the period, and it was MGM's most expensive film to date after ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1925).{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} The principal cinematography was shot by [[Oliver T. Marsh]], and [[George Folsey (cinematographer)|George J.

Gerstad]] is credited for the Hoctor Ballet.&lt;ref name=Media/&gt;

In the advertising for the film, MGM boasted of the film's ostentatious nature, bragging that it was &quot;SO BIG that only MGM could handle it&quot;, with its &quot;countless beauties, trained lions, ponies, dogs and other animals&quot;.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=177}} [[Busby Berkeley]], who had led [[Warner Brothers]] to become the leading producer of musicals in Hollywood in the 1930s, was a major influence on the producers which had &quot;glamorous, excessive 1930s cinematic musical numbers&quot;.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=167}} The film also came at a time when producers had begun seeing the economic and cultural importance of the cinematic medium in comparison to theater.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=167}} ''Variety'' notes that the film producers were likely very concerned with the presentation of the film after production was wrapped up, and that the long length of the film at 176 minutes was understandable in that they probably &quot;wanted to preserve as much footage as possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=Media/&gt; [[William S. Gray (film editor)|William S. Gray]] was responsible for the editing of the film.&lt;ref name=Media/&gt; Over a thousand people were employed in the production, and ''The Great Ziegfeld'' required 16 reels of film after the cutting.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}}

By coincidence, Universal's [[Show Boat (1936 film)|1936 film version of the Ziegfeld musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;]], the most faithful of all the film versions of the stage production, was filmed at the same time as ''The Great Ziegfeld'' and released in the same year.

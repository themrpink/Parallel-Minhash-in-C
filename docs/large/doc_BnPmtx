====Feast days====
[[Image:Ohrid annunciation icon.jpg|thumb|250px|An icon of the [[Annunciation]], the most important [[feast day]] on the [[Liturgical calendar of the Byzantine Rite|fixed calendar]] that can fall during Great Lent (Church of St. [[Clement of Ohrid]], [[North Macedonia]]).]]

Since the season of Great Lent is moveable, beginning on different dates from year to year, accommodation must be made for various feast days on the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|fixed calendar]] ([[Menaion]]) which occur during the season. When these feasts fall on a weekday of Great Lent, the normal Lenten aspect of the services is lessened to celebrate the solemnity.

The most important of these fixed feasts is the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Annunciation]] (March 25), which is considered to be so important that it is never moved, even if it should fall on the Sunday of Pascha itself (a rare and special occurrence which is known as ''[[Kyrio-Pascha]]''). The fast is also lessened, and the faithful are allowed to eat fish (unless it is Good Friday or Holy Saturday). Whereas on other weekdays of Great Lent, no celebration of the Divine Liturgy is permitted, there is a Liturgy (usually the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom|Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]]) celebrated on Annunciationâ€”even if it falls on [[Good Friday]].

When the [[feast day]] of the [[patron saint]] of the [[parish church]] or [[monastery]] falls on a weekday of Great Lent, there is no liturgy (other than the Presanctified), but fish is allowed at the meal.  In some churches the feast of a patron saint is moved to the nearest Saturday (excluding the Saturday of the Akathist), and in other churches, it is celebrated on the day of the feast itself.

When some other important feast occurs on a weekday, such as the [[First and Second Finding of the Head of John the Baptist]] (February 24), the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]] (March 9), etc., it is usually combined with the Lenten service, and wine and oil are allowed at the meal.

Regardless of the rank of the feast being celebrated, the Lenten hymns contained in the Triodion are never omitted, but are always chanted in their entirety, even on the feast of the Annunciation.

On the Saturdays, Sundays, and a number of weekdays during Great Lent, the service materials from the Triodion leave no room for the commemoration of the [[feast day|Saint of the day]] from the [[Menaion]]. In order that their services not be completely forgotten, a portion of them (their canon at Matins, and their stichera from &quot;Lord I Have Cried&quot; at Vespers) is chanted at [[Compline]].

===Readings===
In addition to the added readings from Scripture, spiritual books by the [[Church Fathers]] are recommended during the Fast.

One book commonly read during Great Lent, particularly by [[monasticism|monastics]], is ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'', which was written in about the 7th century by [[John of the Ladder|St. John of the Ladder]] when he was the [[Hegumen]] (Abbot) of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]]. ''The Ladder'' is usually read in the [[trapeza]] (refectory) during meals, but it may alternatively be read during the [[Little Hours]] on weekdays so that everyone can hear. Many of the [[laity]] also read ''The Ladder'' privately during Great Lent.

The theme of ''The Ladder'' is not Great Lent itself, but rather it deals with the ascent of the soul from earth to heaven. That is, from enslavement to the passions to the building up of the [[virtue]]s and its eventual [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] (union with God), which is the goal of Great Lent.

Besides the ''Ladder'', in some monasteries the ''[[Paradise of the Holy Fathers]]'' by [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]] and the penitential [[sermons]] of St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] are read during [[Matins]].

==Outline==
{{main|Paschal cycle}}
Liturgically, the period of the Triodion can be divided into three sections: (1) the Pre-Lenten period, (2) the Great Forty Days, and (3) Holy Week.

===Pre-Lenten period===
{{main|Pre-Lenten Season}}
Before the forty days of Great Lent commence, there is a three-week Pre-Lenten season, to prepare the faithful for the spiritual work they are to accomplish during the Great Fast. During this period many of the themes which will be developed in the liturgical texts of the forty days are introduced. Each week runs from Monday to Sunday and is named for the Gospel theme of the Sunday which concludes it.

In the Slavic tradition, with the addition of Zacchaeus Sunday, some regard the pre-Lenten period as lasting four weeks, but there are no liturgical indications that the week following the fifth Sunday before Lent (whether preceded by Zacchaeus Sunday or otherwise) is in any way Lenten, because Zacchaeus Sunday falls outside the ''[[Triodion]]'', the [[liturgical book]] which governs the pre-Lenten period and Lent itself.

====Zacchaeus Sunday====
[[Image:Hole zachaeus in tree.gif|thumb|[[Zacchaeus]] being called down from the tree (1908, William Hole).]]

In the Slavic liturgical traditions, Zacchaeus Sunday occurs on the fifth Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent (which starts on a Monday). Though there are no materials provided in the Lenten Triodion for this day, it is the very first day that is affected by the date of the upcoming Pascha (all the preceding days having been affected by the previous Pascha). This day has one sole Pre-Lenten feature: the [[Gospel]] reading is always the account of [[Zacchaeus]] from {{bibleverse||Luke|19:1-10|KJV}}, for which reason this Sunday is referred to as &quot;Zacchaeus Sunday&quot; (though the week before is not called &quot;Zacchaeus week&quot;).

This reading actually falls at the end of the [[lectionary]] cycle, being assigned to the 32nd Week after Pentecost. However, depending upon the date of the upcoming Pascha, the readings of the preceding weeks are either skipped (if Pascha will be early) or repeated (if it will be late) so that the readings for the 32nd Sunday after Pentecost always occur on the Sunday preceding the Week of the Publican and the Pharisee.

In the Byzantine (&quot;Greek&quot;) liturgical traditions, the Gospel reading for Zacchaeus remains in the normal lectionary cycle and does not always fall on the fifth Sunday before Lent. In fact, it usually falls a few weeks before, and the fifth Sunday before Lent is known as the Sunday of the Canaanite Woman after the story in {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:21-28|KJV}}.

The Lenten significance of the Gospel account of Zacchaeus is that it introduces the themes of pious zeal (Zacchaeus' climbing up the sycamore tree; Jesus' words: &quot;Zacchaeus, make haste&quot;), restraint (Jesus' words: &quot;come down&quot;), making a place for Jesus in the heart (&quot;I must abide at thy house&quot;), overcoming gossip (&quot;And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner&quot;), repentance and almsgiving (&quot;And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold&quot;), forgiveness and reconciliation (&quot;And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham&quot;), and the reason for the Passion and Resurrection (&quot;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost&quot;).

The [[Epistle]] reading for Zacchaeus Sunday is {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:9-15|KJV}}, which in and of itself has no Lenten theme, other than as an admonition to righteous behaviour.

====Publican and Pharisee====
The reading on the Sunday which concludes this week is the [[Parables of Jesus|Parable]] of the [[Publican and the Pharisee]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|18:10-14|KJV}}). The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is the first day the Lenten Triodion is used (at [[Vespers]] or [[All-Night Vigil]] on Saturday night), though it is only used for the Sunday services, with nothing pertaining to weekdays or Saturday. The theme of the hymns and readings on this Sunday is dedicated to the lessons to be learned from the parable: that righteous actions alone do not lead to salvation, that pride renders good deeds fruitless, that God can only be approached through a spirit of humility and repentance, and that God [[Justification (theology)|justifies]] the humble rather than the self-righteous. The week which follows the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is a fast-free week, to remind the faithful not to be prideful in their fasting as the Pharisee was ({{bibleverse||Luke|18:12|KJV}}).

The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is also the first day that ''structural'' changes (as opposed to simply substituting Lenten hymns for normal hymns from the [[octoechos (liturgy)|octoechos]] or [[menaion]]) are made to the Sunday services. For example, there begins to be a significant 'split' after the Great Prokimenon at [[Vespers]] that night.

====Prodigal Son====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s painting of the ''Return of the [[Prodigal Son]]''&lt;br /&gt;(c. 1662).]]

The theme of this week is the Parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:11-32|KJV}}). Again, the Triodion does not give [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] for the weekdays. The Gospel Reading on Sunday lays out one of the most important themes of the Lenten season: the process of falling into sin, realization of one's sinfulness, the road to repentance, and finally reconciliation, each of which is illustrated in the course of the parable.

The week following is the only week of the Triodion on which there is normal fasting (i.e. no meat, fish, wine, oil or animal products on Wednesday or Friday except if an important feast such as the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] or [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]] falls on that day, in which case certain foods are allowed).

====Meatfare Week====
The Saturday of this week is the first [[Saturday of the Dead]] observed during the Great Lenten season. The proper name in the [[typikon]] for the Sunday of this week is ''The Sunday of the [[Last Judgment]]'', indicating the theme of the Gospel of the day ({{bibleverse||Matthew|25:31-46|KJV}}). The popular name of &quot;Meatfare Sunday&quot; comes from the fact that this is the last day on which the laity are permitted to eat meat until Pascha (Byzantine Rite monks and nuns never eat meat).

====Cheesefare Week====
{{main|Cheesefare Week}}
During Cheesefare Week the eating of dairy products is permitted on every day (even Wednesday and Friday, which are normally observed as fast days throughout the year), though meat may no longer be eaten any day of the week. On the weekdays of this week, the first Lenten structural elements are introduced to the cycle of services on weekdays (the chanting of &quot;Alleluia&quot;, the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, making prostrations, etc.).

Wednesday and Friday are the most lenten, but some lenten elements are also observed on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The office of Cheesefare Saturday celebrates the &quot;Holy Ascetic Fathers&quot;.

Cheesefare Week is concluded on [[Cheesefare Sunday]]. The proper name for this Sunday is ''The Sunday of Forgiveness'', both because of the Gospel theme for the day ({{bibleverse||Matthew|6:14-21|KJV}}) and because it is the day on which everyone asks forgiveness of their neighbor. The popular name of &quot;Cheesefare Sunday&quot; derives from the fact that it is the last day to eat dairy products before Pascha. On this Sunday, Eastern Christians identify with [[Adam and Eve]], and forgive each other in order to obtain forgiveness from God, typically in a Forgiveness Vespers service that Sunday evening.

During Forgiveness Vespers (on Sunday evening) the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] in the church are changed to somber Lenten colours to reflect a penitential mood. At the end of the service comes the &quot;Ceremony of Mutual Forgiveness&quot; during which all of the people one by one ask forgiveness of one another, that the Great Fast may begin in a spirit of peace.

===The Great Forty Days===
The forty days of Great Lent last from Clean Monday until the Friday of the Sixth Week. Each of the Sundays of Great Lent has its own special commemoration, though these are not necessarily repeated during the preceding week.  An exception is the Week of the Cross (the Fourth Week), during which the theme of the preceding Sundayâ€”the [[Veneration of the Cross]]â€”is repeated throughout the week. The themes introduced in the Pre-Lenten period continue to be developed throughout the forty days.

====Clean Week====

The first week of Great Lent starting on [[Clean Monday]], the first day of Great Lent. The name &quot;Clean Week&quot; refers to the spiritual cleansing each of the faithful is encouraged to undergo through fasting, prayer, repentance, reception of the Holy Mysteries and begging forgiveness of his neighbor. It is also traditionally a time for [[spring cleaning]] so that one's outward surroundings matches his inward disposition.

Throughout this week fasting is most strict. Those who have the strength are encouraged to fast completely, eating only on Wednesday and Friday evenings, after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to keep such a strict fast are encouraged to eat only a little, and then only [[xerophagy]] (see [[Great Lent#Prodigal Son|Prodigal Son]]) once a day. On Monday, no food should be eaten at all and only uncooked food on Tuesday and Thursday. Meals are served on Saturday and Sunday, but these are fasting meals at which meat and dairy products are forbidden.

At [[Great Compline]] during the first four days of the Fast (Monday through Thursday) the Great Canon of St. [[Andrew of Crete]] is divided into four parts and one part is chanted each night (for further information about the Great Canon, see [[Great Lent#Fifth Week|Fifth Week]], below).

The First Saturday is called &quot;St. Theodore Saturday&quot; in honor of St. [[Theodore the Recruit]], a 4th-century [[martyr]]. At the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday (since, liturgically, the day begins at sunset) a special canon to St. Theodore, composed by St. [[John of Damascus]], is chanted. Then the priest blesses [[kolyva]] (boiled wheat with honey and raisins) which is distributed to the faithful in commemoration of the following miracle worked by St. Theodore on the First Saturday of Great Lent.

Fifty years after the death of St Theodore, the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] (361-363), as a part of his general policy of [[persecution of Christians]], commanded the governor of [[Constantinople]] during the first week of Great Lent to sprinkle all the food provisions in the marketplaces with the blood offered to pagan idols, knowing that the people would be hungry after the strict fasting of the first week. St Theodore appeared in a dream to Archbishop [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]], ordering him to inform all the Christians that no one should buy anything at the marketplaces, but rather to eat cooked wheat with honey (kolyva).

The First Sunday of Great Lent is the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]], which commemorates the restoration of the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s after the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclast]] controversy, which is considered to be the triumph of the Church over the last of the great [[heresy|heresies]] which troubled her (all later heresies being simply a rehashing of earlier ones).  Before the [[Divine Liturgy]] on this day, a special service, known as the &quot;[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]&quot; is held in [[cathedral]]s and major monasteries, at which the ''[[synodicon]]'' (containing [[anathema]]s against various heresies, and [[encomia]] of those who have held fast to the Christian faith) is proclaimed. The theme of the day is the victory of the True Faith over heresy. &quot;This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith&quot; ({{bibleverse|1|John|5:4|KJV}}). Also, the icons of the saints bear witness that man, &quot;created in the image and likeness of God&quot; ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:26|KJV}}), may become holy and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|godlike]] through the purification of himself as God's living image.

The First Sunday of Great Lent originally commemorated the [[Prophet]]s such as [[Moses]], [[Aaron]], and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]]. The Liturgy's [[Prokeimenon]] and [[alleluia]] verses as well as the [[Epistle]] (Hebrews 11:24-26,32-40) and [[Gospel]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:43-51|KJV}}) readings appointed for the day continue to reflect this older usage.

====Second Week====
The Second Sunday of Great Lent commemorates [[Gregory Palamas|St. Gregory Palamas]], the great defender of the Church's [[doctrine]] of [[Hesychasm]] against its attack by [[Barlaam of Calabria]]. The Epistle is Hebrews 1:10-14; 2:1-3 and the Gospel is {{bibleverse||Mark|2:1-12|KJV}}

Throughout this week, and until the Sixth Friday in Lent, one meal may be taken a day with [[xerophagy]]. Until the [[Lazarus Saturday|Sixth Saturday in Lent]], Saturday and Sunday fasting remains the same as in the First Week.

====Third Week====
The [[Veneration of the Cross]] is celebrated on the third Sunday. The veneration comes on this day because it is the midpoint of the forty days. The services for this day are similar to those on the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] (September 14). During the [[All-Night Vigil]] the priest brings the cross out into the center of the church, where it is venerated by the clergy and faithful. It remains in the center of the church through Friday of the week following (the Fourth Week of Great Lent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=14 Sunday of the Cross] Orthodox [[synaxarion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epistle is {{bibleverse||Hebrews|4:14-5:6|KJV}} and the Gospel is {{bibleverse||Mark|8:34-9:1|KJV}}.

====Fourth Week====
This week is celebrated as a sort of [[afterfeast]] of the Veneration of the Cross, during which some of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated each day. On Monday and Wednesday of the Fourth Week, a Veneration of the Cross takes place at the [[Prime (liturgy)|First Hour]] (repeating a portion of the service from the All-Night Vigil of the previous Sunday). On Friday of that week, the veneration takes place after the [[Ninth Hour]], after which the cross is solemnly returned to the sanctuary by the priest and deacon.

The Sunday which ends the fourth week is dedicated to [[St. John Climacus]], whose work, ''The Ladder of Divine Ascent'' has been read throughout the Great Lenten Fast.

====Fifth Week====
[[Image:Andrew of Crete.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon|Russian Icon]] depicting [[Andrew of Crete|St. Andrew of Crete]] (left) and [[St. Mary of Egypt]].]]

On Thursday of the Fifth Week, the Great Canon of [[Andrew of Crete|St. Andrew of Crete]] is chanted. This is the longest Canon of the church year, and during the course of its nine [[Ode]]s, most every person mentioned in the Bible is called to mind and tied to the theme of repentance. In anticipation of the Canon, Vespers on Wednesday afternoon is longer than normal, with special [[stichera]] added in honor of the Great Canon. The Great Canon itself is recited during [[Matins]] for Thursday, which is usually celebrated by anticipation on Wednesday evening, so that more people can attend.

As a part of the Matins of the Great Canon, the ''Life of St. Mary of Egypt'' by St. [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] (634 - 638) is read, for her example of repentance and overcoming temptation.  On this day also is chanted the famous [[kontakion]],  &quot;My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...&quot; by St. [[Romanos the Melodist]]. The next day (Thursday morning) a special Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated, and the fast is relaxed slightly (wine and oil are allowed) as consolation after the long service the night before.

Saturday of the Fifth Week is dedicated to the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God), and is known as the &quot;Saturday of the Akathist&quot; because the [[Akathist]] to the Theotokos is chanted during Matins on that day (again, usually anticipated on Friday evening).

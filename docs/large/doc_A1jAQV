In September 2012 a US official stated that the rebel militant group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] was manufacturing and using mustard gas in Syria and Iraq, which was allegedly confirmed by the group's head of chemical weapons development, Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who has since been captured.&lt;ref name=bbc-20150911&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34211838 |title=US official: 'IS making and using chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria' |author=Paul Blake |publisher=BBC |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-20150911&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-manufacturing-and-using-chemical-weapons-in-iraq-and-syria-us-official-claims-10496094.html |title=Isis 'manufacturing and using chemical weapons' in Iraq and Syria, US official claims |author=Lizzie Dearden |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 September 2015 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2016/03/09/america-has-captured-isis-scientist-in-charge-of-chemical-weapons/ |title=Captured ISIS head of chemical weapons says they've got mustard gas' |author= Jamie Schram |publisher=NYPost |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of the first chemotherapy drug====
As early as 1919 it was known that mustard agent was a suppressor of [[hematopoiesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=Rôle of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning: I. peripheral blood changes and their significance |journal=JAMA |doi=10.1001/jama.1919.26110010018009f|volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423423 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, autopsies performed on 75 soldiers who had died of mustard agent during [[World War I]] were done by researchers from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] who reported decreased counts of [[white blood cell]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faguet&quot; /&gt; This led the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to finance the biology and chemistry departments at [[Yale University]] to conduct research on the use of chemical warfare during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;faguet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard |journal=Am.

The results of this study were not published until 1946, when they were declassified.&lt;ref name=&quot;gilman&quot; /&gt; In a parallel track, after the [[air raid on Bari]] in December 1943, the doctors of the U.S. Army noted that white blood cell counts were reduced in their patients. Some years after World War II was over, the incident in Bari and the work of the Yale University group with nitrogen mustard converged, and this prompted a search for other similar [[chemical compound]]s. Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard called &quot;HN2&quot; became the first cancer [[chemotherapy]] drug, [[mustine]], to be used.

====Disposal====
In the United States, storage and incineration of mustard agent and other poison gases was carried out by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cma.army.mil/home.aspx The U.S. Army's Chemical Materials Agency (CMA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015020742/http://www.cma.army.mil/home.aspx |date=October 15, 2004}}. cma.army.mil. Retrieved on November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Disposal projects at the two remaining American chemical weapons sites, will be carried out at their sites near [[Richmond, Kentucky]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Although not yet Declassified,{{Specify|reason=If not yet declassified, how do we know about this?|date=September 2020}} toxicology specialists who dealt with the accidental puncturing of World War I gas stockpiles add that Air Force bases in Colorado have been made available to assist veterans of the 2003 American war with Iraq in which many Marines were exposed to gas as caches of up to 25,000 pounds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} The United Nations definition of a weapon of mass destruction for mustard gas is 30000 lb, typically the Marines and other coalition allies discovered caches of 25,000 pounds located across a road from 5,000 lb caches as multiple memoirs attest.

New detection techniques are being developed in order to detect the presence of mustard gas and its metabolites. The technology is portable and detects small quantities of the hazardous waste and its oxidized products, which are notorious for harming unsuspecting civilians. The [[immunochromatographic]] assay would eliminate the need for expensive, time-consuming lab tests and enable easy-to-read tests to protect civilians from sulfur-mustard dumping sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://docksci.com/competitive-immunochromatographic-assay-for-the-detection-of-thiodiglycol-sulfox_5a9bdc6fd64ab2d6e91e8ff2.html |title=Competitive immunochromatographic assay for the detection of thiodiglycol sulfoxide, a degradation product of sulfur mustard |journal=The Analyst|volume=139|issue=20|pages=5118–26|date=24 July 2014|doi=10.1039/C4AN00720D |pmid=25121638|last1=Sathe|first1=Manisha|last2=Srivastava|first2=Shruti|last3=Merwyn|first3=S.|last4=Agarwal|first4=G.

In 1946, 10,000 drums of mustard gas (2,800 tonnes) stored at the production facility of Stormont Chemicals in [[Cornwall, Ontario]], Canada were loaded onto 187 boxcars for the 900-mile journey to be buried at sea on board a {{Convert|400|foot|m|abbr=|adj=}} long barge {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} south of [[Sable Island]], southeast of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] at a depth of 600 fathoms. The dump location is 42 degrees, 50 minutes north by 60 degrees, 12 minutes west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hill 70 &amp; Cornwall's Deadly Mustard Gas Plant|url=https://cornwallcommunitymuseum.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/hill-70-cornwalls-deadly-mustard-gas-plant/|website=Cornwall Community Museum|publisher=Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Historical Society|access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large British stockpile of old mustard agent that had been made and stored since World War I at [[M. S. Factory, Valley]] near [[Rhydymwyn]] in [[Flintshire]], Wales, was destroyed in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valley Factory, Rhydymwyn|date=24 July 2010|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/r/rhydymwyn/defra_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the mustard gas agent found in Germany after [[World War II]] was dumped into the [[Baltic Sea]]. Between 1966 and 2002, fishermen have found about 700 chemical weapons in the region of [[Bornholm]], most of which contain mustard gas. One of the more frequently dumped weapons was the &quot;Sprühbüchse 37&quot; (SprüBü37, Spray Can 37, 1937 being the year of its fielding with the German Army). These weapons contain mustard gas mixed with a [[thickener]], which gives it a tar-like viscosity. When the content of the SprüBü37 comes in contact with water, only the mustard gas in the outer layers of the lumps of viscous mustard [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]], leaving behind amber-colored residues that still contain most of the active mustard gas. On mechanically breaking these lumps, e.g., with the drag board of a fishing net or by the human hand, the enclosed mustard gas is still as active as it had been at the time the weapon was dumped. These lumps, when washed ashore, can be mistaken for amber, which can lead to severe health problems. [[shell (projectile)|Artillery shells]] containing mustard gas and other toxic ammunition from World War I (as well as conventional explosives) can still be found in France and Belgium. These were formerly disposed of by explosion undersea, but since the current environmental regulations prohibit this, the [[French government]] is building an automated factory to dispose of the accumulation of chemical shells.

In 1972, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] banned the practice of disposing of chemical weapons into the ocean by the United States. 29,000 tons of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean off the United States by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. According to a report created in 1998 by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the [[U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency]], the army created at least 26 chemical weapons dumping sites in the ocean offshore from at least 11 states on both the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] (in [[Operation CHASE]], [[Operation Geranium]], etc.). In addition, due to poor recordkeeping, about one-half of the sites have only their rough locations known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bull|first=John|title=The Deadliness Below|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2005-10-30/news/0510300001_1_chemical-weapons-army-chemical-materials-agency-mustard-gas|publisher=Daily Press Virginia|date=30 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producing or stockpiling mustard gas is prohibited by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. When the convention entered force in 1997, the parties declared worldwide stockpiles of 17,440 tonnes of mustard gas. As of December 2015, 86% of these stockpiles had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons |date=30 November 2016 |title=Report of the OPCW on the Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction in 2015 |chapter-url=https://www.opcw.org/documents-reports/annual-reports/ |chapter=Annex 3 |page=42 |access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the [[stockpile (military)|stockpile]] of mustard agent in the United States was stored at the Edgewood Area of [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Maryland]]. Approximately 1,621 tons of mustard agent were stored in one-ton containers on the base under heavy guard. A chemical neutralization plant was built on the proving ground and neutralized the last of this stockpile in February 2005. This stockpile had priority because of the potential for quick reduction of risk to the community. The nearest schools were fitted with overpressurization machinery to protect the students and faculty in the event of a catastrophic explosion and fire at the site. These projects, as well as planning, equipment, and training assistance, were provided to the surrounding community as a part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint program of the Army and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/csepp1.shtm |title=CSEPP Background Information |publisher=US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |date=2 May 2006 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527013022/http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/csepp1.shtm |archive-date=27 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unexploded shells containing mustard agent and other chemical agents are still present in several test ranges in proximity to schools in the Edgewood area, but the smaller amounts of poison gas (four to 14 pounds) present considerably lower risks. These remnants are being detected and excavated systematically for disposal. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency oversaw disposal of several other chemical weapons stockpiles located across the United States in compliance with international chemical weapons treaties. These include the complete incineration of the chemical weapons stockpiled in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], and [[Oregon]]. Earlier, this agency had also completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile located on [[Johnston Atoll]] located south of [[Hawaii]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003676918 |title=Milestones in U.S. Chemical Weapons Storage and Destruction, fact sheet, US Chemical Materials Agency |access-date=15 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915081558/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003676918 |archive-date=15 September 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest mustard agent stockpile, of about 6,196 [[ton]]s, was stored at the [[Deseret Chemical Depot]] in northern [[Utah]]. The incineration of this stockpile began in 2006. In May 2011, the last one-ton tank of mustard agent was incinerated at the Deseret Chemical Depot, and the last mustard agent artillery shells at Deseret were incinerated in January 2012.

===WWII-era tests on men===
From 1943 to 1944, mustard agent experiments were performed on Australian service volunteers in tropical [[Queensland, Australia]], by [[British Army]] and American experimenters, resulting in some severe injuries. One test site, the [[Brook Islands National Park]], was chosen to simulate Pacific islands held by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The experiments were classified secret and as with [[Agent Orange#US Public Health Service, CDC and VA|Agent Orange]], claims for medical care and compensation were routinely denied, even after the WWII-era tests were declassified in 1993. The [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] stated that it would contact 4,000 surviving test subjects but failed to do so, eventually only contacting 600. Skin cancer, severe eczema, leukemia, and chronic breathing problems plagued the test subjects, some of whom were as young as 19 at the time of the tests, until their deaths, but even those who had previously filed claims with the VA went without compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/23/416408655/the-vas-broken-promise-to-thousands-of-vets-exposed-to-mustard-gas |title=The VA's Broken Promise To Thousands Of Vets Exposed To Mustard Gas |last=Dickerson |first=Caitlin |date=2015-06-23 |website=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |access-date=2019-05-03 |quote=... the Department of Veterans Affairs made two promises: to locate about 4,000 men who were used in the most extreme tests, and to compensate those who had permanent injuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection in biological fluids===
Urinary concentrations of the thiodiglycol hydrolysis products of mustard gas have been used to confirm a diagnosis of chemical poisoning in hospitalized victims. The presence in urine of 1,1'-sulfonylbismethylthioethane (SBMTE), a conjugation product with glutathione, is considered a more specific marker, since this metabolite is not found in specimens from unexposed persons. Intact mustard gas was detected in postmortem fluids and tissues of a man who died one week post-exposure.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Robert Endre Tarjan''' (born April 30, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]] and [[mathematician]].  He is the discoverer of several [[graph theory|graph]] algorithms, including [[Tarjan's off-line lowest common ancestors algorithm]], and co-inventor of both [[splay tree]]s and [[Fibonacci heap]]s. Tarjan is currently the [[James S. McDonnell]] Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science at [[Princeton University]], and the Chief Scientist at [[Intertrust Technologies Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intertrust.com/newsroom/leadership/#robert-e-tarjan|title=Intertrust Leadership|website=intertrust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], [[California]]. His father was a child psychiatrist specializing in mental retardation, and ran a state hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Out_of_Their_Minds&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Tarjan read a lot of science fiction, and wanted to be an [[astronomer]]. He became interested in [[mathematics]] after reading [[Martin Gardner]]'s mathematical games column in [[Scientific American]]. He became seriously interested in math in the eighth grade, thanks to a &quot;very stimulating&quot; teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was in high school, Tarjan got a job, where he worked IBM punch card collators. He first worked with real computers while studying astronomy at the [[Summer Science Program]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Out_of_Their_Minds&quot;/&gt;

Tarjan obtained a [[Bachelor's degree]] in mathematics from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1969.  At [[Stanford University]], he received his master's degree in computer science in 1971 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science (with a minor in mathematics) in 1972. At Stanford, he was supervised by [[Robert Floyd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Donald Knuth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;/&gt; both highly prominent computer scientists, and his Ph.D. dissertation was ''An Efficient Planarity Algorithm''. Tarjan selected computer science as his area of interest because he believed that computer science was a way of doing mathematics that could have a practical impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP_art_of_algo&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science career==
Tarjan has been teaching at Princeton University since 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP_art_of_algo&quot;/&gt; He has also held academic positions at [[Cornell University]] (1972–73), [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1973–1975), [[Stanford University]] (1974–1980), and [[New York University]] (1981–1985). He has also been a fellow of the NEC Research Institute (1989–1997).&lt;ref name=&quot;turing&quot;/&gt; In April 2013 he joined Microsoft Research Silicon Valley in addition to the position at Princeton. In October 2014 he rejoined Intertrust Technologies as chief scientist.

Tarjan has worked at AT&amp;T Bell Labs (1980–1989), Intertrust Technologies (1997–2001, 2014–present), Compaq (2002) and Hewlett Packard (2006–2013).

===Algorithms and data structures===
Tarjan is known for his pioneering work on graph theory algorithms and data structures. Some of his well-known algorithms include [[Tarjan's off-line least common ancestors algorithm]], and [[Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm]], and he was one of five co-authors of the [[median of medians]] linear time [[selection algorithm]]. The Hopcroft–Tarjan [[planarity testing]] algorithm was the first linear-time algorithm for planarity-testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | chapter = Planar Graphs
 | page = [https://archive.org/details/graphsalgorithms00will/page/n196 312]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarjan has also developed important data structures such as the [[Fibonacci heap]] (a heap data structure consisting of a forest of trees), and the [[splay tree]] (a self-adjusting binary search tree; co-invented by Tarjan and [[Daniel Sleator]]). Another significant contribution was the analysis of the [[disjoint-set data structure]]; he was the first to prove the optimal runtime involving the inverse [[Ackermann function]].

==Awards==
Tarjan received the [[Turing Award]] jointly with [[John Hopcroft]] in 1986.  The citation for the award states&lt;ref name=&quot;turing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/tarjan_1092048.cfm|title=Robert E Tarjan — A.M.

'''ITV Digital''' was a British [[digital terrestrial television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] which launched a pay-TV service on the world's first digital terrestrial television network. Its main shareholders were [[Carlton Communications plc]] and [[Granada plc]], owners of two franchises of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. Starting as '''ONdigital''' in 1998, the service was re-branded as ITV Digital in July 2001. Low audience figures, piracy issues and an ultimately unaffordable multi-million pound deal with the [[Football League]] led to the broadcaster suffering massive losses, forcing it to enter [[administration (law)|administration]] in March 2002. Pay television services ceased permanently on 1 May 2002, and the remaining free-to-air channels such as [[BBC One]] and [[Channel 4]] had ceased when the company was liquidated in October. The terrestrial [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]]es were subsequently taken over by [[Crown Castle]] and the [[BBC]] to create [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] later that month.

==History==
[[File:British Digital Broadcasting logo.png|thumb|British Digital Broadcasting logo (1997–1998)]]
{{see also|Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#History}}
On 31 January 1997, [[Carlton Television]], [[Granada Television]] and satellite company [[British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB), together created British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) as a [[joint venture]] and applied to operate three [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) licences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onhistory.co.uk/timeline/1997/01/31/carlton-granada-and-bskyb-form-british-digital-bro|title=Carlton, Granada, and BSkyB form British Digital Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt; They faced competition from a rival, Digital Television Network (DTN), a company created by cable operator CableTel (later known as [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/british-digital-broadcasting-targets-1-million-viewers-1276296.html|title=British Digital Broadcasting targets 1 million viewers}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1997, BDB won the auction and the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) awarded the sole broadcast licence for DTT to the consortium. Then on 20 December 1997, the ITC awarded three [[pay television|pay-TV]] digital multiplex licences to BDB.

That same year, however, the ITC forced BSkyB out of the consortium on competition grounds; this effectively placed Sky in direct competition with the new service as Sky would also launch its digital satellite service in 1998, although Sky was still required to provide key channels such as [[Sky Movies]] and [[Sky Sports]] to ONdigital.&lt;ref&gt;Itv Big Two lead digital revolution. Eric Reguly and Carol Midgley. The Times, Wednesday, 25 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; With Sky part of the consortium, ONdigital would have paid discounted rates to carry Sky's television channels. Instead, with its positioning as a competitor, Sky charged the full market rates for the channels, at an extra cost of around £60million a year to ONdigital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Monkey Business | series = [[The Money Programme]] | network = BBC Two | airdate = 2002-06-12 | minutes = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 1998, BDB announced the service would be called '''ONdigital''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 28 July 1998|title= UK Digital turn on for ONdigital|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/140880.stm|work= BBC News|access-date= 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed it would be the biggest television brand launch in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/140824.stm|title=BBC News – UK – D-day for digital TV|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company would be based in [[Marco Polo House]], now demolished, in Battersea, south London, which was previously the home of BSkyB's earlier rival, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB).

Six [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexes]] were set up, with three of them allocated to the existing [[Analog television|analogue]] broadcasters. The other three multiplexes were auctioned off. ONdigital was given one year from the award of the licence to launch the first DTT service. In addition to launching audio and video services, it also led the specification of an industry-wide advanced interactive engine, based on [[MHEG-5]]. This was an open standard that was used by all broadcasters on DTT.

From the beginning, however, the service was quickly losing money. Supply problems with set-top boxes meant that the company missed Christmas sales. Meanwhile, aggressive marketing by BSkyB for Sky Digital made the ONdigital offer look unattractive. The new digital satellite service provided a dish, [[Digibox (Sky Digital)|digibox]], installation and around 200 channels for £159, a lower price than ONdigital at £199. ONdigital's subscription pricing had been set to compare with the older Sky [[analogue television|analogue]] service of 20 channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/142310.stm|title=BBC News – Entertainment – BSkyB to woo digital market|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, digital cable services were launched by [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]], [[Telewest]] and [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable &amp; Wireless]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/323190.stm|title=BBC News – Entertainment – Digital cable TV 'will be a hit'|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

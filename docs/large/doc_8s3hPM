During medieval times Terra Australis was known by a different name, that being the [[Antipodes]]. First widely introduced to medieval western Europe by [[Isidore of Seville]] in his famous book the ''[[Etymologiae]]'', the idea gained popularity over Europe, and most scholars didn’t question its existence, instead debating if it was habitable for other humans. It would later be included on some zonal [[Mappa mundi]] and intrigue medieval scholars for centuries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Medieval|first=Daily|date=2012-06-22|title=Daily Medieval: The Antipodes|url=https://dailymedieval.blogspot.com/2012/06/antipodes.html|access-date=2020-07-12|website=Daily Medieval}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Haase|first1=Wolfgang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1LEmKPgJ8MC&amp;pg=241|title=The Classical Tradition and the Americas: European images of the Americas and the classical tradition (2 pts.)|last2=Reinhold|first2=Meyer|date=1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-011572-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Antipodes|url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01581a.htm|access-date=2020-07-12|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Medieval Antipodes {{!}} History Today|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/medieval-antipodes|access-date=2020-07-12|website=www.historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explorers of the [[Age of Discovery]], from the late 15th century on, proved that Africa was almost entirely surrounded by sea, and that the Indian Ocean was accessible from both west and east.  These discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion. Scientists such as [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuber|first=Mike A.|date=2011|title=The Armchair Discovery of the Unknown Southern Continent: Gerardus Mercator, Philosophical Pretensions and a Competitive Trade|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910165|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=16|issue=6|pages=505–541|via=|doi=10.1163/157338211X607772}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] as late as 1767&lt;ref name=Wilford /&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large [[landmass]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere|south]] as a [[counterweight]] to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of the hypothetical continent.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Pedro Vairo, TERRA AUSTRALIS Historical Charts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. Ed. Zagier &amp; Urruty Publicationa, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German cosmographer and mathematician [[Johannes Schöner]] (1477–1547) constructed a terrestrial globe in 1515, based on the world map and globe made by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and his colleagues at St. Dié in Lorraine in 1507. Where Schöner departs most conspicuously from Waldseemüller is in his globe's depiction of an Antarctic continent, called by him Brasilie Regio. His continent is based, however tenuously, on the report of an actual voyage: that of the Portuguese merchants Nuno Manuel and [[Christopher de Haro|Cristóvão de Haro]] to the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]], and related in the ''Newe Zeytung auss Presillg Landt'' (&quot;New Tidings from the Land of Brazil&quot;) published in Augsburg in 1514.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblio.wdfiles.com/local--files/schuller-1915-nova/schuller_1915_nova.pdf Newen Zeytung auss Presillg Landt]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Zeytung'' described the Portuguese voyagers passing through a strait between the southernmost point of America, or Brazil, and a land to the south west, referred to as ''vndtere Presill'' (or ''Brasilia inferior'').

This supposed &quot;strait&quot; was in fact the Rio de la Plata (or the [[San Matias Gulf]]). By &quot;vndtere Presill&quot;, the Zeytung meant that part of Brazil in the lower latitudes, but Schöner mistook it to mean the land on the southern side of the &quot;strait&quot;, in higher latitudes, and so gave to it the opposite meaning. On this slender foundation he constructed his circum-Antarctic continent to which, for the reasons that he does not explain, he gave an annular, or ring shape. In an accompanying explanatory treatise, ''Luculentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio'' (&quot;A Most Lucid Description of All Lands&quot;), he explained: &quot;The Portuguese, thus, sailed around this region, the Brasilie Regio, and discovered the passage very similar to that of our Europe (where we reside) and situated laterally between east and west.

From one side the land on the other is visible; and the cape of this region about 60 miles away, much as if one were sailing eastward through the Straits of Gibraltar or Seville and Barbary or Morocco in Africa, as our Globe shows toward the Antarctic Pole. Further, the distance is only moderate from this Region of Brazil to Malacca, where St. Thomas was crowned with martyrdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chet van Duzer]], ''Johann Schöner's Globe of 1515: Transcription and Study,'' Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, ''Transactions,'' Volume 100, Part 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this scrap of information, united with the concept of the Antipodes inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, Schöner constructed his representation of the southern continent. His strait served as inspiration for [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition to reach the Moluccas by a westward route.&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Wieser, ''Magalhães-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Schöner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert,'' Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took Magellan's discovery of Tierra del Fuego in 1520 as further confirmation of its existence, and on his globes of 1523 and 1533 he described it as ''terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita'' (&quot;Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known&quot;). It was taken up by his followers, the French cosmographer [[Oronce Fine]] in his world map of 1531, and the Flemish cartographers [[Gerardus Mercator]] in 1538 and [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1570. Schöner's concepts influenced the [[Dieppe]] school of mapmakers, notably in their representation of [[Jave la Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;Armand Rainaud, ''Le Continent Austral: Hypotheses et Découvertes,'' Paris, Colin, 1893 (repr. Amsterdam, Meridian Pub. Co., 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terra Australis'' was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. There was much interest in Terra Australis among [[Normandy|Norman]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] merchants at that time. In 1566 and 1570, Francisque and [[André d'Albaigne]] presented [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], Admiral of France, with projects for establishing relations with the Austral lands. Although the Admiral gave favourable consideration to these initiatives, they came to nought when Coligny was [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|killed in 1572]].&lt;ref&gt;E.T.

[[Image:Mercator World Map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Terra Australis occupies a large part of the southern hemisphere in this world map of 1587 by [[Rumold Mercator]].]]

Gerardus Mercator believed in the existence of a large Southern continent on the basis of cosmographic reasoning, set out in the abstract of his ''Atlas or Cosmographic Studies in Five Books,'' as related by his biographer, Walter Ghim, who said that even though Mercator was not ignorant that the Austral continent still lay hidden and unknown, he believed it could be &quot;demonstrated and proved by solid reasons and arguments to yield in its geometric proportions, size and weight, and importance to neither of the other two, nor possibly to be lesser or smaller, otherwise the constitution of the world could not hold together at its centre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ghim, &quot;Vita…Gerardi Mercatoris Rupelmundani&quot;, ''Gerardi Mercatoris Atlas sive Cosmographice Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricate Figura,'' Amsterdami, 1606, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flemish geographer and cartographer, [[Cornelius Wytfliet]], wrote concerning the ''Terra Australis'' in his 1597 book, ''Descriptionis Ptolemaicae Augmentum: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The terra Australis is therefore the southernmost of all other lands, directly beneath the antarctic circle; extending beyond the tropic of Capricorn to the West, it ends almost at the equator itself, and separated by a narrow strait lies on the East opposite to New Guinea, only known so far by a few shores because after one voyage and another that route has been given up and unless sailors are forced and driven by stress of winds it is seldom visited. The terra Australis begins at two or three degrees below the equator and it is said by some to be of such magnitude that if at any time it is fully discovered they think it will be the fifth part of the world.

Adjoining Guinea on the right are the numerous and vast Solomon Islands which lately became famous by the voyage of Alvarus Mendanius.&lt;ref&gt;Australis igitur terra omnium aliarum terrarum australissima, directe subiecta antarctico circulo, Tropicum Capricorni vltra ad Occidentem excurrens, in ipfo penè aequatore finitur, tenuique difcreta freto Nouam Guineam Orienti obijcit, paucis tãtum hactenus littoribus cognitam, quòd post vnam atque alteram nauigationem, curfus ille intermissus fit, &amp; nisi coactis impulsifquc nautis ventorum turbine, rarius eò adnauigetur.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;José Toribio Medina, ''El Piloto Juan Fernandez,'' Santiago de Chile, 1918, reprinted by Gabriela Mistral, 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;136, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Polus Antarcticus'' map of 1641 by [[Hendrik Hondius II|Henricus Hondius]], bears the inscription: ''&quot;Insulas esse a Nova Guinea usque ad Fretum Magellanicum affirmat Hernandus Galego, qui ad eas explorandas missus fuit a Rege Hispaniae Anno 1576'' (Hernando Gallego, who in the year 1576 was sent by the King of Spain to explore them, affirms that there are islands from New Guinea up to the Strait of Magellan)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;An on-line image of this map is at: http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-t732.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[Luís Vaz de Torres]], a [[Galician people|Galician]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigator who commanded the ''San Pedro y San Pablo'', the ''San Pedrico'' and the tender or yacht, ''Los Tres Reyes Magos'' during the 1605–1606 expedition led by [[Pedro Fernandes de Queiros]] in quest of the Southern Continent, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. Commenting on this in 1622, the Dutch cartographer and publisher of Queiros' eighth memorial, [[Hessel Gerritsz]], noted on his ''Map of the Pacific Ocean:'' &quot;Those who sailed with the yacht of Pedro Fernando de Quiros in the neighbourhood of New Guinea to 10 degrees westward through many islands and shoals and over 23 and 24 fathoms for as many as 40 days, estimated that Nova Guinea does not extend beyond 10 degrees to the south; if this be so, then the land from 9 to 14 degrees would be a separate land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel Gerritsz (c. 1581–1632), ''Map of the Pacific Ocean,'' 1622, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, département des Cartes et Plans, SH, Arch. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], another Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/spanish-quest-terra-australis |title=The Spanish quest for Terra Australis |date=13 November 2015 | publisher=State Library of New South Wales |accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented this to the King of [[Spain]] as the Terra Australis incognita. In his 10th Memorial (1610), Queirós said: &quot;New Guinea is the top end of the Austral Land of which I treat [discuss], and that people, and customs, with all the rest referred to, resemble them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2014/D23411/a6314001.pdf Translation by Dolores Turró of Memorial No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch father and son Isaac and [[Jacob Le Maire]] established the Australische Compagnie (Australian Company) in 1615 to trade with Terra Australis, which they called &quot;Australia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Spieghel der Australische Navigatie;'' cited by A.

The cartographic depictions of the southern continent in the 16th and early 17th centuries, as might be expected for a concept based on such abundant conjecture and minimal data, varied wildly from map to map; in general, the continent shrank as potential locations were reinterpreted.  At its largest, the continent included [[Tierra del Fuego]], separated from South America by a small strait; [[New Guinea]]; and what would come to be called [[Australia]].  In Ortelius's atlas ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'', published in 1570, Terra Australis extends north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Pacific Ocean.

As long as it appeared on maps at all, the continent minimally included the unexplored lands around the [[South Pole]], but generally much larger than the real [[Antarctica]], spreading far north&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[New Zealand]], first seen by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]] in 1642, was regarded by some as a part of the continent.

===18th century===
[[Alexander Dalrymple]], the Examiner of Sea Journals for the English [[East India Company]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard T. Fry, ''Alexander Dalrymple (1737–1808) and the Expansion of British Trade,'' London, Cass for the Royal Commonwealth Society, 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst translating some Spanish documents [[British occupation of Manila|captured in the Philippines in 1762]], found de Torres's testimony.  This discovery led Dalrymple to publish the ''Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean'' in 1770–1771. Dalrymple presented a beguiling tableau of the Terra Australis, or Southern Continent:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of inhabitants in the Southern Continent is probably more than 50 millions, considering the extent, from the eastern part discovered by Juan Fernandez, to the western coast seen by Tasman, is about 100 deg. of longitude, which in the latitude of 40 deg. amounts to 4596 geographic, or 5323 stature miles. This is a greater extent than the whole civilized part of Asia, from Turkey to the eastern extremity of China. There is at present no trade from Europe thither, though the scraps from this table would be sufficient to maintain the power, dominion, and sovereignty of Britain, by employing all its manufacturers and ships. Whoever considers the Peruvian empire, where arts and industry flourished under one of the wisest systems of government, which was founded by a stranger, must have very sanguine expectations of the southern continent, from whence it is more than probable Mango Capac, the first Inca, was derived, and must be convinced that the country, from whence Mango Capac introduced the comforts of civilized life, cannot fail of amply rewarding the fortunate people who shall bestow letters instead of quippos ([[quipus]]), and iron in place of more awkward substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Dalrymple, ''An Historical Collection of the several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean,'' Vol.I, London, 1769 and 1770, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxviii–xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dalrymple's claim of the existence of an unknown continent aroused widespread interest and prompted the British government in 1769 to order [[James Cook]] in [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] to seek out the Southern Continent to the South and West of [[Tahiti]], discovered in June 1767 by [[Samuel Wallis]] in {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} and named by him King George Island.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cook, Introduction to ''An account of the discoveries made in the South Pacifick Ocean&amp;nbsp;/ by Alexander Dalrymple'' ; first printed in 1767, reissued with a foreword by Kevin Fewster and an essay by Andrew Cook, Potts Point (NSW), Hordern House Rare Books for the Australian National Maritime Museum, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The London press reported in June 1768 that two ships would be sent to the newly discovered island and from there to &quot;attempt the Discovery of the Southern Continent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The St. James's Chronicle'', 11 June and ''The Public Advertiser,'' 13 June 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent press report stated: &quot;We are informed, that the Island which Captain Wallis has discovered in the South-Sea, and named George's Land, is about fifteen hundred Leagues to the Westward and to Leeward of the Coast of Peru, and about five-and-thirty Leagues in circumference; that its principal and almost sole national Advantage is, its Situation for exploring the Terra Incognita of the Southern Hemisphere. The Endeavour, a North-Country Cat, is purchased by the Government, and commanded by a Lieutenant of the Navy; she is fitting out at Deptford for the South-Sea, thought to be intended for the newly-discovered Island&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The St. James's Chronicle, 18 June, ''The Gazetteer,'' 20 June and' 'The Westminster Journal,'' 25 June 1768''.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the expedition were revealed in days following: &quot;To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt. Cook, for the South Seas, under the direction of the Royal Society, to observe the Transit of Venus next summer, and to make discoveries to the South and West of Cape Horn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Evening Post,'' 5 August, ''The St. James's Chronicle,'' 6 August, ''Courier du Bas-Rhin'' (Cleves), 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; The London ''Gazetteer'' was more explicit when it reported on 18 August 1768: &quot;The gentlemen, who are to sail in a few days for George's Land, the new discovered island in the Pacific ocean, with an intention to observe the Transit of Venus, are likewise, we are credibly informed, to attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract, above the latitude 40&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Also in ''Lloyd's Evening Post,'' 19 August and ''The New York Journal,'' 3 November 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this [[first voyage of James Cook]] in respect of the quest for the Southern Continent were summed up by Cook himself. He wrote in his Journal on 31 March 1770 that the ''Endeavour's'' voyage &quot;must be allowed to have set aside the most, if not all, the Arguments and proofs that have been advanced by different Authors to prove that there must be a Southern Continent; I mean to the Northward of 40 degrees South, for what may lie to the Southward of that Latitude I know not&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8106/8106-h/8106-h.htm#ch6 W.J.L.

==Decline of the idea==
[[Image:terraaustralis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The available territory for a southern continent had diminished greatly in this 1657 map by [[Jan Janssonius]]. ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (&quot;unknown southern land&quot;) is printed across a region including the south pole without any definite shorelines.]]
Over the centuries the idea of Terra Australis gradually lost its hold. In 1616, [[Jacob Le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of [[Cape Horn]] proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island, while in 1642 [[Abel Tasman]]'s first Pacific voyage proved that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. Much later, [[James Cook]] sailed around most of New Zealand in 1770, showing that even it could not be part of a large continent. On his [[Second_voyage_of_James_Cook|second voyage]] he [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe at a very high southern [[latitude]], at some places even crossing the [[Antarctic Circle]], showing that any possible southern continent must lie well within the cold polar areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wales&quot;/&gt; There could be no extension into regions with a [[temperate climate]], as had been thought before. In 1814, [[Matthew Flinders]] published the book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]].'' Flinders had concluded that the Terra Australis as hypothesized by [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]] did not exist, so he wanted the name applied to what he saw as the next best thing: &quot;[[Australia]]&quot;. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...with the accompanying note at the bottom of the page:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term, it would have been to convert it into AUSTRALIA; as being more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flinders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His conclusion would soon be revealed as a mistake, but by that time the name had stuck.&lt;ref&gt;Avan Judd Stallard, &quot;Origins of the Idea of Antipodes: Errors, Assumptions, and a Bare Few Facts&quot;, ''Terrae Incognitae,'' Volume 42, Number 1, September 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Province of Beach}}

==The Province of Beach==

A land feature known as the &quot;Province of Beach&quot; or &quot;Boeach&quot; – from the Latin ''Provincia boëach'' – appears to have resulted from mistranscriptions of a name in Marco Polo's ''[[Il Milione]]'' (Book III). Polo described his journey by sea from China to India by way of [[Champa]] (''provincia ciamba''; modern southern Vietnam),  ''[[Jave la Grande|Java Major]]''), ''Locach'' (modern [[Lop Buri]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lavo (Thai ลพบร) was named after Lavo, the son of [[Rama]] in [[Hindu mythology]]). (G. E. Gerini, ''Researches on Ptolemy's geography of Eastern Asia (further India and Indo-Malay archipelago),'' London, Royal Asiatic Society, Asiatic Society Monographs vol.1, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt;   and [[Sumatra]] (''Java Minor''). In [[Cantonese]], Lavo (an early name of Lop Buri) was pronounced &quot;Lo-huk&quot; 羅斛  and ''Locach'' was Marco Polo's transcription of this name.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on [[Marco Polo]],'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, pp.&amp;nbsp;768–9, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was &quot;so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it&quot;. Polo's narrative describes the route southward from Champa toward [[Sumatra]], but by a slip of the pen the name &quot;Java&quot; (which Polo did not himself visit) was substituted for &quot;Champa&quot; as the point of departure,&lt;ref&gt;''Milione: il Milione nelle redazioni toscana e franco–italiana, Le Divisament dou Monde,'' Gabriella Ponchi (ed.), Milano, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;540: cap. clxiii, &quot;La grant isle de Java&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby mis-locating Sumatra  and Lochach south of Java (rather than Champa). Consequently, some geographers believed that Sumatra and Lochcach were near, or extensions of, ''Terra Australis''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. McClymont, &quot;The Theory of an Antipodal Southern Continent during the Sixteenth Century&quot;, ''Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,'' Hobart, January 1892, Hobart, the Association, 1893, pp.&amp;nbsp;442–462; Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on Marco Polo,'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, p.&amp;nbsp;769.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kurrent|German cursive script]], ''Locach'' and ''Boeach'' look similar. A feature known as the &quot;Province of Beach&quot; or &quot;Boeach&quot; – from the Latin ''Provincia boëach'' – appears on European maps as early as the 15th century. On a map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by [[Henricus Martellus]], the Latin name ''provincia boëach'' is given to a southern neighbour of Champa. In fact, by 1532, in an edition of [[The Travels of Marco Polo|Marco Polo's ''Travels'']], Locach was changed to ''Boëach'', later shortened to ''Beach''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, ''Novus Orbis Regionum ac Insularum,'' Basel and Paris, 1532, Marco Polo cap.xi, &quot;De provincia Boëach&quot;; cited in Thomas Suarez, ''Early Mapping of Southeast Asia,'' Hong Kong, Periplus, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-16th century, according to [[Henry Yule]], the editor of a modern (1921) edition of Polo's ''Travels'', some geographers and cartographers followed the error in older editions of Polo that &quot;placed ... the land of &quot;Boeach&quot; (or Locac)&quot; south-east of Java and &quot;introduced in their maps a continent in that situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Henry Yule (ed.), ''The Book of Ser Marco Polo,'' London, Murray, 1921, Volume 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;276–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard Mercator]] did just that on his 1541 globe,  placing ''Beach provincia aurifera'' (&quot;Beach the gold-bearing province&quot;) in the northernmost part of the ''Terra Australis'' in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo's ''Travels''. The landmass of Beach remained in this location on Mercator's world map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, ''Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem'' (&quot;Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people&quot;) with ''Lucach regnum'' shown somewhat to its south west.&lt;ref&gt;Peter van der Krogt, ''Globi Neerlandici: The Production of Globes in the Low Countries,'' Utrecht, HES Publishers, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;64, plate 2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mercator, [[Abraham Ortelius]] also showed &lt;small&gt;''BEACH''&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;''LVCACH''&lt;/small&gt; in these locations on his world map of 1571.

In 1596, on a popular map by [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]], showed  &lt;small&gt;''BEACH''&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;''LOCACH''&lt;/small&gt;, projecting from the map's southern edge as the northernmost parts of the ''Terra Australis'' long hypothesized by Europeans.  Ironically, an accidental encounter by the Dutch vessel ''Eendracht'', commanded by [[Dirk Hartog]], with [[Shark Bay, Western Australia]] in 1616, appeared to confirm that land existed where the maps showed ''Beach''; Hartog named the wider  landmass ''[[Eendrachtsland]]'', after his ship. Nevertheless, the old name persisted for some time: in August 1642, the Council of the [[Dutch East India Company]] – evidently still relying on Linschoten's map – despatched [[Abel Tasman]] and [[Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher]] on a voyage of exploration to areas, including Beach and its purported gold,  between the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Staten Land]] (near [[Cape Horn]]) and south of the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of &quot;all the totally unknown provinces of Beach&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Heeres, &quot;Abel Janszoon Tasman, His Life and Labours&quot;, ''Abel Tasman's Journal,'' Los Angeles, 1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;137, 141–2; cited in Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctica==
[[Antarctica]] was finally [[History of Antarctica#First sighting|sighted]] in the hypothetical area of Terra Australis in 1820. The extent of Terra Australis was finally determined, also proving the [[Southern Hemisphere]] has much less land than the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]].

==In fiction==
The unexplored southern continent was a frequent subject of fantastic fiction in the 17th and 18th centuries in the [[imaginary voyages]] genre. Among the works which dealt with imaginary visits to the continent (which at the time was still believed to be real) were:
* ''[[Mundus alter et idem]], sive Terra Australis antehac semper incognita lustrata'' (1605), a satirical Latin work by [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], Bishop of Norwich.
* ''The Isle of Pines, or, A late discovery of a fourth island near Terra Australis incognita, by Henry Cornelius van Sloetten'' (1668) by Henry Neville.
* ''La terre australe connue'' (1676) by [[Gabriel de Foigny]].
* ''Histoire des Sevarambes'' (1675–1679) by [[Denis Vairasse|Denis Vairasse d'Allais]].
* ''Voyages et avantures de Jaques Massé'' (c. 1715, falsely dated 1710) by Tyssot de Patot.
* ''Miscellanea aurea: The Fortunate Shipwreck, or a description of New Athens in Terra Australis incognita'' (1720) by Thomas Killigrew.
* ''Relation d'un voyage du Pole Arctique, au Pole Antarctique par le centre du monde'' (1721), anonymous.
* ''Relation du royaume des Féliciens'' (1727) by the Marquis de Lassay.
* ''Viaggi di Enrico Wanton alle Terre incognite Australi'' (1749) by Zaccaria Seriman.
* ''Voyage de Robertson, aux Terres Australes, traduit sur le manuscrit anglois'' (1767), anonymous.
* ''La découverte australe par un homme-volant'' (1781) by [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Restif de la Bretonne]].
* The idea of ''Terra Australis'' was also used by [[Terry Pratchett]] in his [[Discworld]] series of novels (1983–2014) where the World is balanced by the strange and little-known [[Counterweight Continent]].

[[Queen's University Belfast]]. Retrieved 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] that form [[Northern Ireland]]. Adjoined to the north-east shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of {{convert|3046|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28893/Antrim|title=Antrim|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a population of about 618,000. County Antrim has a population density of 203 people per square kilometre or 526 people per square mile.&lt;ref&gt;Divide the population of County Antrim (618,108) by the area (3046 km2)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the thirty-two traditional [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of [[Ireland]], as well as part of the historic [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]].

The [[Glens of Antrim]] offer isolated rugged landscapes, the [[Giant's Causeway]] is a unique landscape and a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], [[Bushmills]] produces whiskey, and [[Portrush]] is a popular seaside resort and night-life area. The majority of [[Belfast]], the capital city of Northern Ireland, is in County Antrim, with the remainder being in [[County Down]].

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], it is currently one of only two counties of Ireland in which a majority of the population are from a [[Protestant]] background. The other is [[County Down]] to the south.

==Geography==
[[File:Glendun - geograph.org.uk - 465779.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Glens of Antrim at Glendun]]

[[Image:Larne Harbour from Inver.jpg|250px|thumb|Larne Harbour]]

A large portion of Antrim is hilly, especially in the east, where the highest elevations are attained. The range runs north and south, and, following this direction, the highest points are Knocklayd {{convert|514|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, [[Slieveanorra Forest|Slieveanorra]] {{convert|508|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, Trostan {{convert|550|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, [[Slemish]] {{convert|437|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, Agnew's Hill {{convert|474|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and Divis {{convert|478|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Mountain Views | publisher = Simon Stewart | url = http://mountainviews.ie/mv/index.php?ids=summit_view&amp;mtnindex=361 | accessdate = 30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inland slope is gradual, but on the northern shore the range terminates in abrupt and almost perpendicular declivities, and here, consequently, some of the finest coast scenery in the world is found, widely differing, with its unbroken lines of cliffs, from the indented coast-line of the west. The most remarkable cliffs are those formed of perpendicular basaltic columns, extending for many miles, and most strikingly displayed in [[Fair Head]] and the celebrated [[Giant's Causeway]]. From the eastern coast the hills rise instantly but less abruptly, and the indentations are wider and deeper. On both coasts there are several resort towns, including [[Portrush]] (with well-known golf links), [[Portballintrae]] and [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]]; on the east [[Cushendun]], [[Cushendall]] and [[Waterfoot, County Antrim|Waterfoot]] on Red Bay, [[Carnlough]] and [[Glenarm]], [[Larne]] on the [[Sea of Moyle]], and [[Whitehead, County Antrim|Whitehead]] on Belfast Lough. All are somewhat exposed to the easterly winds prevalent in spring. The only island of size is the L-shaped [[Rathlin Island]], off Ballycastle, {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total length by {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} maximum breadth, {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast, and of similar basaltic and limestone formation to that of the mainland. It is partially arable, and supports a small population. [[Islandmagee]] is a peninsula separating [[Larne Lough]] from the [[North Channel (British Isles)|North Channel]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Antrim (county)|volume=2|pages=152–154|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valleys of the [[River Bann|Bann]] and [[River Lagan|Lagan]], with the intervening shores of Lough Neagh, form the fertile lowlands. These two rivers, both rising in County Down, are the only ones of importance. The latter flows to Belfast Lough, the former drains Lough Neagh, which is fed by a number of smaller streams. The fisheries of the Bann and of Lough Neagh (especially for [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s) are of value both commercially and to sportsmen, the small town of [[Toome]], at the outflow of the river, being the centre. Immediately below this point lies [[Lough Beg]], the &quot;Small Lake&quot;, about {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower than Lough Neagh.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Transport==
County Antrim has a number of air, rail and sea links.

===Air===
Northern Ireland's main airport, [[Belfast International Airport]], at Aldergrove is in County Antrim. Belfast International shares its runways with [[RAF Aldergrove|38 Brigade Flying Station Aldergrove]], which otherwise has its own facilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} It is the fifth-largest regional air cargo centre in the UK. There are regular services to Great Britain, Europe and North America.

The region is also served by [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], a mile east of [[Belfast City Centre|Belfast city centre]] on the County Down side of the city, which was renamed in 2006 in honour of [[Association football|footballer]] [[George Best]].

===Rail===
{{See also|:Category:Railway stations in County Antrim}}

The main [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] [[Northern Ireland Railways]] routes are the major line between Belfast, Antrim, [[Ballymena]], [[Coleraine]] and [[Derry]], Belfast to [[Carrickfergus]] and [[Larne]], the port for [[Stranraer]] in Scotland and Coleraine to [[Portrush]].

===Sea===
Two of Northern Ireland's main ports are in County Antrim, [[Larne]] and [[Belfast]].

Ferries sail from Larne Harbour to destinations including [[Cairnryan]] in Scotland.

The [[Port of Belfast]] is Northern Ireland's principal maritime gateway, serving the Northern Ireland economy and increasingly that of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is a major centre of industry and commerce and has become established as the focus of logistics activity for Northern Ireland. Around two-thirds of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade, and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole is handled at the port, which receives over 6,000 vessels each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfast-harbour.co.uk/about-us.htm |title=About Us |work=Belfast Harbour |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529143348/http://www.belfast-harbour.co.uk/about-us.htm |archivedate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

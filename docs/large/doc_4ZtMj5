==Aftermath==
The signing of the treaty settled immediate difficulties in the Far East and created three decades of peace between the two nations. The treaty confirmed Japan's emergence as the pre-eminent power in East Asia and forced Russia to abandon its [[expansionist]] policies there, but it was not well received by the Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5D8103AE733A25750C0A96F9C946497D6CF&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=order+of+meiji&amp;st=p &quot;Japan's Present Crisis and Her Constitution; The Mikado's Ministers Will Be Held Responsible by the People for the Peace Treaty – Marquis Ito May Be Able to Save Baron Komura,&quot;] ''New York Times''. September 3, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese public were aware of their country's unbroken string of military victories over the Russians but were less aware of the precarious overextension of military and economic power that the victories had required. News of the terms of the treaty appeared to show Japanese weakness in front of the European powers, and this frustration caused the [[Hibiya riots]] and the collapse of [[Katsura Tarō]]'s cabinet on January 7, 1906.&lt;ref name= Kowner/&gt;

Because of the role played by Roosevelt, the United States became a significant force in world diplomacy. Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for his backchannel efforts before and during the peace negotiations even though he never actually went to Portsmouth.

In 1994, the Portsmouth Peace Treaty Forum was created by the Japan-America Society of New Hampshire to commemorate the Portsmouth Peace Treaty with the first formal meeting between Japanese and Russian scholars and diplomats in Portsmouth since 1905. As the Treaty of Portsmouth was one of the most powerful symbols of peace in the Northern Pacific region and the most significant shared peace history of Japan, Russia, and the United States, the forum was designed to explore from the Japanese, Russian, and American perspectives, the history of the Portsmouth Treaty and its relevance to current issues involving the Northern Pacific region. The forum is intended to focus modern scholarship on international problems in the &quot;spirit of the Portsmouth Peace Treaty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;The First Portsmouth Peace Treaty Forum June 15, 1994&quot; (2005) [http://www.portsmouthpeacetreaty.com/first_forum_index.cfm online ]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aurora''' (plural: '''auroras''' or '''aurorae'''),{{efn|The name &quot;auroras&quot; is now the more common plural of &quot;aurora&quot;{{citation needed|reason=the only provided ref does not state this|date=October 2019}}, however ''aurorae'' is the original Latin plural and is often used by scientists; in some contexts, aurora is an uncountable noun, multiple sightings being referred to as &quot;the aurora&quot;.

Modern style guides recommend that the names of [[meteorological phenomena]], such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |access-date=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |archive-date=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} sometimes referred to as '''polar lights''' (aurora polaris), '''northern lights''' (aurora borealis), or '''southern lights''' (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in [[polar regions of Earth|high-latitude regions]] (around the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]).

Auroras are the result of disturbances in the [[magnetosphere]] caused by [[solar wind]]. These disturbances are sometimes strong enough to alter the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, [[Electron precipitation|precipitate]] into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]).

The resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;aurora&quot; is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/aurora|title=Aurora|editor-last=Harper|editor-first=Douglas|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=14 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek poets used the name metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colours across the otherwise dark sky (''e.g.'', &quot;rosy-fingered dawn&quot;). {{Citation needed|reason=No citation and the pages 'Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate' and'Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age § Colour controversy' on Wikipedia show how this is rather unlikely, or at least a mistranslation|date=June 2020}}

==Occurrence==
Most auroras occur in a band known as the &quot;auroral zone&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;feldstein86&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldstein |first=Y.

A region that currently displays an aurora is called the &quot;auroral oval&quot;, a band displaced by the solar wind towards the night side of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gLwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|title=Illustrated Glossary for Solar and Solar-Terrestrial Physics|last1=Bruzek|first1=A.|last2=Durrant|first2=C.

===Germany===
Trial by jury was introduced in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848. However, it remained controversial; and, early in the 20th century, there were moves to abolish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [139] | doi= 10.1086/467481 | s2cid = 144941508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emminger Reform]] of January 4, 1924, during an [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] state of emergency, abolished the jury system and replaced it with a mixed system including bench trials and [[lay judge]]s.

In 1925, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] called for the reinstitution of the jury; a special meeting of the German Bar demanded revocation of the decrees, but &quot;on the whole the abolition of the jury caused little commotion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [140] | doi=10.1086/467481| s2cid = 144941508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their verdicts were widely perceived as [[Justice|unjust]] and inconsistent.

Today, most misdemeanors are tried by a ''Strafrichter'', meaning a single judge at an ''Amtsgericht''; felonies and more severe misdemeanors are tried by a ''Schöffengericht'', also located at the ''Amtsgericht'', composed of 1 judge and 2 lay judges; some felonies are heard by ''Erweitertes Schöffengericht'', or extended ''Schöffengericht'', composed of 2 judges and 2 lay judges; severe felonies and other &quot;special&quot; crimes are tried by the ''große Strafkammer'', composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges at the ''Landgericht'', with specially assigned courts for some crimes called ''Sonderstrafkammer'';  felonies resulting in the death of a human being are tried by the ''Schwurgericht'', composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges, located at the ''Landgericht''; and serious crimes against the state are tried by the ''Strafsenat'', composed of 5 judges, at an ''Oberlandesgericht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Lay Judges in the German Criminal Courts | first1 = Gerhard | last1= Casper | first2= Hans | last2= Zeisel | journal= Journal of Legal Studies | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | date= January 1972 | jstor= 724014 | pages= 135–191 [142] | doi=10.1086/467481| s2cid = 144941508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some civil cases, such as commercial law or patent law, there are also lay judges, who have to meet certain criteria (e.g., being a merchant).

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Jury system in Hong Kong}}
Article 86 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] assures the practice of jury trials. Criminal cases in the High Court and some civil cases are tried by a jury in [[Hong Kong]]. There is no jury in the District Court. In addition, from time to time, the Coroner's Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest.  Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.

Although article 86 of the basic law states that ‘the principle of trial by jury previously practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained’, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by a jury. In the case ''Chiang Lily v. Secretary for Justice'' (2010), the Court of Final Appeal agreed that ‘there is no right to trial by jury in Hong Kong.’

===India===
Jury trials were abolished in most Indian courts by the [[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973|1973 Code of Criminal Procedure]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.droit.ens.fr/IMG/pdf/Lay_Justice_in_India_1.pdf|title=Lay Justice in India|last=Jean-Louis Halpérin|author-link=:fr:Jean-Louis Halpérin|date=25 March 2011|publisher=[[École Normale Supérieure]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503122852/http://www.droit.ens.fr/IMG/pdf/Lay_Justice_in_India_1.pdf|archive-date=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanavati Case was not the last Jury trial in India.

The [[Law Commission of India|Law Commission]] recommended their abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report. They were retained in a discreet manner for [[Parsi]] divorce courts, wherein a panel of members called 'delegates' are randomly selected from the community to decide the fact of the case. Parsi divorce law is governed by 'The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936' as amended in 1988,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fb.com/notes/1302292416456423|title=Jury system in Parsi Matrimonial Disputes|date=August 30, 2016|website=RIGHT TO RECALL AGAINST CORRUPTION – Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a mixture of the [[Panchayati raj|Panchayat legal system]] and jury process.

===Ireland===

The [[law of the Republic of Ireland|law in Ireland]] is historically based on English common law and had a similar jury system.  Article 38 of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] mandates trial by jury for criminal offences, with exceptions for [[summary offence|minor offences]], military tribunals, and where &quot;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html#part12 |title=CONSTITUTION OF IRELAND: TRIAL OF OFFENCES |date=August 2012|work=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[DPP v McNally]]''{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}} sets out that a jury has the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence.

The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;citinfoirlservice&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/index.html|title=Juries Act, 1976|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/act/pub/0014/print.html#part6|title=Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008; PART 6: Juries|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fine of €500 for failing to report for jury service, though this was poorly enforced until a change of policy at the Courts Service in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishlegal.com/3637/courts-service-to-notify-gardai-of-jury-non-reporting/|title=Courts Service to notify gardaí of jury non-reporting|date=16 February 2016|accessdate=17 February 2016|publisher=Irish Legal News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal jury trials are held in the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit Court]] or the [[High Court (Ireland)|Central Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html|title=Criminal trials|date=29 August 2012 |publisher=Citizens Information Bureau  |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juryless trials under the inadequacy exception, dealing with terrorism or organised crime, are held in the [[Special Criminal Court]], on application by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts_system/special_criminal_court.html |title=Special Criminal Court |date=6 August 2009 |publisher=Citizens Information Board |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juries are also used in some civil law trials, such as for [[defamation]];&lt;ref name=&quot;citinfoirlrole&quot;/&gt; they are sometimes used at coroner's inquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/inquests.html|title=Inquests|date=9 September 2010 |publisher=Citizens Information Bureau |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], a [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdiction, untrained judges are present only in the [[Corte d'Assise]], where two career magistrates are supported by six so-called ''Lay Judges'', who are raffled from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the ''Corte d'Assise'', however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the ''Scuola Media'' (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the ''Corte d'Assise d'Appello'' (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the ''Scuola Superiore'' (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the [[stipend]]iary judges and &quot;Lay Judges&quot; together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named ''Camera di Consiglio'' (&quot;Counsel Chamber&quot;), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them.  The ''Corte d'Assise'' has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include [[terrorism]], murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. [[assisted suicide]]), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the &quot;Lay Judges&quot; generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include [[life sentences]].

===New Zealand===
Juries are used in trials for all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11–1 or 10–1) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9–3 or 9–2) in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ's first majority guilty verdict|publisher=Stuff|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2563945/NZs-first-majority-guilty-verdict|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Juries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier.
They brought the jury system to [[England]] and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway's central government was in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].
Though Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387–1536), and later under the governmental union (1536–1814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.

The jury was reintroduced in 1887, and was then solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system (&quot;[[Court of appeal (Norway)|Lagmannsretten]]&quot;). The jury consisted of 10 people, and had to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lov om rettergangsmåten i straffesaker (Straffeprosessloven)|publisher=Lovdata|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-039.html|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury never gave a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gave a &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;non-guilty&quot; verdict.

In a sense, the concept of being judged by one's peers existed on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In [[Tingretten]], one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten two judges and five lay judges preside. The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], only [[Candidate of Law|trained lawyers]] are seated.

===Russia===
The right to a jury trial is provided by [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of Russian Federation]] but for criminal cases only and in the procedure defined by law. Initially, the Criminal Procedure Code, which was adopted in 2001, provided that the right to a jury trial could be realized in criminal cases which should be heard by regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets as the courts of first instance; the jury was composed of 12 jurors. In 2008, the anti-state criminal cases (treason, espionage, armed rebellion, sabotage, mass riot, creating an illegal paramilitary group, forcible seizure of power, terrorism) were removed from the jurisdiction of the jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2008/12/18/35407-ssylki-na-nedokazannost-nalichiya?print=true|title=18.12.2008 Ссылки на недоказанность наличия.

A juror must be 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|p=439}}

===Spain===

Spain has no strong tradition of using juries. However, there is some mentions in the [[Bayonne Statute]]. Later, Article 307 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] allowed the ''Cortes'' to pass legislation if they felt that over the time it was needed to distinguish between &quot;judges of law&quot; and &quot;judges of facts&quot;. Such legislation however was never enacted.

Article 2 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1837]] while proclamating the freedom of the people to publicate written contents without previous censorship according to the laws also provided that &quot;press crimes&quot; could only be tried by juries. This meant that a ''grand jury'' would need to indict, and a ''petit jury'' would need to convict.

Juries were later abolished in 1845, but were later restored in 1869 for all &quot;political crimes&quot; and &quot;those common crimes the law may deem appropriate to be so tried by a jury&quot;. A Law concerning the Jury entered into force on January 1, 1899 and lasted until 1936, where juries were again disbanded with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

The actual [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution of 1978]] permits the ''Cortes Generales'' to pass legislation allowing juries in criminal trials. The provision is arguably somewhat vague: ''&quot;Article 125 – Citizens may engage in popular action and participate in the administration of justice through the institution of the Jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts.&quot;''

Jury trials can only happen in the criminal jurisdiction and it is not a choice of the defendant to be tried by jury, or by a single judge or a panel of judges. Organic Law 5/1995, of May 22&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-12095 |title=Ley Orgánica 5/1995, de 22 de mayo, del Tribunal del Jurado. |language=es |year=1995 |access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulates the categories of crimes in which a trial by jury is mandatory. For all other crimes, a single judge or a panel of judges will decide both on facts and the law. Spanish juries are composed of 9 citizens and a professional Judge. Juries decide on facts and whether to convict or acquit the defendant. In case of conviction they can also make recommendations such as if the defendant should be pardoned if they asked to, or if they think the defendant could be released on parole, etc.

One of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/1997/03/07/espana/07N0018.html ESPAÑA | Juicio a Mikel Otegi por asesinar a dos ertzainas.

===Sweden===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
{{further|Judiciary of Sweden#Juries}}
In press [[libel]] cases and other cases concerning offenses against freedom of the press, the question of whether or not the printed material falls outside permissible limits is submitted to a jury of 9 members which provides a pre-screening before the case is ruled on by normal courts. In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.

Sweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222143058/http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx |date=December 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.

The jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury's guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6–3. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.

Jury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tryckfrihetsforordning-19491_sfs-1949-105/ Tryckfrihetsförordning (1949:105-SFS 2010:1409)] ''Riksdagen'' {{in lang|sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sw03000_.html The Freedom of the Press Act/Sweden] ''The International Constitutional Law Project''&lt;/ref&gt;

Juries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-penal-2001-1-page-355.htm |title=The advantages and disadvantages of lay judges from a Swedish perspective |publisher=Cairn.info |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.blinamndeman.se/Bli-namndeman/Sa-blir-du-vald/ | title=Så blir du vald - Bli nämndeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
{{main|Juries in England and Wales}}
In England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Bostock S, Thomas C. (1999).

Jury trials are also available for some few areas of civil law (for example defamation cases and those involving police conduct); these also require 12 jurors (9 in the County Court). However less than 1% of civil trials involve juries.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon MA, Carozza PG, Picker CB. (2008) ''Comparative Legal Traditions'', p. 251. Thomson-West.&lt;/ref&gt; At the new [[Manchester Civil Justice Centre]], constructed in 2008, fewer than 10 of the 48 courtrooms had jury facilities.

During [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], jury trials were suspended and trials took place before [[Diplock Courts]]. These were essentially trials before judges only.

{{main|Trial by jury in Scotland}}
Scottish trials are based on an adversarial approach.  First the prosecution leads evidence from witnesses and after each witness the defence has an opportunity to cross examine.  Following the Prosecution case, the defence may move a motion of [[no case to answer]] if the worst the prosecution has been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime.  If there remains a case to answer, the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution, with cross examination being permitted after each witness. Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence, the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard.  The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict. Juries are composed of fifteen residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Was I Picked For Jury Service? |publisher=Courtroom Advice|url=http://www.courtroomadvice.co.uk/why-was-I-picked-for-jury-service.html|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Juries in the United States}}
In criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only [[testimony]] and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial.  In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16–23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious.  If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a &quot;no bill.&quot;  If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a &quot;true bill.&quot;  Grand jury proceedings are ''ex parte'': only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted.  This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant.  It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial.  Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a &quot;no bill&quot; was returned by a previous grand jury.  A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes.  In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal.  Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.

Both [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III of the U.S. Constitution]] and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] require that criminal cases be tried by a jury.&lt;ref name=&quot;King1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = King NJ | title = The American Criminal Jury |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+41+(Spring+1999) | year = 1999 | pages = 41–67 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192252 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally this applied only to federal courts.  However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states.  Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landsman1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Landsman S. | year = 1999 | title = The Civil Jury in America |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+285+(Spring+1999) | pages = 285–304 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192260 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192260}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law.&lt;ref&gt;Amar, A.R. (1998). ''The Bill of Rights''. New Haven, CT: Yale University. pp. 81–118.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment.  Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases.  The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.

In practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by [[plea bargain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |title=Plea Bargains and the Role of Judges |work=2008 National Convention Breakout Session |publisher=The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007220413/http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |archive-date=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.

In 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a &quot;historical accident&quot;, and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; Juries go through a selection process called ''voir dire'' in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make &quot;challenges for cause&quot; and &quot;peremptory challenges&quot; to remove jurors.  Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror.  Since the 1970s &quot;[[scientific jury selection]]&quot; has become popular.&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt;

Unanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but, until 2020, Oregon and Louisiana were the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases (these laws were overturned in ''[[Ramos v. Louisiana]]'').&lt;ref name=Landsman1999/&gt; When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a ''hung jury''), a [[Mistrials|mistrial]] is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ring v. Arizona'', {{ussc|536|284|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/342 Unanimous Jury Votes for Life Sentence, but Alabama Judge Imposes Death] Death Penalty Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine.  Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present.  The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion.  Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial.  The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved.  In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.

In a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in &quot;capital&quot; murder cases.  Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing.  The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;This power is often used in drug cases &quot;''to impose an enhanced sentence ... based on the sentencing judge's determination of a fact that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant''&quot;. In April 2008, the U.S. District Court, in a [http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cr/2006/6cr22moj040108.pdf 236 page opinion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518065947/http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cr/2006/6cr22moj040108.pdf |date=2008-05-18 }} to address this ruled that juries should be told before they deliberate if a defendant is facing a mandatory minimum sentence and also called it &quot;inappropriate&quot; to ignore the juries power to refuse to convict (jury nullification).&lt;/ref&gt;

When used alone the term ''jury'' usually refers to a petit jury, rather than a grand jury.

==Jury sentencing==
Jury sentencing is the practice of having juries decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in [[Virginia]] in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; As of 2018, [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=59 ARK.CODE ANN. § 5-4-103|date=2010|quote=If a defendant is charged with a felony and is found guilty of an offense by a jury, the jury shall fix punishment . . . .|citeseerx = 10.1.1.173.1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39605|title=60 KY.REV.STAT.ANN. § 532.055|quote=Upon return of a verdict of guilty . . . the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing before the jury, if such case was tried before a jury.

CODE ANN. §§ 40-2704 to −2707 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Virginia]] had jury sentencing in times past, but then abandoned it.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

[[Canada|Canadian]] juries have long had the option to recommend mercy, leniency, or [[clemency]], and the 1961 ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' required judges to give a [[jury instruction]], following a verdict convicting a defendant of [[capital murder]], soliciting a recommendation as to whether he should be granted clemency. When [[capital punishment in Canada]] was abolished in 1976, as part of the same raft of reforms, the ''Criminal Code'' was also amended to grant juries the ability to recommend periods of [[parole ineligibility]] immediately following a guilty verdict in [[second-degree murder]] cases; however, these recommendations are usually ignored, based on the idea that judges are better-informed about relevant facts and sentencing jurisprudence and, unlike the jury, permitted to give reasons for their judgments.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origins, Evolution and Puzzling Irrelevance of Jury Recommendations in Second-Degree Murder Sentencing|date=2015|volume=40|number=2|journal=Queen's Law Journal|author=Rankin, Micah B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

===History===
====Rise of jury sentencing====
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution of Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas Jefferson#Minister to France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should &quot;suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776–1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

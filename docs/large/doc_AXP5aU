===Extraversion and introversion===
{{main|Extraversion and introversion}}
Jung was one of the first people to define introversion and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung's ''Psychological Types'', he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychological Types|author=C.G. Jung|publisher=Princeton University Press, 1971|pages=136–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extraversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stepp|first=G|title=People: Who Needs Them|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/social-relationships-introvert-vs-extrovert/50363.aspx|work=Vision Journal|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world ''subjectively'', whereas extraverts interpret the world ''objectively''.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebritytypes1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/04/5-basic-facts-about-jung-and-types/ | title=5 Basic Facts about Jung and Types | work=CelebrityTypes | publisher=CelebrityTypes International | date=19 April 2014 | accessdate=9 June 2015 | author=Arild, Sigurd | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persona===
{{see also|persona (psychology)}}
In his psychological theory – which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of [[social structure]] – the ''persona'' appears as a consciously created personality or identity, fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through [[socialization]], [[acculturation]] and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Székács Jacobi, ''Masks of the Soul''. William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung applied the term ''[[persona]]'', explicitly because, in Latin, it means both ''personality'' and the ''masks'' worn by Roman actors of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], expressive of the individual roles played.

The ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the &quot;collective psyche&quot;, a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the &quot;persona-mask&quot; as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is &quot;a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Gustav Jung]]&quot;, The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious&quot;, in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re)gains their &quot;own self&quot; – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses.

Jung has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate &quot;management persona&quot; (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,&lt;ref&gt;Joann S. Lublin, &quot;How to Look and Act Like a Leader&quot;, ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kees van der Pijl]], &quot;May 1968 and the Alternative Globalist Movement – Cadre Class Formation and the Transition to Socialism&quot;. In: Angelika Ebbinghaus et al. (ed.), ''1968: A View of the Protest Movements 40 Years after, from a Global Perspective. 43rd {{ill|International Conference of Labour and Social History|de}} 2008.'' Vienna: Akademische Verlagsanstalt, 2009, pp. 192, 193, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shadow ===
{{See also|shadow (psychology)}}

The ''shadow'' exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals dislike/would rather ignore: repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. The shadow is the result of an individual's attempt to adapt to cultural norms and expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society, but also those  that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.

Jung argues that the ''shadow'' plays an important role in balancing one's overall psyche - &quot;where there is light, there must also be shadow”. Without a well-developed ''shadow'', an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others - i.e., a walking [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Not wanting to look at their shadow's directly, Jung argues, causes many individuals to project them onto others. Basically, the qualities an individual may hate in another, are actually also present in that individual, who wishes not to see them.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the [[Persona (psychology)|''persona'']] and ''[[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]]'' should be balanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The shadow can appear in dreams or visions, often taking the form of a dark, wild, exotic figure.

===Spirituality===
Jung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|page=3|chapter=Prelude|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uegLZklR0fEC&amp;pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep, innate potential. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called [[individuation]], is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the [[self]] and at the same time to meet the [[Divinity|Divine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frick|first=Eckhard|author2=Lautenschlager, Bruno|title=Auf Unendliches bezogen – Spirituelle Entdeckungen bei C.

In 1959, Jung was asked by host [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] on the BBC interview program ''[[Face to Face (British TV programme)|Face to Face]]'' whether he believed in God, to which Jung answered, &quot;I do not need to believe. I ''know''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AMu-G51yTY BBC ''Face to Face'' broadcast, 22 October 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rollins |first1=Wayne Giibert |title=Jung and the Bible |date=2013 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers [reprint of 1983 edition] |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1625642615 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_spNAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=jung+god+%22the+listener%22&amp;pg=PA121 |accessdate=23 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's ideas on religion counterbalance Freudian skepticism. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation is still treated in modern textbooks on the [[psychology of religion]], though his ideas have also been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=David|title=Psychology of Religion: Classic and Contemporary Views|year=1991|publisher=Wiley and Sons|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyofreli00wulf/page/464 464]|isbn=978-0471502364|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofreli00wulf/page/464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism, and he is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Jerome David|title=Introduction to Alcoholism Counseling|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoal00levi/page/167 167]|chapter=Other Etiological Theories of Alcoholism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y7H9Sq5g6kC&amp;pg=PA167|isbn=978-1-56032-358-7|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoal00levi/page/167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung once treated an American patient ([[Rowland Hazard III]]), suffering from chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed.

Hazard took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal, spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a Christian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group and, through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]].

The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill Wilson, excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984) ''Pass It On: The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A.A. Message Reached the World.'' New York: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. {{ISBN|0-916856-12-7}}, page. 381–386.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his ''Collected Works'', ''The Symbolic Life,''

{{blockquote|For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G.; Adler, G. and Hull, R. F. C., eds. (1977), ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 18: The Symbolic Life: Miscellaneous Writings Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-09892-0}}, p. 272, as noted 2007-08-26 at http://www.stellarfire.org/additional.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908023121/http://www.stellarfire.org/additional.html |date=8 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung goes on to state that he has seen similar cures among [[Roman Catholics]]. The [[Twelve-step program|12 step program of Alcoholics Anonymous]] has an intense psychological backdrop, involving the human ego and dichotomy between the conscious and unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopemakersrecovery.com/psychology/jungian-12-steps|title=Jungian 12 Steps|website=Hope Makers|url-status=dead|access-date=5 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609020111/https://www.hopemakersrecovery.com/psychology/jungian-12-steps|archive-date=9 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquiries into the paranormal ===

Jung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades he attended [[seance]]s and claimed to have witnessed &quot;parapsychic phenomena&quot;. Initially he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on &quot;The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=6|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he began to &quot;doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung1997&quot;/&gt; and stated that &quot;the spirit hypothesis yields better results&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=7|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showing his own skepticism toward this postulation, as he could not find material evidence of the existence of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Gustav Jung|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usrGSaO7QosC|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|page=7|isbn=978-0-415-15509-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in &quot;[[synchronicity]]&quot;, his idea that meaningful connections in the world manifest through coincidence with no apparent causal link. What he referred to as &quot;acausal connecting principle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=&quot;Visitations&quot;: After-Death Contacts |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=September 2002 |volume=12 |issue=3 |url=https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/visitations_after-death_contacts |accessdate=8 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808203007/https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/visitations_after-death_contacts |archive-date=8 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his own experiments failing to confirm the phenomenon&lt;ref name=&quot;ShermerLinse2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Shermer|author2=Pat Linse|title=The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA241|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=240–241|isbn=978-1-57607-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he held on to the idea as an explanation for apparent [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

===Interpretation of quantum mechanics===
Jung influenced one philosophical interpretation (not the science) of quantum physics with the concept of [[synchronicity]] regarding some events as [[causality|non-causal]]. That idea influenced the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (with whom, via a letter correspondence, he developed the notion of ''[[unus mundus]]'' in connection with the notion of nonlocality) and some other [[Quantum physics|physicists]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], ''The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alchemy===
The work and writings of Jung from the 1940s onwards focused on [[alchemy]].

In 1944 Jung published ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]]'', in which he analyzed the alchemical symbols and came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|'For Jung, alchemy is not only part of the pre-history of chemistry, that is, not only laboratory work, but also an essential part of the history of psychology as the history of the discovery of the deep structure of the psyche and its unconscious. Jung emphasized the significance of the symbolic structure of alchemical texts, a structure that is understood as a way independent of laboratory research, as a structure per se.' {{cite book|last=Calian|first=George Florin|title=Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy|url=https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up|publisher=Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU|location=Budapest|year=2010|pages=167–168}}}} He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the individuation process.&lt;ref name=&quot; jungbio1&quot; /&gt;

In 1963 ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' first appeared in English as part of ''[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung]]''. ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' was Jung's last book and focused on the &quot;''Mysterium Coniunctionis''&quot; archetype, known as the [[sacred marriage]] between sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation—his favourite term for personal growth (75).

===Art therapy===
Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore and heal.&lt;ref name=&quot;art-therapy&quot;/&gt; In his work with patients and in his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could be helpful in recovering from trauma and emotional distress. At times of emotional distress, he often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions which he recognized as more than recreational.&lt;ref name=&quot;art-therapy&quot;/&gt;

=== Dance/movement therapy ===
[[Dance/movement therapy]] as an active imagination was created by Carl Gustav Jung and [[Toni Wolff]] in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Dance-Therapy-and-Depth-Psychology-The-Moving-Imagination/Chodorow/p/book/9780415041133|title=Dance Therapy and Depth Psychology: The Moving Imagination – Routledge|last=Chodorow|first=Joan|year=1991|access-date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was practiced by [[Tina Keller-Jenny]] and other analysts, but remained largely unknown until the 1950s when it was rediscovered by [[Marian Chace]] and therapist Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse, after studying with [[Martha Graham]] and [[Mary Wigman]], became herself a dancer and teacher of modern dance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xywBCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|title=Authentic Movement: Moving the Body, Moving the Self, Being Moved: A Collection of Essays – Volume Two|last=Pallaro|first=Patrizia|date=15 January 2007|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1846425868|location=London|page=33|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Swiss Dancer [[Trudi Schoop|Trudy Schoop]] in 1963, who is considered one of the founders of the dance/movement therapy in the United States.

===Political views===

====The state====
Jung stressed the importance of [[Natural and legal rights|individual rights]] in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as &quot;a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected&quot; but that this personality was &quot;only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-451-21860-5|title=The Undiscovered Self: The Problem of the Individual in Modern Society|pages=15–16|publisher=New American Library|last=Jung|first=Carl|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to the state as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;C.

====Germany, 1933 to 1939====
Jung had many Jewish friends and colleagues and maintained relations with them throughout the 1930s despite prevailing [[anti-semitism]]. Until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. Some scholars allege that he himself sympathized with the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.W (1980) ''Freud: the Man and the Cause''. London: Cape, pp. 492–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in restructuring of the [[International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy|General Medical Society for Psychotherapy]] (''Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie''), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:
# A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by [[Matthias Göring]], an [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] psychotherapist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/books/psychotherapy-in-the-third-reich.html Lifton, Robert Jay (27 January 1985) &quot;Psychotherapy in the Third Reich&quot;] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [[Hermann Göring]]
# International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung. The German body was to be affiliated to the international society, as were new national societies being set up in Switzerland and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&amp;nbsp;G.

The International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly, rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation of the circular is in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; pp.&amp;nbsp;545–546.&lt;/ref&gt; This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&amp;nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

As leader of the international body, Jung assumed overall responsibility for its publication, the ''Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie''. In 1933, this journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&amp;nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Medweth. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050331084847/http://www.sfu.ca/~wwwpsyb/issues/1996/winter/medweth.htm &quot;Jung and the Nazis&quot;], in ''Psybernetika'', Winter 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', that he experienced &quot;great surprise and disappointment&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p.&amp;nbsp;538.&lt;/ref&gt; when the ''Zentralblatt'' associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement.

Jung went on to say &quot;the main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p.&amp;nbsp;538. See also Stevens, Anthony, ''Jung: a very short introduction'', Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-285458-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not end his relationship with the ''Zentralblatt'' at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, [[Carl Alfred Meier]] of Switzerland. For the next few years, the ''Zentralblatt'' under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Jaffe_p83&gt;Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C.&amp;nbsp;G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. {{ISBN|0-340-12515-2}}; p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939,&lt;ref name=Jaffe_p83/&gt; the year the [[Second World War]] started.

====Nazism and antisemitism====
Jung's interest in [[European mythology]] and [[folk psychology]] was shared by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noll |first=Richard |edition=1st |date=1994 |title=The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement |page=336 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Grossman|1979}}&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/06/carl-jung-freud-nazis|last=Vernon|first=Mark|work=The Guardian|date=6 June 2011|title=Carl Jung, part 2: A troubled relationship with Freud – and the Nazis|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Noll]] describes Jung's own reaction to this connection:

{{quote|Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German [[Völkisch movement|Volkstumsbewegung]] throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these [[neopagan]] metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on [[Wotan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noll |first=Richard |edition=1st |date=1994 |title=The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement |page=134 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various statements made by Jung in the 1930s have been cited as evidence of both contempt for Nazism and sympathy for Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.W (1980) ''Freud: the Man and the Cause''. London: Cape, pp. 492–3&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1936 essay &quot;Wotan&quot;, Jung described the influence of [[Adolf Hitler]] on Germany as &quot;one man who is obviously 'possessed' has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Carl Gustav Jung: Avant-Garde Conservative|first=Jay|last=Sherry|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later{{when|date=May 2020}} say:
{{quote|Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism&amp;nbsp;... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there&amp;nbsp;... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;''C. G. Jung Speaking: Interviews and Encounters'', eds William McGuire and [[R. F. C. Hull]] (London: Thames and Hudson, 1978), pp. 91–93, 115–135, 136–40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung consistently rejected accusations of [[antisemitism]]. In a 1948 interview with Carol Baumann, he stated:
{{quote|It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Carol Baumann, published in the ''Bulletin of Analytical Psychology Club of New York'', December 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A full response from Jung discounting the rumors can be found in ''C. G Jung Speaking, Interviews and Encounters'', Princeton University Press, 1977.}}}}

The accusations, however, have continued to be made with reference to Jung's statements. [[Avner Falk]] cites articles such as “The State of Psychotherapy Today”,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung|Collected Works]], Volume 10&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1934 in the ''Zentralblatt fur Psychotherapie'', where Jung wrote: &quot;The [[Aryan]] unconscious has a greater potential than the Jewish unconscious&quot; and &quot;The Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, A ''Anti-Semitism A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred'' Westport Connecticut: Praeger, 2008, pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Samuels]] argues that his remarks on the &quot;Aryan unconscious&quot; and the &quot;corrosive character&quot; of Freud's &quot;Jewish gospel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to William M Kranefeldt dd 9 February 1934 reprinted in the ''International Review of Psychoanalysis'' Vol. 4:377 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate an antisemitism &quot;fundamental to the structure of Jung’s thought&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Samuels|Samuels, Andrew]]. (1997), Institute of Historical Research, University of London e-seminar.[http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4412/1/Jung_And_Antisemitism_by_Andrew_Samuels___Institute_of_Historical_Research.pdf “Jung and Anti-Semitism”], Also published in the ''Jewish Quarterly'', Spring 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Service to the Allies during World War II====
Jung was in contact with [[Allen Dulles]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and provided valuable intelligence on the psychological condition of [[Hitler]].  Dulles referred to Jung as &quot;Agent 488&quot; and offered the following description of his service: &quot;Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side&quot;.  Jung's service to the Allied cause through the OSS remained classified after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-shrink-as-secret-agent-jung-hitler-and-the-oss | title=The Shrink as Secret Agent: Jung, Hitler, and the OSS| newspaper=The Daily Beast| date=12 November 2016| last1=Dickey| first1=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI), a popular [[Personality psychology|psychometric instrument]], and the concepts of [[socionics]] were developed from Jung's theory of psychological types. Jung saw the human psyche as &quot;by nature religious&quot; and made this religiousness the focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [[dream interpretation|dream analysis]] and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the &quot;psychologization of religion&quot;, [[spirituality]] and the [[New Age]] movement has been immense. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Jung as the 23rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haggbloom |first1=Steven J. |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III |last10=Beavers |first10=Jamie |last11=Monte |first11=Emmanuelle |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century. |journal=Review of General Psychology |year=2002 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx| display-authors= 8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.1913|s2cid=145668721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hermann Hesse]], author of works such as ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]'' and ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', was treated by Joseph Lang, a student of Jung. For Hesse this began a long preoccupation with [[psychoanalysis]], through which he came to know Jung personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |title=Hermann Hesse |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204213850/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm |archivedate=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Canadian novelist Robertson Davies made Jungian analysis a central part of his 1970 novel ''The Manticore''. He stated in a letter, &quot;There have been other books which describe Freudian analyses, but I know of no other that describes a Jungian analysis&quot; adding &quot;I was deeply afraid that I would put my foot in it, for I have never undergone one of those barnacle-scraping experiences, and knew of it only through reading. So I was greatly pleased when some of my Jungian friends in Zurich liked it very much.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''For Your Eye Alone: The Letters of Robertson Davies'' edited by Judith Skelton Grant (New York: Viking, 2001)72&lt;/ref&gt;

* Musician [[David Bowie]] described himself as Jungian in his relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Bowie sang of Jung on his album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (a pun on &quot; a lad insane&quot;) and attended the exhibition of ''The Red Book'' in New York with artist [[Tony Oursler]], who described Bowie as &quot;reading and speaking of the psychoanalyst with passion&quot;.  Bowie's 1967 song &quot;[[Shadow Man (song)|Shadow Man]]&quot; encapsulates a key Jungian concept, while in 1987 Bowie described the Glass Spiders of ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' as Jungian mother figures around which he not only anchored [[Glass Spider Tour|a worldwide tour]] but also created an enormous onstage effigy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tanjastark.com/2015/06/22/crashing-out-with-sylvian-david-bowie-carl-jung-and-the-unconscious/ Stark, Tanja, (2015) “Crashing Out with Sylvian: David Bowie, Carl Jung and the Unconscious” in Deveroux, E., M.Power and A.

===Theatre, film and television===
* [[Federico Fellini]] brought to the screen exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with Jung's ideas, especially Jungian [[dream interpretation]]. Fellini preferred Jung to Freud because Jungian analysis defined the dream not as a symptom of a disease that required a cure but rather as a link to archetypal images shared by all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondanella|first=Peter E.|title=The Films of Federico Fellini|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsfedericofel00bond|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmsfedericofel00bond/page/n109 94]|isbn=978-0-521-57573-7|date=17 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', a 2011 film directed by [[David Cronenberg]] based on Hampton's play ''The Talking Cure'', is a fictional dramatisation of Jung's life between 1904 and 1913.

* More recently, [[Robert Eggers]] phycological thriller, [[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]] has elements strongly influenced by Jung's work with Eggers hoping that &quot;it’s a movie where both Jung and Freud would be furiously eating their popcorn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; https://m.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/the-lighthouse-homoeroticism-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe_n_5da9c888e4b0e71d65b801ae?ri18n=true&amp;guccounter=1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
Epidemics of smallpox were known for causing a significant decrease in the indigenous population of the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epidemics and history : disease, power, and imperialism|last=Watts|first= S. J. (Sheldon J.)|date=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0585356203|location=New Haven|oclc=47009810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on survivors included [[Acne scarring|pockmarks]] on the skin which left deep scars, commonly causing significant [[disfigurement]]. Some Europeans, who believed the plague of [[syphilis]] in Europe to have come from the Americas, saw smallpox as the European revenge against the Natives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Africans and Europeans, unlike the native population, often had lifelong immunity, because they had often been exposed to minor forms of the illness such as [[cowpox]] or [[variola minor]] disease in childhood. By the late 16th century there existed some forms of inoculation and [[variolation]] in Africa and the Middle East. One practice features Arab traders in Africa &quot;buying-off&quot; the disease in which a cloth that had been previously exposed to the sickness was to be tied to another child's arm to increase immunity. Another practice involved taking pus from a smallpox scab and putting it in the cut of a healthy individual in an attempt to have a mild case of the disease in the future rather than the effects becoming fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;/&gt;

==European competition==
The trade of enslaved Africans in the Atlantic has its origins in the explorations of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century. Before that, contact with African slave markets was made to ransom Portuguese who had been captured by the intense North African [[Barbary pirate]] attacks on Portuguese ships and coastal villages, frequently leaving them depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title= British History in depth: British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|magazine=BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Europeans to use enslaved Africans in the New World were the [[Spaniards]], who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]. The alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them (Laws of Burgos, 1512–13). The first enslaved Africans arrived in Hispaniola in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003165601/http://www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk/webbook-chap1.html|url-status=dead|title=Webbook Chap1|archive-date=October 3, 2006|website=www.ukcouncilhumanrights.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Portugal]] had succeeded in establishing sugar plantations (''engenhos'') in northern [[Brazil]] c. 1545, Portuguese merchants on the West African coast began to supply enslaved Africans to the sugar planters. While at first these planters had relied almost exclusively on the native [[Tupi people|Tupani]] for slave labour, after 1570 they began importing Africans, as a series of [[epidemics]] had decimated the already destabilized Tupani communities. By 1630, Africans had replaced the Tupani as the largest contingent of labour on Brazilian sugar plantations. This ended the European medieval household tradition of [[medieval slavery|slavery]]&lt;!--Explain--&gt;, resulted in Brazil's receiving the most enslaved Africans, and revealed sugar cultivation and processing as the reason that roughly 84% of these Africans were shipped to the New World.

As Britain rose in naval power and settled continental North America and some islands of the [[West Indies]], they became the leading slave traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx | title=European traders | publisher=International Slavery Museum | access-date=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage the trade was the monopoly of the [[Royal Africa Company]], operating out of [[London]].

[[Birmingham]], the largest [[Gun Quarter, Birmingham|gun-producing]] town in Britain at the time, supplied guns to be traded for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Birmingham Gun Trade and The American System of Manufactures |first=David J. |last=Williams |s2cid=110533082 |url=http://www.pubs-newcomen.com/tfiles/75ap085.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6cRfwedHS?url=http://www.pubs-newcomen.com/tfiles/75ap085.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-10-21 |journal=Trans.

==New World destinations==
The first slaves to arrive as part of a labour force in the New World reached the island of [[Hispaniola]] (now [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]) in 1502. [[Cuba]] received its first four slaves in 1513. [[Jamaica]] received its first shipment of 4000 slaves in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynter | first1 = Sylvia | year = 1984a | title = New Seville and the Conversion Experience of Bartolomé de Las Casas: Part One | journal = Jamaica Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 25–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slave exports to [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]] started in 1526.

The first enslaved Africans to reach what would become the United States arrived in July{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} 1526 as part of a Spanish attempt to colonize [[San Miguel de Gualdape]]. By November the 300 Spanish colonists were reduced to 100, and their slaves from 100 to 70{{why?|date = August 2014}}. The enslaved people revolted in 1526 and joined a nearby Native American tribe, while the Spanish abandoned the colony altogether (1527). The area of the future [[Colombia]] received its first enslaved people in 1533. [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Florida]] began their stints in the slave trade in 1541, 1563 and 1581, respectively.

The 17th century saw an increase in shipments. Africans were brought to Point Comfort – several miles downriver from the English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Virginia – in 1619. The first kidnapped Africans in English North America were classed as indentured servants and freed after seven years. Virginia law codified chattel slavery in 1656, and in 1662 the colony adopted the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which classified children of slave mothers as slaves, regardless of paternity.

In addition to African persons, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] were trafficked through Atlantic trade routes.  The 1677 work ''[[s:The Doings and Sufferings of the Christian Indians|The Doings and Sufferings of the Christian Indians]]'', for example, documents [[English overseas possessions#The Americas|English colonial]] [[prisoners of war]] (not, in fact, opposing combatants, but imprisoned members of [[Praying Indian|English-allied forces]]) being enslaved and sent to Caribbean destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gookin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|surname=Gookin|given=Daniel|author-link=Daniel Gookin|year=1836|orig-year=1677|title=The Doings and Sufferings of the Christian Indians|title-link=s:The Doings and Sufferings of the Christian Indians|hdl=2027/mdp.39015005075109?urlappend=%3Bseq=459|oclc=3976964|id=[[iarchive:archaeologiaame02amer/page/423/mode/1up|archaeologiaame02amer]]|quote=But this shows the prudence and fidelity of the [[Praying Indian|Christian Indians]]; yet notwithstanding all this service they were, with others of our Christian Indians, through the harsh dealings of some English, in a manner constrained, for want of shelter, protection, and encouragement, to fall off to the enemy at [[Hassanamesit Indian Reservation|Hassanamesit]], the story whereof follows in its place; and one of them, viz.

In France in the 18th century, returns for investors in plantations averaged around 6%; as compared to 5% for most domestic alternatives, this represented a 20% profit advantage. Risks—maritime and commercial—were important for individual voyages. Investors mitigated it by buying small shares of many ships at the same time. In that way, they were able to diversify a large part of the risk away. Between voyages, ship shares could be freely sold and bought.&lt;ref&gt;Daudin 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most financially profitable West Indian colonies in 1800 belonged to the United Kingdom. After entering the sugar colony business late, British naval supremacy and control over key islands such as [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]], the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]] and the territory of [[British Guiana]] gave it an important edge over all competitors; while many British did not make gains, a handful of individuals made small fortunes. This advantage was reinforced when France lost its most important colony, [[St. Domingue]] (western Hispaniola, now Haiti), to a slave revolt in 1791&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h34-np2.html|title=Haiti, 1789 to 1806|website=www.fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported revolts against its rival Britain, in the name of liberty after the 1793 French revolution. Before 1791, British sugar had to be protected to compete against cheaper French sugar.

After 1791, the British islands produced the most sugar, and the British people quickly became the largest consumers. West Indian sugar became ubiquitous as an additive to Indian tea. It has been estimated that the profits of the slave trade and of [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations created up to one-in-twenty of every pound circulating in the [[Economic history of Britain|British economy]] at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the latter half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=104|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226181840/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm|url-status=dead|title=Digital History|archive-date=February 26, 2009|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Rodney]] has argued that at the start of the slave trade in the 16th century, although there was a technological gap between Europe and Africa, it was not very substantial. Both continents were using Iron Age technology. The major advantage that Europe had was in ship building. During the period of slavery, the populations of Europe and the Americas grew exponentially, while the population of Africa remained stagnant. Rodney contended that the profits from slavery were used to fund economic growth and technological advancement in Europe and the Americas. Based on earlier theories by Eric Williams, he asserted that the industrial revolution was at least in part funded by agricultural profits from the Americas. He cited examples such as the [[Timeline of historic inventions|invention]] of the steam engine by [[James Watt]], which was funded by plantation owners from the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterRodney&quot;&gt;[[Walter Rodney]], ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]''. {{ISBN|0950154644}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians have attacked both Rodney's methodology and accuracy. [[Joseph C. Miller]] has argued that the social change and demographic stagnation (which he researched on the example of West Central Africa) was caused primarily by domestic factors. Joseph Inikori provided a new line of argument, estimating counterfactual demographic developments in case the Atlantic slave trade had not existed. Patrick Manning has shown that the slave trade did have a profound impact on African demographics and social institutions, but criticized Inikori's approach for not taking other factors (such as famine and drought) into account, and thus being highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick: &quot;Contours of Slavery and Social change in Africa&quot;. In: Northrup, David (ed.): ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''. D.C. Heath &amp; Company, 1994, pp. 148–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the economy of West Africa===
[[File:Different cowries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cowrie]] shells were used as money in the slave trade]]
No scholars dispute the harm done to the enslaved people but the effect of the trade on African societies is much debated, due to the apparent influx of goods to Africans. Proponents of the slave trade, such as [[Archibald Dalzel]], argued that African societies were robust and not much affected by the trade. In the 19th century, European [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], most prominently Dr. [[David Livingstone]], took the opposite view, arguing that the fragile local economy and societies were being severely harmed by the trade.

Because the negative effects of slavery on the economies of Africa have been well documented, namely the significant decline in population, some African rulers likely saw an economic benefit from trading their subjects with European slave traders. With the exception of Portuguese-controlled Angola, coastal African leaders &quot;generally controlled access to their coasts, and were able to prevent direct enslavement of their subjects and citizens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Thornton, John. ''A Cultural History of the Atlantic World 1250–1820''. 2012, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as African scholar John Thornton argues, African leaders who allowed the continuation of the slave trade likely derived an economic benefit from selling their subjects to Europeans. The Kingdom of Benin, for instance, participated in the African slave trade, at will, from 1715 to 1735, surprising Dutch traders, who had not expected to buy slaves in Benin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The benefit derived from trading slaves for European goods was enough to make the Kingdom of Benin rejoin the trans-Atlantic slave trade after centuries of non-participation. Such benefits included military technology (specifically guns and gunpowder), gold, or simply maintaining amicable trade relationships with European nations. The slave trade was, therefore, a means for some African elites to gain economic advantages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Fage, J. D. &quot;Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History&quot;, ''The Journal of African History'', Vol. 10. No 3, 1969, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Rodney]] estimates that by c.1770, the King of [[Dahomey]] was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling captive African soldiers and enslaved people to the European slave-traders. Many West African countries also already had a tradition of holding slaves, which was expanded into trade with Europeans.

The Atlantic trade brought new crops to Africa and also more efficient currencies which were adopted by the West African merchants. This can be interpreted as an institutional reform which reduced the cost of doing business. But the developmental benefits were limited as long as the business including slaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=321|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Thornton and Fage contend that while African political elite may have ultimately benefited from the slave trade, their decision to participate may have been influenced more by what they could lose by not participating. In Fage's article &quot;Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History&quot;, he notes that for West Africans &quot;...{{nbsp}}there were really few effective means of mobilizing labour for the economic and political needs of the state&quot; without the slave trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Effects on the British economy===
{{further|Historiography of the British Empire#Slavery}}
[[File:Joseph Cross, The Impolicy of Slavery, 1823 Cornell CUL PJM 1039 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|This map argues that import prohibitions and high duties on sugar were artificially inflating prices and inhibiting manufacturing in England. 1823]]
Historian [[Eric Williams]] in 1944 argued that the profits that Britain received from its sugar colonies, or from the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean, contributed to the financing of Britain's industrial revolution. However, he says that by the time of the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and the emancipation of the slaves in 1833, the sugar plantations of the British West Indies had lost their profitability, and it was in Britain's economic interest to emancipate the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Williams, ''Capitalism &amp; Slavery'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1944), pp. 98–107, 169–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers and historians have strongly contested what has come to be referred to as the &quot;Williams thesis&quot; in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;David Richardson, &quot;The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660–1807,&quot; in P. J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 440–464.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Stanley Engerman]] finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] during any year of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanley L.

However, each of these works focus primarily on the slave trade or the Industrial Revolution, and not the main body of the Williams thesis, which was on sugar and slavery itself. Therefore, they do not refute the main body of the Williams thesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Pares|title=The Economic Factors in the History of the Empire|journal=The Economic History Review|jstor=2590147 | volume=7|issue=2|pages=119–144|year=1937|doi=10.2307/2590147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric Williams 1964&quot;&gt;Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Drescher and Robert Anstey argue the slave trade remained profitable until the end, and that moralistic reform, not economic incentive, was primarily responsible for abolition. They say slavery remained profitable in the 1830s because of innovations in agriculture. However, Drescher's ''Econocide'' wraps up its study in 1823, and does not address the majority of the Williams thesis, which covers the decline of the sugar plantations after 1823, the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s, and the subsequent abolition of sugar duties in the 1840s. These arguments do not refute the main body of the Williams thesis, which presents economic data to show that the slave trade was minor compared to the wealth generated by sugar and slavery itself in the British Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Ward, &quot;The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition,&quot; in P. J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998), pp. 415–439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric Williams 1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Econocide: British Slavery in the Era of Abolition'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]], in his influential economic history of capitalism, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', wrote that &quot;...{{nbsp}}the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production&quot;. He argued that the slave trade was part of what he termed the &quot;primitive accumulation&quot; of capital, the 'non-capitalist' accumulation of wealth that preceded and created the financial conditions for Britain's industrialisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Chapter Thirty-One: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm|work=Karl Marx: Capital Volume One|access-date=21 February 2014|quote=the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production.

===Demographics===
[[File:Agostino Brunias - A Linen Market with a Linen-stall and Vegetable Seller in the West Indies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A Linen Market with enslaved Africans. West Indies, circa 1780]]
The demographic effects of the slave trade is a controversial and highly debated issue. Although scholars such as Paul Adams and Erick D. Langer have estimated that sub-Saharan Africa represented about 18 percent of the world's population in 1600 and only 6 percent in 1900,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiencing World History|last1=Adams|first1=Paul|last2=Hwa|first2=Lily|publisher=New York University Press|year=2000|location=New York|pages=334|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reasons for this demographic shift have been the subject of much debate. In addition to the depopulation Africa experienced because of the slave trade, African nations were left with severely imbalanced gender ratios, with females comprising up to 65 percent of the population in hard-hit areas such as Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Moreover, many scholars (such as Barbara N. Ramusack) have suggested a link between the prevalence of prostitution in Africa today with the temporary marriages that were enforced during the course of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Asia: Restoring Women to History|last=Ramusack|first=Barbara|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1999|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Rodney]] argued that the export of so many people had been a demographic disaster which left Africa permanently disadvantaged when compared to other parts of the world, and it largely explains the continent's continued poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterRodney&quot;/&gt; He presented numbers showing that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while those of Europe and [[Asia]] grew dramatically. According to Rodney, all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving, and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.

Others have challenged this view. [[J. D. Fage]] compared the demographic effect on the continent as a whole. David Eltis has compared the numbers to the rate of [[emigration]] from [[Europe]] during this period. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas, a far higher rate than were ever taken from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;David Eltis, ''Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave Trade''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars accused Walter Rodney of mischaracterizing the trade between Africans and Europeans. They argue that Africans, or more accurately African elites, deliberately let European traders join in an already large trade in enslaved people and that they were not patronized.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John. ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400–1800''. Cambridge University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joseph E. Inikori argues, the history of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African economic model of the period was very different from the European model, and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Inikori, &quot;Ideology versus the Tyranny of Paradigm: Historians and the Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on African Societies&quot;, ''African Economic History'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of racism===
[[File:Agostino Brunias - West Indian Creole woman, with her Black Servant - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Indian [[Creole peoples|Creole]] woman, with her black servant, circa 1780]]

[[Walter Rodney]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role of slavery in promoting racist prejudice and ideology has been carefully studied in certain situations, especially in the USA. The simple fact is that no people can enslave another for four centuries without coming out with a notion of superiority, and when the colour and other physical traits of those peoples were quite different it was inevitable that the prejudice should take a racist form.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterRodney&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Eric Williams]] argued that &quot;A racial twist [was] given to what is basically an economic phenomenon. Slavery was not born of racism: rather, racism was the consequence of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Eric |year=1994 |orig-year=1944 |title=Capitalism and Slavery |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B6AWWVGBaswC&amp;pg=PA7 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the belief that Caucasian Europeans were divinely ordained by an omnipotent [[Judeo-Christian]] God as 'superior' to other human races with darker skin, a major tenant of the [[White supremacy]] movement, was one of the basic perceptions that would allow industrial-scale slavery across the Atlantic to thrive. In the Americas therefore, slavery and racism seem to have strenghtened each other. This would still have to be compared to racism in other parts of the world, as there was also [[Slavery in China]] and [[Slavery in India|India]] for ages. Russia's over 23 million privately held [[serfdom|serfs]] were freed from their lords by an edict of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1861. The owners were compensated through taxes on the freed serfs. [[State serf]]s were [[emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, ''Abolition of Serfdom in Russia: 1762–1907'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The common decisive factor seems to be saving money on the overall [[cost of labor]].

Similarly, John Darwin writes &quot;The rapid conversion from white indentured labour to black slavery... made the English Caribbean a frontier of civility where English (later British) ideas about race and slave labour were ruthlessly adapted to local self-interest...Indeed, the root justification for the system of slavery and the savage apparatus of coercion on which its preservation depended was the ineradicable barbarism of the slave population, a product, it was argued, of its African origins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, John (2013) ''Unfinished Empire'', p40&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, America, Portugal and in parts of Europe, opposition developed against the slave trade. Davis says that abolitionists assumed &quot;that an end to slave imports would lead automatically to the amelioration and gradual abolition of slavery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution: 1770–1823'' (1975), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as [[William Wilberforce]]. Many people joined the movement and they began to protest against the trade, but they were opposed by the owners of the colonial holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Society of Friends Subject Guide: Abolition of the Slave Trade.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Lord Mansfield]]'s decision in 1772, many abolitionists and slave-holders believed that slaves became free upon entering the British isles.&lt;ref name=&quot;CUP&quot;&gt;Paul E. Lovejoy (2000). ''Transformations in Slavery: a history of slavery in Africa'', Cambridge University Press, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality slavery continued in Britain right up to abolition in the 1830s. The Mansfield ruling on ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' only decreed that a slave could not be transported out of England against his will.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: BBC Books, 2005), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Thomas Jefferson]], the new [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Virginia]] in 1778 became the first state and one of the first jurisdictions anywhere to stop the importation of slaves for sale; it made it a crime for traders to bring in slaves from out of state or from overseas for sale; migrants from within the United States were allowed to bring their own slaves. The new law freed all slaves brought in illegally after its passage and imposed heavy fines on violators.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Selby and Don Higginbotham, ''The Revolution in Virginia, 1775–1783'' (2007), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik S. Root, ''All Honor to Jefferson?: The Virginia Slavery Debates and the Positive Good Thesis'' (2008), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-02-02-0019|title=Founders Online: Bill to Prevent the Importation of Slaves, &amp;c., [16 June 1777]|website=founders.archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the other states in the United States followed suit, although [[South Carolina]] reopened its slave trade in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lacy K.

[[Denmark]], which had been active in the slave trade, was the first country to ban the trade through legislation in 1792, which took effect in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virgin-islands-history.org/en/danish-prohibition-on-transatlantic-slave-trade-in-1792/ |title=Danish decision to abolish transatlantic slave trade in 1792 |access-date=2016-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070732/http://www.virgin-islands-history.org/en/danish-prohibition-on-transatlantic-slave-trade-in-1792/ |archive-date=2016-09-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain banned the slave trade in 1807, imposing stiff fines for any slave found aboard a British ship (''see [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]''). The [[Royal Navy]] moved to stop other nations from continuing the slave trade and declared that slaving was equal to piracy and was punishable by death. The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited the building or outfitting of ships in the U.S. for use in the slave trade. The U.S. Constitution barred a federal prohibition on importing slaves for 20 years; at that time the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] prohibited imports on the first day the Constitution permitted: January 1, 1808.

=== British abolitionism ===
[[William Wilberforce]] was a driving force in the British Parliament in the fight against the slave trade in the [[British Empire]]. The British abolitionists focused on the slave trade, arguing that the trade was not necessary for the economic success of sugar on the British West Indian colonies. This argument was accepted by wavering politicians, who did not want to destroy the valuable and important sugar colonies of the British Caribbean. The British parliament was also concerned about the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]], and they believed they had to abolish the trade to prevent a similar conflagration from occurring in a British Caribbean colony.&lt;ref&gt;Christer Petley, ''White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of Revolution'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 200-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1807, the House of Commons passed a motion 283 votes to 16 to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Hence, the slave trade was abolished, but not the still-economically viable institution of slavery itself, which provided Britain's most lucrative import at the time, sugar. Abolitionists did not move against sugar and slavery itself until after the sugar industry went into terminal decline after 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States passed its own [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] the very next week (March 2, 1807), although probably without mutual consultation.  The act only took effect on the first day of 1808; since a compromise clause in the 
[[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_1:_Slave_trade|US Constitution (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1)]] prohibited restrictions on the slave trade before 1808.  The United States did not, however, abolish its [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]], which became the dominant mode of US slave trading until the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marcyliena H. |last=Morgan |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhJcsiydNe8C&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Language, Discourse and Power in African American Culture|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=20 |isbn=9780521001496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1805 the British Order-in-Council had restricted the importation of slaves into colonies that had been captured from France and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CUP&quot;/&gt; Britain continued to press other nations to end its trade; in 1810 an Anglo-Portuguese treaty was signed whereby Portugal agreed to restrict its trade into its colonies; an 1813 Anglo-Swedish treaty whereby Sweden outlawed its slave trade; the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris 1814]] where France agreed with Britain that the trade is &quot;repugnant to the principles of natural justice&quot; and agreed to abolish the slave trade in five years; the 1814 Anglo-Netherlands treaty where the Dutch outlawed its slave trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;CUP&quot;/&gt;

=== Castlereagh and Palmerston's diplomacy ===
Abolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions, although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, &quot;Whose abolition? Popular pressure and the ending of the British slave trade.&quot; ''Past &amp; Present'' 143 (1994): 136–166. {{jstor|651164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the slave trade. Foreign Minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] switched his position and became a strong supporter of the movement. Britain arrange treaties with Portugal Sweden and Denmark, 1810–1814, whereby they agreed to end or restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Reich,  &quot;The Slave Trade at the Congress of Vienna{{snd}}A Study in English Public Opinion.&quot; ''Journal of Negro History'' 53.2 (1968): 129–143. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716488 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships. He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading. There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas. Spain, France, and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations.

As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] and other British foreign ministers continued the Castlereagh policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the slave trade proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Duram, &quot;A Study of Frustration: Britain, the USA, and the African Slave Trade, 1815–1870.&quot; Social Science (1965): 220–225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885111 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Palmerston detested slavery, and in [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]] in 1851 he took advantage of divisions in native politics, the presence of Christian missionaries, and the maneuvers of British consul [[John Beecroft]] to encourage the overthrow of King Kosoko. The new King Akitoye was a docile nonslave-trading puppet.&lt;ref&gt;Giles D.

=== Last slave ship to the United States ===
Even though it was prohibited, after and in response to the North's reluctance or refusal to enforce the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], the Atlantic slave trade was &quot;re-opened by way of retaliation&quot;. In 1859, &quot;the trade in slaves from Africa to the Southern coast of the United States is now carried on in defiance of Federal law and of the Federal Government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

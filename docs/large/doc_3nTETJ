{{ancient history}}
{{Human history}}
'''Ancient history''' as a term refers to the aggregate of past events&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0], &quot;History&quot; {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=2005-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the beginning of writing and [[History of writing|recorded]] [[History of the world|human history]] and extending as far as [[post-classical history]]. The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline.

The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform]] script, with the oldest coherent texts from about 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp. 381–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC – AD 500.

The broad term &quot;ancient history&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;classical antiquity&quot;. The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to [[Western world#Historical divisions|Western history]] in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Ancient Mediterranean]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (first [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the [[founding of Rome]] in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]].

The academic term &quot;history&quot; is not to be confused with colloquial references to times past. History is fundamentally the study of the past, and can be either scientific ([[archaeology]]) or [[Humanistic historiography|humanistic]] (history through language).

Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD (the most used),&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I.S. (1906). Library of universal history: containing a record of the human race from the earliest historical period to the present time; embracing a general survey of the progress of mankind in national and social life, civil government, religion, literature, science, and art. New York: Union Book. p. 1519 (cf., Ancient history, as we have already seen, ended with the fall of the Western Roman Empire; [...])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Center for Research and Training in History. (1973). Bulgarian historical review. Sofia: Pub. House of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. p. 43. (cf. ... in the history of Europe, which marks both the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages, is the fall of the Western Roman Empire.)&lt;/ref&gt; the closure of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Literature |last=Hadas |first=Moses |year=1950 |publisher= Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-01767-1 |page=273 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOht3609JOMC&amp;q=%22end+of+antiquity%22+%2B+%22529%22&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt; the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in 565 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, C.A.

New York [etc.]: Ginn and company.&lt;/ref&gt; as the end of ancient and Classical European history. Outside of Europe the 450–500 time frame for the end of ancient times has had difficulty as a transition date from ancient to post-classical times.

During the time period of ancient history (starting roughly from 3000 BC), the [[world population]] was already exponentially increasing due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]], which was in full progress. According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands, world population increased exponentially in this period. In 10,000 BC in [[prehistory]], the world population had stood at 2 million, rising to 45 million by 3,000 BC.  By the rise of the [[Iron Age]] in 1,000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the period in 500 AD, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. In 3,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnp.nl&quot;&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959683609356587 Data] from [http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html History Database of the Global Environment.]  K.

==Study==
Historians have two major avenues which they take to better understand the ancient world: [[archaeology]] and the study of [[source text]]s. [[Primary source]]s are those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |publisher=Lib.umd.edu |date=2008-05-23 |access-date=2010-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230070606/http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |archive-date=2009-12-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |archive-date= 2005-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary sources have been distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handlin et al., ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954) p. 118-246&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Source text}}

Most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians. Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Arrian]], [[Plutarch]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].

A fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;GardnerP&quot;&gt;Gardner, P. (1892). New chapters in Greek history, historical results of recent excavations in Greece and Asia Minor. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. pp. 1–.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;GardnerP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.S. (2002). The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel. The Biblical resource series. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. xxii–xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Few people were capable of writing histories, as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;Nadin, M. (1997). The civilization of illiteracy. Dresden: Dresden University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], beginning with [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484–c. 425 BC). [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179&quot;&gt;Cochrane, Charles Norris. ''Thucydides and the Science of History'', Oxford University Press, 1929. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179&quot; /&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was an ancient culture with a relatively high literacy rate,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, W.V. (1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist. Indeed, no more than a minority of the work of any major Roman historian has survived.

===Timeline of ancient history===
{{Main|Timeline of ancient history}}
{{Ancient chronology}}
This gives a listed timeline, ranging from 3300 BC to 600 AD, that provides an overview of ancient history.

==Chronology==

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory|Neolithic Revolution}}

Prehistory is the period before [[Recorded history|written history]]. The [[early human migration]]s&lt;ref&gt;H. Liu, F. Prugnolle, A. Manica, [[Francois Balloux|F. Balloux]], ''A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History.'' The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 79, Issue 2, pp. 230–237&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] saw ''[[Homo erectus]]'' spread across Eurasia 1.8 million years ago. The controlled use of fire first occurred 800,000 years ago in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. 250,000 years ago, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (modern humans) [[Human evolution|emerged]] in [[Africa]]. 60–70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along a coastal route to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and reached [[Australia]]. 50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from [[Asia]] to the [[Near East]]. [[Europe]] was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago. Humans [[migration to the New World|migrated to the Americas]] about 15,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The 10th millennium BC is the earliest given date for the [[Neolithic revolution|invention of agriculture]] and the beginning of the ancient era. [[Göbekli Tepe]] was erected by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[10th millennium BC]] (c. 11,500 years ago), before the advent of [[sedentism]]. Together with [[Nevali Cori|Nevalı Çori]], it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]]. In the 7th millennium BC, [[Jiahu]] culture began in [[China]]. By the 5th millennium BC, the late Neolithic civilizations saw the invention of the [[wheel]] and the spread of [[proto-writing]]. In the 4th millennium BC, the [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the [[Ukraine]]-[[Moldova]]-[[Romania]] region develops. By 3400 BC, &quot;proto-literate&quot; [[cuneiform]] is spread in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30th century BC, referred to as the [[Early Bronze Age II]], saw the beginning of the literate period in [[Mesopotamia]] and ancient Egypt. Around the 27th century BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] and the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]] are founded, according to the earliest reliable [[regnal era]]s.

The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. It follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In most areas of civilization bronze smelting became a foundation for more advanced societies. There was some contrast with New World societies, who often still preferred stone to metal for utilitarian purposes. Modern historians have identified five original civilizations which emerged in the time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haviland 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William |display-authors=etal |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |page=250 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|isbn=978-1-285-67530-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study'', Trigger, Bruce G., Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

The first civilization emerged in Sumer in the southern region of [[Mesopotamia]], now part of modern-day Iraq. By 3000 BC, Sumerian city states had collectively formed [[civilization]], with government, religion, division of labor and writing. Among the city states [[Ur]] was among the most significant.

In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html|title=Akkadian Empire|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. (1921).

From Sumer, civilization and bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] and the [[Hittites]].

The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] of the 22nd century BC was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. the 21st century BC in [[Ur]]. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. Egypt was a superpower at the time. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed and invaded the remains of Minoan civilization. The beginning of Hittite dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is also seen in the 1600s BC. The time from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed in Egypt.

East of the Iranian world, was the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley civilization]] which organized cities neatly on grid patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last1=Berger|first1=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=79|date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However the Indus River Valley civilization diminished after 1900 BC and was later replaced with [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] who established [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]].

The beginning of the [[Shang dynasty]] emerged in China in this period, and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. The Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese regime recognized by western scholars though Chinese historians insist that the [[Xia dynasty]] preceded it. The Shang dynasty practiced forced labor to complete public projects. There is evidence of massive ritual burial.

Across the ocean, the earliest known civilization of the Americas appeared in the river valleys of the desert coast of central modern day Peru. The Norte Chico civilization's first city flourished around 3100 BC.  The Olmecs are supposed to appear later in Mesoamerica between the 14th and 13th century.

====Early Iron Age====
{{Main|Iron Age}}{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}

The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with [[ferrous metallurgy]] and the use of [[carbon steel]]. Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as [[copper]] or [[bronze]] and allowed for more productive societies. The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world, and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records.[[File:Bronze Age End.svg|thumb|500x500px|Map of the [[late Bronze Age collapse]], c. 1200 BC|alt=|center]]During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around 1200&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By around 1180&amp;nbsp;BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was under way. The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200&amp;nbsp;BC. In Greece the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minona]] both disintegrated. A wave of [[Sea Peoples]] attacked many countries, only Egypt survived intact. Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty. The [[Zhou dynasty]] was established in China shortly thereafter. During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power. Iron Age China then dissolved into the [[Warring States period|warring states period]] where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles.

[[Pirak]] is an early iron-age site in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], going back to about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.

==== Axial Age ====
{{Main|Axial Age}}
The preceding [[Iron Age]] is often thought to have ended in the Middle East around 550 BC due to the rise of [[historiography]] (the historical record). The [[Axial Age]] is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of Iran|Iran]], [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]] and [[History of China|China]]. Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period, including the rise of the [[Silk Road]]. This period saw the rise of [[philosophy]] and proselytizing religions.

Philosophy, religion and science were diverse in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] producing thinkers such as [[Confucius]], [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] and [[Mozi]] during the sixth century BC. Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of [[Early Buddhism|Buddhism]], in the Near East with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Judaism]] and in the west with [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning.&lt;ref name = &quot;Neville&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;q=%22Axial+Age&amp;pg=PA104 | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =978-0-7914-5424-4 | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies. Significant for the time was the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Turchin|date=14 April 2012|title=Religion and Empire in the Axial Age|url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|page=3|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604213741/http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire's vast territory extended from modern day [[Egypt]] to [[Xinjiang]]. The empire's legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east. The [[Royal Road]] allowed for efficient trade and taxation.  Though Macedonian [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in its entirety, the unity of Alexander's conquests did not survive past his lifetime. Greek culture, and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures.

====Formation of empires and fragmentation====

Separate [[Diadochi|Greek Kingdoms]] Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mastering World History&quot; by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the expansion of the [[Han dynasty]] westward the Silk Road as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin, South Asia and East Asia.  In South Asia, the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived, its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states.

Supplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing [[Roman Republic]] and the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]].  As a result of empires, urbanization and literacy spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires. Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states. Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade, in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries. Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication. Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty [[Sino-Roman relations|rarely communicated]] but trade of goods did occur as evidenced by archaeological discoveries such as Roman coins in Vietnam. At this time most of the world's population inhabited only a small part of the earth's surface. Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as [[Siberia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] remained sparsely populated. The [[New World]] hosted a variety of separate civilizations in the but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel.

Empires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars, economic decline and a changing political environment internationally. In 220 AD Han China collapsed into [[Three Kingdoms|warring states]] while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from turmoil in the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Third Century Crisis]]. In Persia regime change took place from [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] to the more centralized [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations. Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD

Proselytizing religions began to replace [[polytheism]] and [[folk religion]]s in many areas. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] gained a wide following in the Roman Empire, Zoroastrianism became the state enforced religion of Iran and [[History of Buddhism|Buddhism]] spread to East Asia from South Asia. Social change, political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical era in Eurasia roughly around the year 500.

[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|alt=Jupiter Ammon|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', a form of [[Zeus]] 1st century AD. Gods, could sometimes be transferred or adopted by many civilizations, and then adjusted for local conditions.]]
The rise of civilization corresponded with the institutional sponsorship of belief in gods, supernatural forces and the afterlife. During the [[Bronze Age]], many civilizations adopted their own form of [[Polytheism]]. Usually, polytheistic Gods manifested human personalities, strengths and failings.  Early religion was often based on location, with cities or entire countries selecting a deity, that would grant them preferences and advantages over their competitors. Worship involved the construction of representation of deities, and the granting of sacrifices. Sacrifices could be material goods, food, or in extreme cases human sacrifice to please a deity. New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.

The ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa]], [[Karma]], [[Jnana]], [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]] and [[Moksha|Moksa]]. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

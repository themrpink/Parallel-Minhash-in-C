==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Digital printing==
By 2005, [[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45&amp;nbsp;trillion pages printed annually around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;vj_ipg2-0_keynote&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032849/http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html |date=February 16, 2008 }}&quot; Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
* small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
* wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:
* [[blueprint]] – and related chemical technologies
* [[daisy wheel]] – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
* [[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
* [[line printer|line printing]] – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
* [[thermal printer|heat transfer]] – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
* [[inkjet]] – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
* [[electrophotography]] – where [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed
* [[laser printing|laser]] – a type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
* [[solid ink]] printer – where [[solid]] sticks of ink are melted to make liquid ink or toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying, the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from [[3D modeling|three-dimensional digital models]] using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession.  The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Gang run printing==
[[Gang run printing]] is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and [https://www.printulu.co.za/blog/rgb-vs-cmyk/ CMYK process color] jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press.  Printers use the term &quot;gang run&quot; or &quot;gang&quot; to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet, therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in roughly the same amount of time as one job.

==Printed electronics==
[[Printed electronics]] is the manufacturing of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics technology can be produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the printable electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including [[Bemis Company]] and [[Illinois Tool Works]] have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily to the advancement of the printed electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Announcements Show Gains Being Made by PE Industry|url=http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2012/07/recent-announcements-show-gains-being-made-by-pe-i|publisher=Printed Electronics Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printable transistors usher in 'internet of things'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/21/thinfilm/|website=The Register|access-date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cavalcade''''' is a play by [[Noël Coward]] with songs by Coward and others. It focuses on three decades in the life of the Marryots, an upper-middle-class British family, and their servants, beginning in 1900 and ending in 1930, a year before the premiere. It is set against major historical events of the period, including the [[Relief of Mafeking]]; the death of [[Queen Victoria]]; the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]; and the [[First World War]]. The popular songs at the time of each event were interwoven into the score.

The play was premiered in London in 1931 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], directed by the author. The spectacular production presented by the impresario [[Charles B. Cochran]], involved a huge cast and massive sets. The play was very successful and ran for almost a year. It took advantage of the large stage of the Drury Lane Theatre with its hydraulics and moving components to dramatise the events.  
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Background and production==
During the run of his successful comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' in London in 1930, Coward discussed with the impresario [[Charles B. Cochran|C. B. Cochran]] the idea of a large, spectacular production to follow the intimate ''Private Lives''. He considered the idea of an epic set in the French revolution, but in an old copy of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' he saw a photograph of a troopship leaving for the [[Boer War]], which gave him the idea for the new play. He outlined his scenario to Cochran and asked him to secure the [[London Coliseum|Coliseum]], London's largest theatre. Cochran was unable to do so, but was able to book the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], which was not much smaller,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, p. 1354&lt;/ref&gt; provided Coward could guarantee an approximate opening date.&lt;ref name=m166&gt;Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 166–1567&lt;/ref&gt; Coward and his designer [[Gladys Calthrop]] inspected Drury Lane and found it adequate in terms of the size of its stage and its technical facilities, although two extra [[hydraulics|hydraulic lifts]] had to be installed for quick changes of scenery, and unlike the Coliseum it lacked the revolving stage Coward coveted.&lt;ref name=m166/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coward, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; While Calthrop began designing hundreds of costumes and twenty-two  sets, Coward worked on the script, which he completed in August 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley, p. 159; and Morley (1974), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehearsals began the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; With four hundred cast and crew members involved in the production, Coward divided the crowd into groups of twenty and assigned each a leader. Because remembering individual names would be impossible, everyone was given a colour and number for easy identification, thus allowing Coward to direct &quot;Number 7 red&quot; to cross downstage and shake hands with &quot;Number 15 yellow and black&quot;. Extras were encouraged to create their own bits of stage business, as long as it did not draw attention from the main action of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Morley (1974), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cavalcade'' premiered on 13 October 1931, starring [[Mary Clare]] and Edward Sinclair as the Marryot parents and featuring [[John Mills]], [[Binnie Barnes]], [[Una O'Connor (actress)|Una O'Connor]], [[Moya Nugent]], [[Arthur Macrae]], Irene Browne and Maidie Andrews in supporting roles. Despite a brief delay caused by a mechanical problem early in the first act, the performance was a strong success, and the play went on to become one of the year's biggest [[West End theatre|West End]] hits, running for 405 performances. The play closed in September 1932.

==Synopsis==
===Part I===
====Scene 1: Sunday 31 December 1899. The drawing-room of a London House====
It is nearly midnight. Robert and Jane Marryot are seeing in the New Year quietly together in their London house. Their happiness is clouded by the Boer War: Jane's brother is besieged in Mafeking, and Robert himself will shortly be going to South Africa. Robert and Jane invited their butler, Bridges, and his wife, Ellen, to join them. Bells, shouting, and sirens outside usher in the New Year, and Robert proposes a toast to 1900.

====Scene 2: Saturday 27 January 1900. A dockside====
A month later, a contingent of volunteers are leaving for the war. On the dockside Jane and Ellen are seeing off Robert and Bridges. As the men go aboard, Jane comforts Ellen, who is crying.

====Scene 3: Friday 8 March 1900. The drawing-room of the Marryots' house====
The Marryot boys, Edward, aged twelve, and Joe, aged eight, are playing soldiers with a young friend, Edith Harris. She objects to being made to play &quot;the Boers&quot;, and they begin to quarrel. The noise brings in their mothers. Joe throws a toy at Edith, and is sharply slapped by Jane, whose nerves are on edge with anxiety about her brother and her husband. Her state of mind is not helped by a barrel-organ outside, playing &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot; under the window. Margaret, Edith's mother, sends the organ-grinder away and proposes to take Jane to the theatre to take her mind off her worry.

====Scene 4: Friday 8 May 1900. A theatre====
Jane and Margaret are in a stage-box, watching ''MirabeIle'', the currently popular [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]].

Joyous uproar breaks out; the audience claps and cheers and some begin to sing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

====Scene 5: Monday 21 January 1901. The kitchen of the Marryots' house====
The cook, Annie the parlourmaid, and Ellen's mother Mrs Snapper are preparing a special tea to greet Bridges on his return from the war. He comes in with Ellen, looking well, and kisses his little baby, Fanny. He tells them that he has bought a public house so that he and Ellen can work for themselves in future. The celebratory mood is dampened when Annie brings in a newspaper reporting that Queen Victoria is dying.

====Scene 6: Sunday 27 January 1901. Kensington Gardens====

====Scene 7: Saturday 2 February 1901. The Marryots' drawing-room====
On the balcony, Jane, Margaret, their children and the servants are watching Queen Victoria's funeral procession.

Jane has brought her son Edward, now eighteen, to see Ellen in the flat above the public house. They have just finished tea, together with Flo and George, relations of the Bridges.

Bridges starts to bully Fanny and is ejected from the room by George and Flo.

====Scene 2: Saturday 16 June 1906. A London street (exterior of the public house)====

A concert party of six &quot;Uncles&quot; is performing in a bandstand. Ellen and her family are there and Fanny wins a prize for a song and dance competition. They unexpectedly meet Margaret, Jane and Joe. Ellen tells them that she has kept on the pub since her husband's death and that Fanny is now at a dancing-school and determined to go on the stage.

====Scene 5: Sunday 14 April 1912. The deck of an Atlantic liner====
Edward has married Edith Harris, and they are on their honeymoon. They speculate blithely how long the initial bliss of marriage will last. As they walk off, she lifts her cloak from where it has been draped on the ship rail, revealing the name [[R.M.S. Titanic|Titanic]] on a lifebelt. The lights fade into complete darkness; the orchestra plays &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee &quot; very quietly.

====Scene 6: Tuesday 4 August 1914. The Marryots' drawing-room ====
[[First World War|War]] has been declared. Robert and Joe are keen to join the army. Jane is horrified, and refuses to indulge in the jingoisim she sees around her.

Joe and Fanny – now a rising young actress – are dining in a West End restaurant. Joe is in army officer's uniform. He is on leave but is about to return to the Front. They discuss marriage, but she envisages opposition from his family, and bids him wait until he is back from the war for good.

====Scene 9: Tuesday 22 October 1918. A railway station====
Jane sees Joe off at the railway station. Like many of the women on the platform she is distressed.

====Scene 10: Monday 11 November 1918. The Marryots' drawing-room ====

As Ellen is leaving, the maid brings in a telegram. Jane opens it and tells Ellen. &quot;You needn't worry about Fanny and Joe any more, Ellen. He won't be able to come back at all, because he's dead.&quot;

====Scene 11: Monday 11 November 1918. Trafalgar Square====
Surrounded by the frantic revelry of Armistice Night, Jane is walking, dazed, through Trafalgar Square. With tears streaming down her face, she cheers wildly and waves a rattle, while the band plays &quot;Land of Hope and Glory &quot;.

===Part III ===
====Scene 1: Tuesday 31 December 1929. The Marryot's drawing room====
Margaret and Jane, both now elderly, are sitting by the fire. Margaret leaves, after wishing a happy New Year to Jane and Robert, who has come in to drink a New Year toast with his wife. Jane drinks first to him and then to England: &quot;The hope that one day this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness, and peace again&quot;.

====Scene 2: Evening, 1930. A night club====
Robert, Jane, Margaret, Ellen, and the full company are in a night club. At the piano, Fanny sings &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, and after the song everyone dances.

====Scene 3: Chaos====
The lights fade, and a chaotic succession of images representative of life in 1929 is spotlighted. When the noise and confusion reach a climax the stage suddenly fades into darkness and silence. At the back a [[Union Jack]] glows through the darkness. The scene ends with the lights coming up on the massed company singing &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

==Revivals and adaptations==
The play was first revived in the West End in 1966, at the [[Scala Theatre]], with a cast of 96 drama students from the [[Rose Bruford College]]. The reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' found Coward's work remained &quot;dazzling and durable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Students' skill in Coward play&quot;, ''The Times'', 15 July 1966, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional revival was in 1981 at the [[Redgrave Theatre, Farnham|Redgrave Theatre]] in [[Farnham]] in a production directed by David Horlock and with a cast of 12 professional actors and 300 amateur performers. That production was filmed by the [[BBC]] and shown in 1982 as a two-part documentary, ''Cavalcade – A Backstage Story''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6678cff19ba242679b789a26df8ad38a &quot;Cavalcade – A Backstage Story&quot;], BBC Genome.

Lejeune]] called it &quot;the best British film that has ever been made&quot;, and expressed exasperation that British studios had not taken the play up instead of allowing it to go to Hollywood.&lt;ref name=cal&gt;Lejeune, C. A. &quot;The Pictures&quot;, ''The Observer'', 19 February 1933&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|&quot;Why must a couple of dozen British artists go half across the world to make a film of British life under a British director from a play by a British dramatist?&quot;&lt;ref name=cal/&gt;|group= n}} ''Cavalcade'' was adapted for BBC radio by [[Val Gielgud]] and [[Felix Felton]] and broadcast three times in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Coward's &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 June 1936; and &quot;Revival of Noel Coward's 'Cavalcade'&quot;, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 October 1936, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A 1970s television series, ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', was to some extent based on the play.&lt;ref&gt;Morley (1999), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Opening just before the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|British General Election]], the play's strongly patriotic themes were credited by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for helping them secure a large percentage of the [[middle class]] votes, despite the fact Coward had conceived the project a full year before the election was held, and strenuously denied having any thought of influencing its outcome.&lt;ref name=c241&gt;Coward, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|&quot;I was … congratulated upon my uncanny shrewdness in slapping on a strong patriotic play two weeks before a General Election, which was bound to result in a sweeping Conservative majority. (Here I must regretfully admit that during rehearsals I was so very much occupied in the theatre and, as usual, so bleakly uninterested in politics that I had not the remotest idea, until a few days before production, that there was going to be an election at all! However, there was, and its effect on the box office was considerable.)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coward, ''quoted'' in Mander and Michenson, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] attended the performance on election night and received Coward in the [[Box (theatre)|Royal Box]] during the second [[Intermission|interval]].&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' for 1 November 1931, Alan Parsons wrote:
{{quote|When the curtain fell last night at Drury Lane on Mr Noel Coward's ''Cavalcade'', there was an ovation such as I have not heard in very many years' playgoing. Mr Coward, after returning thanks to all concerned, said: &quot;After all, it is a pretty exciting thing in these days to be English&quot;. And therein lies the whole secret of ''Cavalcade''—it is a magnificent play in which the note of national pride pervading every scene and every sentence must make each one of us face the future with courage and high hopes.&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

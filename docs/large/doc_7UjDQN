Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were no hit singles from the 1970 album ''Back Home'', but in 1972 Chess released a live recording of &quot;[[My Ding-a-Ling]]&quot;, a novelty song which he had recorded in a different version as &quot;My Tambourine&quot; on his 1968 LP ''From St. Louie to Frisco''.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The track became his only number-one single. A live recording of &quot;[[Reelin' and Rockin']]&quot;, issued as a follow-up single in the same year, was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the part-live, part-studio album ''[[The London Chuck Berry Sessions]]'' (other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess's mainstay artists [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]). Berry's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album ''Chuck Berry'', after which he did not make a studio record until ''[[Rockit (album)|Rockit]]'' for [[Atco Records]] in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Berry,_Chuck/Discography/album/P3664/R30491/|title=Rock It Album Review, Songs, Ratings|publisher=starpulse.com|accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chuck Berry Midnight Special 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|Berry as guest host of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' in 1973]]

In the 1970s Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. [[AllMusic]] said that in this period his &quot;live performances became increasingly erratic,&amp;nbsp;... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy, out-of-tune performances&quot; which &quot;tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers&quot; alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; In March 1972 he was filmed, at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire|BBC Television Theatre]] in Shepherds Bush, for ''Chuck Berry in Concert'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rbc|title=Chuck Berry in Concert - BBC Four|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a 60-date tour backed by the band [[The Rocking Horse Winner (band)|Rocking Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-snow-mn0000965472|title=Michael Snow - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s were [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] when each was just starting his career. Springsteen related in the documentary film ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'' that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry did not speak to the band after the show. Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. At the request of [[Jimmy Carter]], Berry performed at the [[White House]] on June 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/chuck-berry|title=Chuck Berry|last=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berry's touring style, traveling the &quot;oldies&quot; circuit in the 1970s (often being paid in cash by local promoters) added ammunition to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s accusations that Berry had evaded paying income taxes. Facing criminal sanction for the third time, Berry pleaded guilty to evading nearly $110,000 in federal income tax owed on his 1973 earnings. Newspaper reports in 1979 put his 1973 joint income (with his wife) at $374,982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/13/archives/chuck-berry-pleads-guilty-to-tax-evasion-for-1973.html

===1980–2017: Last years on the road===
[[File:ChuckBerry1997.jpg|thumb|left|Berry performing at the 1997 [[Long Beach Blues Festival]]]]

Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, [[Taylor Hackford]] made a documentary film, ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'' of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by [[Keith Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rocknroll-fireworks-keith-richards-and-chuck-berry-together-on-stage-440364.html |title=Rock'n'Roll Fireworks: Keith Richards and Chuck Berry Together on Stage |work=The Independent |accessdate=June 6, 2010 |location=London |first=Taylor |last=Hackford |date=March 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205165400/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rocknroll-fireworks-keith-richards-and-chuck-berry-together-on-stage-440364.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Clapton]], [[Etta James]], [[Julian Lennon]], [[Robert Cray]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]], among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a [[Gibson ES-355]], the luxury version of the [[Gibson ES-335|ES-335]] that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black [[Fender Telecaster]] Custom, Cray a [[Fender Stratocaster]] and Clapton a Gibson ES 350T, the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/us/sweet-tunes-fast-beats-and-a-hard-edge.html|title=Sweet Tunes, Fast Beats and a Hard Edge&amp;nbsp;— Series|work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 18, 2010|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|date=February 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Berry bought the [[Southern Air Restaurant|Southern Air]], a restaurant in [[Wentzville, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Rock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/berrytwo.htm|title=Chuck Berry|publisher=history-of-rock.com|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Berry faced legal issues when he was sued by his former pianist [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] who claimed that he had co-written over 50 songs, including &quot;No Particular Place to Go&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, that credit Berry alone.

[[File:Chuck Berry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Berry in 2008]]
In 2008, Berry toured Europe, with stops in Sweden, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Poland, and Spain.

Berry lived in [[Ladue, Missouri]], approximately {{convert|10|mi}} west of St. Louis. He also had a home at &quot;Berry Park&quot;, near Wentzville, Missouri where he lived part-time since the 1950s and was the home in which he died. This home, with the guitar-shaped swimming pool, is seen in scenes near the end of the film &quot;[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.de/archive_october2002.htm|title=News Archive&amp;nbsp;– October 2002|publisher=chuckberry.de|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He regularly performed one Wednesday each month at [[Blueberry Hill (restaurant)|Blueberry Hill]], a restaurant and bar located in the [[Delmar Loop]] neighborhood of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], from 1996 to 2014.

Berry announced on his 90th birthday that his first new studio album since ''Rockit'' in 1979, entitled ''[[Chuck (Chuck Berry album)|Chuck]]'', would be released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/18/chuck-berry-new-album-first-in-38-years|title=Chuck Berry, 90, announces first album in 38 years|date=October 18, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first new record in 38 years, it includes his children, Charles Berry Jr. and Ingrid, on guitar and harmonica, with songs &quot;covering the spectrum from hard-driving rockers to soulful thought-provoking time capsules of a life's work&quot; and dedicated to his beloved wife of 68 years, Toddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2016/1018/Chuck-Berry-to-release-new-studio-album-at-90-video|title=Chuck Berry to release new studio album at 90|author=Beck, Christina|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|date=October 31, 2016|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical and sexual abuse allegations====
In 1987, Berry was charged with assaulting a woman at [[Gramercy Park Hotel|New York's Gramercy Park Hotel]]. He was accused of causing &quot;lacerations of the mouth, requiring five stitches, two loose teeth, [and] contusions of the face.&quot; He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment and paid a $250 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/chuck-berry-inside-father-of-rocks-triumphs-scandals-w475260|title=Chuck Berry: Farewell to the Father of Rock|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|date=April 7, 2017|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a [[video camera]] in the bathroom. Berry claimed that he had had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Although his guilt was never proven in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. One of his biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that with 59 women it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/us/sweet-tunes-fast-beats-and-a-hard-edge.html|title=Sweet Tunes, Fast Beats and a Hard Edge&amp;nbsp;— Series|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 18, 2010| first=Bernard |last=Weinraub |date=February 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BERNARD WEINRAUB |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/us/sweet-tunes-fast-beats-and-a-hard-edge.html |title=Sweet Tunes, Fast Beats and a Hard Edge |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2003 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom was apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence, placed on two years unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.&lt;ref name=RSBIO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |title=Chuck Berry: Biography |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714112146/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |archive-date=July 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards a private service was held in the club celebrating Berry's life and musical career, with the Berry family inviting 300 members of the public into the service. [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] gave an impromptu, unadvertised eulogy at the service, while [[Little Richard]] was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but was unable to attend due to an illness.

One of Berry's attorneys estimated that his estate was worth $50 million, including $17 million in music rights. Berry's music publishing accounted for $13 million of the estate's value. The Berry estate owned roughly half of his songwriting credits (mostly from his later career), while [[BMG Rights Management]] controlled the other half; most of Berry's recordings are currently owned by [[Universal Music Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/7735739/chuck-berry-left-behind-17-million-in-music-assets|title=Business-Savvy Chuck Berry Left Behind An Estimated $50 Million Estate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, Dualtone, the label which released Berry's final album, ''Chuck'', agreed to publish all his compositions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7980738/chuck-berry-us-publishing-dualtone-isalee-music|title=Dualtone to Handle Chuck Berry U.S. Publishing Rights: Exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

{{quote box|width=30%|quote=While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together. It was his particular genius to graft country &amp; western guitar licks onto a rhythm &amp; blues chassis in his very first single, &quot;Maybellene&quot;.|source=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/chuck-berry/bio/|title=Chuck Berry Biography|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A pioneer of rock and roll, Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as &quot;[[Maybellene]]&quot; (1955), &quot;[[Roll Over Beethoven]]&quot; (1956), &quot;[[Rock and Roll Music]]&quot; (1957) and &quot;[[Johnny B. Goode]]&quot; (1958), Berry refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; and utilizing [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]] that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008p168/&gt;  Thus Berry, the songwriter, according to critic [[Jon Pareles]], invented rock as &quot;a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/arts/chuck-berry-dead.html |title=Chuck Berry, Rock 'n' Roll Pioneer, Dies at 90 |author=John Pareles |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Lynch |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-berry-didnt-invent-rock-n-roll-but-he-turned-an-attitude-changed-world-987198 |title=Chuck Berry Didn't Invent Rock 'n' Roll, But He Turned It Into an Attitude That Changed the World |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components of rock and roll.

On July 29, 2011, Berry was honored in a dedication of an eight-foot, in-motion Chuck Berry Statue in the Delmar Loop in St. Louis right across the street from Blue Berry Hill.  Berry said, &quot;It's glorious--I do appreciate it to the highest, no doubt about it.  That sort of honor is seldom given out.  But I don't deserve it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daniel Durchholz |first= Daniel |date=July 29, 2011 |title=Chuck Berry Statue Unveiled in St. Louis |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chuck-berry-statue-unveiled-in-st-louis-247875/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked what caused the explosion of the popularity of rock 'n roll that took place in the 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, &quot;Well, actually they begin to listen to it, you see, because certain stations played certain music. The music that we, the blacks, played, the cultures were so far apart, we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together, and you begin to see one another's vein of life, then the music came together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Berry, 1972, interview by Charles Osgood, re-broadcast, ''CBS Sunday Morning'', September 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The document also maintains that India &quot;will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail&quot; and that decisions to authorise the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the prime minister or his 'designated successor(s)'.&lt;ref name=NFU/&gt; According to the [[National Research Development Corporation]], despite the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan in 2001–2002, India remained committed to its nuclear no-first-use policy.&lt;ref&gt;[shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/.../08_chapter%204.pdf A Rani (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; India is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on &quot;[[credible minimum deterrence]]&quot;.

===Russia===
Russia describes its entire military doctrine as defensive [[Military doctrine of Russia#2010 Military Doctrine|military doctrine]].
With regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons:
* in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also
* in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Policy2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|orig-year=presidential decree 2010-06-25|date=2010-06-25|script-title=ru:Военная доктрина Российской Федерации|title=Voyennaya doktrina Rossiyskoy Federatsii|trans-title=Military doctrine of the Russian Federation|language=ru|website=scrf.gov.ru|location=Moscow|publisher=[[Security Council of the Russian Federation]]|url=http://www.scrf.gov.ru/documents/33.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504070127/http://www.scrf.gov.ru/documents/33.html|archivedate=2011-05-04|url-status=dead}} The same URL is used for various revisions with different presidential decree dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2002, the [[secretary of state for defence]] [[Geoff Hoon]] stated that the UK was prepared to use nuclear weapons against &quot;[[rogue state]]s&quot; such as Iraq if they ever used &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; against British troops in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1883258.stm  |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— UK 'prepared to use nuclear weapons' |accessdate=2007-09-14 |date= 20 March 2002&lt;!--, 14:49 GMT--&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021020052015/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1883258.stm |archivedate = 2002-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was restated in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2717939.stm |date= 2 February 2003&lt;!--, 19:25 GMT --&gt;|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— UK restates nuclear threat |accessdate=2007-09-14 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 Defence Secretary [[Michael Fallon]] confirmed that the UK would use nuclear weapons in a &quot;[[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|pre-emptive initial strike]]&quot; in &quot;the most extreme circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref name=independent-20170424&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nuclear-weapons-first-strike-michael-fallon-general-election-jeremy-corbyn-trident-a7698621.html |title=Theresa May would fire UK's nuclear weapons as a 'first strike', says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon |first=Rob |last=Merrick |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallon stated in a parliamentary answer that the UK has neither a 'first use' or 'no first use' in its nuclear weapon policy so that its adversaries would not know when the UK would launch nuclear strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-09-05/8502/ |title=Nuclear Weapons:Written question - 8502  |first=Michael |last=Fallon |date=5 September 2017 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy and says that it &quot;reserves the right to use&quot; nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict. The US doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons was revised most recently in the [[Nuclear Posture Review]], released April 6, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclposreview&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121227050836/http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/10-04-06_NPR%20201%20Briefing%20-%201032.pdf Nuclear Posture Review Report], [[U.S. Department of Defense]], April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2010 Nuclear Posture review reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons, &quot;The fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist, is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners.&quot; The U.S. doctrine also includes the following assurance to other states: &quot;The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclposreview&quot;/&gt;

For states eligible for the assurance, the United States would not use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical or biological attack but states that those responsible for such an attack would be held accountable and would face the prospect of a devastating conventional military response. Even for states that are not eligible for the assurance, the United States would consider the use of nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. The Nuclear Posture Review also notes, &quot;It is in the U.S. interest and that of all other nations that the nearly 65-year record of nuclear non-use be extended forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclposreview&quot;/&gt;

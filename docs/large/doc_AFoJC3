'''Orange County''' is a county located in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 3,010,232,&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Orange County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06059.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 4, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60DIyoARz?url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06059.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third-most populous county in California, the [[County statistics of the United States|sixth most populous]] in the U.S., and more populous than 21 U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American FactFinder|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=July 10, 2014|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2013/PEPANNRES/0100000US&amp;#124;0100000US.04000&amp;#124;0200000US1&amp;#124;0200000US2&amp;#124;0200000US3&amp;#124;0200000US4}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mostly suburban, it is the second most densely populated county in the state, behind [[San Francisco|San Francisco County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--county-rank.htm |title=California Population Density County Rank |publisher=USA.com |access-date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the county's three most populous cities, [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] (the [[county seat]]), and [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] has a population exceeding 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503072804/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=May 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington Beach, the fourth most populous city, has a population of slightly under 200,000 people. Six cities are on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, including [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]].

Orange County is included in the [[Los Angeles]]-[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]-[[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The county has 34 [[Incorporated place|incorporated]] cities. Older cities like Santa Ana, Anaheim, [[Orange, California|Orange]], and [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, while newer commercial development or &quot;[[edge city|edge cities]]&quot; stretch [[Anaheim–Santa Ana edge city|along I-5 between Disneyland and Santa Ana]] and [[South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city|between South Coast Plaza and the Irvine Business Complex]], and cluster at [[Irvine Spectrum]]. Although single-family homes make up the dominant landscape for most of the county, Northern and Central Orange County is relatively more urbanized and dense as compared to those areas beyond Irvine, which are less dense, though still contiguous and primarily suburban rather than [[exurban]].

The county is a tourist center, with attractions like [[Disneyland]], [[Knott's Berry Farm]], [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]], [[Modjeska House]], [[Yost Theater]], [[Balboa Island]], [[Angel Stadium]], Crystal Cove State Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=644&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crystalcovestatepark.org/&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Honda Center]], and several popular beaches along its more than {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} of coastline.

Members of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]], [[Juaneño]], and [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]] Native American groups long inhabited the area. After the 1769 expedition of [[Gaspar de Portolà]], a Spanish expedition led by [[Junipero Serra]] named the area Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of [[Saint Anne]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A brief history of Orange County | author = Phil Brigandi | publisher = County of Orange | date = March 9, 2007 | access-date = May 28, 2009 | url = http://www.oc.ca.gov/RECORDER/Archives/forms/history%20of%20orange%20county.pdf| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090528102945/http://www.oc.ca.gov/recorder/Archives/forms/history%20of%20orange%20county.pdf| archive-date= May 28, 2009 | url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 1776, [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] became the area's first permanent European settlement. Among those who came with Portolá were [[Rancho Los Nietos|José Manuel Nieto]] and [[José Antonio Yorba]]. Both these men were given land grants—[[Rancho Los Nietos]] and [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]], respectively. The Nieto heirs were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as [[Rancho Los Alamitos]], [[Rancho Las Bolsas]], and [[Rancho Los Coyotes]]. Yorba heirs [[Bernardo Yorba]] and [[José Antonio Yorba|Teodosio Yorba]] were also granted [[Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana]] (Santa Ana Canyon Ranch) and [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]], respectively. Other ranchos in Orange County were granted by the Mexican government during the Mexican period in [[Alta California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://egov.ocgov.com/vgnfiles/ocgov/Clerk-Recorder/Docs/Archives/Spanish_and_Mexican_Ranchos.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726003947/http://egov.ocgov.com/vgnfiles/ocgov/Clerk-Recorder/Docs/Archives/Spanish_and_Mexican_Ranchos.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Spanish and Mexican Ranchos of Orange County|archive-date=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, [[cattle]] [[ranching]], and much land came into the possession of Richard O'Neill, Sr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ranchomissionviejo.com/blog/the-reserve-at-rancho-mission-viejo-a-rich-history/|title=The Reserve at Rancho Mission Viejo: A Rich History|work=Rancho Mission Viejo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]] and other [[land baron]]s. In 1887, [[silver]] was discovered in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], attracting settlers via the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]s.

[[File:Los Angeles County Before OC Secession.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Los Angeles County]] before the secession of Orange County in 1889]]

After several failed attempts in previous sessions, the [[California legislature]] passed a bill authorizing the portion of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] south of Coyote Creek to hold a referendum on whether to remain part of Los Angeles County or to secede and form a new county to be named “Orange” as directed by the legislature. Such referendum required a 2/3 vote for secession to take place, and subsequently on June 4, 1889, the residents south of Coyote Creek voted 2,509 to 500 in favor of secession. After such referendum, Los Angeles County filed three lawsuits in the courts to stall and stop the secession from occurring, but such attempts were futile. On July 17, 1889, a second referendum was held south of the Coyote Creek to determine if the county seat of the to-be county to be in either Anaheim or Santa Ana, along with an election for every county officer. In the end, Santa Ana defeated Anaheim in such referendum.  With the referendum taken place, the County of Orange was officially incorporated on August 1, 1889, as prescribed by state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost-la/how-orange-county-seceded-from-los-angeles|title=How Orange County Seceded from Los Angeles|first=Nathan|last=Masters|date=August 16, 2013|website=KCET|access-date=December 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the date of the incorporation of the county, the only geographical changes to have occurred which affected Orange County was when the County and Los Angeles County agreed to trade land around Coyote Creek to adjust the border of the two counties to conform with city blocks.

The county is said to have been named for the [[citrus fruit]] in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradise – a place where anything could grow.&lt;ref&gt;Sleeper, Jim. &quot;How Orange County Got Its Name&quot; (1974).

Other [[citrus]] crops, [[avocado]]s, and [[petroleum|oil]] extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County benefited from the July 4, 1904, completion of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]], a [[tram|trolley]] connecting [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]]. The link made Orange County an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early [[Hollywood]]. It was deemed so significant that Pacific City changed its name to [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] in honor of [[Henry E. Huntington]], president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of [[Collis Huntington]]. Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] (now mostly [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]]) in the 1920s.

Agriculture, such as that involving the [[boysenberry|boysenberries]] made famous by [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]] native [[Walter Knott]], began to decline after [[World War II]]. However, the county's prosperity soared during this time. The completion of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] in 1954 helped make Orange County a [[bedroom community]] for many who moved to [[Southern California]] to work in [[aerospace]] and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2011/03/10/santa-ana-neighborhood-was-african-american-hub/|title=Santa Ana neighborhood was African American hub|last=Galvin|first=Andrew|date=March 10, 2011|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|language=en-US|access-date=March 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orange County received a further boost in 1955 with the opening of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]].

In 1969, [[Yorba Linda]]-born Orange County native [[Richard Nixon]] became the 37th [[President of the United States]].

In the 1980s, Orange County had become the second most populous county in California as the population topped two million for the first time.

{{anchor|bankruptcy}}In 1994, an investment fund meltdown led to the criminal prosecution of treasurer [[Robert Citron]]. The county lost at least $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion through high-risk investments in bonds. The loss was blamed on [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] by some media reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;timebankrupt&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Orange County Goes Bust |magazine=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]] bankruptcy,&lt;ref name=&quot;timebankrupt&quot;/&gt; from which it emerged on June 12, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In recent years, land use conflicts have arisen between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have regarded issues such as construction of new toll roads and the repurposing of a decommissioned air base. [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]] was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing [[John Wayne Airport]]. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions have caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. Instead, it became the [[Orange County Great Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/data/13030/jh/kt7d5nf2jh/files/kt7d5nf2jh.pdf Guide to the Collection on the Development of the El Toro Airport.] Online Archive of California.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|948|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|791|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|157|sqmi}} (16.6%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=September 28, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest county by area in [[Southern California]]. The average annual temperature is about {{convert|68|F|C}}.

Orange County is bordered on the southwest by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the north by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], on the northeast by [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], on the east by [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], and on the southeast by [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].

The northwestern part of the county lies on the [[coastal plain]] of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. Most of Orange County's population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the [[Santa Ana Valley]] and the [[Saddleback Valley]]. The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the [[Cleveland National Forest]]. The high point is [[Santiago Peak]] ({{convert|5689|ft|m|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ngs&quot;&gt;{{cite ngs | id = DX4296 | designation = RP 1 | accessdate = July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby [[Modjeska Peak]], just {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} shorter, form a ridge known as [[Saddleback (Orange County, California)|Saddleback]], visible from almost everywhere in the county. The [[Peralta Hills]] extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of [[Anaheim Hills]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], and ending in [[Olive, California|Olive]]. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by [[Santiago Creek|Santiago Canyon]].

The [[Santa Ana River]] is the county's principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is [[Santiago Creek]]. Other watercourses within the county include [[Aliso Creek (Orange County)|Aliso Creek]], [[San Juan Creek]], and Horsethief Creek. In the North, the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]]. [[Laguna Beach]] is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.

===Regions of Orange County===
[[File:Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley from over Costa Mesa by Don Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley from over Costa Mesa]]
Orange County is sometimes divided into northern and southern regions.  There are significant political, demographic, economic and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County.&lt;ref name=uci&gt;{{cite web |title=Orange County on the Cusp of Change |date=July 2014 |author1=[[University of California, Irvine]] Community and Labor Project |author2=[[UCLA]] Labor Center |url=http://labor.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/07/FINAL-OC-report-for-Web.pdf |access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular dividing line between the two regions is the [[Costa Mesa Freeway]].

North Orange County, including Anaheim, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], was the first part of the county to be developed and is culturally closer to neighboring [[Los Angeles County]]. This region is more Hispanic (mostly Mexican) and Asian (predominantly Vietnamese and Korean),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Orange County 2010 Census Demographic Profiles|publisher=US Census Bureau|via=Cal State Fullerton|access-date=January 23, 2020|url=http://www.fullerton.edu/cdr/_resources/pdf/census/Census2010_OC_DP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; more densely populated (Santa Ana is the [[List of United States cities by population density|fifth most densely-populated city in the United States]] with a population of over 200,000), younger, less wealthy and with higher unemployment. It has more renters, fewer homeowners and more registered Democrats as opposed to Republicans. There are notable exceptions to these general trends, such as strongly Republican [[Yorba Linda]] and affluent [[Anaheim Hills]] and [[Villa Park, California|Villa Park]].&lt;ref name=uci/&gt; North Orange County is predominantly flat, giving way to the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] in the Northeast.

South Orange County is more residential, wealthier, more Republican, less racially diverse and more recently developed. Irvine, the largest city in the region, is an exception to some of these trends, being a major employment center and having an Asian plurality (although Irvine's Asian population tends to be East Asian rather than Southeast Asian). South Orange County almost always includes Irvine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vacanies Are Up in South OC Offices |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33114305/south_oc_definition_la_times/ |access-date=June 22, 2019 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], and the cities to their southeast, including [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]], and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]. Costa Mesa is sometimes included in South County,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orangecoastrealestate.com/south-orange-county-real-estate/|title=South Orange County Real Estate foreclosures - South Orange County MLS homes &amp; Condos For sale|website=Orange Coast Real Estate}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is located predominantly to the west of the [[Costa Mesa Freeway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33114665/south-orange-co-definition/|title=South Orange Co. definition|date=October 18, 1986|pages=67|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irvine is located in a valley defined by the Santa Ana Mountains and the [[San Joaquin Hills]], while much of South Orange County is very hilly.

Another region of Orange County is the [[Orange Coast]], which includes the six cities bordering the Pacific Ocean. These are (from northwest to southeast): [[Seal Beach]], [[Huntington Beach]], [[Newport Beach]], [[Laguna Beach]], [[Dana Point]] and [[San Clemente]].

===Commercial clusters — edge cities===
{{See also|Irvine Spectrum|South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city}}
Older cities like Santa Ana, Anaheim, and [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, with Downtown Santa Ana being the home of the county, state and federal institutions. However, far more commercial activity is concentrated in clusters of newer commercial development are found in the county's [[edge city|edge cities]], the three largest being
* along [[Interstate 5]] [[Anaheim–Santa Ana edge city|between Disneyland and Downtown Santa Ana]]
* [[South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city|South Coast Plaza to the Irvine Business Complex]], and at 
* [[Irvine Spectrum]]

Entertainment and cultural facilities include [[Disneyland Resort]], [[Angel Stadium]], [[Christ Cathedral (Garden Grove, California)|Christ Cathedral]] (formerly Crystal Cathedral), [[City National Grove of Anaheim]] - a live concert venue, [[Discovery Cube Orange County]], the [[Honda Center]] - home to the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the NHL ([[National Hockey League]]), and the [[Anaheim Convention Center]]. Health care facilities include CHOC ([[Children's Hospital of Orange County]]), Kaiser Permanente Health Pavilion (Anaheim), [[St. Joseph Health System|St. Joseph Hospital (Orange)]], and the [[UCI Medical Center]].

Retail complexes include [[Anaheim GardenWalk]], Anaheim Marketplace (claiming to be the largest indoor [[swap meet]] in Orange County with more than 200 vendors), [[MainPlace Mall]], Orange Town &amp; Country, and [[The Outlets at Orange]], originally a mall named &quot;The City&quot; which was the centerpiece of a planned, 1970s [[mixed-use development]] by the same name. There is commercial strip-style development including [[big box retailers]] along West Chapman Avenue in Orange ([[Marshalls]], [[Ralphs]]), along Harbor Boulevard in Garden Grove ([[Burlington (department store)|Burlington]], [[Ross Dress for Less]]), and around Harbor Blvd. and Chapman Ave. in Anaheim ([[Target Corporation|Target]]).

Major hotels line [[Harbor Boulevard]] from Disneyland south to Garden Grove: Grand Legacy at the Park, Hilton, Marriott, Courtyard, DoubleTree Suites, Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites, Embassy Suites, Residence Inn, Hyatt Regency, Marriott Suites, Sheraton, and the Great Wolf Lodge. The [[Orange County Transit Authority]] studied the corridor as the possible route for a streetcar, a proposal that was dropped in 2018 due to opposition from Anaheim and other city governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Report Central Harbor Boulevard Transit Corridor Study |publisher=Orange County Transportation Authority |page=117 |url=https://www.octa.net/pdf/180731%20Harbor%20Blvd%20Final%20Report%20-%20Final1.pdf |access-date=July 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to suburban-style apartment complexes, Anaheim's [[Platinum Triangle, Anaheim|Platinum Triangle]] is undergoing transformation from a low-density commercial and industrial zone into a more urban environment with high-density housing, commercial office towers, and retail space. Anaheim envisions it as a &quot;downtown for Orange County&quot;.&lt;ref name=Khouri&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-0115-property-report-anaheim-20150115-story.html |title= Anaheim developments revive city's vision of a new downtown for O.C. |last= Khouri |first= Andrew |date= January 15, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date= January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|820|acres}} area undergoing this large-scale [[redevelopment]] includes the city's two major sports venues, the [[Honda Center]] and [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/platinum-688140-triangle-construction.html|title=Platinum Triangle development taking shape near Angel Stadium, Disneyland|first=Art |last=Marroquin |work=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=October 18, 2015|access-date=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GR8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=May 14, 2011|title=U.S. Census website}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 2,846,289 people, 935,287 households, and 667,794 families living in the county, making Orange County the second most populous county in [[California]]. The [[population density]] was 1,392/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,606/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). There were 969,484 housing units at an average density of 474/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,228/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The racial makeup of the county was 64.8% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 13.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 1.7% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.7% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.3% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 14.8% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.1% from two or more races. 30.8% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race. 8.9% were of [[german people|German]], 6.9% [[english people|English]] and 6.0% [[irish people|Irish]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 58.6% spoke only [[English language|English]] at home; 25.3% spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 4.7% [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], 1.9% [[Korean language|Korean]], 1.5% [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Cantonese]] or [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]) and 1.2% [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

In 1990, still according to the [[census]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GR2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were 2,410,556 people living in the county. The racial makeup of the county was 78.6% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 10.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 1.8% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.5% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], and 8.8% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]]. 23.4% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

Whites now comprise only 45 percent of the population, while the numbers of Hispanics grow steadily, along with Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese families. The percentage of foreign-born residents jumped to 30 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 1970.  The mayor of Irvine, Sukhee Kang, was born in Korea, making him the first Korean-American to run a major American city. “We have 35 languages spoken in our city,” Kang observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Nagourney2010&quot;&gt;Adam Nagourney, &quot;Orange County Is No Longer Nixon Country,&quot; [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/us/politics/30orange.html?hp ''New York Times,'' Aug. 30, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; The population is diverse age-wise, with 27.0% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.7 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $61,899, and the median income for a family was $75,700 (these figures had risen to $71,601 and $81,260 respectively as of a 2007 estimate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Factfinder - Orange County, CA|url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&amp;geo_id=05000US06059&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C05000US06013&amp;_street=&amp;_county=orange&amp;_cityTown=orange&amp;_state=04000US06&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=|access-date= December 14, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606042427/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&amp;geo_id=05000US06059&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C05000US06013&amp;_street=&amp;_county=orange&amp;_cityTown=orange&amp;_state=04000US06&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null:null&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=|archive-date= June 6, 2011|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

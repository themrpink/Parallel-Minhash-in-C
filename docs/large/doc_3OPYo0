Each square of the [[chessboard]] is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number. The vertical {{chessgloss|files}} are labeled ''a'' through ''h'', from White's left (i.e. the [[queenside]]) to White's right. Similarly, the horizontal {{chessgloss|ranks}} are numbered from ''1'' to ''8'', starting from the one nearest White's side of the board. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number. The white king, for example, starts the game on square '''e1'''. The black knight on '''b8''' can move to '''a6''' or '''c6'''.

In formal competition, each player is obliged to record each move as it is played in a [[chess notation]] in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. [[Algebraic chess notation]] is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as [[ICCF numeric notation]] for international [[correspondence chess]] and the obsolete [[descriptive chess notation]]. The current rule is that a move must be made on the board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.&lt;ref&gt;In a variation of the rules, a USCF director may allow players to write their move on a paper {{chessgloss|score sheet}} (but not enter it electronically) before making the move. Ref: [http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7594/28/ USCF rule changes as of August 2007] (requires registration) or [http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/reports/RulebookChanges.pdf PDF] retrieved Dec 4, 2009. &quot;Rule 15A. {{nowrap|(Variation I)}} Paper scoresheet variation. The player using a paper scoresheet may first make the move, and then write it on the scoresheet, or vice versa. This variation does not need to be advertised in advance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Before this was the rule, [[Mikhail Tal]] and others were in the habit of writing the move before making it on the board. Unlike other players, Tal did not hide the move after he had written it – he liked to watch for the reaction of his opponent before he made the move. Sometimes he crossed out a move he had written and wrote a different move instead {{harvcol|Timman|2005|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both players should indicate offers of a draw by writing &quot;=&quot; at that move on their score sheet {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=27}}. Notations about the time on the clocks can be made. If a player has less than five minutes left to complete all of their moves, they are not required to record the moves (unless a delay of at least thirty seconds per move is being used). The score sheet must be made available to the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} at all times. A player may respond to an opponent's move before writing it down {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=25–26}}.

:''See [[Adjournment (games)#Chess|Adjournment § Chess]].''

===Irregularities===

====Illegal move====
A player who makes an {{chessgloss|illegal move}} must retract that move and make a legal move. That move must be made with the same piece if possible, because the touch-move rule applies. If the illegal move was an attempt to castle, the touch-move rule applies to the king but not to the rook. The arbiter should adjust the time on the clock according to the best evidence. If the mistake is only noticed later on, the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred.{{refn|Article 7.5.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} Some regional organizations have different rules.&lt;ref&gt;The USCF requires that only an illegal move within the last ten moves be corrected. If the illegal move was more than ten moves ago, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A player may correct an illegal move if the player has not pressed their clock. If a player has pressed their clock, the illegal move may be stated by the arbiter intervening or by the opponent claiming the illegal move. If the arbiter does not intervenes and the opponent moves, the illegal move is accepted and without penalty.{{refn|Article 4.8 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;If the player has pressed their clock, the standard USCF rule is that two minutes are added to the offender's opponent's clock. An alternative USCF rule is that the opponent can claim a win by forfeit if the player has not touched a piece. If the player has left their king in check, the opponent may touch the piece that is giving check, remove the opponent's king, and claim a win {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FIDE Laws of Chess, the first stated completed illegal move results in a time penalty. The time penalty consists of giving the opponent two minutes extra time in standard and rapid chess, one minute extra time in Blitz.{{refn|Article 7.5.5 and B.2 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} The second stated completed illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game,{{refn|Article 7.5.5 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} unless the position is such that it is impossible for the opponent to win by any series of legal moves (e.g. if the opponent has a [[bare king]]) in which case the game is drawn.{{refn|Article 6.9 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} A move is completed when it has been made and the player has pressed the clock.{{refn|Article 6.2.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}

====Illegal position====
If it is discovered during the game that the starting position was incorrect, the game is restarted. If it is discovered during the game that the board is oriented incorrectly, the game is continued with the pieces transferred to a correctly oriented board. If the game starts with colours reversed, the game is restarted if less than 10 moves have been made by both players, otherwise the game is continued.{{refn|Article 7.3 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} Some regional organizations have different rules.&lt;ref&gt;The USCF rules are different. If before Black's tenth move is completed it is discovered that the initial position was wrong or that the colors were reversed, the game is restarted with the correct initial position and colors. If the discovery is made after the tenth move, the game continues {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a player knocks over pieces, it is their responsibility to restore them to their correct position on their time. If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made, or that pieces have been displaced, the game is restored to the position before the irregularity. If that position cannot be determined, the game is restored to the last known correct position.{{refn|Articles 7.5.1 and 7.6 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}

===Conduct===
Players may not use any notes, outside sources of information (including computers), or advice from other people. Analysis on another board is not permitted. Scoresheets are to record objective facts about the game only, such as time on the clock or draw offers. Players may not leave the competition area without permission of the arbiter {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30–31}}.

High standards of etiquette and ethics are expected. Players should shake hands before and after the game. Generally a player should not speak during the game, except to offer a draw, resign, or to call attention to an irregularity. An announcement of &quot;check&quot; is commonly made in informal games but is not recommended in officially sanctioned games. A player may not distract or annoy another player by any means, including repeatedly offering a draw {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=30–31,49–52}}.

Due to increasing concerns about the use of [[chess engine]]s and outside communication, [[mobile phone]] usage is banned. The first forfeit by a high-profile player, for their phone ringing during play, occurred in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/chess-1-1295070 &quot;I just called to say... you’re disqualified!&quot;], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 FIDE extended this to ban all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.&lt;ref name=&quot;chessbase-anti-cheating&quot;&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/new-fide-anti-cheating-rules New FIDE anti-cheating rules], ChessBase, 17 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
{{Main|Chess piece|Chessboard|Staunton chess set|Chess clock}}
[[Image:Staunton chess set.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=This photo shows a chessboard with pieces set up on both sides, ready to play. A chess clock is at the side.| Pieces at the start of a game and an analog [[chess clock]]]]

The size of the squares of the [[chessboard]] should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or 50 to 65&amp;nbsp;mm. Squares of approximately 57&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or [[buff (colour)|buff]].

[[File:JaquesCookStaunton.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|alt=A photo of the original Staunton chess pieces from about 1849.|Original Staunton chess pieces, introduced in 1849. Left to right: [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], [[rook (chess)|rook]], [[knight (chess)|knight]], [[bishop (chess)|bishop]], [[queen (chess)|queen]], and [[king (chess)|king]]]]
Pieces of the [[Staunton chess set]] design are the standard and are usually made of wood or plastic. They are often black and white; other colors may be used (like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; pieces (see [[White and Black in chess]]). The height of the king should be 85 to 105&amp;nbsp;millimetres (3.35–4.13&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref&gt;The 1988 and 2006 FIDE rules specify 85–105&amp;nbsp;mm;{{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=121}} the 2008 rules simply say &quot;about 95&amp;nbsp;mm&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; A height of approximately 95 to 102&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|4}}–4&amp;nbsp;inches) is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;ref&gt;The US Chess Federation allows the height of the king to be 86–114&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|3|8}}–{{frac|4|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches) {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In games subject to [[time control]], a [[chess clock]] is used, consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be [[Analog clock|analog]] or [[Clock#Digital clocks|digital]] though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either an [[Time_control#Increment_and_delay_methods|increment]] (extra time being added prior or after the move) or [[Time_control#Increment_and_delay_methods|delay]] (a countdown to when a clock starts again) to their time controls. Before the start of the game, either the arbiter decides, or whoever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.

==History==
The rules of chess have evolved much over the centuries from the early chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century, giving more mobility to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=41,328}} or early 16th century {{harvcol|Ruch|2004}}. The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. Pawns originally did not have the option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank. The queen was originally the ''[[ferz (chess)|fers]]'' or ''farzin'', which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some areas also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a ''pīl'' (Persian) or ''[[alfil (chess)|fīl]]'' (Arabic) (meaning &quot;elephant&quot;) which moved two squares diagonally with jump {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=13}}. In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be [[promotion (chess)|promoted]] to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was the weakest piece) if it reached its eighth rank {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59–61}}. During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=146}}; whence the word &quot;chequered&quot;/&quot;checkered&quot;.
[[Image:André Philidor.jpg|right|thumb|175px|alt=An image of Philidor, who published rules in 1749|Philidor]]
Between 1200 and 1600 several laws emerged that drastically altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing all of the opponent's pieces. [[Stalemate]] was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see [[Stalemate#History of the stalemate rule|History of the stalemate rule]]). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the ''[[en passant]]'' rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to [[castling|castle]] (see [[Castling#History|Variations throughout history of castling]] for different versions of the rule).

Between 1475 and 1500 the queen and the bishop also acquired their current moves, which made them much stronger pieces&lt;ref&gt;''[[A History of Chess]]''&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14–17}}. When all of these changes were accepted the game was in essentially its modern form {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=14–17}}.

The rules for pawn promotion have changed several times. As stated above, originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen, which at that time was a weak piece. When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece, the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook, bishop, or knight. In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured, e.g. the rules published in 1749 by [[François-André Danican Philidor]]. In the 19th century this restriction was lifted, which allowed for a player to have more than one queen, e.g. the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] {{harvcol|Davidson|1949|pp=59–61}}.

Two new rules concerning draws were introduced, each of which have changed through the years:
* The [[threefold repetition]] rule was added, although at some times up to six repetitions have been required, and the exact conditions have been specified more clearly (see [[Threefold repetition#History]]).
* The [[fifty-move rule]] was also added. At various times, the number of moves required was different, such as 24, 60, 70, or 75. For several years in the 20th century, the standard fifty moves was extended to one hundred moves for a few specific [[Chess endgame|endgames]] (see [[fifty-move rule#History|Fifty-move rule's history]]).

Another group of new laws included (1) the [[touch-move rule]] and the accompanying &quot;j'adoube/adjust&quot; rule; (2) that White moves first (in 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess-math.org/scholarsmate/ ''Scholar's Mate'' issue 102]&lt;/ref&gt;); (3) the orientation of the board; (4) the procedure if an illegal move was made; (5) the procedure if the king had been left in check for some moves; and (6) issues regarding the behavior of players and spectators. The [[Staunton chess set]] was introduced in 1849 and it became the standard style of pieces. The size of pieces and squares of the board was standardized {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220–21, ''laws, history of''}}.

Until the middle of the 19th century, chess games were played without any time limit. In an 1834 match between [[Alexander McDonnell]] and [[Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais]], McDonnell took an inordinate amount of time to move, sometimes up to 1½ hours. In 1836 [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant]] suggested a time limit, but no action was taken. At the [[London 1851 chess tournament|1851 London tournament]], Staunton blamed his loss in his match against [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]]  on Williams' slow play; one game was adjourned for the day after only 29 moves.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess Tournament – A Collection of Games Played at this Celebrated Assemblage'', London 1852, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The next year a match between [[Daniel Harrwitz]] and [[Johann Löwenthal]] used a limit of 20 minutes per move. The first use of a modern-style time limit was in an 1861 match between [[Adolph Anderssen]] and [[Ignác Kolisch]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=459}}.

The first known publication of chess rules was in a book by [[Luis Ramírez de Lucena]] about 1497, shortly after the movement of the queen, bishop, and pawn were changed to their modern form {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}. [[Ruy López de Segura]] gave rules of chess in his 1561 book [[Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez]] {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=294}}. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there were local differences concerning rules such as castling, pawn promotion, stalemate, and ''en passant''. Some of these differences persisted until the 19th century {{Harvcol|Harkness|1967|p=3}}; for example differences in castling rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century.

As chess clubs arose and tournaments became common, there was a need to formalize the rules. In 1749 [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] (1726–1795) wrote a set of rules that were widely used, as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by [[Jacob Sarratt]] (1772–1819) and rules by George Walker (1803–1879)&lt;!-- not any of the George Walkers with articles--&gt;. In the 19th century, many major clubs published their own rules, including The Hague in 1803, London in 1807, Paris in 1836, and St. Petersburg in 1854. In 1851 [[Howard Staunton]] (1810–1874) called for a &quot;Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess&quot; and proposals by [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa]] (1818–1889) were published in 1854. Staunton had published rules in ''Chess Player's Handbook'' in 1847, and his new proposals were published in 1860 in ''Chess Praxis''; they were generally accepted in English-speaking countries. German-speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority [[Johann Berger]] (1845–1933) or ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' by [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer]] (1815–1840), first published in 1843.

In 1924, Fédération Internationale des Échecs ([[FIDE]]) was formed and in 1929 it took up the task of standardizing the rules. At first FIDE tried to establish a universal set of rules, but translations to various languages differed slightly. Although FIDE rules were used for international competition under their control, some countries continued to use their own rules internally {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220–21}}. In 1952 FIDE created the Permanent Commission for the Rules of Chess (also known as the Rules Commission) and published a new edition of the rules. The third official edition of the laws was published in 1966. The first three editions of the rules were published in French, with that as the official version. In 1974 FIDE published the English version of the rules (which was based on an authorized 1955 translation). With that edition, English became the official language of the rules. Another edition was published in 1979. Throughout this time, ambiguities in the laws were handled by frequent interpretations that the Rules Commission published as supplements and amendments. In 1982 the Rules Commission rewrote the laws to incorporate the interpretations and amendments {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|pp=7–8}}. In 1984 FIDE abandoned the idea of a universal set of laws, although FIDE rules are the standard for high-level play {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=220–21}}. With the 1984 edition, FIDE implemented a four-year moratorium between changes to the rules. Other editions were issued in 1988 and 1992 {{harvcol|FIDE|1989|p=5}}, {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.

The rules of national FIDE affiliates (such as the [[United States Chess Federation]], or USCF) are based on the FIDE rules, with slight variations {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller states that the United States is the only country that does not follow the FIDE rules. Some of the differences in the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules are (1) a player must have a reasonably complete {{chessgloss|score sheet}} to claim a time forfeit and (2) the player can choose whether or not to use a clock with a delay period for each move {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=123–24}}. Some other differences are noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Harkness]] published popular rulebooks in the United States starting in 1956, and the USCF continues to publish rulebooks for use in tournaments it sanctions.

In 2008, FIDE added the variant [[Chess960]] to the appendix of the &quot;Laws of Chess&quot;. Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with the conditions that the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.{{refn|&quot;II.3 Chess960 castling rules&quot; under Guidelines in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}

In the 21st century, rules about such things as [[mobile phone]]s and unauthorised use of [[chess engines]] were introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;chessbase-anti-cheating&quot; /&gt;

==Variations==
From time to time, rules have been introduced at certain tournaments to discourage players from [[Draw by agreement#Steps taken to discourage draws or short draws|agreeing to short draws]]. One such case was the &quot;no drawing or resigning during the first 30 moves&quot; rule used at the [[London Chess Classic#2009 Classic: 8–15 December|2009 London Chess Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;pages W1 and W2 of &quot;Weekend&quot; supplement of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper for 21 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apparent retrograde motion''' is the apparent motion of a [[planet]] in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point. '''Direct motion''' or '''prograde motion''' is motion in the same direction as other bodies.

While the terms ''direct'' and ''prograde'' are equivalent in this context, the former is the traditional term in astronomy. The earliest recorded use of ''prograde'' was in the early 18th century, although the term is now less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Prograde, adj. | date = 2012 | work = OED Online version | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''retrograde'' is from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|retrogradus}} – &quot;backward-step&quot;, the affix {{lang|la|retro-}} meaning &quot;backwards&quot; and {{lang|la|gradus}} &quot;step&quot;. ''Retrograde'' is most commonly an [[adjective]] used to describe the path of a planet as it travels through the night sky, with respect to the [[zodiac]], stars, and other bodies of the celestial [[wikt:canopy|canopy]]. In this context, the term refers to planets, as they appear from Earth, stopping briefly and reversing direction at certain times, though in reality, of course, we now understand that they perpetually orbit in the same uniform direction.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, Bradley and Ostlie, Dale, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', Second Edition, Addison-Wesley, San Francisco, 2007. pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Although planets can sometimes be mistaken for stars as one observes the night sky, the planets actually change position from night to night in relation to the stars. Retrograde (backward) and prograde (forward) are observed as though the stars revolve around the Earth. Ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in 150&amp;nbsp;AD believed that the Earth was the center of the [[Solar System]] and therefore used the terms ''retrograde'' and ''prograde'' to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars. Although it is known today that the planets revolve around the sun, the same terms continue to be used in order to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars as they are observed from Earth. Like the sun, the planets appear to rise in the East and set in the West. When a planet travels eastward in relation to the stars, it is called ''prograde''. When the planet travels westward in relation to the stars (opposite path) it is called ''retrograde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/retrograde |title=Retrograde &amp;#124; Define Retrograde at Dictionary.com |publisher=[[Dictionary.reference.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From Earth ===
When standing on the Earth looking up at the sky, it would appear that  [[the Moon]] travels from [[east]] to [[west]], just as the Sun and the stars do. Day after day however, the Moon appears to move to the east with respect to the stars. In actual fact, the Moon orbits the Earth from [[west]] to [[east]], as do the vast majority of manmade satellites such as the [[International Space Station]]. The apparent westward motion of the Moon from the Earth's surface is actually an artifact of it being in a [[supersynchronous orbit]]. This means that the Earth completes one [[sidereal rotation]] before [[the Moon]] is able to complete one orbit. As a result, it looks like [[the Moon]] is travelling in the opposite direction, otherwise known as apparent retrograde motion. This phenomenon also occurs on [[Mars]], which has two natural satellites,  [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and  [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. Both moons orbit [[Mars]] in an eastward ([[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]]) direction; however, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] has an orbital period of 1.23 Martian  [[Sidereal Time|sidereal days]], making it [[supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous]], whereas [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] has an orbital period of 0.31 Martian  [[Sidereal Time|sidereal days]], making it [[subsynchronous orbit|subsynchronous]]. Consequently, although both moons are traveling in an eastward (prograde) direction, they appear to be traveling in opposite directions when viewed from the surface of [[Mars]] due to their orbital periods in relation to the rotational period of the planet.

[[File:2015 BZ509-retrograde-near-sun.png|thumb|The asteroid [[514107 Kaʻepaokaʻawela]] has a [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde orbit]]. Its apparent retrograde motion occurs at [[Conjunction (astronomy)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]] with the sun, as shown in this example in 2018.]]
All other planetary bodies in the Solar System also appear to periodically switch direction as they cross Earth's sky. Though all stars and planets appear to move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the rotation of Earth, the outer planets generally drift slowly eastward relative to the stars. [[Asteroids]] and [[Kuiper Belt]] objects (including [[Pluto]]) exhibit apparent retrogradation. This motion is normal for the planets, and so is considered direct motion. However, since Earth completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than the planets outside its orbit, it periodically overtakes them, like a faster car on a multi-lane highway. When this occurs, the planet being passed will first appear to stop its eastward drift, and then drift back toward the west. Then, as Earth swings past the planet in its orbit, it appears to resume its normal motion west to east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrol 2007. pp. 4&quot;&gt;Carrol, Bradley and Ostlie, Dale, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', Second Edition, Addison-Wesley, San Francisco, 2007. pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Inner planets [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] appear to move in retrograde in a similar mechanism, but as they can never be [[Opposition (planets)|in opposition]] to the Sun as seen from Earth, their retrograde cycles are tied to their inferior conjunctions with the Sun. They are unobservable in the Sun's glare and in their &quot;new&quot; phase, with mostly their dark sides toward Earth; they occur in the transition from evening star to morning star.

The more distant planets retrograde more frequently, as they do not move as much in their orbits while Earth completes an orbit itself. The center of the retrograde motion occurs when the body is exactly opposite the sun, and therefore high in the ecliptic at local midnight. The retrogradation of a hypothetical extremely distant (and nearly non-moving) planet would take place during a half-year, with the planet's apparent yearly motion being reduced to a [[parallax]] ellipse.

The period between the center of such retrogradations is the [[synodic period]] of the planet.

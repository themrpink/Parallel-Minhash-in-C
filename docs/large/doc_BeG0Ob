&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisco&quot;&gt;Though many residents still maintain that the nickname &quot;Frisco&quot; is taboo, many residents, especially younger and working-class natives, have kept this term alive and well. In any case, this is a matter of ongoing speculation that reflects certain cultural divisions within the city. {{cite news

&lt;ref name=&quot;Friscophobia&quot;&gt;Some tourists refer to San Francisco as &quot;Frisco.&quot; However, locals discourage this. Samuel D. Cohen writes that many credit &quot;Friscophobia&quot; to newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose first book, published in 1953, was &quot;Don't Call it Frisco&quot; after a 1918 newspaper article of the same name. Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web

'''Alonzo Church''' (June 14, 1903 – August 11, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[list of logicians|logician]] who made major contributions to [[mathematical logic]] and the foundations of [[theoretical computer science]]. He is best known for the [[lambda calculus]], [[Church–Turing thesis]], proving the unsolvability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]], [[Frege–Church ontology]], and the [[Church–Rosser theorem]]. He also worked on philosophy of language (see e.g. Church 1970).

==Life==
Alonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost this position because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, the son attended the private Ridgefield School for Boys in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ridgefield School for Boys, also known as the Ridgefield School, was a private school that existed from 1907 to 1938. See [http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/rschool2.htm The Ridgefield School].&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended [[Princeton University]], where he was an exceptional student. He published his first paper on [[Lorentz transformation]]s and graduated in 1924 with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton for graduate work, earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics in three years under [[Oswald Veblen]].

He married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925. The couple had three children, Alonzo Church, Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933) and Mildred (1938).

After receiving his Ph.D., he taught briefly as an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/early-history-computing-princeton|title=An early history of computing at Princeton|date=2012-04-04|website=Princeton Alumni Weekly|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a two-year [[United States National Research Council|National Research Fellowship]] that enabled him to attend [[Harvard University]] in 1927–1928, and the [[University of Göttingen]] and [[University of Amsterdam]] the following year.

He taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton for nearly four decades, 1929–1967. He taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 1967–1990. He was a Plenary Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1962 in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Church, Alonzo.

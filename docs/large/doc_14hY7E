An infamous [[structural failure]] involving tie rods is the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], on July 17, 1981. The hotel had a large atrium with three walkways crossing it suspended from tie rods. Construction errors led to several of the walkways collapsing, killing 114 people and injuring over 200.

==Geometry==
Osgood and Graustein used the rectangular [[hyperbola]], its conjugate hyperbola, and [[conjugate diameters]] to rationalize tie rods at 15 degree radial spacing, to a square of [[girder]]s, from its center. The tie-rods to the corners (45°) correspond to the asymptotes, while the pair at 15° and 75° are conjugate, as are the pair at 30° and 60°. According to this model in [[linear elasticity]], the application of a load compressing the square results in a [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] where the tie rods maintain their conjugate relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Osgood]] &amp; William C. Graustein (1922) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/abn6056.0001.001/324?rgn=full+text;view=pdf Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry], page 307, link from University of Michigan Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[Khoemana|!Orakobab]] name is ''ǀʼAuxa ǃXās'' or ''ǀKxʼauxa ǃXās'' ([[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoegowab]] spelling: ǀAuxa !Khās), which refers to [[Jan Bloem II]], known as !Xās-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokxʼaob (chief) of the ǀŨdiǁʼaes (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora (&quot;Korana&quot;) nation, whose kraal was the original settlement before the city was built.

==History==
[[File:De Wet Statue Bloemfontein.jpg|thumb|The fourth ''Raadsaal'' in Bloemfontein, with the statue of [[Christiaan de Wet]]]]

The origin of the city's name is disputed. It has been assumed to be from the Dutch words bloem (flower) and fontein (fountain), meaning fountain of flowers. Popular colonial legends include an [[ox]] named &quot;Bloem&quot; owned by Rudolphus Martinus Brits, one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]] near a fountain on his property, while the more likely indigenous history names Jan Bloem II (1775–1858), a !Ora (&quot;Korana&quot; [[Khoekhoe]]) leader who settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te1461s33IwC|title=Weekends with Legends|author=Bridget Hilton-Barber|publisher=New Africa Books|year=2001|isbn=978-0-86486-471-0|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bloemfontein, from the South - c1900.JPG|thumb|left|(A picture of Church Street or currently known as Oliver Tambo Road) Bloemfontein, circa 1900.]] His father, Jan Bloem, was a fugitive from the Cape Colony, where he reportedly was escaping arrest after murdering his first wife. Bloem was well known as an expert marksman, and married into the ǀHõaǁʼaes (Katz clan) and ǀŨdiǁʼaes where he played a role in training !Ora artillery fighters during the first !Ora Wars (a century prior to the second [[!Kora Wars|!Ora Wars]]) on the ǂNū!arib ([[Orange River]]) in the second half of the 18th century CE. His son was born in 1775 into the Springbok Clan (ǀŨdiǁʼaes), later becoming the kapteijn or chief of this polity.

===Early history===
Though historically a [[Khoekhoe|!Orana]] settlement, and then a [[Afrikaner|Boer]] settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major [[Henry Douglas Warden]] as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called &quot;Korana&quot; of the ǀHõaǁʼaes, ǀHũdiǁʼaes, Einiǁʼaes and others), [[Cape Colony]] [[Trek Boers]], [[Griqua people|Griqua]] (at that time known as ''Baasters''), and [[Barolong]].

Warden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to [[Winburg]], the spacious open country, and the absence of [[African horse sickness|horse sickness]]. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann – as he was known – sold the farm to Major Warden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|title=History of Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa|newspaper=Bloemfontein Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121041821/http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|archive-date=21 January 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] (1848–54) and eventually the [[Orange Free State]] Republic (1854–1902). From 1902 to 1910 it served as the capital of the [[Orange River Colony]] and since that time as the provincial capital of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]]. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the [[Union of South Africa]].

===Orange Free State (1854–1902)===
The [[Orange Free State]] was an independent [[Boere-Afrikaner|Boer]] sovereign republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers, its borders were determined by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the [[Orange River Sovereignty]], with a seat of a [[British Resident]] in Bloemfontein.

As the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the growth of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the governance of the republic and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich [[Griqualand|Griqua Land]] area.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnson, &quot;Griqua Land Claims in Southern Africa, 1874-1998&quot;, in David L. Eng and David Kazanjian, eds., ''Loss: The Politics of Mourning''  (Berkeley: Univ. of CA Press, 2003), 283-88. {{ISBN|0520232364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old Orange Free State's presidential residence the [[Old Presidency]] is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.

A railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to [[Cape Town]].

The writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State (province)|Free State province]], South Africa) following the death of his father, [[Arthur Tolkien]], when Tolkien was three (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of &quot;a hot country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien: &quot;though my earliest memories of are a hot country [...] I was shipped home [England] in 1895&quot;. Biographical sketch to Houghton Mifflin Co. (July 1955), in ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed. Humphrey Carpenter (London: Allen Unwin, 1981; London: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014), 165. {{ISBN|0544363795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 the city was the site of the [[Bloemfontein Conference]], which failed to prevent the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]]. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the [[South African Republic]]. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.

The rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located [[Bloemfontein railway station|railway station]], and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.

On 13 March 1900, following the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], British forces captured the city and built a [[Concentration camp (South Africa)|concentration camp]] nearby to house [[Boer]] women and children. The [[National Women's Monument]], on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|title=The Concentration Camps, 1900–1902: Facts, Figures and Fables|author=Arthur Clive Martin|publisher=H. Timmins|year=1957|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lKkwAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/concentration-camps/black-camps.php|title=''Black Concentration Camps''}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/concentration-camps/|title=Concentration Camps during Anglo-Boer War|website=www.anglo-boer.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill in town was named Naval Hill after the naval guns brought in by the British in order to fortify the position against attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/other-information/16-other-information/1844-blockhouses|title=Anglo Boer War - Blockhouses|first=David|last=Biggins|website=www.angloboerwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===
On 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the [[Treaty of Vereeniging|Peace Treaty of Vereeniging]] that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the [[British Empire]] and two [[Boer]] [[State (polity)|states]], the [[South African Republic]] (Republic of Transvaal) and the [[Orange Free State]], South Africa became a Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/union-south-africa-1910|title=The Union of South Africa 1910|last=tinashe|date=2011-11-08|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] and become the Union's judicial capital.&lt;ref&gt;Section 109 of South Africa Act, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|publisher=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 1912, the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/african-national-congress-anc|title=African National Congress (ANC)|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-20|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220091912/http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/african-national-congress-anc|archive-date=20 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 to 9 January 1914, [[J. B. M. Hertzog|James Barry Munnik Hertzog]] and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party of the Orange Free State]], and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the [[South African Party]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/national-party-np|title=National Party (NP)|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-30|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of racial segregation known as [[apartheid]].

===Apartheid era (1948–1994)===

When the National Party won the 1948 [[South Africa]]n national government elections they began implementing the policy known as [[apartheid]]. The policy was built on [[white supremacy]] and racial segregation was implemented. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord, had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area which lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the Waaihoek Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay taxes; the so-called hut tax as well as tax on grazing rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloemfotein1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/bloemfontein-segregated-city|publisher=SA History Online| title=Bloemfontein the Segregated city|date=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.

When the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government passed the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area which was occupied by the city's coloured population and moved the residents to [[Heidedal]]. However, due to Coloureds living in such close proximity with black people; intermarriages across racial lines occurred, resulting in a partial mixed population in Heidedal and Mangaung. In 1952 the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as [[Sotho people|Sotho]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloemfotein1&quot;/&gt; [[Phahameng]], a [[Sotho people|Sotho]] township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population.11 000 housing structures, of which approximately 6 000 were government built rental accommodation, were erected in Mangaung between 1952- 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloemfotein2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/cultural-studies/review-of-apartheid-in-bloemfontein-verno-cultural-studies-essay.php|publisher=Uni Assignment| title=Review of Apartheid in Bloemfontein Verno Cultural Studies Essay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Mangaung faced serious housing shortages when as many as 3000 to 6000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55&amp;nbsp;km east ward expansion called [[Botshabelo]] was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled of all black urbanisation to [[Thaba Nchu]] and Botshabelo.

Botshabelo was developed as source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared decentralisation point. This means that Botshabelo was to become an industrial development point in order to reduce the distance between place of employment and place of residence. In 1988, an approximate 14 500 people were commuting on a daily basis between Botshabelo and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's work force was employed outside the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloemfotein3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://impulscentrum.be/south_africa/mod4_fringe/lesson11.asp|publisher=Impuls centrum| title= Apartheid and housing in Mangaung and Botshabelo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of [[Motheo District Municipality]]. The [[Motheo District Municipality]] was disestablished on 18 May 2011 and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.

===Since 1994===
Until 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.

==Government==
Free State Provincial Government building
Bloemfontein forms part of the [[Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality]], which was upgraded from a [[Local Municipality (South Africa)|Local Municipality]] in 2011.

The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods, through a [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional representation (MMP)]] system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote is used to distribute seats in the municipal council amongst parties while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives. The current Executive Mayor of Mangaung, [[Olly Mlamleli]], was elected in August 2016.

Bloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the [[Highveld]] at an elevation of {{Convert|1400|m|ft}}, bordering on the semi-arid region of the [[Karoo]]. The area is generally flat with occasional hills (''koppies'' in [[Afrikaans]]) and the general vegetation is [[Highveld]] grassland. Bloemfontein experiences a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk''), with hot summer days and cooler, dry winters, often with frosts. Snow is rare but as recently as August 2006 it snowed in the city, with snowfalls occurring again at the airport on 26 July 2007.

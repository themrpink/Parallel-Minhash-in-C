Mendelson reflected on Guaraldi's contribution to the ''Peanuts'' franchise when Winston released his two tribute albums, saying &quot;Several generations have now grown up with Vince Guaraldi's music. If people hear just one or two bass notes of the intro to 'Linus and Lucy', they cheer. The ''Peanuts'' programs and Vince's music were such a wonderful marriage. It's a shame it got cut off so soon, but people like George are perpetuating it, for which we are very appreciative.&quot;&lt;ref name=liner&gt;{{cite web|title=George Winston: ''Love Will Come'' Liner Notes|url=http://www.georgewinston.com/us/liner-notes-love-will-come-music-vince-guaraldi-volume-2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312200446/http://www.georgewinston.com/us/liner-notes-love-will-come-music-vince-guaraldi-volume-2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Guaraldi's son David began working to secure the necessary licenses to distribute some of his father's previously unreleased material.&lt;ref name=Bang/&gt; The first release, ''[[The Charlie Brown Suite &amp; Other Favorites]]'', featured an archived 1969 live performance of the seven-part &quot;Charlie Brown Suite&quot;. Other releases include ''[[Oaxaca (album)|Oaxaca]]'' (2004), ''[[North Beach (album)|North Beach]]'' (2006), [[Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials|''Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials'', Volumes 1]] (2007) and [[Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials, Volume 2|2]] (2008), ''[[Live on the Air]]'' (2008) and ''[[An Afternoon with the Vince Guaraldi Quartet]]'' (2011).

In 2010, a two-hour documentary entitled ''The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi'' was released, featuring recently discovered and restored footage of Guaraldi's appearances and recording sessions. The documentary also featured new performances and insights from Winston, [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Paul Krassner]] and surviving Guaraldi sidemen [[Eddie Duran]], Dean Reilly, and [[Jerry Granelli]]. The documentary was co-produced by Toby Gleason (son of Ralph J. Gleason) and filmmaker Andrew Thomas. ''The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi'' was the recipient of five &quot;Best Documentary&quot; awards, and was a special presentation at the [[Library of Congress]] and [[Monterey Jazz Festival]]. Gleason commented, &quot;let's just agree that Vince Guaraldi re-invented the sound of the modern American Christmas.&quot;&lt;ref name=alljazzThomas&gt;{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Thomas  |title= ''Anatomy Of Vince Guaraldi'' Documentary Re-Discovers Long-Lost Jazz Treasures |work= [[All About Jazz]] |date= November 27, 2016 |url = https://news.allaboutjazz.com/anatomy-of-vince-guaraldi-documentary-re-discovers-long-lost-jazz-treasures | access-date = 7 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of ''[[The Definitive Vince Guaraldi]]'' (2009), ''[[All About Jazz]]'' critic David Rickert credited Guaraldi for introducing many to the world of jazz music &quot;before we even knew what it was. [Guaraldi]'s soundtracks for the ''Peanuts'' television specials were a novel idea in cartoon scoring, yet seemed to perfectly fit the deceptively sophisticated adventures of Charlie Brown and the rest of the ''Peanuts'' gang. His originals were some of the best jazz to come from the West Coast scene and a tribute to what can happen when a great muse hits a gifted composer.&quot;&lt;ref name=alljazz&gt;{{cite news |first = David |last = Rickert |title= ''Vince Guaraldi: The Definitive Vince Guaraldi'' |work= [[All About Jazz]] |date= November 19, 2009 |url = https://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-definitive-vince-guaraldi-vince-guaraldi-fantasy-jazz-review-by-david-rickert.php | access-date = 3 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
Guaraldi used a variety of sidemen throughout his career. His main preference was playing as a trio, although this number would increase depending on the needs of a song, live performance or ''Peanuts'' soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt; The largest confluence of musicians occurred in 1969 for soundtrack recordings of ''[[It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown]]'' (octet) and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown (soundtrack)|A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'' (nonet).&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt;

For bass/double bass, regular sidemen during the 1950s and 1960s included [[Monty Budwig]], Dean Reilly, Fred Marshall and Tom Beeson. During the 1970s, Guaraldi performed with Koji Kataoka and primarily Seward McCain.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt;

Guitarist [[Eddie Duran]] served steadily throughout the 1950s and 1960s, save for mid-1963–65 when Guaraldi teamed up with guitarist [[Bola Sete]] as a double act. During the 1970s, Guaraldi himself performed guitar when necessary but otherwise did not retain a sideman to fill the position.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt;

Guaraldi's first two releases—''[[Vince Guaraldi Trio (album)|Vince Guaraldi Trio]]'' (1956) and ''[[A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing]]'' (1958)—did not feature a drummer. Starting in 1961, [[Colin Bailey (drummer)|Colin Bailey]] filled the role, followed by [[Jerry Granelli]]. [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]] became Guaraldi's regular drummer for live performances during the 1970s. Other drummers included Lee Charlton, [[Johnny Rae|John Rae]], Al Coster, [[Eliot Zigmund]], Glenn Cronkhite, [[Vince Lateano]], Mark Rosengarden, and Jim Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=Bangtimeline/&gt;

The original Vince Guaraldi Trio consisted of Dean Reilly (bass) and Eddie Duran (guitar), appearing on Guaraldi's first two albums. The second lineup, considered the first of two &quot;classic&quot; trios, featured Monty Budwig (bass) and Colin Bailey (drums). This version of the classic trio appeared on ''Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus'' and ''Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown''. The second of two classic trios featured Fred Marshall (bass) and Jerry Granelli (drums). This incarnation was featured on more albums than any other trio, including ''[[Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends]]'', ''[[Jazz Casual: Paul Winter/Bola Sete and Vince Guaraldi]]'', ''The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi'', ''[[From All Sides]]'' and ''A Charlie Brown Christmas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang 2012 11&quot;/&gt;

'''Western Christianity''' is one of two sub-divisions of [[Christianity]] ([[Eastern Christianity]] being the other). Western Christianity is composed of the [[Latin Church]] and [[Protestantism]], together with their offshoots such as [[Independent Catholicism]] and [[Restorationism]].

The large majority of the world's 2.3&amp;nbsp;billion Christians are Western Christians (about 2&amp;nbsp;billion – 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion Latin Catholic and 800&amp;nbsp;million Protestant). The original and still major component, the Latin Church, developed under the [[bishop of Rome]] (the [[Patriarch of the West]]) in the former [[Western Roman Empire]] in [[Early Christianity|Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/ancient-medieval/christianity/a/roman-culture|title=Christianity in the Roman Empire|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the Latin Church emerged a wide variety of independent [[Protestant denominations]], including [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]], starting from the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, as did Independent Catholicism in the 19th century. Thus, the term &quot;Western Christianity&quot; does not describe a single [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] or [[religious denomination]], but is applied to distinguish all these denominations collectively from Eastern Christianity.

The establishment of the distinct Latin Church, a [[particular church]] ''[[sui iuris]]'' of the [[Catholic Church]], coincided with the consolidation of the [[Holy See]] in [[Rome]], which claimed [[papal primacy|primacy]] since Antiquity. The Latin Church is distinct from the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], also in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]] in [[Holy See|Rome]], and from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], which are not in communion with Rome. These other Churches are part of [[Eastern Christianity]]. The terms &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; in this regard originated with geographical divisions mirroring the cultural divide between the [[Greek East and Latin West|Hellenistic east and Latin West]], and the political divide between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman empires]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] adherents of the Latin Church, irrespective of ethnicity, commonly referred to themselves as &quot;Latins&quot; to distinguish themselves from [[Eastern Christians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orbilat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orbilat.com/General_Survey/Terms--Latins_and_Romans.html |title=Distinguishing the terms: Latins and Romans |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Orbis Latinus]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Christianity has [[Role of Christianity in civilization|played a prominent role]] in the shaping of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryChase2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, James Jacob, Margaret Jacob, Theodore H. Von Laue|title=Western Civilization: Since 1400|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6jytVCocwMC|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-83169-1|page=XXIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507284/Roman-Catholicism Roman Catholicism], &quot;Roman Catholicism, Christian church that has been the decisive spiritual force in the history of Western civilization&quot;. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltron J.H Hayas&quot;&gt;Caltron J.H Hayas, ''Christianity and Western Civilization'' (1953), Stanford University Press, p. 2: That certain distinctive features of our Western civilization—the civilization of western Europe and of America—have been shaped chiefly by Judaeo – Graeco – Christianity, Catholic and Protestant.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlandis&quot;&gt;Jose Orlandis, 1993, &quot;A Short History of the Catholic Church,&quot; 2nd edn. (Michael Adams, Trans.), Dublin: Four Courts Press, {{ISBN|1851821252}}, preface, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=KYdbpwAACAAJ], accessed 8 December 2014. p. (preface)&lt;/ref&gt; With the expansion of [[European colonialism]] from the [[Early Modern era]], the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the [[Americas]], much of the [[Philippines]], [[Southern Africa]], pockets of [[West Africa]], and throughout [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, when used for historical periods after the 16th century, the term &quot;Western Christianity&quot; does not refer to a particular geographical area, but is rather used as a collective term for all these.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute as in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, due to the spread of [[Christian missionaries]], [[Human migration|migration]]s, and [[globalisation]]. As such, the adjectives &quot;Western Christianity&quot; and &quot;Eastern Christianity&quot; are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in [[Christian theology|theology]] and [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], rather than present geographical locations.

Careful control of viscoelastic properties – by modifying the catalysts and polyols used – can lead to [[memory foam]], which is much softer at skin temperature than at room temperature.

Foams can be either &quot;closed-cell&quot;, where most of the original bubbles or cells remain intact, or &quot;open-cell&quot;, where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or [[mattresses]]. Closed-cell rigid foams are used as [[thermal insulation]], for example in [[refrigerators]].

Microcellular foams are tough elastomeric materials used in coverings of car [[steering wheel]]s or [[shoe sole]]s.

==Raw materials==
The main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-[[isocyanates]] and [[polyols]]. Other materials are added to aid processing the polymer or to modify the properties of the polymer.

===Isocyanates===
Isocyanates used to make polyurethane have two or more isocyanate groups on each molecule. The most commonly used isocyanates are the [[aromaticity|aromatic]] diisocyanates,  [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]], MDI.

TDI and MDI are generally less expensive and more reactive than other isocyanates. Industrial grade TDI and MDI are mixtures of isomers and MDI often contains polymeric materials. They are used to make flexible foam (for example slabstock foam for mattresses or molded foams for car seats),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dowglobal.beta.ides.com/DocSelect.aspx?DOC=DOWTDS&amp;E=101414|title= Technical data sheet from Dow Chemical|access-date=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; rigid foam (for example insulating foam in refrigerators) elastomers (shoe soles, for example), and so on. The isocyanates may be modified by partially reacting them with polyols or introducing some other materials to reduce volatility (and hence toxicity) of the isocyanates, decrease their freezing points to make handling easier or to improve the properties of the final polymers.

[[File:MDI isomers.PNG|500px|center|MDI isomers and polymer]]

Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Randall |last2=Lee|first2= Steve | title=The Polyurethanes Book | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-470-85041-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are [[hexamethylene diisocyanate|1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane ([[isophorone diisocyanate]], IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;MDI or hydrogenated MDI).

===Polyols===
[[Polyols#Polyols in polymer chemistry|Polyols]] can be polyether polyols, which are made by [[ethoxylation|the reaction of epoxides]] with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional [[carboxylic acid]]s and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.

Polyols for flexible applications use low functionality initiators such as [[dipropylene glycol]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2), [[glycerine]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3), or a sorbitol/water solution (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.75).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|title=Polyether polyols suitable for flexible polyurethane foam prepared by co-initiation of aqueous solutions of solid polyhydroxyl initiators|date=Jul 29, 1997|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0755955A1/en|inventor-last=Hager|inventor2-last=Knight|inventor3-last=Helma|inventor-first=Stanley L.|inventor2-first=James E.|inventor3-first=Gregory F.|issue=US5652279 A|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as [[sucrose]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8), [[sorbitol]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6), [[toluenediamine]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4), and [[Mannich base]]s (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4). [[Propylene oxide]] and/or [[ethylene oxide]] is added to the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups.  Incorporating carbon dioxide into the polyol structure is being researched by multiple companies.   

Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed [[Copolymer|styrene–acrylonitrile]], [[acrylonitrile]], or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as [[ethylenediamine]] and [[triethanolamine]] are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. A special class of polyether polyols, [[poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol]]s, which are made by polymerizing [[tetrahydrofuran]], are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.

Conventional polyester polyols are based on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification ([[glycolysis]]) of recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|poly(ethyleneterephthalate)]] (PET) or [[dimethylterephthalate]] (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to [[polyisocyanurate]] (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.

Specialty polyols include [[polycarbonate]] polyols, [[polycaprolactone]] polyols, [[polybutadiene]] polyols, and [[polysulfide]] polyols. The materials are used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. [[Natural oil polyols]] derived from [[castor oil]] and other [[vegetable oils]] are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.

Co-polymerizing [[chlorotrifluoroethylene]] or [[tetrafluoroethylene]] with vinyl ethers containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate have been used to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine–carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.

[[Phosphorus]]-containing polyols are available that become [[Chemical bond|chemically bonded]] to the polyurethane matrix for the use as [[flame retardants]]. This covalent linkage prevents migration and leaching of the organophosphorus compound.

===Chain extenders and cross linkers===
Chain extenders (''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) and [[cross-link|cross linkers]] (''f''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3) are low molecular weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that play an important role in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oertel 1985&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J. | last=Blackwell |first2=M.

The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are [[ethylene glycol]], [[1,4-butanediol]] (1,4-BDO or BDO), [[1,6-hexanediol]], [[cyclohexane dimethanol]] and [[hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether]] (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They are all suitable for [[thermoplastic polyurethanes]] with the exception of ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gum 1992&quot;/&gt; Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.

===Catalysts===
Polyurethane [[catalyst]]s can be classified into two broad categories, basic and acidic [[amine]]. [[Tertiary amine]] catalysts function by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the diol component. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides function as mild Lewis acids in accelerating the formation of polyurethane. As bases, traditional amine catalysts include triethylenediamine (TEDA, also called [[DABCO]], 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), [[dimethylcyclohexylamine]] (DMCHA), [[dimethylethanolamine]] (DMEA), and bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, a blowing catalyst also called A-99. A typical Lewis acidic catalyst is [[dibutyltin dilaurate]]. The process is highly sensitive to the nature of the catalyst and is also known to be [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_665.pub2 |chapter=Polyurethanes |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2005 |last1=Adam |first1=Norbert |last2=Avar |first2=Geza |last3=Blankenheim |first3=Herbert |last4=Friederichs |first4=Wolfgang |last5=Giersig |first5=Manfred |last6=Weigand |first6=Eckehard |last7=Halfmann |first7=Michael |last8=Wittbecker |first8=Friedrich-Wilhelm |last9=Larimer |first9=Donald-Richard |last10=Maier |first10=Udo |last11=Meyer-Ahrens |first11=Sven |last12=Noble |first12=Karl-Ludwig |last13=Wussow |first13=Hans-Georg |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors affecting catalyst selection include balancing three reactions: urethane (polyol+isocyanate, or gel) formation, the urea (water+isocyanate, or &quot;blow&quot;) formation, or the isocyanate trimerization reaction (e.g., using potassium acetate, to form [[isocyanurate]] rings). A variety of specialized catalysts have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jeffcat Amine Catalysts for the Polyurethane Industry | year = 2006 | url = http://www.huntsman.com/performance_products/Media/JEFFCAT_Catalyst_Trifold_bulletin.pdf | access-date = 2007-10-23 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129082418/http://www.huntsman.com/performance_products/Media/JEFFCAT_Catalyst_Trifold_bulletin.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Building quality with Air Products trimerisation catalysts | year = 2003 | url = http://www.airproducts.com/NR/rdonlyres/55C5A72A-D126-4888-9E1A-D24EFBE4AAC1/0/14004004EU.pdf | access-date = 2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = FOMREZ Specialty Tin Catalysts for Polyurethane Applications | journal = 120-074-10 | date = January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surfactants===
[[Surfactants]] are used to modify the characteristics of both foam and non-foam polyurethane polymers. They take the form of polydimethylsiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymers, [[silicone]] oils, [[nonylphenol]] ethoxylates, and other organic compounds. In foams, they are used to emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and sub-surface voids.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |year=2002 |chapter=10 |editor1-last=Randall |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Lee |editor2-first=Steve |title=The Polyurethanes Book |chapter-url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Polyurethanes+Book-p-9780470850411 |location=The United Kingdom |publisher=Huntsman International LLC, Polyurethanes business |pages=156–159 |isbn=978-0470850411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-foam applications they are used as air release and antifoaming agents, as wetting agents, and are used to eliminate surface defects such as pin holes, orange peel, and sink marks.

==Production==
Polyurethanes are produced by mixing two or more liquid streams. The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents and so on. The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'. In Europe the meanings for 'A-side' and 'B-side' are reversed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, [[cross linker]]s, [[surfactant]]s, [[flame retardant]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[pigment]]s, and [[filler (materials)|fillers]]. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the isocyanate, polyol or additives.

Green Science Policy Institute states: &quot;Although the new standard can be met without flame retardants, it does NOT ban their 
use. Consumers who wish to reduce household exposure to flame retardants can look for a TB117-2013 tag on furniture, and verify with retailers that products do not contain flame retardants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greensciencepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TB117-2013_manufacturers_021114.pdf |title=Manufacturers |date=2015 |website=greensciencepolicy.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid resin blends and [[isocyanate]]s may contain hazardous or regulated components. Isocyanates are known skin and respiratory sensitizers. Additionally, amines, glycols, and phosphate present in spray polyurethane foams present risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/03/sprayfoam/ |publisher=CDC |website=NIOSH Science Blog |title=Help Wanted: Spray Polyurethane Foam Insulation Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to chemicals that may be emitted during or after application of [[Spray foams (insulation)|polyurethane spray foam]] (such as isocyanates) are harmful to human health and therefore special precautions are required during and after this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/quick-safety-tips-spray-polyurethane-foam-users |title=Quick Safety Tips for Spray Polyurethane Foam Users}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, additional health and safety information can be found through organizations such as the Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA) and the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry (CPI), as well as from polyurethane system and raw material manufacturers. Regulatory information can be found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 21 (Food and Drugs) and Title 40 (Protection of the Environment). In Europe, health and safety information is available from ISOPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isopa.org |title=Home : ISOPA |website=www.isopa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Diisocyanate and Polyol Producers Association.

==Manufacturing==
The methods of manufacturing polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, high-volume bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, wait until it cures, then demold the finished part.

===Dispensing equipment===
Although the capital outlay can be high, it is desirable to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater–chiller unit is added to control material temperature in order to improve mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as [[viscosity]] and filler content, and [[process control]]. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs ([[intermediate bulk container]]s, such as [[Caged IBC totes|totes]]), or [[Storage tank|bulk storage tanks]]. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened [[lance pump]]s to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer-milled [[glass fiber]] and [[wollastonite]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The pumps can drive low-pressure (10 to 30&amp;nbsp;bar, 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;MPa) or high-pressure (125 to 250&amp;nbsp;bar, 12.5 to 25.0&amp;nbsp;MPa) dispense systems. Mix heads can be simple static mix tubes, rotary-element mixers, low-pressure dynamic mixers, or high-pressure hydraulically actuated direct [[Impinging mixer|impingement mixers]]. Control units may have basic on/off and dispense/stop switches, and analogue pressure and temperature gauges, or may be computer-controlled with flow meters to electronically calibrate mix ratio, digital temperature and level sensors, and a full suite of statistical process control software. Add-ons to dispense equipment include nucleation or gas injection units, and third or fourth stream capability for adding pigments or metering in supplemental additive packages.

===Tooling===
Distinct from pour-in-place, bun and boardstock, and coating applications, the production of piece parts requires tooling to contain and form the reacting liquid.
The choice of mold-making material is dependent on the expected number of uses to end-of-life (EOL), molding pressure, flexibility, and heat transfer characteristics.

RTV silicone is used for tooling that has an EOL in the thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding rigid foam parts, where the ability to stretch and peel the mold around undercuts is needed.
The heat transfer characteristic of RTV silicone tooling is poor. High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.

Epoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is used for tooling that has an EOL in the tens of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.

Aluminum is used for tooling that has an EOL in the hundreds of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding microcellular foam gasketing and cast elastomer parts, and is milled or extruded into shape.

Mirror-finish [[stainless steel]] is used for tooling that imparts a glossy appearance to the finished part. The heat transfer characteristic of metal tooling is excellent.

Finally, molded or milled [[polypropylene]] is used to create low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many expensive metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of polypropylene tooling is poor, which must be taken into consideration during the formulation process.

In 2007, the global consumption of polyurethane raw materials was above 12 million metric tons, and the average annual growth rate was about 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.|last=Avar|date=October 2008|title=Polyurethanes (PU)|journal=Kunststoffe International|issue=10/2008|pages=123–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues generated with PUR on the global market are expected to rise to approximately US$75 billion by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ceresana|title= Market Study: Polyurethanes and Isocyanates|date= July 2013|url= http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/pur-isocyanates/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of visible light==
[[Image:UVDistressedFlexMoldedFoam800x600.png|thumb|150px|Polyurethane foam made with an aromatic isocyanate, which has been exposed to UV light. Readily apparent is the discoloration that occurs over time.]]

Polyurethanes, especially those made using [[aromatic]] isocyanates, contain [[chromophores]] that interact with light. This is of particular interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where [[light]] stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that [[aliphatic]] isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxi.com/assets/pdf/Discoloration_Info.pdf|title=Discoloration of polyurethane foam|publisher=Foamex Information sheet|access-date=2010-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924224254/http://fxi.com/assets/pdf/Discoloration_Info.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0021955X9302900605 |title=Inhibition of the Discoloration of Polyurethane Foam Caused by Ultraviolet Light |journal=Journal of Cellular Plastics |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=569–88 |year=1993 |last1=Valentine |first1=C. |last2=Craig |first2=T.A. |last3=Hager |first3=S.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.

It has been reported that exposure to visible light can affect the variability of some physical property test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=G. Ron |last=Blair |first2=Bob |last2=Dawe |first3=Jim|last3= McEvoy |first4=Roy|last4= Pask |first5=Marcela Rusan |last5=de Priamus |first6=Carol|last6= Wright  |title=The Effect of Visible Light on the Variability of Flexible Foam Compression Sets |publisher=Center for the Polyurethane Industry |year=2007 |location=Orlando, FL |url=http://www.moldedfoam-ip.com/linkedpdf/Technical%20Info%20-%20The%20Effects%20of%20Visible%20Light%20on%20the%20Variability%20of%20Flexible%20Foam%20Compression%20Sets%20(Final).pdf |access-date=2008-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-energy [[Ultraviolet|UV]] radiation promotes chemical reactions in foam, some of which are detrimental to the foam structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ie0009738 |title=Modeling the Ultraviolet Photodegradation of Rigid Polyurethane Foams |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research |volume=40 |issue=15 |pages=3346–52 |year=2001 |last1=Newman |first1=Christopher R. |last2=Forciniti |first2=Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrolysis and biodegradation==
Polyurethanes may crumble due to hydrolysis. This is a common problem with shoes left in a closet, and reacting with moisture in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hydrolysis, The Crumbling of Shoe Soles explained {{!}} Safety Shoes and Gloves |url=https://www.safetyjogger.com/en/academy/hydrolysis-crumbling-shoe-soles-explained |website=www.safetyjogger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two species of the Ecuadorian fungus ''[[Pestalotiopsis]]'' are capable of biodegrading polyurethane in aerobic and anaerobic conditions such as found at the bottom of [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/AEM.00521-11 |pmid=21764951 |pmc=3165411 |title=Biodegradation of Polyester Polyurethane by Endophytic Fungi |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=77 |issue=17 |pages=6076–84 |year=2011 |last1=Russell |first1=J.

Polyester-type polyurethanes are more easily biodegraded by fungus than polyether-type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/ijms10093722 |pmid=19865515 |pmc=2769161 |title=Biodegradability of Plastics |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=3722–42 |year=2009 |last1=Tokiwa |first1=Yutaka |last2=Calabia |first2=Buenaventurada P. |last3=Ugwu |first3=Charles U. |last4=Aiba |first4=Seiichi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

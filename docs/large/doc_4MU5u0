The system's nationalist traits grew and progressively blended with [[North Korea]]n ''[[Juche]]'' and [[China|Chinese]] [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideals.{{cn|date=July 2020}} In 1971, the Party, which had already been completely purged of internal opposition (with the possible exception of [[Gheorghe Gaston Marin]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; approved the ''[[July Theses]]'', expressing Ceaușescu's disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party's grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceaușescu's nationalist principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Geran Pilon, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to [[Dacians]] as having &quot;an unorganised State&quot;, part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; The government continued its cultural dialogue with ancient forms, with Ceaușescu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea cel Bătrân]] (lit. &quot;Mircea the Elder&quot;, whom he styled &quot;Mircea the Great&quot;) and [[Mihai Viteazul]] (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or [[Imperial Rome|Roman]] versions to the names of cities and towns (''Drobeta'' to [[Turnu Severin]], ''Napoca'' to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]).&lt;ref&gt;Geran Pilon, pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ceaușescu maintained an independent, &quot;national Communist&quot; course, his absolute control over the country, as well as the intensity of the personality cult surrounding him, led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the [[Country Studies|Country Study]] on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR's &quot;Stalinist repression of individual liberties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ro0010%29&lt;/ref&gt; A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration's character. Ceaușescu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of [[National Bolshevism]] such as [[Jean-François Thiriart]], but there was a publicised connection between him and [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]], an [[Iron Guard]]ist Romanian-Italian émigré millionaire (Drăgan was already committed to a Dacian [[Protochronism]] that largely echoed the official cultural policy).

Nicolae Ceaușescu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictator [[Ion Antonescu]]. Although Antonescu's image was never a fully official myth in Ceaușescu's time, after his overthrow politicians such as [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Magyar minority]] in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially [[Socialist state]]s, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the [[Iron Curtain]], appealed to the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism,&lt;ref&gt;Geran Pilon, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.

The strong opposition to Ceaușescu on all forms of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' placed Ceaușescu at odds with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev's reforms. In particular, he was incensed when [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland—a significant reversal, considering how violently he opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceaușescu, whom he called &quot;the Romanian [[führer]].&quot; At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceaușescu for his inflexible attitude. &quot;You are running a dictatorship here,&quot; the Soviet leader warned.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

In November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceaușescu condemned the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and asked for the annulment of its consequences. In effect, this amounted to a demand for the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent [[Moldova]]) and northern [[Bukovina]], both of which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviet Union]] in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.

===Non-aligned policy feats===

Ceaușescu's Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's pre-emptive strike against [[Egypt]] at the start of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Ceaușescu made efforts to act as a mediator between the [[PLO]] and [[Israel]].

Similarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], which had been [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] by the Soviets and the rest of their allies in response to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.

Ceaușescu's Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country that did not sever diplomatic relations with [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] after [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Augusto Pinochet's coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Valenzuela, J. Samuel and Arturo Valenzuela (eds.), ''Military Rule in Chile: Dictatorship and Oppositions'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae Ceaușescu was a close ally and personal friend of [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|dictator]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaïre]]. Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective [[One-party state|political machineries]], the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution|MPR]] and the [[Romanian Communist Party|PCR]]. Many believe that Ceaușescu's death played a role in influencing Mobutu to &quot;democratise&quot; Zaïre in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0173) Relations with the Socialist World] [[Library of Congress Country Study]] on Zaire (Former), Library of Congress Call Number DT644 .Z3425 1994.

Ceaușescu reduced the size of the [[Romanian People's Army]] by 5%, for which he organized a [[Romanian military referendum, 1986|mock referendum]].&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ro011986 Rumänien, 23.

====Bessarabia====
In August 1976, Nicolae Ceaușescu was the first high-level Romanian visitor to [[Bessarabia]] since World War II. In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, [[Ivan Bodiul]] said that &quot;the good relationship was initiated by Ceaușescu's visit to Soviet Moldova&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-1-68.shtml|title=Romanian-Moldavian SSR relations, by Patrick Moore and the Romanian Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality cult and totalitarianism===
[[File:TimbruNicolaeCeausescu.png|thumb|Stamp commemorating the 70th birthday (and 55 years of political activity) of Nicolae Ceaușescu, 1988]]
{{main|Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality}}
Ceaușescu created a pervasive [[Cult of personality|personality cult]], giving himself such titles as &quot;[[Conducător]]&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;) and &quot;Geniul din Carpați&quot; (&quot;The Genius of the Carpathians&quot;), with inspiration from [[Proletarian Culture]] ([[Proletkult]]). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a [[Kings of Romania|king]]-like [[sceptre]] made for himself.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2019}} 

The most important day of the year during Ceaușescu's rule was his birthday, 26 January – a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian [[Victor Sebestyen]], it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

Such excesses prompted painter [[Salvador Dalí]] to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceaușescu on his &quot;introducing the presidential sceptre&quot;. The Communist Party daily ''[[Scînteia]]'' published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire. To lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa's defection, Ceaușescu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceaușescu was creating &quot;[[socialism in one country|socialism in one family]]&quot;.{{Cn|date=March 2020}}

Not surprisingly, Ceaușescu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt; Additionally, producers had to take great care to make sure that Ceaușescu's height (he was only {{convert|1.68|m}} tall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|title=Un Ceauşescu pe care nu îl ştiaţi: creţ, cu ochii &quot;blonzi&quot; şi nasul borcănat|language=ro|publisher=Realitatea.net|date=3 August 2011|access-date=22 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726194246/http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|archive-date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was never emphasized on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceaușescu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;

As part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceaușescus through the consular cultural attachés of Romanian embassies,{{cn|date=July 2020}} they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceaușescu the [[Legion of Honour]]. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the [[UK]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of honorary British Knights]]&lt;/ref&gt; a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceaușescu was arranged to be &quot;elected&quot; to membership of a science academy in the U.S.

To execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, &quot;The sight of a church bothered Ceausescu.  It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight.&quot; Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Harrison.

==Legacy==
Ceaușescu had a mixed reputation among international leaders of his time. In his memoir ''The Artful Albanian'', Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]] remarked &quot;As if Ceausescu and company are to bring down imperialism! If the world waits for the Ceausescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Enver Hoxha (1986) The Artful Albanian, (Chatto &amp; Windus, London)&lt;/ref&gt; However Libyan leader [[Muammar Gadaffi]] had an opposite interpretation saying, &quot;My brother! You are my brother for the rest of my life!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Muammar Gaddafi, as quoted in Lt. General Ion Mihai Pacepa (1987) Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief (Regnery Gateway, p. 101)&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu even received praise from anti-communists with the leader of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] saying &quot;I would like to salute [Ceaușescu's] intransigent patriotism and ferocious will for independence. A veritable amity links me to him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, Réponse à l'Histoire (Albin Michel, 1979), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

He directed the construction of the [[Palace of the Parliament]] in Bucharest, which broke ground in June 1984. It was previously called The House of the People and The People's House. The building of the Palace of the Parliament was the most extreme expression of the [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]] program imposed by Nicolae Ceaușescu upon Romania. The systematization was a program of [[urban planning]] carried out by Ceaușescu. The main architect of the building was [[Anca Petrescu]] (1949-2013), who began her work on this building when she was 28 years old. The building was completed in 1997, after Ceaușescu's death in 1989. Since 2004 the [[Romanian Senate]] has been headquartered in the Parliamentary Palace and was originally housed in the former building of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. The building has 1,100 rooms and is the largest civilian government building in the world as measured by volume in one continuous structure. (There are private sector buildings, mainly for the construction of aircraft that have more continuous volume in one building, such as the [[Boeing Everett Factory]] in Everett, Washington; see the [[List of largest buildings#Largest usable volume]].) Much of the building remains empty, being larger than the Parliament needs, though Parliament shares it with three museums and an international conference center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/05/travel/ceausescu-trail-bucharest-romania/index.html?hpt=hp_c5 |title=Palace of the damned dictator: On the trail of Ceausescu in Bucharest |work=CNN |first=John |last=Malathronas |date=5 December 2014 |access-date=12 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the heaviest building in the world, being constructed of  700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze, a million square feet of marble, and large amounts of crystal and wood.&lt;ref name=heavy&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-building/ |title=Heaviest building |work=Guinness World Records |access-date=12 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The heaviest building in the world |url=https://www.viacapitalevendu.com/blogue/en/heaviest-building-world/ |work=Via Capitale |language=en |date=1 November 2018 |access-date=12 August 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:019.Vacanta-pentrecuta-in-Moldova-1976 (1).jpg|thumb|His successor, [[Ion Iliescu]], and Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1976]]
Nicolae and [[Elena Ceaușescu]] had three children: [[Valentin Ceaușescu]] (born 1948), a nuclear physicist; [[Zoia Ceaușescu]] (1949–2006), a mathematician; and [[Nicu Ceaușescu]] (1951–1996), a physicist. After the death of his parents, Nicu Ceaușescu ordered the construction of an [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church, the walls of which are decorated with portraits of his parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Praising the &quot;crimes&quot; of totalitarian governments and denigrating their victims is forbidden by law in Romania; this includes the Ceaușescu era. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (''3TV Oltenia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220071037/http://www.cna.ro/comunicare/comunic/2006/c0207.html |date=20 December 2007 |title=Official communique of the National Board of the Audio-Visual }}, originally at [http://www.cna.ro/comunicare/comunic/2006/c0207.html cna.org] but now removed, accessible through web.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to opinion polls held in 2010, 41% of Romanians would vote for Ceaușescu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Horvath |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/33/33094/1.html |title=Ceausescu – Back from the Dead |publisher=Telepolis |access-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;balkanalysis.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/ |title=In Romania, Opinion Polls Show Nostalgia for Communism |publisher=Balkanalysis |date=27 December 2011 |access-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 63% think that their lives were better before 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;balkanalysis.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Noul_Partid_Comunist_Roman-_Pionierii_0_367163711.html |title=Noul Partid Comunist Român, condus de un șofer de taxi |publisher=Adevarul |access-date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the percentage of those who would vote for Ceaușescu reached 46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Social/SONDAJ%2B66%2Bdintre%2Bromanii%2Bintervievati%2Bl-ar%2Bvota%2Bacum%2Bpe%2BNicolae%2B|title=SONDAJ. 46% dintre românii intervievaţi l-ar vota acum pe Nicolae Ceauşescu la prezidenţiale|work=DIGI24.ro|access-date=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821180553/http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Social/SONDAJ+66+dintre+romanii+intervievati+l-ar+vota+acum+pe+Nicolae+|archive-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 2018, a poll was conducted where 64% of people had a good opinion of Ceaușescu.&lt;ref&gt;https://transylvanianow.com/ceausescu-still-most-beloved-president-of-romania/&lt;/ref&gt;

He was played by Constantin Cojocaru in the 2011 Swiss docudrama, ''Die letzten Tage der Ceausescus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3894634/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3 |title=IMDb entry for 'Die letzten Tage der Ceausescus' |work=[[IMDb]] |date=22 January 2011 |access-date=11 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comedy musical enjoyed a world premiere at Se7en Arts in [[Leeds]] on Sunday 21 May 2017. It was written by Tom Bailey and Greg Jameson, with songs by Allan Stelmach, and depicted Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu and their son Valentin in a piece of meta musical theatre that was also a comment upon [[celebrity|celebrity culture]] and the role social media and political correctness play in creating [[Outcast (person)|social pariahs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theculturevulture.co.uk/blog/reviews/music/ceausescu-the-musical/|title=Ceausescu the Musical {{!}} the culture vulture|website=theculturevulture.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Ceaușescu was made a knight of the Danish [[Order of the Elephant]], but this appointment was revoked on 23 December 1989 by the queen of Denmark, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]].

Ceaușescu was likewise stripped of his honorary [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath) status by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] on the day before his execution. Queen Elizabeth II also returned the insignia of the [[Order of the Star of the Socialist Republic of Romania]] that Ceaușescu had bestowed upon her in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The Official Website of the British Monarchy: [http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Honours.aspx &quot;Queen and Honours&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116034858/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Honours.aspx |date=16 January 2013 }}, retrieved on 13 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his 70th birthday in 1988, Ceaușescu was decorated with the [[Karl Marx Order|Karl-Marx-Order]] by then [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) chief [[Erich Honecker]]; through this he was honoured for his rejection of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms.

{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''president pro tempore of the United States Senate''' (often shortened to '''president pro tem''') is the second-highest-ranking official of the [[United States Senate]]. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section Three of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] is the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|president of the Senate]] (despite not being a senator), and mandates that the Senate must choose a president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to act in the vice president's absence. Unlike the vice president, the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate, able to speak or vote on any issue. Selected by the Senate at large, the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/9|title=Pro Tem: Presidents Pro Tempore of the United States Senate since 1789|author1=Senate Historical Office|author2=With a preface by Senator [[Robert C.

In practice, neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in [[parliamentary procedure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Hillary takes Senate gavel–for an hour |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/24/hillary.senate/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120220245/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/24/hillary.senate/index.html |archive-date=January 20, 2010 |publisher=CNN |date=January 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1890, the most [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior U.S. senator]] in the majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another.

==Power and responsibilities==

Although the position is in some ways analogous to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], the powers of the president pro tempore are far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with party leaders and individual senators, but as the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|chamber's presiding officer]], the president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the absence of the vice president, including ruling on [[point of order|points of order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=President Pro Tempore |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/President_Pro_Tempore.htm |website=United States Senate |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment to the Constitution]], the president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so. The president pro tempore is third in the line of [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]], following the vice president and the speaker,&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot; /&gt; and consequently is one of the few members of Congress entitled to a full-time [[U.S. Capitol Police|security detail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stricherz |first=Mark |title=Congressional Security Details Remain Murky |url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/those-who-protect-members-of-congress-remain-out-of-the-spotlight |website=rollcall.com |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=March 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional duties include appointment of various congressional officers, certain commissions, advisory boards, and committees and joint supervision of the congressional [[United States Senate Page#School|page school]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot; /&gt; The president pro tempore is the designated legal recipient of various reports to the Senate, including [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]] reports under which he or she, jointly with the speaker, may have the president call Congress back into session.

==History==
===Position established===
The office of president pro tempore was established by the [[Constitution of the United States]] in 1789. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second in the line of [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]], following the vice president and preceding the speaker. Through 1891, the president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis only, when the vice president was not present to preside over the Senate, or at the adjournment of a session of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/CongressionalLeadership.html|title=A Brief History of Congressional Leadership|author=Richard E. Berg-Andersson|date=June 7, 2001|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first president pro tempore, [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]], was elected on April 6, 1789,&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot;/&gt; serving four separate terms between 1789 and 1793. More than twelve senators{{clarify|date=January 2020}} held the office during the Senate's first decade,&lt;ref name=&quot;Protem–1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Pro tem : presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate since 1789| editor-last=Erickson| editor-first=Nancy| publisher=U.S. Government Printing office| location=Washington, D.C.| date=August 22, 2008| isbn=978-0-16-079984-6| pages=[https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/7 7–10]| chapter=Chapter 1:The Formative Years, 1789–1860| chapterurl=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CPUB-110spub18/pdf/GPO-CPUB-110spub18-1-6.pdf| accessdate=July 12, 2018| url=https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/7}}&lt;/ref&gt; presiding over sessions, signing legislation, and performing routine administrative tasks.

Whenever the office of the vice presidency was vacant, as it was on ten occasions between 1812 and 1889,&lt;ref name=CRSsuccession22&gt;{{cite web| last=Neale| first=Thomas H.| title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation|page=22| work=CRS Report for Congress| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| date=September 27, 2004| accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the office garnered heightened importance, for although he did not assume the vice presidency, the president pro tempore stood next in line for the presidency.&lt;ref name=JT10th&gt;{{cite web| title=John Tyler, Tenth Vice President (1841)| url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm| publisher= Office of the Secretary, United States Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, a vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled only by a regular election; several individuals who served during these vacancies were referred to informally as &quot;acting vice president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Lafayette Foster| url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Sculpture_21_00006.htm| work=Art &amp; History| publisher=Secretary of the Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:

*from July 9 to July 11, 1850, following [[Millard Fillmore]]'s accession to the presidency upon the death of [[Zachary Taylor]], until [[William R.

*from September 19 to October 10, 1881, following [[Chester Arthur]]'s accession to the presidency upon the death of [[James A. Garfield]], until [[Thomas F. Bayard]] was elected president pro tempore;&lt;ref name=&quot;Protem–2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Pro tem : presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate since 1789| editor-last=Erickson| editor-first=Nancy| publisher=U.S. Government Printing office| location=Washington, D.C.| date=August 22, 2008| isbn=978-0-16-079984-6| pages=[https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/55 55–57]| chapter=Chapter 2: A Question of Succession, 1861-1889| chapterurl=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CPUB-110spub18/pdf/GPO-CPUB-110spub18-1-7.pdf| accessdate=July 12, 2018| url=https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*from November 25 to December 7, 1885, following the death of Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], until [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] was elected president pro tempore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protem–2&quot;/&gt;

When President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had no vice president, was [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached and tried]] in 1868, Senate President pro tempore [[Benjamin Wade|Benjamin Franklin Wade]] was next in line to the presidency. Wade's radicalism is thought by many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want to see Wade in the [[White House]], acquitted Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gene|title=High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Company|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03072-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/highcrimesmisdem00smit}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president pro tempore and the speaker of the House were removed from the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] in 1886. Both were restored to it in 1947, though this time with the president pro tempore following the speaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot;/&gt;

[[William P. Frye]] served as president pro tempore from 1896 to 1911 (the [[Fifty-fourth United States Congress|54th]] through the [[Sixty-second United States Congress|62nd Congress]]), a tenure longer than anyone else. He resigned from the position due to ill health shortly before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult, as Senate Republicans, then in the majority, were split between [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] factions, each promoting its own candidate. Likewise, the Democrats proposed their own candidate. As a result of this three-way split, no individual received a majority vote. It took four months for a compromise solution to emerge: Democrat [[Augustus Octavius Bacon|Augustus Bacon]] served for a single day, August 14, 1911, during the vice president's absence. Thereafter, Bacon and four Republicans—[[Charles Curtis]], [[Jacob Harold Gallinger|Jacob Gallinger]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], and [[Frank B. Brandegee|Frank Brandegee]]—alternated as president pro tempore for the remainder of the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;SenPPT&quot;/&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:WHOportTyler.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|[[John Tyler]] is the only Senate president pro tempore to also become [[President of the United States]].]]
In January 1945, the [[79th United States Congress|79th Congress]] elected [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]], who at the time was the [[Dean of the United States Senate|senator with the longest continuous service]], to be president pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party's senior member to hold this position. [[Arthur H. Vandenberg|Arthur Vandenberg]] (from 1947 to 1949) was the last president pro tempore not to be the senior member of the majority party, aside from the single day in December 1980 accorded [[Milton Young]], who was the retiring senior member of the Republican Party, which would hold the majority in the incoming [[97th United States Congress|97th Congress]].&lt;ref name=Davis2012/&gt;

Three presidents pro tempore have gone on to be elected to the office of vice president—[[John Tyler]], [[William R. King]], and [[Charles Curtis]]—of whom Tyler is the only one to become president, assuming the office in April 1841 upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]].

Most adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with ''more'' and ''most'': ''often'', ''more often'', ''most often''; ''smoothly'', ''more smoothly'', ''most smoothly'' (see also [[#Comparison|comparison of adjectives]], above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms:&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/&gt; ''much'', ''more'', ''most''; ''a little'', ''less'', ''least''; ''well'', ''better'', ''best''; ''badly'', ''worse'', ''worst''; ''far'', ''further'' (''farther''), ''furthest'' (''farthest''); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: ''fast'', ''faster'', ''fastest''; ''soon'', ''sooner'', ''soonest''; etc.

Adverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (''We considered the proposal '''carefully'''''), although other positions are often possible (''We '''carefully''' considered the proposal''). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as ''often'', ''always'', ''almost'', ''probably'', and various others such as ''just'') tend to be placed before the verb (''they '''usually''' have chips''), although if there is an auxiliary or other &quot;special verb&quot; (see {{slink||Verbs}} above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): ''I have '''just''' finished the crossword''; ''She can '''usually''' manage a pint''; ''We are '''never''' late''; ''You might '''possibly''' have been unconscious''. Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as ''next'', ''then'', ''however''), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: '''''Yesterday''' we went on a shopping expedition.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://esl.about.com/od/grammarstructures/a/adverb_placement.htm esl.about.com]&lt;/ref&gt; If the verb has an object, the adverb comes after the object (''He finished the test '''quickly'''''). When there is more than one types of adverb, they usually appear in the order: manner, place, time (''His arm was hurt '''severely at home yesterday''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adverbs and adverb phrases: position - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/adverbs-and-adverb-phrases-position|access-date=2020-09-24|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form [[phrasal verb]]s (such as ''up'' in ''pick up'', ''on'' in ''get on'', etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (''pick the pen up'' or ''pick up the pen'', but ''pick it up'').

====Phrases====
An [[adverb phrase]] is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p312&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the [[#Adjective phrases|adjective phrases]] described above. For example: ''very sleepily''; ''all too suddenly''; ''oddly enough''; ''perhaps shockingly for us''.

Another very common type of adverb phrase is the [[prepositional phrase]], which consists of a preposition and its object: ''in the pool''; ''after two years''; ''for the sake of harmony''.

===Prepositions===
[[Preposition]]s form a closed word class,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/&gt; although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as ''in front of''. A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are ''of'', ''in'', ''on'', ''over'', ''under'', ''to'', ''from'', ''with'', ''in front of'', ''behind'', ''opposite'', ''by'', ''before'', ''after'', ''during'', ''through'', ''in spite of'' or ''despite'', ''between'', ''among'', etc.

A preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its [[complement (grammar)|complement]]. A preposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]].&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p314-315&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|pp=314â€“315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''after six pleasant weeks'', ''between the land and the sea''. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in ''the man in the car'', ''the start of the fight''; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in ''deal with the problem'', ''proud of oneself''; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).

English allows the use of [[Preposition stranding|&quot;stranded&quot; prepositions]]. This can occur in interrogative and [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]], where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start ([[wh-fronting|fronted]]), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:
*''What are you talking about?'' (Possible alternative version: ''About what are you talking?'')
*''The song that you were listening to ...'' (more formal: ''The song to which you were listening ...'')
Notice that in the second example the relative pronoun ''that'' could be omitted.

Stranded prepositions can also arise in [[English passive voice|passive voice]] constructions and other uses of passive [[past participle|past participial phrases]], where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] in the same way that a verb's direct object would: ''it was looked at''; ''I will be operated on''; ''get your teeth seen to''. The same can happen in certain uses of [[infinitive]] phrases: ''he is nice to talk to''; ''this is the page to make copies of''.

===Conjunctions===
[[Conjunction (grammar)|Conjunction]]s express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences.&lt;ref name=&quot;carter-mccarthy-p315&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal [[coordinating conjunction]]s in English are: ''and'', ''or'', ''but'', ''nor'', ''so'', ''yet'', and ''for''. These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/&gt; for example:
*Noun phrases combined into a longer noun phrase, such as ''John, Eric, and Jill'', ''the red coat or the blue one''. When ''and'' is used, the resulting noun phrase is plural. A determiner does not need to be repeated with the individual elements: ''the cat, the dog, and the mouse'' and ''the cat, dog, and mouse'' are both correct. The same applies to other modifiers. (The word ''but'' can be used here in the sense of &quot;except&quot;: ''nobody but you''.)
*Adjective or adverb phrases combined into a longer adjective or adverb phrase: ''tired but happy'', ''over the fields and far away''.
*Verbs or verb phrases combined as in ''he washed, peeled, and diced the turnips'' (verbs conjoined, object shared); ''he washed the turnips, peeled them, and diced them'' (full verb phrases, including objects, conjoined).
*Other equivalent items linked, such as prefixes linked in ''pre- and post-test counselling'',&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Association, ''Misuse of Drugs'', Chapter 4, &quot;Constraints of current practice.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; numerals as in ''two or three buildings'', etc.
*Clauses or sentences linked, as in ''We came, '''but''' they wouldn't let us in. They wouldn't let us in, '''nor''' would they explain what we had done wrong.''

There are also [[correlative conjunction]]s, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p315/&gt; The common correlatives in English are:
* ''either ... or'' (''either a man or a woman'');
* ''neither ... nor'' (''neither clever nor funny'');
* ''both ... and'' (''they both punished and rewarded them'');
* ''not ... but'', particularly in ''not only ... but also'' (''not exhausted but exhilarated'', ''not only football but also many other sports'').

[[Subordinating conjunction]]s make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a [[subordinate clause]].&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p316&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common subordinating conjunctions in English are:
*conjunctions of time, including ''after'', ''before'', ''since'', ''until'', ''when'', ''while'';
*conjunctions of cause and effect, including ''because'', ''since'', ''now that'', ''as'', ''in order that'', ''so'';
*conjunctions of opposition or concession, such as ''although'', ''though'', ''even though'', ''whereas'', ''while'';
*conjunctions of condition: such as ''if'', ''unless'', ''only if'', ''whether or not'', ''even if'', ''in case (that)'';
*the conjunction ''that'', which produces [[content clause]]s, as well as words that produce interrogative content clauses: ''whether'', ''where'', ''when'', ''how'', etc.

Subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in ''probably because ...'', ''especially if ...''. The conjunction ''that'' can be omitted after certain verbs, as in ''she told us (that) she was ready''. (For the use of ''that'' in relative clauses, see {{slink||Relative pronouns}} above.)

===Case===
Although English has largely lost its case system, [[personal pronouns]] still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[objective case|objective]] and [[genitive case]]s:&lt;ref&gt;The Chambers Dictionary, 11th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''[[nominative case]]'' (''[[subjective pronouns]]'' such as ''I'', ''he'', ''she'', ''we'', ''they'', ''who'', ''whoever''), used for the subject of a [[finite verb]] and sometimes for the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].
* The ''[[oblique case]]'' (''[[object pronoun]]s'' such as ''me'', ''him'', ''her'', ''us'', ''it'', ''us'', ''them'', ''whom'', ''whomever''), used for the direct or indirect [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.
* The ''[[genitive case]]'' (''[[possessive pronouns]]'' such as ''my/mine'', ''his'', ''her(s)'', ''our(s)'', ''its'', ''our(s)'', ''their'', ''theirs'', ''whose''), used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see {{slink|English possessive|Status of the possessive as a grammatical case}}.

Most English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the [[possessive case]], which has both a ''[[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]'' form (such as ''my'', ''our'') and a distinct ''independent'' form (such as ''mine'', ''ours'') (with two exceptions: the [[grammatical person|third person]] singular masculine and the third person singular neuter ''it'', which use the same form for both determiner and independent [''his car'', ''it is his'']), and a distinct ''[[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]'' or ''intensive'' form (such as ''myself'', ''ourselves''). The [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] personal pronoun ''who'' exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (''who'', ''whom'', ''whose'') and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (''whoever'', ''whomever'', and ''whosever'').

Forms such as ''I'', ''he'', and ''we'' are used for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (&quot;'''I''' kicked the ball&quot;), whereas forms such as ''me'', ''him'' and ''us'' are used for the [[object (grammar)|object]] (&quot;John kicked '''me'''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Finkenstaedt, Thomas; Dieter Wolff (1973). Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon. C. Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declension===
{{further|Declension}}
Nouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they ''decline'' to reflect their [[grammatical number]]; consider the difference between ''book'' and ''books''. In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct [[nominative case|nominative]] (also called [[nominative case#Subjective|subjective]]) and [[oblique case|oblique]] (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a [[verb]] or [[preposition]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Consider the difference between ''he'' (subjective) and ''him'' (objective), as in &quot;He saw it&quot; and &quot;It saw him&quot;; similarly, consider ''[[Who (pronoun)|who]]'', which is subjective, and the objective ''whom''.

Further, these pronouns and a few others have distinct [[grammatical possession|possessive]] forms, such as ''his'' and ''whose''. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single ''plain case''. For example, ''chair'' does not change form between &quot;the chair is here&quot; (subject) and &quot;I saw the chair&quot; (direct object). Possession is shown by the [[clitic]] ''-'s'' attached to a possessive [[noun phrase]], rather than by declension of the noun itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clackson]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDjNp6wODoC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Indo-European linguistics: an introduction''], p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negation==
As noted above under {{slink||Verbs}}, a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] by placing the word ''not'' after an auxiliary, modal or other &quot;[[special verb|special]]&quot; verb such as ''do'', ''can'' or ''be''. For example, the clause ''I go'' is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary ''do'', as ''I do not go'' (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). When the '''affirmative''' already uses auxiliary verbs (''I am going''), no other auxiliary ''verbs'' are added to negate the clause (''I am not going''). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: ''I go not.'')

Most combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with ''not'' have [[contraction (grammar)|contracted forms]]: ''don't'', ''can't'', ''isn't'', etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of ''can'' is written as a single word ''cannot''.) On the inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: ''Should he not pay?'' or ''Shouldn't he pay?''

Other elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word ''not'' before them: ''not the right answer'', ''not interesting'', ''not to enter'', ''not noticing the train'', etc.

When other negating words such as ''never'', ''nobody'', etc. appear in a sentence, the negating ''not'' is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): ''I saw nothing'' or ''I didn't see anything'', but not (except in non-standard speech) *''I didn't see nothing'' (see [[Double negative]]). Such negating words generally have corresponding [[negative polarity item]]s (''ever'' for ''never'', ''anybody'' for ''nobody'', etc.) which can appear in a negative context but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).

==Clause and sentence structure==
{{main|English clause syntax}}
A typical [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] contains one [[independent clause]] and possibly one or more [[dependent clause]]s, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (a noun phrase) and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun, or phrase containing one).

===Word order===
English word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subjectâ€“verbâ€“object]] (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of [[auxiliary verbs]] often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the center of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''. In most sentences, English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The [[Objectâ€“subjectâ€“verb]] (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the [[future tense]] or used as a contrast with the conjunction &quot;but&quot;, such as in the following examples: &quot;Rome I shall see!&quot;, &quot;I hate oranges, but apples I'll eat!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Crystal| first = David| author-link = David Crystal| title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | edition = 2nd| year = 1997| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 0-521-55967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questions===
Like many other Western European languages, English historically allowed [[question]]s to be formed by [[inversion (grammar)|inverting]] the positions of the verb and [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (&quot;[[special verb]]s&quot;), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'' (see [[subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion]]). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]). For example:
* She can dance. â†’ Can she dance? (inversion of subject ''she'' and auxiliary ''can'')
* I am sitting here. â†’ Am I sitting here? (inversion of subject ''I'' and copula ''am'')
* The milk goes in the fridge. â†’ Does the milk go in the fridge? (no special verb present; ''do''-support required)

The above concerns [[yes-no question]]s, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with [[interrogative word]]s such as ''where'', ''what'', ''how'', etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:
* I go. â†’ Where do I go? (''wh''-question formed using inversion, with ''do''-support required in this case)
* He goes. â†’ Who goes? (no inversion, because the question word ''who'' is the subject)

Note that inversion does not apply in [[indirect question]]s: ''I wonder where he is'' (not *''... where is he''). Indirect yes-no questions can be expressed using ''if'' or ''whether'' as the interrogative word: ''Ask them whether/if they saw him.''

[[Negative (grammar)|Negative]] questions are formed similarly; however, if the verb undergoing inversion has a [[English contractions|contraction]] with ''not'', then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:
* John is going. (affirmative)
* John is not going. / John isn't going. (negative, with and without contraction)
* Isn't John going? / Is John not going? (negative question, with and without contraction respectively)

See also {{slink|English auxiliaries and contractions|Contractions and inversion}}.

===Dependent clauses===
The syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun ''that'' can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).

===Other uses of inversion===
The clause structure with an inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentences. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with adverbial or other phrases that are essentially negative or contain words such as ''only'', ''hardly'', etc.: ''Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted''.

In elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after ''so'' (meaning &quot;also&quot;) as well as after the negative ''neither'': ''so do I, neither does she''.

Inversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with ''should'', ''were'' (subjunctive), or ''had'', in the following ways:
*''should I win the race'' (equivalent to ''if I win the race'');
*''were he a soldier'' (equivalent to ''if he were a soldier'');
*''were he to win the race'' (equivalent to ''if he were to win the race'', i.e. ''if he won the race'');
*''had he won the race'' (equivalent to ''if he had won the race'').
Other similar forms sometimes appear but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive ''be'', as in ''be he alive or dead'' (meaning &quot;no matter whether he is alive or dead&quot;).

Use of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression ''long live X'', meaning &quot;let X live long&quot;.

===Imperatives===
In an [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: ''Go away until I call you.'' It is possible, however, to include ''you'' as the subject for emphasis: ''You stay away from me.''

===Elliptical constructions===
Many types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]].

Some notable elliptical forms found in English include:
*Short statements of the form ''I can'', ''he isn't'', ''we mustn't''. Here the verb phrase (understood from the context) is reduced to a single auxiliary or other &quot;special&quot; verb, negated if appropriate. If there is no special verb in the original verb phrase, it is replaced by ''do/does/did'': ''he does'', ''they didn't''.
*Clauses that omit the verb, in particular those like ''me too'', ''nor me'', ''me neither''. The latter forms are used after negative statements. (Equivalents including the verb: ''I do too'' or ''so do I''; ''I don't either'' or ''neither do I''.)
*[[Tag question]]s, formed with a special verb and pronoun subject: ''isn't it?''; ''were there?''; ''am I not?''

==History of English grammars==
{{main|History of English grammars}}
The first published English grammar was a ''Pamphlet for Grammar'' of 1586, written by [[William Bullokar]] with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily's]] Latin grammar, ''Rudimenta Grammatices'' (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been &quot;prescribed&quot; for them in 1542 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a &quot;reformed spelling system&quot; of his own invention; but much English grammar, for much of the century after Bullokar's effort, was written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. [[John Wallis]]'s ''Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae'' (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.

Even as late as the early 19th century, [[Lindley Murray]], the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite &quot;grammatical authorities&quot; to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.

English [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;q=dryden|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=27â€“28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some English grammar rules were adopted from [[Latin]], for example [[John Dryden]] is thought to have created the rule [[Preposition stranding|no sentences can end in a preposition]] because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no [[split infinitive]]s was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=524618639|title=From 'F-Bomb' To 'Photobomb,' How The Dictionary Keeps Up With English|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;q=latin|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;q=split|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollution due to PCBs==
===Belgium===

In 1999, the [[Dioxin Affair]] occurred when 50&amp;nbsp;kg of PCB transformer oils were added to a stock of recycled fat used for the production of 500 tonnes of animal feed, eventually affecting around 2,500 farms in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernard A, Broeckaert F, De Poorter G, De Cock A, Hermans C, Saegerman C, Houins G |title=The Belgian PCB/dioxin incident: analysis of the food chain contamination and health risk evaluation |journal=Environ.

The PCB congener pattern suggested the contamination was from a mixture of Aroclor 1260 &amp; 1254. Over 9 million chickens, and 60,000 pigs were destroyed because of the contamination. The extent of human health effects has been debated, in part because of the use of differing risk assessment methods. One group predicted increased cancer rates, and increased rates of neurological problems in those exposed as neonates. A second study suggested carcinogenic effects were unlikely and that the primary risk would be associated with developmental effects due to exposure in pregnancy and neonates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Covaci&quot; /&gt; Two businessmen who knowingly sold the contaminated feed ingredient received two-year suspended sentences for their role in the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dioxin scandal: 2 year suspended prison sentence|url=http://www.expatica.com/be/news/country-news/Dioxin-scandal-2-year-suspended-prison-sentence_158523.html|website=www.expatica.com|access-date=9 June 2016|date=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The Italian company Caffaro, located in [[Brescia]], specialized in producing PCBs from 1938 to 1984, following the acquisition of the exclusive rights to use the patent in Italy from Monsanto.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The pollution resulting from this factory and the case of Anniston, in the US, are the largest known cases in the world of PCB contamination in water and soil, in terms of the amount of toxic substance dispersed, size of the area contaminated, number of people involved and duration of production.

The values reported by the local health authority (ASL) of Brescia since 1999 are 5,000 times above the limits set by Ministerial Decree 471/1999 (levels for residential areas, 0.001&amp;nbsp;mg/kg). As a result of this and other investigations, in June 2001, a complaint of an environmental disaster was presented to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia. Research on the adult population of Brescia showed that residents of some urban areas, former workers of the plant, and consumers of contaminated food, have PCB levels in their bodies that are in many cases 10–20 times higher than reference values in comparable general populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turrio&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turrio-Baldassarri, Luigi|title=PCDD/F and PCB in human serum of differently exposed population groups of an Italian city |journal=Chemosphere |volume=73 |issue=1 |date=2008 |pages=S228–S234 |pmid=18514762 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.01.081|bibcode=2008Chmsp..73S.228T}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=May 2015}} PCBs entered the human food supply by animals grazing on contaminated pastures near the factory, especially in local veal mostly eaten by farmers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Rocca C, Mantovani A |title=From environment to food: the case of PCB |journal=Annali-Istituto Superiore di Sanita |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=2006 |pages=410–6 |pmid=17361063}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposed population showed an elevated risk of [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], but not for other specific cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part C |volume=31 |issue=2 |date=2013 |vauthors=Zani C, Toninelli G, Filisetti B, Donato F |title=Polychlorinated biphenyls and cancer: an epidemiological assessment |pages=99–144 |pmid=23672403 |doi=10.1080/10590501.2013.782174|s2cid=5294247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In 1968, a mixture of dioxins and PCBs got into rice bran oil produced in northern [[Kyushu]]. Contaminated cooking oil sickened more than 1860 people. The symptoms were called [[Yushō disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aoki, Yasunobu 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=Yasunobu|title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Polychloronated Dibenzo-p-dioxins, and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans as Endocrine Disrupters—What We Have Learned from Yusho Disease|journal=Environmental Research|date=May 2001|volume=86|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1006/enrs.2001.4244|pmid=11386736|bibcode=2001ER.....86....2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Okinawa, high levels of PCB contamination in soil on [[Kadena Air Base]] were reported in 1987 at thousands of parts per million, some of the highest levels found in any pollution site in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonMitchell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. military report suggests cover-up over toxic pollution in Okinawa|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/03/17/issues/u-s-military-report-suggests-cover-up-over-toxic-pollution-in-okinawa/|website=The Japan Times|access-date=2016-06-09|author=Jon Mitchell|date=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
{{Main|2008 Irish pork crisis}}
In December 2008, a number of Irish news sources reported testing had revealed &quot;extremely high&quot; levels of dioxins, by [[toxic equivalent]], in pork products, ranging from 80 to 200 times the [[European Union|EU's]] upper safe limit of 1.5 pg WHO-TEQ&lt;sub&gt;DFP&lt;/sub&gt;/μg i.e. 0.12 to 0.3 parts per billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC PCB-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Food body to meet on pork recall|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7769871.stm|access-date=27 October 2014|work=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EU COMMISSION REGULATION&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006.

[[Brendan Smith (politician)|Brendan Smith]], the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, stated the pork contamination was caused by PCB-contaminated feed that was used on 9 of Ireland's 400 pig farms, and only one feed supplier was involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC PCB-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Firm at centre of toxin scare investigated|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1207/111373-pork/|access-date=27 October 2014|publisher=RTE news|date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith added that 38 beef farms also used the same contaminated feed, but those farms were quickly isolated and no contaminated beef entered the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Q&amp;A: The recall of Irish pork |work= BBC |access-date= 2008-12-08 |date= 2008-12-07 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7769893.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the contamination was limited to just 9 pig farms, the Irish government requested the immediate withdrawal and disposal of all pork-containing products produced in Ireland and purchased since 1 September 2008. This request for withdrawal of pork products was confirmed in a press release by the [[Food Safety Authority of Ireland]] on December 6.&lt;!-- Not original press release cited, but that link was dead and this covers the topic in question --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Recall of Pork and Bacon Products December 2008 |publisher= Food Safety Authority of Ireland |date= December 2008 |url= http://www.fsai.ie/food_businesses/topics_of_interest/recall_of_pork_dec08/recall_information.html |access-date= 27 May 2013 |url-status= dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817023437/http://www.fsai.ie/food_businesses/topics_of_interest/recall_of_pork_dec08/recall_information.html |archive-date= 17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the incident resulted from the contamination of fuel oil used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs. The resulting combustion produced a highly toxic mixture of PCBs, dioxins and [[furan]]s, which was included in the feed produced and subsequently fed to a large number of pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the Inter-Agency Review Group on the Dioxin Contamination Incident in Ireland in December 2008 |publisher= Department of Agriculture, Food &amp; the Marine |date= Dec 2009 |url= http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/publications/2010/DioxinReport211209revised190110.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, a number of cases have been reported in the 2010s of thieves selling [[transformer oil]], stolen from electric [[transformer]]s, to the operators of roadside [[food stall]]s for use in [[deep frying]]. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular [[cooking oil]]. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iraki|first1=XN|title=Thieves fry Kenya's power grid for fast food|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/12/thieves-fry-kenya-power-grid-fast-food-2014122884728785480.html|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===
The chemical plant '''Chemko''' in [[Strážske]] (east [[Slovakia]]) was an important producer of polychlorinated biphenyls for the former communist bloc ([[Comecon]]) until 1984. Chemko contaminated a large part of east Slovakia, especially the sediments of the [[Laborec]] river and [[reservoir]] [[Zemplínska šírava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zivot.azet.sk/clanok/6399/viete-co-doma-dychate |title=Viete, čo doma dýchate? |trans-title=Do you know what you breathe at home? |language=sk |work=Život |issue=33 |year=2009 |first=Dan |last=Himič}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/slovakia/zataze/arealy-podnikov-a-priemyselne/projekt-implementacie |title=Chemko Strážske |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516215920/http://www.greenpeace.org/slovakia/zataze/arealy-podnikov-a-priemyselne/projekt-implementacie |archive-date=May 16, 2011 |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
Between 1962 and 1983, the [[Iskra (company)|Iskra Kondenzatorji]] company in [[Semič]] ([[White Carniola]], Southeast [[Slovenia]]) manufactured [[capacitor]]s using PCBs. Due to the wastewater and improperly disposed waste products, the area (including the [[Krupa (Lahinja)|Krupa]] and [[Lahinja]] rivers) became highly contaminated with PCBs. The pollution was discovered in 1983, when the Krupa river was meant to become a water supply source. The area was sanitized then, but the soil and water are still highly polluted. Traces of PCBs were found in food (eggs, cow milk, walnuts) and Krupa is still the most PCB-polluted river in the world.

===Spain &amp; Portugal===
Several [[cetacean]] species have very high mean [[blubber]] PCB concentrations likely to cause population declines and suppress population recovery. [[Striped dolphin]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[killer whale]]s were found to have mean levels that markedly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The western Mediterranean Sea and the south-west Iberian Peninsula were identified as “hotspots”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Paul D.

===United Kingdom===
[[Monsanto]] manufactured PCBs at its chemical plant in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], South Wales, until the mid- to late-1970s. During this period, waste matter, including PCBs, from the Newport site was dumped at a disused quarry near [[Groes-faen]], west of [[Cardiff]], and Penhros landfill site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tip-fumes-felt-like-terror-2435122|title=Tip fumes &quot;felt like terror attack&quot;|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 30, 2004 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where it continues to be released in waste water discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/21/monsanto-brofiscin-pollution | title=Monsanto agrees to clean up toxic chemicals in South Wales quarry | date=21 February 2011 | access-date=16 September 2013 | last=Levitt | first=Tom | newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===&lt;!-- Linked from [[PCBs in the United States]] redir. --&gt;
Only one company, Monsanto manufactured PCBs in the US. Its production was entirely halted in 1977. (Kimbrough, 1987, 1995)&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

====Alabama====
PCBs originating from [[Monsanto Chemical Company]] in [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]], Alabama were dumped into Snow Creek, which then spread to Choccolocco Creek, then [[Logan Martin Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anniston PCB Site (Monsanto Co), Anniston, AL |url=http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0400123 |website=Superfund Site Profile |access-date=2020-05-24 |publisher=EPA |location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, class action lawsuits were settled by local land owners, including those on [[Logan Martin Lake]], and [[Lay Dam|Lay Reservoir]] (downstream on the [[Coosa River]]), for the PCB pollution. Donald Stewart, former Senator from Alabama, first learned of the concerns of hundreds of west Anniston residents after representing a church which had been approached about selling its property by Monsanto. Stewart went on to be the pioneer and lead attorney in the first and majority of cases against Monsanto and focused on residents in the immediate area known to be most polluted. Other attorneys later joined in to file suits for those outside the main immediate area around the plant; one of these was the late [[Johnnie Cochran]].

In 2007, the highest pollution levels remained concentrated in Snow and Choccolocco Creeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.03.046 |title=Variations in PCB concentrations between sexes of six warmwater fish species in Lake Logan Martin, Alabama, USA |year=2007 |last1=Rypel |first1=Andrew L. |last2=Findlay |first2=Robert H. |last3=Mitchell |first3=Justin B. |last4=Bayne |first4=David R. |journal=Chemosphere |volume=68 |issue=9 |pages=1707–15 |pmid=17490714|bibcode=2007Chmsp..68.1707R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations in fish have declined and continue to decline over time; sediment disturbance, however, can resuspend the PCBs from the sediment back into the water column and food web.

====Great Lakes====
In 1976, environmentalists found PCBs in the sludge at [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] Harbor, the southwest end of [[Lake Michigan]]. They were able to trace the source of the PCBs back to the Outboard Marine Corporation that was producing boat motors next to the harbor. By 1982, the Outboard Marine Corporation was court-ordered to release quantitative data referring to their PCB waste released. The data stated that from 1954 they released 100,000 tons of PCB into the environment, and that the sludge contained PCBs in concentrations as high as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashworth |first=William |title=The Late, Great Lakes |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-8143-1887-4}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahan |first=Meegan L. |date=May 4, 1998 |title=Are PCBs still a problem in the great lakes? |url=http://www.cevl.msu.edu/~long/pcb.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722012319/http://www.cevl.msu.edu/~long/pcb.htm |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |url-status=dead}}{{self-published source|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=May 2013}}

In 1989, during construction near the [[Zilwaukee, Michigan|Zilwaukee]] bridge, workers uncovered an uncharted landfill containing PCB-contaminated waste which required $100,000 to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganhighways.org/indepth/zilwaukee.html|title=Michigan Highways: In Depth: The Milwaukee Bridge|author=Christopher J. Bessert|work=michiganhighways.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[Great Lakes]] area were still heavily polluted with PCBs in 1988, despite extensive remediation work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bette |last=Hileman |title=Great Lakes Cleanup Effort |journal=Chemical and Engineering News |volume=66 |issue=6 |date=February 8, 1988 |pages=22–39 |doi=10.1021/cen-v066n006.p022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indiana====
From the late 1950s through 1977, [[Westinghouse Electric]] used PCBs in the manufacture of capacitors in its [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana, plant. Reject capacitors were hauled and dumped in area salvage yards and landfills, including Bennett's Dump, Neal's Landfill and Lemon Lane Landfill.&lt;ref name=&quot;US EPA&quot;/&gt; Workers also dumped PCB oil down factory drains, which contaminated the city sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copa.org/abb.html|access-date=2010-02-24|title=Westinghouse/ABB Plant Facility|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Bloomington gave away the sludge to area farmers and gardeners, creating anywhere from 200 to 2,000 sites, which remain unaddressed.

Over 2 million pounds of PCBs were estimated to have been dumped in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe]] and [[Owen County, Indiana|Owen]] counties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Although federal and state authorities have been working on the sites' [[environmental remediation]], many areas remain contaminated. Concerns have been raised regarding the removal of PCBs from the [[karst]] limestone topography, and regarding the possible disposal options. To date, the Westinghouse Bloomington PCB Superfund site case does not have a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and Record of Decision (ROD), although Westinghouse signed a US Department of Justice Consent Decree in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;US EPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US EPA Region 5 Superfund|url=http://www.epa.gov/R5Super/npl/indiana/IND006418651.htm|access-date=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1985 consent decree required Westinghouse to construct an incinerator that would incinerate PCB-contaminated materials. Because of public opposition to the incinerator, however, the State of Indiana passed a number of laws that delayed and blocked its construction. The parties to the consent decree began to explore alternative remedies in 1994 for six of the main PCB contaminated sites in the consent decree. Hundreds of sites remain unaddressed as of 2014. Monroe County will never be PCB-free, as noted in a 2014 Indiana University program about the local contamination.&lt;ref name=&quot;US EPA&quot; /&gt;

On 15 February 2008, Monroe County approved a plan to clean up the three remaining contaminated sites in the City of Bloomington, at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]9.6 million to [[CBS Corporation|CBS Corp.]], the successor of Westinghouse. In 1999, Viacom bought CBS, so they are current responsible party for the PCB sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monroe Co. approves PCB clean up |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080218/LOCAL/802180394 |publisher=IndyStar.com|access-date=2008-02-18 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indystar.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F20080218%2FLOCAL%2F802180394&amp;date=2008-02-18 |archive-date=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Massachusetts====
[[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], in western Massachusetts, was home to the [[General Electric Pittsfield Plant|General Electric (GE) transformer, capacitor, and electrical generating equipment divisions]]. The electrical generating division built and repaired equipment that was used to power the electrical utility grid throughout the nation. PCB-contaminated oil routinely migrated from GE's {{convert|254|acre|km2|adj=on}} industrial plant located in the very center of the city to the surrounding groundwater, nearby Silver Lake, and to the [[Housatonic River]], which flows through Massachusetts, Connecticut, and down to Long Island Sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;GE Pittsfield-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Site History &amp; Description |website=GE/Housatonic River Site in New England |url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/ge/sitehistory.html |date=2011 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Boston, MA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519121339/http://www.epa.gov/NE/ge/sitehistory.html |archive-date=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCB-containing solid material was widely used as fill, including [[meander|oxbows]] of the Housatonic River.

====Missouri====
In 1982, Martha C. Rose Chemical Inc. began processing and disposing of materials contaminated with PCB's in [[Holden, Missouri]], a small rural community about {{convert|40|mi}} east of Kansas City. From 1982 until 1986, nearly 750 companies, including General Motors Corp., Commonwealth Edison, Illinois Power Co. and West Texas Utilities, sent millions of pounds of PCB contaminated materials to Holden for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/c83b34f4cdcddc21aff592829725dff4|title=Nearly a Decade After Spill, Cleanup of Toxic Site Drags On With PM-Rusted Legacy II|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, according to prosecutors, the company began storing the contaminated materials while falsifying its reports to the EPA to show they had been removed.

After the plant closed the state environmental agency found PCB contamination in streams near the plant and in the city's sewage treatment sludge. A 100,000 square-foot warehouse and unknown amounts of contaminated soil and water around the site had to be cleaned up. Most of the surface debris, including close to 13 million pounds of contaminated equipment, carcasses and tanks of contaminated oil, had to be removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinzor|first=R.

Carolan, owner of Rose Chemical, and five others pleaded guilty in 1989 to committing fraud or falsifying documents. Carolan and two other executives served sentences of less than 18 months; the others received fines and were placed on probation. Cleanup costs at the site are estimated at $35 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

====New York====
[[Pollution of the Hudson River]] is largely due to dumping of PCBs by [[General Electric]] from 1947 to 1977. GE dumped an estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River during these years. The PCBs came from the company's two capacitor manufacturing plants at [[Hudson Falls, New York|Hudson Falls]] and [[Fort Edward (town), New York|Fort Edward]], New York. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-hudson-cleanup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River Cleanup |publisher=EPA |url=https://www.epa.gov/hudsonriverpcbs/hudson-river-cleanup |date=2020-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hudson River PCBs Superfund Site |url=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories-epa-region-2#hudson |website=Superfund Success Stories: EPA Region 2 |date=2018-06-04 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the implementation of [[Clean Water Act#Point sources|wastewater discharge permits]] and consequent control or reduction of wastewater discharges, and sediment removal operations, which have continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSDEC-Hudson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/77105.html |title=How is the Hudson Doing? |website=Hudson River Estuary Program |publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation |location=Albany, NY |access-date=2020-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Love Canal]] is a neighborhood in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], New York that was heavily contaminated with toxic waste including PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Brown |first1=Michael H. |title=Love Canal and the Poisoning of America |journal=The Atlantic |date=December 1979 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eighteen Mile Creek (Niagara County)|Eighteen Mile Creek]] in [[Lockport (town), New York|Lockport]], New York is an EPA Superfund site for PCBs contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eighteen Mile Creek, Lockport, NY |url=http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0206456 |website=Superfund Program |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCB pollution at the [[Government Plaza, Binghamton|State Office Building]] in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] was responsible for what is now considered to be the first indoor environmental disaster in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2011/08/07/former-ny-governor-hugh-carey-dead-at-92/ &quot;Former NY governor Hugh Carey dead at 92&quot;], ''New York Post'', August 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a transformer explosion in the basement spewed PCBs throughout the entire 18-story building.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spill closes offices&quot;, ''Syracuse Herald-Journal'', February 5, 1981, pD-1&lt;/ref&gt; The contamination was so severe that cleanup efforts kept the building closed for 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;State Building Finally Reopens in Binghamton&quot;, ''The Buffalo News'', October 12, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/11/nyregion/13-year-cleaning-job-after-53-million-17-million-state-building-finally-declared.html?pagewanted=1 &quot;The 13-Year Cleaning Job; After $53 Million, a $17 Million State Building Finally Is Declared Safe From Toxins&quot;], ''New York Times'', October 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Carolina====
One of the largest deliberate PCB spills in American history occurred in the summer of 1978 when 31,000 gallons (117 m^3) of PCB-contaminated oil were illegally sprayed by the Ward PCB Transformer Company in {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on}} swaths along the roadsides of some {{convert|240|mi|km}} of North Carolina highway shoulders in 14 counties and at the [[Fort Bragg]] Army Base. The crime, known as &quot;[[Warren County PCB Landfill|the midnight dumpings]]&quot;, occurred over nearly 2 weeks, as drivers of a black-painted tanker truck drove down one side of rural Piedmont highways spraying PCB-laden waste and then up the other side the following night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siceloff|first1=Bruce|title=Toxic cleanup shifts from dirt near RDU to region's streams, lakes|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article10027130.html|website=The News &amp; Observer|access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Governor [[Jim Hunt|James B. Hunt]], Jr., state officials then erected large, yellow warning signs along the contaminated highways that read: &quot;CAUTION: PCB Chemical Spills Along Highway Shoulders.&quot; The illegal dumping is believed to have been motivated by the passing of the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), which became effective on August 2, 1978 and increased the expense of chemical waste disposal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Within a couple of weeks of the crime, Robert Burns and his sons, Timothy and Randall, were arrested for dumping the PCBs along the roadsides. Burns was a business partner of Robert &quot;Buck&quot; Ward, Jr., of the Ward PCB Transformer Company, in Raleigh. Burns and sons pleaded guilty to state and Federal criminal charges; Burns received a three to five-year prison sentence. Ward was acquitted of state charges in the dumping, but was sentenced to 18 months prison time for violation of TSCA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/us/carolinians-angry-over-pcb-landfill.html |title=Carolinians Angry Over PCB Landfill|work=NY Times |date=11 August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleanup and disposal of the roadside PCBs generated controversy, as the Governor's plan to pick up the roadside PCBs and to bury them in a landfill in rural [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]] were strongly opposed in 1982 by local residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt; In October 2013, at the request of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), the City of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina decided to stop applying [[biosolids|sewage sludge]] to land while authorities investigated the source of PCB contamination.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmu&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/Utilities/AboutUs/Documents/Minutes%20October%202013.pdf|author=Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities Advisory Committee|title=Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities Advisory Committee Minutes|date=October 17, 2013|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2014, the City of Charlotte admitted PCBs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;co214&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/02/07/4670710/chemical-dumped-into-charlotte.html |title=Task force named to probe chemical dumping |date=7 February 2014 |newspaper=Charlotte Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2013 SCDHEC had issued emergency regulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Regulation for Management of Wastewater System Sludge|url=http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/docs/NewsReleaseDocs/PCBEmergencyRegFINAL.pdf|publisher=South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the City of Charlotte discovered high levels of PCBs entering its sewage waste water treatment plants, where sewage is converted to sewage sludge.&lt;ref name=co214/&gt; The city at first denied it had a problem, then admitted an &quot;event&quot; occurred in February 2014, and in April that the problem had occurred much earlier.&lt;ref name=cmu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/04/04/4817470/more-pcbs-found-in-charlotte-wastewater.html|title=More PCBs found in Charlotte wastewater, city says |date=4 April 2014| newspaper=Charlotte Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city stated that its very first test with a newly changed test method revealed very high PCB levels in its sewage sludge farm field fertilizer. Because of the widespread use of the contaminated sludge, SCDHEC subsequently issued PCB fish advisories for nearly all streams and rivers bordering farm fields that had been applied with city waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/NewsReleases/2014/nr20140703-01/|date=July 3, 2014|title=DHEC Releases Safe Fish Eating Advisory for S.C.

From 1955 until 1977, the Sangamo Weston plant in Pickens, SC, used PCBs to manufacture capacitors, and dumped 400,000 pounds of PCB contaminated wastewater into the Twelve Mile Creek. In 1990, the EPA declared the {{convert|228|acre|km2}} site of the capacitor plant, its landfills and the polluted watershed, which stretches nearly {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} downstream to Lake Hartwell as a [[Superfund]] site. Two dams on the Twelve Mile Creek are to be removed and on Feb. 22, 2011 the first of two dams began to be dismantled. Some contaminated sediment is being removed from the site and hauled away, while other sediment is pumped into a series of settling ponds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/npl/nplsc/sangamsc.htm Sangamo Weston, Inc./Twelve-Mile Creek/Lake Hartwell PCB Contamination], USEPA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyff4.com/r/26949154/detail.html Dam Demolition Begins On Twelve Mile River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718123940/http://www.wyff4.com/r/26949154/detail.html |date=2011-07-18}}, WYFF News 4, February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the state environmental regulators issued a rare emergency order, banning all [[sewage sludge]] from being land applied or deposited on landfills, as it contained very high levels of PCBs. The problem had not been discovered until thousands of acres of farm land in the state had been contaminated by the [[hazardous]] sludge. A criminal investigation to determine the perpetrator of this crime was launched.&lt;ref name=&quot;scdhec.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scdhec.gov/administration/news/2013/nr20130925-01.htm |title=DHEC: General Agency Information |date=2013 |work=scdhec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
As of 2015, several bodies of water in the state of Washington were contaminated with PCBs, including the [[Columbia River]], the [[Duwamish River]], [[Green Lake (Seattle)|Green Lake]], [[Lake Washington]], the [[Okanogan River]], [[Puget Sound]], the [[Spokane River]], the [[Walla Walla River]], the [[Wenatchee River]], and the [[Yakima River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fish Consumption Advisories :: Washington State Dept. of Health |url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Food/Fish/Advisories |website=www.doh.wa.gov |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Washington State published in 2011 found that the two largest sources of PCB flow into the Spokane River were City of Spokane stormwater (44%) and municipal and industrial discharges (20%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spokane River PCB Source Assessment 2003–2007 |url=https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/documents/1103013.pdf |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs entered the environment through paint, hydraulic fluids, sealants, inks and have been found in river sediment and wildlife.

====Wisconsin====
From 1954 until 1971, the Fox River in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], Wisconsin had PCBs deposited into it from Appleton Paper/NCR, P.H. Gladfelter, [[Georgia-Pacific]] and other notable local paper manufacturing facilities. The Wisconsin DNR estimates that after wastewater treatment the PCB discharges to the Fox River due to production losses ranged from 81,000&amp;nbsp;kg to 138,000&amp;nbsp;kg. (178,572&amp;nbsp;lbs. to 304,235&amp;nbsp;lbs). The production of Carbon Copy Paper and its byproducts led to the discharge into the river. Fox River clean up is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of PCBs in the Fox River and Green Bay |url=http://www.foxriverwatch.com/pcb_pcbs_sources_1.html |website=www.foxriverwatch.com|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
===Japan===
In 1972 the Japanese government banned the production, use, and import of PCBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

===Sweden===
In 1973, the use of PCBs in &quot;open&quot; or &quot;[[dissipative]]&quot; sources (such as [[Plasticizer|plasticisers]] in paints and cements, casting agents, [[fire retardant]] fabric treatments and [[Heat stabilizer|heat stabilizing additives]] for PVC electrical insulation, [[adhesive]]s, paints and waterproofing, [[railroad tie]]s) was banned in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===United Kingdom===
In 1981, the UK banned closed uses of PCBs in new equipment, and nearly all UK PCB synthesis ceased; closed uses in existing equipment containing in excess of 5&amp;nbsp;litres of PCBs were not stopped until December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidance on municipal waste strategies, Section 5.12 Equipment, which contains low volumes of PCBs |publisher=UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions |page=17 |year=2001 |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/pdf/mwms.pdf |access-date=2008-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414094248/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/pdf/mwms.pdf |archive-date=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1976, concern over the toxicity and persistence (chemical stability) of PCBs in the environment led the [[United States Congress]] to ban their domestic production, effective January 1, 1978, pursuant to the [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976|Toxic Substances Control Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States.

EPA defined the &quot;maximum contaminant level goal&quot; for [[public water system]]s as zero, but because of the limitations of water treatment technologies, a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the actual regulated level ([[maximum contaminant level]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Primary Drinking Water Regulations |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations |date=2020-02-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of destruction==
===Physical===
PCBs are technically attractive because of their inertness, which includes their resistance to combustion. Nonetheless, they can be effectively destroyed by [[incineration]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. When combusted at lower temperatures, they convert in part to more hazardous materials, including dibenzofurans and dibenzodioxins. When conducted properly, the combustion products are water, carbon dioxide, and [[hydrogen chloride]]. In some cases, the PCBs are combusted as a solution in kerosene. PCBs have also been destroyed by pyrolysis in the presence of alkali metal [[carbonate]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

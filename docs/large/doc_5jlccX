He is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century and one of the greatest cellists of all time. He made many recordings throughout his career of solo, chamber, and orchestral music, including some as conductor, but he is perhaps best remembered for the recordings of the [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suites]] he made from 1936 to 1939.  He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963 by [[President John F. Kennedy]] (though the ceremony was presided over by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]).

==Biography==

===Childhood and early years===
Casals was born in [[El Vendrell]], Catalonia, Spain. His father, Carles Casals i Ribes (1852–1908), was a parish [[organist]] and [[conducting|choirmaster]]. He gave Casals instruction in piano, songwriting, violin, and organ. He was also a very strict disciplinarian. When Casals was young his father would pull the piano out from the wall and have him and his brother, Artur, stand behind it and name the notes and the scales that his father was playing. At the age of four Casals could play the violin, piano and flute; at the age of six he played the violin well enough to perform a solo in public. His first encounter with a cello-like instrument was from witnessing a local travelling Catalan musician, who played a cello-strung broom handle. Upon request, his father built him a crude cello, using a [[gourd]] as a sound-box. When Casals was eleven, he first heard the real cello performed by a group of traveling musicians, and decided to dedicate himself to the instrument. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1888 his mother, [[Pilar Defilló Amiguet|Pilar Defilló de Casals]], who was born in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]], of Catalan ancestry, took him to Barcelona, where he enrolled in the Escola Municipal de Música.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he studied cello, theory, and piano. In 1890, when he was 13, he found in a second-hand sheet music store in Barcelona a tattered copy of Bach's six cello suites. He spent the next 13 years practicing them every day before he would perform them in public for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Siblin,''The Cello Suites: J.S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a Baroque Masterpiece''. Atlantic; 336 pages, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Casals would later make his own version of the six suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ovationpress.com/c-84-casals-pablo.aspx|title=Pablo Casals - Cello|website=ovationpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made prodigious progress as a cellist; on 23 February 1891 he gave a solo recital in Barcelona at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the ''Escola'' with honours five years later.

===Youth and studies===
[[File:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Pau Casals- 027622-D 006612.jpg|thumb|upright|A young Pau Casals, by [[Ramon Casas]]]]
In 1893, Spanish composer [[Isaac Albéniz]] heard him playing in a trio in a café and gave him a letter of introduction to the Count [[Guillermo Morphy]], the private secretary to [[Maria Christina of Austria|María Cristina]], the Queen Regent of Spain. Casals was asked to play at informal concerts in the palace, and was granted a royal stipend to study composition at the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]] in Madrid with [[Víctor Mirecki Larramat|Víctor Mirecki]]. He also played in the newly organised Quartet Society.

In 1895 he went to Paris, where, having lost his stipend, he earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the ''[[Théâtre des Folies-Marigny|Folies Marigny]]''. In 1896, he returned to Spain and received an appointment to the faculty of the ''Escola Municipal de Música'' in Barcelona. He was also appointed principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the [[Liceu]]. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the [[Madrid Symphony Orchestra]], and was awarded the [[Order of Charles III|Order of Carlos III]] from the Queen. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===International career===
In 1899, Casals played at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London, and later for [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]], her summer residence, accompanied by [[Ernest Walker (composer)|Ernest Walker]]. On 12 November, and 17 December 1899, he appeared as a soloist at Lamoureux Concerts in Paris, to great public and critical acclaim. He toured Spain and the Netherlands with the pianist [[Harold Bauer]] from 1900 to 1901; in 1901/02 he made his first tour of the United States; and in 1903 toured South America.

On 15 January 1904, Casals was invited to play at the [[White House]] for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. On 9 March, of that year he made his debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York, playing [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' under the baton of the composer. In 1906 he became associated with the talented young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, Anita [http://www.cello.org/Newsletter/Articles/suggia.htm Guilhermina Suggia], retrieved 2009-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; who studied with him and began to appear in concerts as Mme. P. Casals-Suggia, although they were not legally married. Their relationship ended in 1912.

''[[The New York Times]]'' of 9 April 1911, announced that Casals would perform at the London Musical Festival to be held at the Queen's Hall on the second day of the Festival (23 May). The piece chosen was [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s Cello Concerto in D and Casals would later join [[Fritz Kreisler]] for [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto for Violin and Cello]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;

In 1914, Casals married the American socialite and singer [[Susan Metcalfe Casals|Susan Metcalfe]]; they were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.

Although Casals made his first recordings in 1915 (a series for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]), he would not release another recording until 1926 (on the [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] label).&lt;ref name=&quot;classical&quot;/&gt;

Back in Paris, Casals organized a trio with the pianist [[Alfred Cortot]] and the violinist [[Jacques Thibaud]]; they played concerts and made recordings until 1937. Casals also became interested in conducting, and in 1919 he organized, in Barcelona, the [[Orquestra Pau Casals|Pau Casals Orchestra]] and led its first concert on 13 October 1920. With the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the Orquesta Pau Casals ceased its activities.

Casals was an ardent supporter of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican government]], and after its defeat vowed not to return to Spain until democracy was restored. Casals performed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu on 19 October 1938, possibly his last performance in Spain during his exile.&lt;ref&gt;Abella, Rafael ''La vida cotidiana durante la guerra civil: la España republicana'' p. 422 (published by Editorial Planeta, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidential Medal of Freedom.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|Presidential Medal of Freedom]]
In the last weeks of 1936 he stayed in [[Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales|Prades]],&lt;ref&gt;René Puig (Casals' doctor in Prades since the end of 1936) in &quot;Pablo Casals&quot;, ''Magazine Conflent'', 1965, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; a small village in France near the Spanish border, where Casals would settle in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baldock |first1=Robert |title=Pablo Casals |url=https://archive.org/details/pablocasals0000bald |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=Northeastern University Press |location=Boston |isbn=1-55553-176-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/pablocasals0000bald/page/161 161]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], a historically Catalan region. Between 1939 and 1942 he made sporadic appearances as a cellist in the unoccupied zone of southern France and in [[Switzerland]]. He was mocked by the Francoist press, which wrote articles deriding him as &quot;a donkey&quot;, and was fined one million pesetas for his political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalunya sota el règim franquista|last=1920-2008.|first=Benet, Josep|date=1978|publisher=Blume|isbn=847031064X|edition=1. reedició|location=Barcelona|oclc=4777662}}&lt;/ref&gt; So fierce was his opposition to [[Francoist Spain]] that he refused to appear in countries that recognized the Spanish government. He made a notable exception when he took part in a concert of [[chamber music]] in the [[White House]] on 13 November 1961, at the invitation of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], whom he admired. On 6 December 1963, Casals was awarded the U.S. [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Throughout most of his professional career, he played on a cello that was labeled and attributed to &quot;[[Carlo Annibale Tononi|Carlo Tononi]] ... 1733&quot; but after he had been playing it for 50 years it was discovered to have been created by the Venetian [[luthier]] [[Matteo Goffriller]] around 1700. Casals acquired it in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=2366|title= Cello by Matteo Goffriller, 1700c (ex-Casals)|publisher= Cozio|accessdate= 2007-01-22|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071122232757/http://www.cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=2366|archive-date= 22 November 2007|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played another cello by Goffriller dated 1710, and a Tononi from 1730.

====Prades Festivals====
In 1950 he resumed his career as conductor and cellist at the [[Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales|Prades]] Festival in [[Conflent]], organized in commemoration of the bicentenary of the death of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]; Casals agreed to participate on condition that all proceeds were to go to a refugee hospital in nearby [[Perpignan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;classical&quot; /&gt;

====Puerto Rico====
Casals traveled extensively to Puerto Rico in 1955, inaugurating the annual [[Casals Festival]] the next year. In 1955 Casals married as his second wife long-time associate Francesca Vidal de Capdevila, who died that same year. In 1957, at age 80, Casals married 20-year-old [[Marta Casals Istomin|Marta Montañez y Martinez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Master cellist Pablo Casal marries 21-year-old pupil|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&amp;dat=19570805&amp;id=hpxJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mwwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1738,948032| newspaper=The News and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)| date=5 August 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have dismissed concerns that marriage to someone 60 years his junior might be hazardous by saying, &quot;I look at it this way: if she dies, she dies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gardner| first=Jasmine| title=Julian Lloyd Webber talks music and marriage |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/julian-lloyd-webber-talks-music-and-marriage-7578985.html |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Amis| first=John| title=Master of the Cello: Pablo Casals| journal=The Tablet| date=6 February 1993| url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/6th-february-1993/16/master-of-the-cello| access-date=29 September 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193522/http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/6th-february-1993/16/master-of-the-cello| archive-date=29 October 2013| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pau and Marta made their permanent residence in the town of [[Ceiba, Puerto Rico|Ceiba]], and lived in a house called &quot;El Pessebre&quot; (The Manger).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festcasalspr.gobierno.pr/historia.html Festival Casals de Puerto Rico: Historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427045736/http://www.festcasalspr.gobierno.pr/historia.html |date=27 April 2009 }}, retrieved 2009-08-01 {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an impact in the Puerto Rican music scene, by founding the [[Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra]] in 1958, and the [[Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico]] in 1959.

===Later years===
Casals appeared in the 1958 documentary film ''[[Windjammer (1958 film)|Windjammer]]''. In the 1960s, Casals gave many [[master class]]es throughout the world in places such as [[Gstaad]], [[Zermatt]], Tuscany, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[Marlboro, Vermont|Marlboro]]. Several of these master classes were televised.

On 13 November 1961, he performed in the [[East Room]] at the White House by invitation of President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] at a dinner given in honor of the Governor of Puerto Rico, [[Luis Muñoz Marín]]. This performance was recorded and released as [[#R1961|an album]].

Casals was also a composer. Perhaps his most effective work is ''[[Sardana|La Sardana]]'', for an ensemble of cellos, which he composed in 1926. His oratorio ''El Pessebre'' was performed for the first time in [[Acapulco]], Mexico, on 17 December 1960. He also presented it to the United Nations during their anniversary in 1963. He was initiated as an honorary member of the Epsilon Iota chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] music fraternity at [[Florida State University]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfonia.org/TheSinfonian/issues/2002-12-part1.pdf|title=''The Sinfonian'' December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later awarded the fraternity's [[Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award]] in 1973.

One of his last compositions was the &quot;Hymn of the United Nations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/faq/factsheets/hymn.pdf|title=United Nations – Fact Sheet # 9: &quot;Does the UN have a hymn or national anthem?&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971, two months before his 95th birthday. On that day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[U Thant]], awarded Casals the U.N. Peace Medal in recognition of his stance for peace, justice and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Pau Casals Foundation, [http://www.paucasals.org/en/-PAU-CASALS-United-Nations-speech United Nations Peace Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; Casals accepted the medal and made his famous &quot;[[I Am a Catalan]]&quot; speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|AKlkO3Tt3Kw|Video of Pablo Casals &quot;I am a Catalan&quot; speech, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he stated that [[Catalonia]] had the first democratic [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], long before England did.

In 1973, invited by his friend [[Isaac Stern]], Casals arrived at Jerusalem to conduct the youth orchestra and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. The concert he conducted with the youth orchestra at the Jerusalem Khan Theater was the last concert he conducted in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jerusalemsymphonyorchestra.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A5-%D7%A4%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%A7%D7%96%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A1-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA/|title=הישראלי המאומץ – פבלו קזאלס והסימפונית|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casals' memoirs were taken down by [[Albert E. Kahn]], and published as ''Joys and Sorrows: Pablo Casals, His Own Story'' (1970).

=== Death ===
Casals died in 1973 at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], at the age of 96, from complications of a heart attack he had three weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Casals, the Master Cellist, Won Wide Acclaim in Career That Spanned 75 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/23/archives/casals-the-master-cellist-won-wide-acclaim-in-career-that-spanned.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 October 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |title=Casals Dies in Puerto Rico at 96 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A01E3D81739E73ABC4B51DFB6678388669EDE |quote=Pablo Casals, the celebrated cellist and conductor, died today at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital of complications from a heart attack suffered three weeks ago.

In 1989, Casals was posthumously awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ Lifetime Achievement Award], [[Grammy Award]] official web site, retrieved 2009-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museo Pablo Casals in San Juan.jpg|thumb|Pablo Casals Museum, in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]
The southern part of the highway C-32 in Catalonia, Spain, is named [[Autopista de Pau Casals]].

The International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in [[Kronberg im Taunus|Kronberg]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany, under the auspices of the [[Kronberg Academy]] once every four years, starting in 2000, to discover and further the careers of the future cello elite, and is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage of his widow, [[Marta Casals Istomin]]. One of the prizes is the use of one of the Gofriller cellos owned by Casals. The first top prize was awarded in 2000 to Claudio Bohórquez.

Australian radio broadcaster [[Phillip Adams]] often fondly recalls Casals' 80th birthday press conference where, after complaining at length about the troubles of the world, he paused to conclude with the observation: &quot;The situation is hopeless. We must take the next step&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Phillip|authorlink=Phillip Adams|title=Why We Need a Revolution Now|url=http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/files/Adams.pdf|website=Our Community|publisher=2004 Communities in Control conference convened by Our Community and Catholic Social Services|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Adams| first=Phillip| title=The emu's bum, or &quot;The situation is hopeless, we must take the next step&quot;|url= http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/23811390 |website=National Library of Australia| location=Moonah, Tasmania| publisher=Tasmanian Peace Trust| year=2004| accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Phillip|url=https://twitter.com/PhillipAdams_1/status/647647952551346176|title=Tweet|date=26 September 2015|website=Twitter|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American comedian [[George Carlin]], in his interview for the [[Archive of American Television]], refers to Casals when discussing the restless nature of an artist's [[persona]]. As Carlin states, when Casals (then aged 93) was asked why he continued to practice the cello three hours a day, Casals replied, &quot;'I'm beginning to notice some improvement&amp;nbsp;...' [A]nd that's the thing that's in me. I notice myself getting better at this,&quot; Carlin continued.

In Puerto Rico, the [[Casals Festival]] is still celebrated annually. There is also a museum dedicated to the life of Casals located in [[Old San Juan]]. On 3 October 2009, [[Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center#Casals|Sala Sinfónica Pau Casals]], a symphony hall named in Casals' honour, opened in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The $34 million building, designed by Rodolfo Fernandez, is the latest addition to the [[Centro de Bellas Artes]] complex. It is the new home of the [[Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra]].

Prades, France is home to another Pablo Casals Museum located inside the public library. Many of the artist's memorabilia and precious documents are there: photos, concert outfits, authentic letters, original scores of the Pessebre, interview soundtracks, films, paintings, a cello, and his first piano.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tourism-occitanie.co.uk/pablo-casals-museum/prades]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tokyo, the [[Casals Hall]] opened in 1987 as a venue for chamber music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nagata.co.jp/e_sakuhin/factsheets/casals.pdf |title=Casals Hall |publisher=[[Nagata Acoustics]] |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pau Casals Elementary School in Chicago is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.edu/Schools/Pages/school.aspx?id=610021 &quot;Pablo Casals Elementary School&quot;] [[Chicago Public Schools]]. Retrieved 28 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; I.S. 181 in the Bronx is also named after Casals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/11/X181/AboutUs/MapsAndDirections/default.htm|title=Directions - I.S. 181 Pablo Casals - X181 - New York City Department of Education|website=schools.nyc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casals' [[motet]] ''{{Lang|la|O vos omnes}}'', composed in 1932, is frequently performed today.

In [[Pablo Larraín]]'s 2016 film ''[[Jackie (2016 film)|Jackie]]'', Casals is played by [[Roland Pidoux]].

In 2019, Casal's album ''Bach Six Cello Suites'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Travis M. |date=20 March 2019 |title=Jay-Z, a speech by Sen.

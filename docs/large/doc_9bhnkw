'''Flavius Phocas''' ({{lang-el|Φωκᾶς}}; 547{{spnd}}5 October 610) was [[Eastern Roman emperor]] from 602 to 610. The early life of Phocas is largely unknown, but he rose to prominence in 602, as a leader in the revolt against Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]. Phocas captured [[Constantinople]] and overthrew Maurice on 23 November 602, and declared himself emperor on the same day. Phocas deeply mistrusted the elite of Constantinople, and therefore installed his relatives in high military positions, and brutally purged his opponents. Phocas was an incompetent leader, both of the administration and army, and under him the Byzantine Empire was threatened by multiple enemies, with frequent raids in the Balkans from the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]], and a [[Sassanid]] [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|invasion of the eastern provinces]]. Because of Phocas' incompetence and brutality, the [[Exarch of Africa]], [[Heraclius the Elder]], rebelled against him. Heraclius the Elder's son, [[Heraclius]], succeeded in taking Constantinople on 5 October 610, and executed Phocas on the same day, before declaring himself the emperor.

==Life==
===Early life===
Phocas was probably born in 547, as he was said to be aged 55 when he became emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire|''PLRE'']] 3B p. 1030&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family were likely of [[Illyro-Roman]] origin.&lt;ref name=Bury197&gt;{{cite book | last=Bury | first=John Bagnell | authorlink=J.B. Bury | title=History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene| volume=II | year=2009 | origyear=1889 | publisher=Cosimo, Inc. | isbn=978-1-60520-405-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Phocas before his usurpation of the Byzantine Empire's throne is obscure, but it is known that he served as a low-ranking officer under Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]].

===Usurpation===
In 602, the Byzantine army rebelled against [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]], largely due to exhaustion and outrage over orders to continue campaigning north of the Danube in winter as well as previous cuts in wages. The army declared Phocas, by then a [[centurion]], to be the new emperor, raising him on a shield (the traditional method of declaring emperors) on 23 November 602.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2017|p=890}}{{sfn|Carr|2015|p=79}}

Phocas was crowned the new emperor by the patriarch in the church of St John the Baptist at the [[Bakırköy#History|Hebdomon]]. Several days afterwards he entered Constantinople unopposed. 

Maurice fled the city with his sons, [[Theodosius (son of Maurice)|Theodosius]] and [[Tiberius (son of Maurice)|Tiberius]], but they were soon after captured and executed. Maurice's wife and daughters were put in the monastery of Nea Metanoia and later killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot;&gt;Ekonomou, Andrew. ''Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes.'' Lexington books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign conflict===
Despite the executions of the previous emperor and his dynastic successors, Phocas remained in a precarious position, which led him to devote his energy to purging enemies and destroying conspiracies. Because of this focus, and the local resistance he faced all throughout the Byzantine Empire, he was unable to confront foreign attacks on the empire's frontiers. The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] launched numerous raids into the Balkan provinces of the Byzantine Empire, and the [[Sassanian Empire]] launched [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|an invasion of the eastern provinces]] of the empire.

The Avars were able to take all land in the Balkans north of Thessalonica. The populations of Christian cities were slaughtered or captured. The Byzantines transferred most of their forces to the eastern front due to the threat from the Persians. 

The Sassanid Persians had formerly been at peace with Maurice as a result of a treaty they made with him in 591. After Phocas usurped and killed Maurice, the Persians invaded the empire in 603. {{sfn|Kleinhenz|2017|p=890}} The Sassanids rapidly occupied the eastern provinces, leading the ''[[Magister militum per Orientem]]'', [[Narses (general under Maurice)|Narses]], to defect to their side. Phocas swiftly dealt with him, by inviting him to Constantinople under the promise of safe conduct, then having him burnt alive when he arrived. By 607, the Sassanids had occupied [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]], and much of [[Byzantine Anatolia|Asia Minor]], as far as the [[Bosphorus]].{{sfn|Carr|2015|p=80}}

By the time his reign ended in 610, the Persians had already crossed the Euphrates and taken Zenobia. Contemporary accounts describe the Persians as being very brutal to the occupied population. The 'miracle of St Demetrios' described the carnage: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he devil raised the whirlwind of hatred in all the East, Cilicia, Asia, Palestine and all the lands from there to Constantinople: the factions, no longer content simply to spill blood in public places, attacked homes, slaughtered women, children, the aged, and the young who were sick; those whose youth and frailty impeded their escape from the massacre, [saw] their friends, acquaintances, and parents pillaged, and after all that, even set on fire so that the most wretched inhabitant was not able to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:RomaForoRomanoColonnaFoca2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The [[Column of Phocas]] in Rome]]

===Administration ===
Phocas was an incompetent administrator, who was unable to control either the state or the army effectively.{{Sfn|Parnell|2016|p=6}} Due to his distrust of the bulk of Constantinople's elite, with whom he had had no connection before becoming emperor, Phocas practised nepotism, frequently filling senior military positions with his relatives. He installed: his brother [[Domentziolus (brother of Phocas)|Domentziolus]] as ''[[Magister officiorum]]'' in 603; his nephew [[Domentziolus (nephew of Phocas)|Domentziolus]] as ''Magister militum per Orientem'' in 604, giving him command over the eastern provinces; and his brother [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]] as ''Magister militum per Orientem'' around 610. All three remained loyal to Phocas until they were killed by Heraclius.{{Sfn|Parnell|2016|p=136}} Of the three known male blood-relatives of Phocas, all three were appointed to senior posts, two in military positions and one in an administrative position. Phocas also appointed [[Priscus (magister militum)|Priscus]], who was his son-in-law by way of his marriage to Phocas' daughter [[Domentzia]], as ''[[Comes excubitorum]]'', the captain of the [[Excubitors]], in 603.{{Sfn|Parnell|2016|p=137}}

===Italian policy===
When Phocas was Emperor, Byzantine Italy was under continual attack from [[Lombards]], but the Byzantine government spent few resources to aid Italy due to troubles elsewhere. In the entirety of Phocas' reign the only public structure built with government money in the city of Rome was a statue of Phocas completed in 608.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot; /&gt;

When Phocas usurped Maurice, [[Gregory the Great]] was bishop of Rome and he praised Phocas as a restorer of liberty. Gregory referred to him as a pious and clement lord, and compared his wife (the new Empress) Leontia to Marcian's consort Pulcheria (whom the Council of Chalcedon called the new Helena). In May 603, portraits of the imperial couple arrived in Rome and were ordered by the pope to be placed in the oratory of St Caesarius in the imperial palace on the Palatine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot; /&gt;
[[File:The deposition of Phocas 610 AD.jpg|thumb|The deposition of Phocas 610 AD.]]
Imperial approval was needed in that time to appoint a new pope, but the approval was delayed by a year upon the death of Pope Sabinian in 606, as Phocas was occupied with killing internal enemies that threatened his rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot; /&gt; He finally gave approval in 607 and [[Boniface III]] became pope. Phocas declared Rome &quot;the head of all churches&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ekonomou&quot; /&gt; Shortly afterwards, Phocas had  a gilded statue of himself erected on a [[Roman triumphal column|monumental column]] in the [[Roman Forum]], known as the [[Column of Phocas]].
[[File:41-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|Miniature 41 from the [[Constantine Manasses]] Chronicle, 14 century: Usurper Phocas and the assault against him from the armies of Heraclius.]]

===Downfall===
{{also|Heraclian revolt}}
Despite being appointed as ''Comes excubitorum'', Priscus was not loyal to Phocas, and in 608 he appealed to [[Heraclius the Elder]], the [[Exarch of Carthage]], to rebel against Phocas.{{Sfn|Parnell|2016|p=137}} Heraclius the Elder agreed, and began to prepare to invade, by cutting off the supply of grain to Constantinople and assembling a large army and navy. Heraclius the Elder launched his invasion in 609, with his cousin, [[Nicetas (cousin of Heraclius)|Nicetas]], marching troops overland to the capital, and his son, [[Heraclius]], leading a naval invasion of [[Thessalonica]], before marching to Constantinople. Heraclius arrived outside Constantinople on 3 October 610, and seized the city on 5 October. Heraclius was declared emperor on the same day, and swiftly had Phocas executed.{{sfn|Carr|2015|p=81}}

== Legacy ==
Phocas is generally depicted as a villain by Byzantine and modern historians alike, but some of the earliest sources available about Phocas’ reign were written during the reign of Heraclius.  The writings that survive aren't reliably neutral and the writers would have good reason to demonize him in order to strengthen the rule of Heraclius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roman-emperors.org/phocas.htm|title=Phocas|last=Kevin|first=Crow|date=2002|website=De Imperatoribus Romanis|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the cultural sphere, the reign of Phocas is marked by the change of Imperial fashion set by [[Constantine the Great]].  Constantine and all his successors, except [[Julian the Apostate]], were beardless.  Phocas again introduced the wearing of the [[beard]].  This fashion lasted until the end of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byzantium.xronikon.com/statfirst.html |title=Byzantine first &amp; last times |publisher=Byzantium.xronikon.com |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In calling the Pope the &quot;head of all churches&quot;, Phocas' decree has been important in discussions about [[papal primacy]] and [[papal supremacy]]. Some Protestant [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist]] commentators have seen the decree of Phocas (usually taken to be in 606) as having eschatological significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newsom |first1=Carol A. |authorlink1=Carol A. Newsom |title=Daniel: A Commentary |date=2014 |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |page=317 |isbn=9781611645392 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ha51BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA317 |accessdate=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his ''[[Horae Apocalypticae]]'', [[Edward Bishop Elliott]] took the [[1260 days]] of [[Revelation 11]]:3 to be the period between 606 and the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1866.

'''Elizabeth Petrovna''' ({{lang-ru|Елизаве́та (Елисаве́та) Петро́вна}}) ({{OldStyleDate|29 December|1709|18 December}}{{snd}}{{OldStyleDate|5 January 1762||25 December 1761}}), also known as '''Yelisaveta''' or '''Elizaveta''', was the [[Empress of Russia]] from 1741 until her death in 1762. She remains one of the most popular [[List of Russian rulers|Russian monarchs]] because of her decision not to execute a single person during her reign, her numerous [[construction]] projects, and her strong opposition to [[Prussia]]n policies.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=105}}

The second eldest daughter of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], Elizabeth lived under the confused successions of her father's descendants since her half-brother Alexei's death. The throne was first passed to her nephew [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], who died in 1730 and was succeeded by her first cousin [[Anna of Russia|Anna]]. After the brief rule of Anna's great-nephew, [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], Elizabeth seized the throne with the military's support and declared her own nephew, the future [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], to be her heir.

During her reign, Elizabeth continued the policies of her father and brought a remarkable [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Russia. Her domestic policies allowed the nobles to gain dominance in local government while shortening their terms of service to the state. She encouraged [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]'s foundation of the [[University of Moscow]], the highest-ranking Russian educational institution. Her court was one of the most splendid in all Europe, especially regarding [[architecture]]: she modernized Russia's [[road]]s, encouraged [[Ivan Shuvalov]]'s foundation of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], and financed grandiose baroque projects of her favourite architect, [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], particularly in [[Peterhof Palace]]. The [[Winter Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]] in Saint Petersburg are among the chief monuments of her reign.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=105}}

Elizabeth led the country during the two major European conflicts of her time: the [[War of Austrian Succession]] (1740–48) and the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). She and diplomat [[Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]] solved the first event by forming an alliance with Austria and France, but indirectly caused the second. Russia enjoyed several victories against Prussia and briefly occupied [[Berlin]], but when [[Frederick the Great]] was finally prepared to surrender in January 1761 (1762?), the message was sent only to find the Empress dead.

==Early life==
===Childhood and teenage years===
[[File:Elizabeth of Russia in youth (1720s, Russian museum).jpg|thumb|Young Elizabeth in the 1720s, painted by [[Ivan Nikitich Nikitin]].]]
Elizabeth was born at [[Kolomenskoye]], near [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], on 18 December 1709 ([[Julian calendar|O.S.]]). Her parents were [[Peter the Great]], [[Tsar]] of Russia and [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]].{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=104}} Catherine was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński, a subject of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the [[Old Trinity Cathedral|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] in [[St. Petersburg]] at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=46}} Their official marriage was at [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[St. Petersburg]] on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple ([[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia|Anna]] and Elizabeth) were legitimized by their father{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=46}} and given the title of [[Tsarevna]] (&quot;[[princess]]&quot;) on 6 March 1711.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=104}} Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=50}} They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince [[Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Petrovich]], who was Peter's son by his first wife, noblewoman [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]].

As a child, Elizabeth was the favorite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=23}} Even though he adored his daughter, Peter didn't devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) from his first marriage to a noblewoman and didn't anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which no woman had ever sat upon at that point in time. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls as best she could, but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. 
Still, Elizabeth was a bright girl, if not brilliant{{sfn|Bain|1911|p=283}} and had a French governess who gave lessons of [[mathematics]], arts, [languages, and sports. She grew interested in [[architecture]], became fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], turned to be an excellent dancer and rider.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=104}} Like her father, she was physically active and loved [[horseriding]], [[hunting]], [[Sledding|sledging]], [[Ice skating|skating]], and [[gardening]].{{sfn|Cowles|1971|p=66}} From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary vivacity and was regarded as the leading beauty of the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=104}} The wife of the British ambassador described Grand Duchess Elizabeth as &quot;fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay, and talks to everyone...&quot;{{sfn|Cowles|1971|pp=66–67}}

===Marriage plans===
[[File:Alexei Grigorievich Razumovskiy.PNG|thumb|190px|Elizabeth probably secretly married [[Alexei Razumovsky]], a handsome Ukrainian-born chorister.]]
With much of his fame resting on his effective efforts to modernize Russia, Tsar Peter desired to see his children married into the royal houses of Europe, something which his predecessors had consciously avoided. His heir was born of his first marriage to a noblewoman and had no problem securing a bride from the ancient house of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. However, he was hard put to arrange similar marriages for the daughters born of his second wife. When Peter offered either of his daughters in marriage to the future [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], he was snubbed by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]s of [[France]] because of their post-facto legitimization.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=50}}

In 1724, Peter betrothed his daughters to two young princes, first cousins to each other, who hailed from the tiny north German principality of [[Holstein-Gottorp]] and whose family was undergoing a period of political and economic stress. Anna Petrovna (aged 16) was to marry [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]], who was then living in exile in Russia as Peter's guest after having failed in his attempt to succeed [[Charles XII of Sweden|his maternal uncle]] as King of Sweden and whose patrimony was at that time under Danish occupation.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=50}} Despite all this, the prince was of impeccable birth and well-connected to many royal houses; it was a respectable and politically useful alliance.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=58}} In the same year, Elizabeth was betrothed to marry Charles Frederick's first cousin, Charles Augustus of [[Holstein-Gottorp]],{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=58}} the eldest son of [[Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin|Christian Augustus, Prince of Eutin]]. Her sister's wedding was held in 1725 as planned, even though their father died a few weeks before the nuptials. In  her case, however, her fiancé died on 31 May 1727, before the wedding could be celebrated. This came as a double blow to Elizabeth, because her mother (who had ascended to the throne) had died just two weeks previously, on 17 May 1727.

By the end of May 1727, 17-year-old Elizabeth had lost her fiancé and both of her parents. Furthermore, her half-nephew [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] was on the throne. Her marriage prospects didn't improve three years later, when her nephew died and was succeeded by her first cousin [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], daughter of [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]]. There was little love lost between the cousins and no prospect of either any Russian nobleman or any foreign prince seeking Elizabeth's hand in marriage. Nor could she marry a commoner because it would cost  her royal status, property rights and claim to the throne.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=59}} The fact that Elizabeth was something of a beauty didn't bring her any advantage in marriage prospects; but instead earned her resentment. When the Chinese minister in St. Petersburg was asked by the Empress Anna who was the most beautiful woman at her court, he pointed to Elizabeth, much to Anna's displeasure.{{sfn|Cowles|1971|p=67}}

Elizabeth's response to the lack of marriage prospects was to take Alexis Shubin, a handsome sergeant in the [[Semyonovsky Guards regiment]], as her lover. When Empress Anna found out about this, she had Shubin's tongue cut off and banished him to [[Siberia]]. After consoling herself, Elizabeth turned to handsome coachmen and footmen for her sexual pleasure.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=59}} She eventually found a long-term companion in [[Aleksey Grigorievich Razumovsky|Alexis Razumovsky]], a kind-hearted and handsome [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] peasant [[serf]] with a good [[Bass (voice type)|bass voice]]. Razumovsky had been brought from his village to [[St. Petersburg]] by a nobleman to sing for a church choir until the Grand Duchess purchased the talented serf from the nobleman for her own choir. A simple-minded man, Razumovsky never showed interest in affairs of state during all the years of his relationship with Elizabeth, which spanned from the days of her obscurity to the height of her power. As the couple was devoted to each other, there is reason to believe that they might even have married in a secret ceremony. In 1742, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] made Razumovsky a [[Count]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1756, Elizabeth made him a [[Prince]] and [[Field Marshal]].{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=59}}

==Imperial Coup==
[[File:Elizabeth at Preobrazhensky quarter by Lansere.jpg|thumb|The [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] soldiers proclaim Elizabeth as Empress of Russia.]]

While [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] remained in power (until September 1727), the government of Elizabeth's adolescent nephew [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] (reigned 1727–1730) treated her with liberality and distinction. However, the [[House of Dolgorukov|Dolgorukov]]s, an ancient [[boyar]] family, deeply resented Menshikov. With Peter II's attachment to Prince Ivan Dolgorukov and two of their family members on the Supreme State Council, they had the leverage for a successful {{lang|fr|coup}}. Menshikov was arrested, stripped of all his honours and properties, and exiled to northern [[Siberia]], where he died in November 1729.{{sfn|Coughlan|1974|p=52}} The Dolgorukovs hated the memory of Peter the Great and practically banished his daughter from Court.{{sfn|Bain|1911|pp=283–284}}

During the reign of her cousin [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] (1730–1740), Elizabeth was gathering support in the background. Being the daughter of Peter the Great, she enjoyed much support from the Russian guards regiments. She often visited the elite Guards regiments, marking special events with the officers and acting as godmother to their children. After the death of Empress Anna, the regency of [[Anna Leopoldovna]] for the infant [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]] was marked by high taxes and economic problems. {{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=105}} The French ambassador in St. Petersburg, [[Jacques-Joachim Trotti, marquis de La Chétardie|the marquis de La Chétardie]] was deeply involved in planning a coup to depose the regent, whose foreign policy was opposed to the interests of France, and bribed numerous officers in the Imperial Guard to support Elizabeth's coup.{{sfn|Cowles|1971|pp=67–68}} The French adventurer [[Count Lestocq]] helped her actions according to the advice of the marquis de La Chétardie and the Swedish ambassador, who were particularly interested in toppling the regime of Anna Leopoldovna.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=105}} 

On the night of 25 November 1741 (O.S.), Elizabeth seized power with the help of the [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]].  Arriving at the regimental headquarters wearing a warrior's metal breastplate over her dress and grasping a silver cross, she challenged them:  &quot;Whom do you want to serve:  me, your natural sovereign, or those who have stolen my inheritance?&quot; Won over, the regiment marched to the [[Winter Palace]] and arrested the infant Emperor, his parents, and their own lieutenant-colonel, Count Burkhard Christoph von Munnich. It was a daring coup and, amazingly, succeeded without bloodshed. Elizabeth had vowed that if she became Empress, she would not sign a single death sentence, an extraordinary promise at the time but one that she kept throughout her life.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=105}} 

Despite Elizabeth's promise, there was still cruelty in her regime. Although she initially thought of allowing the young tsar and his mother to leave Russia, she imprisoned them later in a [[Shlisselburg Fortress]], worried that they would stir up trouble for her in other parts of Europe.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=268}} Fearing a coup on Ivan's favour, Elizabeth set about destroying all papers, coins or anything else depicting or mentioning Ivan. She had issued an order that if any attempt were made for the adult Ivan to escape, he was to be eliminated. [[Catherine the Great]] upheld the order, and when an attempt was made, he was killed and secretly buried within the fortress.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=103}}

Another case was Countess [[Natalia Lopukhina]]. The circumstances of Elizabeth's birth would later be used by her political opponents to challenge her right to the throne on grounds of illegitimacy. When 
Countess Lopukhina's son, Ivan Lopukhin, complained of Elizabeth in a tavern, he implicated his mother, himself and others in a plot to reinstate Ivan VI as tsar. Ivan Lopukhin was overheard and tortured for information, with all of those implicated sentenced to death except for the women. Instead, the latter would have their tongues removed and would be publicly flogged.{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2016|p=269}}

==Reign==
[[File:Coronation-Procession Elisabeth by Ivan Sokolow.JPG|thumb|Coronation procession of Empress Elizabeth, Moscow 1742]]
Elizabeth crowned herself Empress in the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]] on 25 April 1742 (O.S.), which would become standard for all emperors of Russia until 1896. At the age of thirty-three, with relatively little political experience, she found herself at the head of a great empire at one of the most critical periods of its existence. Her proclamation explained that the preceding reigns had led Russia to ruin: &quot;The Russian people have been groaning under the enemies of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith, but she has delivered them from the degrading foreign oppression.&quot;
Russia had been under the domination of [[Germans|German]] advisers, so its Empress exiled the most unpopular of them, including [[Heinrich Ostermann]], [[Burkhard von Munnich]] and Carl Gustav Lowenwolde.{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=106}} She passed down several pieces of legislation that undid much of the work her father had done to limit the power of the church.{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=149}}, while still limiting its influence.

With all her shortcomings (documents often waited months for her signature),{{sfn|Antonov|2006|p=107}}, Elizabeth had inherited her father's genius for government. Her usually keen judgment and her diplomatic tact again and again recalled Peter the Great. What sometimes appeared as irresolution and procrastination was most often a wise suspension of judgment under exceptionally difficult circumstances. From the Russian point of view, her greatness as a stateswoman consisted of her steady appreciation of national interests and her determination to promote them against all obstacles.

===Educational reforms===

Despite the substantial changes made by Peter the Great, he hadn't exercised a really formative influence on the intellectual attitudes of the ruling classes as a whole. Although Elizabeth lacked the early education necessary to flourish as an intellectual (once finding the reading of secular literature to be &quot;injurious to health&quot;),{{sfn|Bain|1899|p=137}} she was clever enough to know its benefits and made considerable groundwork for her eventual successor, Catherine the Great.{{sfn|Hoetzsch|1966|p=83}} She made education freely available to all social classes (except for [[serfs]]), encouraged establishment of the very first [[University of Moscow|university in Russia founded in Moscow]] by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], and helped to finance the establishment of the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]].

===Internal peace===
[[File:Imperial Monogram of Empress Elizabeth I of Russia.svg|thumb|100px|Imperial monogram, often present in peace treaties.]]
A gifted diplomant, Elizabeth hated bloodshed and conflict and went to great lengths to alter the Russian system of punishment, even outlawing [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Talbot Rice|1970|p=150}} According to historian [[Robert Nisbet Bain]], it was one of her &quot;chief glories that, so far as she was able, she put a stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anne and Ivan VI, and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia.&quot;{{sfn|Bain|1899|p=142}}

==Command structure==
===Organization===
Buchenwald’s first commandant was SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Karl-Otto Koch]], who ran the camp from 1 August 1937 to July 1941. His second wife, [[Ilse Koch]], became notorious as ''Die Hexe von Buchenwald'' (&quot;the witch of Buchenwald&quot;) for her cruelty and brutality. In February 1940 Koch had an indoor riding hall built by the prisoners who died by the dozen due to the harsh conditions of the construction site. The hall was built inside the camp, near the canteen, so that oftentimes Ilse Koch could be seen riding in the morning to the beat of the prisoner orchestra.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=198}} Koch himself was eventually imprisoned at Buchenwald by the Nazi authorities for incitement to murder. The charges were lodged by [[Josias, Hereditary Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Prince Waldeck]] and [[Georg Konrad Morgen|Dr. Morgen]], to which were later added charges of [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[embezzlement]], [[Underground economy|black market]] dealings, and exploitation of the camp workers for personal gain.{{sfn|Hackett|1997|p=341}} Other camp officials were charged, including Ilse Koch. The trial resulted in Karl Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS; he was executed by firing squad on April 5, 1945, one week before American troops arrived. [[Ilse Koch]] was sentenced to a term of four years' imprisonment after the war. Her sentence was reduced to two years and she was set free. She was subsequently arrested again and sentenced to life imprisonment by the post-war German authorities; she committed suicide in [[Aichach]] (Bavaria) prison in September 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett 1997, p. 43 n.19&lt;/ref&gt; The second commandant of the camp, between 1942 and 1945, was [[Hermann Pister]] (1942–1945). He was tried in 1947 ([[Dachau Trials]]) and sentenced to death, but on 28 September 1948 he died in [[Landsberg Prison]] of a heart attack before the sentence could be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett 1997, p. 59 n.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female prisoners and overseers===
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}
The number of women held in Buchenwald was somewhere between 500 and 1,000. The first female inmates were twenty political prisoners who were accompanied by a [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|female SS guard (''Aufseherin'')]]; these women were brought to Buchenwald from [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] in 1941 and forced into sexual slavery at the camp's [[brothel]]. The SS later fired the SS woman on duty in the brothel for corruption; her position was taken over by “brothel mothers” as ordered by SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]].

The majority of women prisoners, however, arrived in 1944 and 1945 from other camps, mainly [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen]]. Only one barracks was set aside for them; this was overseen by the female block leader (''Blockführerin'') Franziska Hoengesberg, who came from Essen when it was evacuated. All the women prisoners were later shipped out to one of Buchenwald's many female satellite camps in [[Sömmerda]], [[Buttelstedt]], [[Mühlhausen]], [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Essen]], [[Lippstadt]], [[Weimar]], [[Magdeburg]], and [[Penig]], to name a few. No female guards were permanently stationed at Buchenwald.

[[Ilse Koch]] served as head supervisor (''Oberaufseherin'') of 22 other female guards and hundreds of women prisoners in the main camp. More than 530 women served as guards in the vast Buchenwald system of subcamps and external commands across Germany. Only 22 women served/trained in Buchenwald, compared to over 15,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Harry |editor-last=Gedenkstatte Buchenwald |year=2005 |title=Buchenwald concentration camp 1937–1945 (A Guide to the Permanent Historical Exhibition) |publisher=Wallstein |isbn=978-3-89244-695-8 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subcamps===
{{main|List of subcamps of Buchenwald}}
The first subcamps of Buchenwald were established in 1941 so that the prisoners could work in nearby SS industries. In 1942, the SS began to use its forced labor supply for armaments production. Because it was more economical to rent out prisoners to private firms, subcamps were set up near factories which had a demand for prisoner labor. Private firms paid the SS between 4 and 6 Reichsmarks per day per prisoner, resulting in an estimated 95,758,843 Reichsmarks in revenue for the SS between June 1943 and February 1945.{{sfn|Zanden|2009|p=297}} There were 136 subcamps in all.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.holocaust.org.uk/buchenwald&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were worse than at the main camp, with prisoners provided insufficient food and inadequate shelter.{{sfn|Zanden|2009|p=298}}

==Allied POWs==
{{main|Allied airmen at Buchenwald concentration camp}}

Although it was highly unusual for German authorities to send [[Allies of World War II|Western Allied]] POWs to concentration camps, Buchenwald held a group of [[KLB Club|168 aviators]] for two months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/secondwar/fact_sheets/pow Veterans Affairs Canada, 2006: &quot;Prisoners of War in the Second World War&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625165353/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history%2Fsecondwar%2Ffact_sheets%2Fpow |date=25 June 2009 }} Accessed 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These men were from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica. They all arrived at Buchenwald on August 20, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140223114725/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1575 National Museum of the USAF: &quot;Allied Victims of the Holocaust&quot;] Accessed 9 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;buchenwaldflyboy.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buchenwaldflyboy.wordpress.com |title=Eyewitness accounts of Art Kinnis, president of KLB (Konzentrationslager Buchenwald), and 2nd Lt. Joseph Moser, one of the surviving pilots|website=www.buchenwaldflyboy.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these airmen were in aircraft that had crashed in [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]]. Two explanations are given for them being sent to a concentration camp: first, that they had managed to make contact with the [[French Resistance]], some were disguised as civilians, and they were carrying false papers when caught; they were therefore categorized by the Germans as [[espionage|spies]], which meant their rights under the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] were not respected. The second explanation is that they had been categorised as ''[[Terror bombing|Terrorflieger]]'' (&quot;terror aviators&quot;). The aviators were initially held in Gestapo prisons and headquarters in France. In April or August 1944, they and other Gestapo prisoners were packed into [[covered goods wagon]]s (US: boxcars) and sent to Buchenwald. The journey took five days, during which they received very little food or water.&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Lucky Ones: Allied Airmen and Buchenwald'' (1994 film, directed by Michael Allder), cited by [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/secondwar/fact_sheets/pow Veterans Affairs Canada, 2006: &quot;Prisoners of War in the Second World War&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625165353/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history%2Fsecondwar%2Ffact_sheets%2Fpow |date=25 June 2009 }} Accessed 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death toll==

===Causes of death===
[[File:Buchenwald Executions 13143.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|On 26 April 1942, twenty Polish prisoners were hanged in retaliation for the killing of a German overseer. Pictured awaiting execution.]]
A primary cause of death was illness due to harsh camp conditions, with starvation—and its consequent illnesses—prevalent. Malnourished and suffering from disease, many were literally &quot;worked to death&quot; under the ''Vernichtung durch Arbeit'' policy ([[extermination through labor]]), as inmates only had the choice between slave labor or inevitable execution. Many inmates died as a result of [[Nazi human experimentation|human experimentation]] or fell victim to arbitrary acts perpetrated by the SS guards. Other prisoners were simply murdered, primarily by shooting and hanging.

[[Martin Sommer|Walter Gerhard Martin Sommer]] was an SS-''Hauptscharführer'' who served as a guard at the concentration camps of Dachau and Buchenwald. Known as the &quot;Hangman of Buchenwald&quot;, he was considered a depraved sadist who reportedly ordered Otto Neururer and Mathias Spannlang, two Austrian priests, to be [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]]. Sommer was especially infamous for hanging prisoners off of trees from their wrists, which had been tied behind their backs (a torture technique known as [[strappado]]) in the &quot;singing forest&quot;, so named because of the screams which emanated from this wooded area.&lt;ref&gt;The resistance in Austria, 1938–1945 By Radomír Luža Publisher: University of Minnesota Press (April 9, 1984) {{ISBN|0-8166-1226-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Stein|2005|p=302}}

[[Summary execution]]s of Soviet POWs were also carried out at Buchenwald. At least 1,000 men were selected in 1941–42 by a task force of three [[Dresden]] [[Gestapo]] officers and sent to the camp for immediate liquidation by a gunshot to the back of the neck, the infamous ''Genickschuss''.

The camp was also a site of large-scale trials for [[vaccine]]s against [[Typhus|epidemic typhus]] in 1942 and 1943. In all 729 inmates were used as test subjects, of whom 154 died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spitz |first=Vivien |year=2005 |title=Doctors from Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans |publisher=Sentient Publications |isbn=978-1-59181-032-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/doctorsfromhellh00spit/page/199 199] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/doctorsfromhellh00spit/page/199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other &quot;experimentation&quot; occurred at Buchenwald on a smaller scale. One such experiment aimed at determining the precise fatal dose of a poison of the [[alkaloid]] group; according to the testimony of one doctor, four Soviet POWs were administered the poison, and when it proved not to be fatal they were &quot;strangled in the crematorium&quot; and subsequently &quot;dissected&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz 2005, pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt; Among various other experiments was one which, in order to test the effectiveness of a balm for wounds from [[incendiary bomb]]s, involved inflicting &quot;very severe&quot; [[white phosphorus]] burns on inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz 2005, pp. 213–4&lt;/ref&gt; When challenged at trial over the nature of this testing, and particularly over the fact that the testing was designed in some cases to cause death and only to measure the time which elapsed until death was caused, one Nazi doctor's defence was that, although a doctor, he was a &quot;legally appointed executioner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz 2005, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of deaths===
{{Main|Number of deaths in Buchenwald}}
[[File:German atrocities. Germany, Poland &amp;amp; Czechoslovakia - NARA - 292596.jpg|thumb|left|Corpses found in the camp after liberation]]
The SS left behind accounts of the number of prisoners and people coming to and leaving the camp, categorizing those leaving them by release, transfer, or death. These accounts are one of the sources of estimates for the number of deaths in Buchenwald. According to SS documents, 33,462 died. These documents were not, however, necessarily accurate: Among those executed before 1944, many were listed as &quot;transferred to the Gestapo&quot;. Furthermore, from 1941, Soviet POWs were executed in mass killings. Arriving prisoners selected for execution were not entered into the camp register and therefore were not among the 33,462 dead listed.{{sfn|Bartel|1961|p=. 64, lines 12–23}}

One former Buchenwald prisoner, Armin Walter, calculated the number of executions by the number of shootings in the spine at the base of the head. His job at Buchenwald was to set up and care for a radio installation at the facility where people were executed; he counted the numbers, which arrived by telex, and hid the information. He says that 8,483 Soviet prisoners of war were shot in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Bartel 1961, p. 203, lines 18–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the same source, the total [[Number of deaths in Buchenwald|number of deaths at Buchenwald]] is estimated at 56,545. This number is the sum of:
* Deaths according to material left behind by the SS: 33,462&lt;ref&gt;Includes male deaths in satellite camps.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Executions by shooting: 8,483
* Executions by hanging (estimate): 1,100
* Deaths during&lt;!--NOT &quot;at&quot;--&gt; evacuation transports (estimate): 13,500&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1961|loc=p. 87, line 17–18}} reports that somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 prisoners died on evacuation transports in March and April 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

This total (56,545) corresponds to a death rate of 24 percent, assuming that the number of persons passing through the camp according to documents left by the SS, 240,000 prisoners, is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Bartel 1960, p. 87, line 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberation==
[[File:Concentration_camp_SS.jpg|thumb|Prisoner of KZ Buchenwald with [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|member of SS personnel]] after entry of U.S. Army 1945.]]
[[Image:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] (D-Kentucky) looks on after Buchenwald's liberation.]]
On April 4, 1945, the [[89th Division (United States)|U.S. 89th Infantry Division]] overran [[Ohrdruf forced labor camp|Ohrdruf]], a subcamp of Buchenwald.

Buchenwald was partially evacuated by the Germans from April 6, 1945, until April 11, 1945. In the days before the arrival of the American army, thousands of the prisoners were forced to join the evacuation marches.{{sfn|Stein|2005|loc=p. 227 &quot;Evacuation&quot;}}
Thanks in large part to the efforts of Polish engineer (and [[Shortwave radio|short-wave]] [[Amateur radio operator|radio-amateur]], his pre-war callsign was SP2BD) Gwidon Damazyn, an inmate since March 1941, a secret short-wave transmitter and small generator were built and hidden in the prisoners' movie room. On April 8 at noon, Damazyn and Russian prisoner Konstantin Ivanovich Leonov sent the [[Morse code]] message prepared by leaders of the prisoners' underground resistance (supposedly [[Walter Bartel]] and Harry Kuhn):

{{Quote|text=To the Allies. To the army of [[George S. Patton|General Patton]]. This is the Buchenwald concentration camp. SOS. We request help. They want to evacuate us. The SS wants to destroy us.}}

The text was repeated several times in English, German, and Russian. Damazyn sent the English and German transmissions, while Leonov sent the Russian version. Three minutes after the last transmission sent by Damazyn, the headquarters of the [[Third United States Army|U.S. Third Army]] responded:

{{Quote|text=KZ Bu. Hold out. Rushing to your aid. Staff of Third Army.}}
[[File:Buchenwald-J-Rouard-25.jpg|thumb|Interior of the barracks, pictured after liberation by {{ill|Jules Rouard|fr}} on April 16, 1945.]]
According to Teofil Witek, a fellow Polish prisoner who witnessed the transmissions, Damazyn fainted after receiving the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langbein|first1=Hermann|title=Against All Hope: Resistance in the Nazi Concentration Camps, 1938–1945|year=1994|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|isbn=1-55778-363-2|page=502|first2=Harry (translator)|last2=Zohn|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this news had been received, inmates stormed the watchtowers and killed the remaining guards, using arms they had been collecting since 1942 (one machine gun and 91 rifles; see [[Buchenwald Resistance]]).&lt;ref&gt;Several eyewitness reports of Dutch and German inmates of Buchenwald at the Dutch Institute for War Documentation NIOD in Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portão de entrada Buchenwald.jpg|thumb|3:15 p.m. is the permanent time of the clock at the entrance gate]]

As American forces closed in, Gestapo headquarters at Weimar telephoned the camp administration to announce that it was sending explosives to blow up any evidence of the camp, including its inmates. The Gestapo did not know that the administrators had already fled. A prisoner answered the phone and informed headquarters that explosives would not be needed, as the camp had already been blown up, which was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Best |first1=Brian |title=Reporting the Second World War |date=2015 |publisher=Casemate Publishers |isbn=9781473870666 |pages=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWHNDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT234 |accessdate=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detachment of troops of the U.S. 9th Armored Infantry Battalion, from the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]], part of the [[Third United States Army|U.S. Third Army]], and under the command of [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] Frederic Keffer, arrived at Buchenwald on April 11, 1945 at 3:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[:pt:Buchenwald#/media/Ficheiro:Portão de entrada Buchenwald.jpg|now the permanent time of the clock at the entrance gate]]). The soldiers were given a hero's welcome, with the emaciated survivors finding the strength to toss some liberators into the air in celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;liberators&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/buchenwald.liberator/ |title=Buchenwald liberator, American hero dies at 83 |work=CNN |date=August 14, 2008 |author=Wayne Drash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the day, elements of the [[83rd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 83rd Infantry Division]] overran Langenstein, one of a number of smaller camps comprising the Buchenwald complex. There, the division liberated over 21,000 prisoners,&lt;ref name=&quot;liberators&quot;/&gt; ordered the mayor of Langenstein to send food and water to the camp, and hurried medical supplies forward from the 20th Field Hospital.

Third Army Headquarters sent elements of the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] to take control of the camp on the morning of Thursday, April 12, 1945. Several journalists arrived on the same day, perhaps with the 80th, including [[Edward R. Murrow]], whose radio report of his arrival and reception was broadcast on [[CBS]] and became one of his most famous:{{Quote|text=I asked to see one of the barracks. It happened to be occupied by Czechoslovaks. When I entered, men crowded around, tried to lift me to their shoulders. They were too weak. Many of them could not get out of bed. I was told that this building had once stabled 80 horses. There were 1,200 men in it, five to a bunk. The stink was beyond all description.

They called the doctor. We inspected his records. There were only names in the little black book, nothing more. Nothing about who these men were, what they had done, or hoped. Behind the names of those who had died, there was a cross. I counted them. They totaled 242. 242 out of 1,200, in one month.

As we walked out into the courtyard, a man fell dead. Two others, they must have been over 60, were crawling toward the latrine. I saw it, but will not describe it. |author=Extract from [[Edward R.

===Civilian tour===
After Patton toured the camp, he ordered the mayor of Weimar to bring 1,000 citizens to Buchenwald; these were to be predominantly men of military age from the middle and upper classes. The Germans had to walk {{convert|25|km}} roundtrip under armed American guard and were shown the crematorium and other evidence of Nazi atrocities. The Americans wanted to ensure that the German people would [[German collective guilt|take responsibility]] for Nazi crimes, instead of dismissing them as [[atrocity propaganda]].{{sfn|Mauriello|2017|pp=32–34}}  Gen. Dwight Eisenhower also invited two groups of Americans to tour the camp in mid-April 1945; journalists and editors from some of the principal U.S. publications, and then a dozen members of the Congress from both the House and the Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader [[Alben W. Barkley]].

==Aftermath==
===Buchenwald Trial===
{{main|Buchenwald Trial}}
[[File:Ilse Koch testifies in her own defense 8 jul 47.png|thumb|Ilse Koch testifies]]
Thirty SS perpetrators at Buchenwald were tried before a US military tribunal in 1947, including [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] [[Josias Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont]], who oversaw the SS district that Buchenwald was located in, and many of the doctors responsible for Nazi human experimentation. Almost all of the defendants were convicted, and 22 were sentenced to death. However, only nine death sentences were carried out, and by the mid-1950s, all perpetrators had been freed except for [[Ilse Koch]]. Additional perpetrators were tried before German courts during the 1960s.{{sfn|Zegenhagen|2009|pp=293–294}}

===The site===
Between August 1945 and 1 March 1950, Buchenwald was the site of [[NKVD special camp Nr. 2]], where the [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] imprisoned former Nazis and anti-communist dissidents.{{sfn|Marcuse|2010|p=190}} According to Soviet records, 28,455 people were detained, 7,113 of whom died. After the NKVD camp closed, much of the camp was razed, while signs were erected to provide a Soviet interpretation of the camp's legacy.{{sfn|Marcuse|2010|p=200}} The first monument to victims was erected by Buchenwald inmates days after the initial liberation. It was made of wood and only intended to be temporary. A second monument to commemorate the dead was erected in 1958 by the GDR government near the mass graves. Inside the camp, there is a stainless steel monument on the spot where first, temporary monument stood. Its surface is maintained at {{convert|37|C|F}}, the temperature of human skin, all year round.&lt;ref&gt;Young, James E.: ''At Memory's Edge: After-Images of the Holocaust in Contemporary Art and Architecture'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-visits-buchenwald-concentration-camp/|title=Obama Visits Buchenwald Concentration Camp|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the Buchenwald camp site serves as a holocaust memorial.

It is managed by Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, which also looks after the camp memorial at [[Mittelbau-Dora]].&lt;ref name=Foundation&gt;{{cite web|title= Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation – Purpose of the Foundation |url= http://www.buchenwald.de/english/index.php?p=stiftungszweck |publisher= Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Survivors who have written about their camp experiences include [[Jorge Semprún]], who in ''Quel beau dimanche!'' describes conversations involving [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Léon Blum]], and [[Ernst Wiechert]], whose ''Der Totenwald'' was written in 1939 but not published until 1945, and which likewise involved Goethe. Scholars have investigated how camp inmates used art to help deal with their circumstances, and according to [[Theodor Ziolkowski]] writers often did so by turning to Goethe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ziolkowski |first=Theodore |year=2001 |title=Das Treffen in Buchenwald oder Der vergegenwärtigte Goethe |journal=Modern Language Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=131–50 |jstor=3195281 |doi=10.2307/3195281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Léon Delarbre]] sketched, besides other scenes of camp life, the Goethe Oak, under which he used to sit and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=David Fraser|title=John Piper: The Forties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7WuzDK3dSkC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2000|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-0-85667-534-8|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few prisoners who escaped from the camp, the Belgian Edmond Vandievoet, recounted his experiences in a book whose English title is &quot;I escaped from a Nazi Death Camp&quot; [Editions Jourdan, 2015].

'''Tove Marika Jansson''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈtuːve ˈjɑːnson|fi|Sv-Tove_Jansson.ogg}}; 9 August 1914 – 27 June 2001) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking Finn]]ish author, novelist, painter, [[illustrator]] and [[comic strip]] author. Brought up by artistic parents, Jansson studied art from 1930 to 1938 in [[Stockholm]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Paris]]. Her first solo art exhibition was in 1943. At the same time, she was writing short stories and articles for publication, as well as creating the graphics for book covers and other purposes. She continued to work as an artist and a writer for the rest of her life.

Jansson wrote the ''[[Moomins|Moomin]]'' books for children, starting in 1945 with ''[[The Moomins and the Great Flood]]''. The next two books, ''[[Comet in Moominland]]'' and ''[[Finn Family Moomintroll]]'', published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, were highly successful in sales, adding to sales of the first book. For her work as a children's writer she received the [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-jansson/&gt;

Starting with the semi-autobiographical ''Bildhuggarens dotter'' (''Sculptor's Daughter'') in 1968, Jansson wrote six novels, including the admired&lt;ref name=&quot;Westin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF1gAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Sommarboken+Boel+Westin&amp;pg=PT324|title=Tove Jansson - Ord, bild, liv|author=Westin, Boel|publisher=Albert Bonniers|year=2013|isbn=978-9-51-501672-0|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sommarboken'' (''[[The Summer Book]]''), and five books of short stories for adults.

== Early life ==
[[File:Tove Jansson 1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jansson in 1923]]

Tove Jansson was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], [[Russian Empire]]. Her family, part of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] minority of [[Finland]], was an artistic one: her father, [[Viktor Jansson]], was a sculptor, and her mother, [[Signe Hammarsten-Jansson]], was a Swedish-born [[graphic designer]] and illustrator. Tove's siblings also became artists: [[Per Olov Jansson]] became a photographer and [[Lars Jansson (cartoonist)|Lars Jansson]] an author and cartoonist. Whilst their home was in [[Helsinki]], the family spent many of their summers in a rented cottage on an island near [[Porvoo|Borgå]], 50 [[km]] east of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liukkonen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tjansson.htm|title=Tove Jansson|last=Liukkonen|first=Petri|website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi)|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916102623/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tjansson.htm|archivedate=16 September 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jansson studied at [[University College of Arts, Crafts and Design]], in Stockholm in 1930–33, the Graphic School of the [[Academy of Fine Arts (Finland)|Finnish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1933–1937, and finally at L'École d'Adrien Holy and L'[[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris in 1938. She displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 30s and early 40s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943.

At age 14, Jansson wrote and illustrated her first picture book &quot;Sara och Pelle och [[Neck (water spirit)|näck]]ens [[Cephalopod|bläckfisk]]ar&quot; (&quot;Sara and Pelle and Neptune's Children&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moomin.com/en/event/villain-moominhouse-archway-words-literary-festival-england/// |title=ArchWay With Words |website=ArchWayWithWords.co.uk |accessdate=2017-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129185831/https://www.moomin.com/en/event/villain-moominhouse-archway-words-literary-festival-england/ |archive-date=29 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;) It was not published until 1933. She also sold drawings that were published in magazines in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;biografiakeskus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=1395|title=Jansson, Tove (1914–2001)|last=Ahola|first=Suvi|year=2008|work=Biografiakeskus|publisher=[[Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura]]|others=Fletcher, Roderick (trans.)|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s Jansson made several trips to other European countries. She drew from these for her short stories and articles, which she also illustrated, and which were also published in magazines, periodicals and daily papers. During this period, Jansson also designed many book covers, adverts and postcards. Following her mother's example, she drew illustrations for ''Garm'', an anti-fascist Finnish-Swedish satirical magazine.&lt;ref name=biografiakeskus /&gt;

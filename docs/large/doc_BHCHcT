===Nest protecting===

[[File:Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) attacking, Amsterdam island, Svalbard.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic tern]]s protect their offspring extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies. Other birds often benefit from this behavior by breeding very close to the Arctic terns.]]
[[Red-winged blackbird]] males help defend neighbor's nests. There are many theories as to why males behave this way. One is that males only defend other nests which contain their extra-pair offspring. Extra-pair offspring is juveniles which may contain some of the male bird's DNA. Another is the tit-for-tat strategy of reciprocal altruism. A third theory is, males help only other closely related males. A study done by The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided evidence that males used a tit-for-tat strategy. The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife tested many different nests by placing stuffed crows by nests, and then observing behavior of neighboring males. The behaviors they looked for included the number of calls, dives, and strikes. After analyzing the results, there was not significance evidence for kin selection; the presence of extra-pair offspring did not affect the probability of help in nest defense. However, males reduced the amount of defense given to neighbors when neighbor males reduced defense for their nests. This demonstrates a tit-for-tat strategy, where animals help those who previously helped them. This strategy is one type of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olendorf |first1=Robert |first2=Thomas |last2=Getty |first3=Kim |last3=Scribner |title=Cooperative Nest Defence in Red–winged Blackbirds: Reciprocal Altruism, Kinship or By–product Mutualism? |journal=Proc.

===Vampire bats===
[[Vampire bats]] also display reciprocal altruism, as described by Wilkinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5955| pages = 181–184 | doi=10.1038/308181a0 | pmid = 23282995 | pmc = 3574350 | bibcode=1984Natur.308..181W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = G. | year = 1988 | title = Reciprocal Altruism in Bats and Other Mammals | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 9 | issue =2–4 | pages = 85–100 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90015-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bats feed each other by regurgitating blood. Since bats only feed on blood and will die after just 70 hours of not eating, this food sharing is a great benefit to the receiver and a great cost to the giver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Gerald|title=Food Sharing in Vampire Bats: Reciprocal Help Predicts Donations More than Relatedness or Harassment | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|volume=280|issue=1753|pages=20122573|date=January 2, 2013 |pmc=3574350|pmid=23282995|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.2573}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To qualify for reciprocal altruism, the benefit to the receiver would have to be larger than the cost to the donor. This seems to hold as these bats usually die if they do not find a blood meal two nights in a row. Also, the requirement that individuals who have behaved altruistically in the past are helped by others in the future is confirmed by the data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson1&quot; /&gt; However, the consistency of the reciprocal behaviour, namely that a previously non-altruistic bat is refused help when it requires it, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the bats do not seem to qualify yet as an unequivocal example of reciprocal altruism.

===Primates===
Grooming in primates meets the conditions for reciprocal altruism according to some studies.  One of the studies in vervet monkeys shows that among unrelated individuals, grooming induce higher chance of attending to each other's calls for aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys|last1 = Seyfarth|first1 = Robert M|date = 1984|journal = Nature |volume=308 |issue = 5959|pages=541–3|doi = 10.1038/308541a0|pmid = 6709060 |first2 = Dorothy L|last2 = Cheney|bibcode = 1984Natur.308..541S|s2cid = 4266889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, vervet monkeys also display grooming behaviors within group members, displaying alliances.&lt;ref name=&quot;sibships&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = P.C. | year = 1987 | title = Sibships: Cooperation and Competition Among Immature Vervet Monkeys. | url = | journal = [[Primates (journal)|Primates]] | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1007/bf02382182| s2cid = 21449948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would demonstrate vervet monkey's grooming behavior as a part of kin selection since the activity is done between siblings in this study. Moreover, following the criteria by Stephen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot; /&gt; if the study is to be an example of reciprocal altruism, it must prove the mechanism for detecting cheaters.

=== Bacteria ===
Numerous species of bacteria engage in reciprocal altruistic behaviors with other species. Typically, this takes the form of bacteria providing essential nutrients for another species, while the other species provides an environment for the bacteria to live in. Reciprocal altruism is exhibited between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants in which they reside. Additionally, it can be observed between bacteria and some species of flies such as ''[[Bactrocera tryoni|Bactrocera tyroni]]''. These flies consume nutrient-producing bacteria found on the leaves of plants; in exchange, they reside within the flies' digestive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=A.R.|last2=Powell|first2=K.S.|last3=Weldon|first3=C.W.|last4=Taylor|first4=P.W.|date=2010-11-02|title=The ecology of ''Bactrocera tryoni'' (Diptera: Tephritidae): what do we know to assist pest management?|journal=Annals of Applied Biology|volume=158|issue=1|pages=26–54|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00448.x|issn=0003-4746|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/40107/1/c40107.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reciprocal altruistic behavior has been exploited by techniques designed to eliminate ''B. tyroni'', which are fruit fly pests native to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=MA|date=1967|title=Adaptations to temperature in geographic races of the Queensland fruit fly ''Dacus (Strumenta) tryoni'' |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1141|doi=10.1071/zo9671141|issn=0004-959X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation by emotional disposition==
In comparison to that of other animals, the human altruistic system is a sensitive and unstable one.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot; /&gt; Therefore, the tendency to give, to cheat, and the response to other's acts of giving and cheating must be regulated by a complex psychology in each individual, social structures, and cultural traditions. Individuals differ in the degree of these tendencies and responses.
According to [[Trivers]], the following emotional dispositions and their evolution can be understood in terms of regulation of altruism.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivers&quot; /&gt;

*Friendship and emotions of liking and disliking.
*Moralistic aggression. A protection mechanism from cheaters acts to regulate the advantage of cheaters in selection against altruists. The moralistic altruist may want to educate or even punish a cheater.
*Gratitude and sympathy. A fine regulation of altruism can be associated with gratitude and sympathy in terms of cost/benefit and the level in which the beneficiary will reciprocate.
*Guilt and reparative altruism. Prevents the cheater from cheating again. The cheater shows regret to avoid paying too dearly for past acts.
*Subtle cheating. A stable evolutionary equilibrium could include a low percentage of mimics in controversial support of adaptive sociopathy.
*Trust and suspicion. These are regulators for cheating and subtle cheating.
*Partnerships. Altruism to create friendships.

It is not known how individuals pick partners as there has been little research on choice. Modeling indicates that altruism about partner choices is unlikely to evolve, as costs and benefits between multiple individuals are variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schino | first1 = G. | last2 = Aureli | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = A few misunderstandings about reciprocal altruism | journal = Commun.

'''''The Selfish Gene''''' is a 1976 book on [[evolution]] by the biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author builds upon the principal theory of [[George C. Williams (biologist) |George C. Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966). Dawkins uses the term &quot;selfish gene&quot; as a way of expressing the [[gene-centered view of evolution| gene-centred view of evolution]] (as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the [[Group selection|group]]), popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.

A [[Lineage (evolution) | lineage]] is expected to evolve to maximise its [[inclusive fitness]]—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. The book also introduces the term ''[[meme]]'' for a unit of human [[cultural evolution]] analogous to the gene, suggesting that such &quot;selfish&quot; replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. [[Memetics]] has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book.  In raising awareness of Hamilton's ideas, as well as making its own valuable contributions to the field, the book has also stimulated research on [[human inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SBNK&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Holland, Maximilian |year= 2012 |title= Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches |publisher= Createspace Press|title-link= Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he &quot;can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents&quot; and in retrospect thinks he should have taken [[Tom Maschler]]'s advice and called the book ''The Immortal Gene''.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesexcerpt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece |title= It's all in the genes |last= Dawkins |first= Richard| date= 12 March 2006 |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate= 6 January 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135027/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece | archivedate= 15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[Royal Society]] science book prize listed ''The Selfish Gene'' as the most influential science book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
Dawkins builds upon [[George C. Williams (biologist) |George C. Williams]]'s book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966), which argued that [[altruism]] is not based upon [[group selection |group benefit]] ''per se'',&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; but results from [[natural selection| selection]] that occurs &quot;at the level of the gene mediated by the [[phenotype]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Williams2/&gt; and that any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others developed this approach further during the 1960s; they opposed the concepts of [[group selection]] and of selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism.&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the principle of '[[survival of the fittest]]' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] ''G'' will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene ''G'' ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.
:— W. D. Hamilton, ''The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior'' (1963), pp. 354–355.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilkins and Hull (2014) provide an extended discussion of Dawkins' views and of his book ''The Selfish Gene''.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

===Contents===

Dawkins begins by discussing the altruism that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking [[group selection]] as an explanation. He considers the [[origin of life]] with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at [[DNA]]'s role in [[evolution]], and its organisation into [[chromosome]]s and [[gene]]s, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes [[organism]]s as [[teleology in biology|apparently purposive]] but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use [[negative feedback]] to [[homeostasis|achieve control]]. This extends, he argues, to the [[brain]]'s ability to simulate the world with subjective [[consciousness]], and [[signalling theory|signalling between species]]. He then introduces the idea of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], and uses it to explain why [[game theory|alternative competitive strategies]] like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s argument for [[kin selection]], that genes for [[ethology|behaviour]] that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes. 

Dawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]], arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them, and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that [[R. A. Fisher]] showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping [[elephant seal]], where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. [[Amotz Zahavi]]'s theory of [[honest signalling]] explains [[stotting]] as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be. 

Dawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's [[selfish herd]] model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the [[social insects]] such as ants and bees, where [[worker bee|workers]] give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual ([[haplodiploid]]) system of [[sex determination system|sex determination]] may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.

The final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the [[meme]], a [[Cultural learning|culturally-transmitted]] entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.

===Themes===
====&quot;Selfish&quot; genes====
In describing genes as being &quot;selfish&quot;, Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or [[Volition (psychology)|will]], but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described ''as if'' they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose [[evolution]]ary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the [[anthropomorphism]]) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary &quot;selfishness&quot; down to creation of a widely proliferated [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']].&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;

For some, the metaphor of &quot;selfishness&quot; is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, [[Andrew Brown (Guardian journalist)|Andrew Brown]] has written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Brown |date=22 December 1998 |url=http://webpages.charter.net/sn9/science/dawkins2.html |title=The Science of Selfishness (book review of ''Unweaving the Rainbow'') |publisher=Salon Media Group |work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;&quot;Selfish&quot;, when applied to genes, doesn't mean &quot;selfish&quot; at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: &quot;the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process.&quot; This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but &quot;selfish&quot; isn't it.&quot;

[[Donald Symons]] also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly for the present instance. He writes in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979):&lt;ref name=Symons&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Donald Symons |last=Symons |first=Donald |chapter=The semantics of ultimate causation |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=42 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0195029079 |edition=Paperback |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkISQRDurU0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;In summary, the rhetoric of ''The Selfish Gene'' exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind.&quot;

====&quot;Replicators&quot;====
Dawkins proposes the idea of the &quot;replicator&quot;:&lt;ref name=DawkinsRep&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |author=Dawkins, Richard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirfBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT231 |publisher=Best Books |year=1976}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;It is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms ‘replicator’ and ‘vehicle’. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or 'vehicles'.&quot;
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253] (Anniversary Edition)

The original replicator (Dawkins' ''&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;eplicator'') was the initial [[molecule]] which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the [[Abiogenesis#&quot;Primordial soup theory|primordial soup]].&lt;ref name=Replicator&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA15 |quote=At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the ''Replicator''. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself |author=Dawkins, Richard|isbn=9780191537554 |date=2006-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.

Dawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, &quot;successful&quot; genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.

====Genes vs organisms====
There are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's [[inclusive fitness]] by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of [[Spider cannibalism|being eaten by the cannibalistic female]]. Another example is the existence of [[Intragenomic conflict|segregation distorter]] genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR/&gt; Likewise, the persistence of [[Noncoding DNA#Junk DNA|junk DNA]] that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR2/&gt;

These examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.

An example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the [[Malthusian]] model of population growth.

====Altruism====
Dawkins says that his &quot;purpose&quot; in writing ''The Selfish Gene'' is &quot;to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism.&quot; He does this by supporting the claim that &quot;gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of [[altruism]] at the level of individual animals.&quot; Gene selection provides one explanation for [[kin selection]] and [[eusociality]], where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in &quot;helping&quot; copies of themselves (or sequences with the same [[phenotype|phenotypic effect]]) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these &quot;selfish&quot; actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: &quot;You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours&quot; by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve [[kin recognition]], or manage to orchestrate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[coevolution]]. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']]:&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bury&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Burying the Vehicle: Commentary |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=17 |number=4 |pages=616–617 |year=1994 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/248092678/Burying-the-Vehicle#scribd |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00036207}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&quot;We agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book ''Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior''] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it....Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather 'Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?'&quot;
::—Richard Dawkins, ''Burying the Vehicle''

Although Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a &quot;vehicle&quot; for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery.
::&quot;We can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a ''candidate'' for the replicator role.  The controversy between ‘individual selection’ and ‘group selection’ is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity.&quot;

Prior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of [[group selection]], where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of [[Multilevel selection theory|&quot;multilevel selection&quot;]] claim to have overcome the original objections,&lt;ref name=Korb&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Behaviour: Evolution and Mechanisms |author=Judith Korb |chapter=§7.4—The level of selection debate: multilevel selection |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej953ZCO_Q8C&amp;pg=PA195 |pages =195 ''ff'' |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3642026232  |year=2010 |editor=Peter Kappeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.&lt;ref name=PinkerS&gt;Pinker describes the futility of the &quot;Public Good Game&quot; where individuals elect not to aid the group: {{cite book |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |author-link=Steven Pinker|author=Pinker, Steven |page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePNi4ZqYdVQC&amp;pg=PA257 |isbn=9781101200322 |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Selfish Gene'' was extremely popular when first published, causing &quot;a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology&quot;,{{Sfn|Grafen &amp; Ridley|p=72}} and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies, and has been translated into more than 25 languages.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by [[Charles Darwin]] before the basic mechanisms of [[genetics]] were understood.

According to the ethologist [[Alan Grafen]], acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect.&lt;ref name=Grafen&gt;{{cite book |title=Richard Dawkins: How a scientist changed the way we think |author1link=Alan Grafen |last1=Grafen |first1=Alan |author2link=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |last2=Ridley |first2=Mark |page=[https://archive.org/details/richarddawkinsho00alan/page/68 68] |url=https://archive.org/details/richarddawkinsho00alan |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780191500770}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction &quot;explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [''The Selfish Gene''] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt; According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, &quot;Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles Of Comparative Psychology |author=Hayes, Nicky |page=33 |chapter=The &quot;selfish gene&quot; theory |isbn=978-1317758754 |year=2014 |edition=Digital printing of 1996 |publisher=Psychology Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsx7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, critics argue that ''The Selfish Gene'' oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson2/&gt;)

''The Selfish Gene'' further popularised [[sociobiology]] in Japan after its translation in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sakura |first=Osamu |date=1 July 1998 |title=Similarities and Varieties: A Brief Sketch on the Reception of Darwinism and Sociobiology in Japan |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=341–357 |doi=10.1023/A:1006504623820|s2cid=169325555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term &quot;meme&quot; entered popular culture. Yuzuru Tanaka of Hokkaido University wrote a book, ''Meme Media and Meme Market Architectures'', while the psychologist [[Susan Blackmore]] wrote ''[[The Meme Machine]]'' (2000), with a foreword by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Lectures/Japan%202005.htm |title=The Evolution of Meme Machines |author-link=Susan Blackmore |last=Blackmore |first=Susan |date=17 May 2005 |website=Dr. Susan Blackmore |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information scientist Osamu Sakura has published a book in Japanese and several papers in English on the topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=遺伝子vsミーム―教育 |last=佐倉 |first=統 |publisher=廣済堂出版 |date=2001 |isbn=978-4331850053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.natureinterface.com/e/ni04/P026-029/ |title=What is the Evolution of Communication? -- Osamu Sakura |website=www.natureinterface.com |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nippon Animation produced an educational television program titled ''[[Mīmu Iro Iro Yume no Tabi|The Many Journeys of Meme]]''.

In 1976, the ecologist [[Arthur Cain]], one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a &quot;young man's book&quot; (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the [[New College, Oxford]]{{efn|Dawkins's college.}} philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]'s ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been &quot;flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesexcerpt&quot; /&gt; This point also was made by the philosopher [[Mary Midgley]]: &quot;The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in ''Language, Truth and Logic''. &quot;This hasn't occurred to Dawkins&quot;, she says. &quot;He goes on saying the same thing.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul  |journal=The Guardian |author=Anthony, Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness |date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Wilkins and Hull,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilkins, John S. |author2=Hull, David |title=Replication and Reproduction |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Zalta, Edward N. |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/replication/#DawRepVeh |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:

:&quot;In Dawkins' early writings, replicators and vehicles played different but complementary and equally important roles in selection, but as Dawkins honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became less and less fundamental... In later writings Dawkins goes even further and argues that phenotypic traits are what really matter in selection and that they can be treated independently of their being organized into vehicles....Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins  proclaims that he &quot;coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to praise it but to bury it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bury/&gt; As prevalent as organisms might be, as determinate as the causal roles that they play in selection are, reference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous characterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Dawkins is far from a genetic ''determinist'', but he is certainly a genetic ''reductionist''.&quot;

===Units of selection===
As to the [[unit of selection]]: &quot;One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene,...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |editor=Keller, Laurent |author1=Reeve, H. Kern |author2=Keller, Laurent  |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins proposed the matter without a distinction between 'unit of replication' and 'unit of selection' that he made elsewhere: &quot;the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dawkins76A&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene  |chapter=Chapter 1: Why are people? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continues in a later chapter:

:&quot;On any sensible view of the matter Darwinian selection does not work on genes directly. ...The important differences between genes emerge only in their ''effects''. The technical word ''phenotype'' is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene has on the body...Natural selection favours some genes rather than others not because of the nature of the genes themselves, but because of their consequences—their phenotypic effects...But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as ''all the effects that it has on the world''. ...The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation. All I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall...Examples that spring to mind are artefacts like beaver dams, bird nests, and caddis houses.&quot; 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', Chapter 13, pp. 234, 235, 238

Dawkins' later formulation is in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] effect of a gene.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] finds Dawkins' position tries to have it both ways:&lt;ref name=GouldSJ&gt;{{cite book |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LMrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA640 |pages=640–641 |isbn=978-0674417922 |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

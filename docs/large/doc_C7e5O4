In 1975, Mercury visited Everett, bringing with him an advance copy of the single &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2011&quot;/&gt; Despite doubting that any station would play the six-minute track, Everett placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, exclaimed: &quot;Forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2011&quot;/&gt; Although [[Capital Radio]] had not officially accepted the song, Everett talked incessantly about a record he possessed but could not play. He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: &quot;Oops, my finger must've slipped.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2011&quot;/&gt; On one occasion, Everett aired the song thirty-six times in a single day. Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/kenny-everett--the-best-possible-way-to-remember-a-true-pioneer-8191316.html | title = Kenny Everett – The best possible way to remember a true pioneer | newspaper = The Independent | access-date = 19 January 2015| date = 30 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett's confidante.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett&quot;/&gt; Throughout the early- to mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and experiment with drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett&quot;/&gt; By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wife [[Lee Everett Alkin|Lady Lee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett&quot;/&gt; In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everett&quot;&gt;&quot;When Freddie Mercury Met Kenny Everett&quot; (1 June 2002).

===Sexual orientation===
While some commentators claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,&lt;ref name=&quot;Januszczak_1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain_2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landesman_2006&quot;/&gt; others claimed he was &quot;openly [[homosexuality|gay]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzpatrick_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_2006&quot;/&gt; In December 1974, when asked directly, &quot;So how about being bent?&quot; by the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', Mercury replied, &quot;You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Sommerlad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bohemian-rhapsody-oscars-2019-rami-malek-backlash-controversy-freddie-mercury-queen-a8740806.html |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Why the Oscar-nominated Queen biopic has suffered a backlash |date=22 January 2019|access-date=7 March 2019 |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had been [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967]], seven years earlier. During public events in the 1980s, Mercury often kept a distance from his partner, Jim Hutton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton_1994&quot;/&gt; The tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' referred to Mercury as a &quot;[[bisexuality|bisexual]] rock star&quot; in 1986, who had &quot;confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sun October 1986&quot;/&gt;

During his career, Mercury's flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1984 for ''[[Kerrang!]]'', noted Mercury's &quot;[[Camp (style)|camp]]&quot; addresses to the audience and even described him as a &quot;posing, pouting, posturing tart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.queencuttings.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=310 | title= Kerrang! – UK – Queen, Wembley Arena London | work=Queen Cuttings | access-date=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007065922/http://www.queencuttings.com/images/80s/WembleyArena_05sept1984_rev.jpg|archive-date= 7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, John Marshall of ''[[Gay Times]]'' opined: &quot;[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' […] It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leung&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen Hok-Sze | last = Leung| year=2009|isbn=9780774858298| title = Undercurrents: Queer Culture and Postcolonial Hong Kong | page = 88 | publisher = HBC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[AfterElton]]'', Robert Urban said: &quot;Mercury did not ally himself to 'political [[Coming out|outness]],' or to [[LGBT]] causes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leung&quot;/&gt;

Some have continued to refer to Mercury as bisexual; for example, regarding the creation of [[Celebrate Bisexuality Day]], [[Wendy Curry]] said: &quot;We were sitting around at one of the annual bi conventions, venting and someone{{snd}}I think it was [[Gigi Raven Wilbur|Gigi]]{{snd}}said we should have a party.

The 2018 biopic of Mercury, ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'', received criticism for its portrayal of Mercury's sexuality, which was described as &quot;sterilized&quot; and &quot;confused&quot;, and was even accused of being &quot;dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.pride.com/movies/2018/10/24/how-bohemian-rhapsody-sterilized-freddie-mercurys-bisexuality | title= How Bohemian Rhapsody Sterilized Freddie Mercury's Bisexuality | work=Pride | first=Taylor | last=Henderson | date=24 October 2018 | access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/bohemian-rhapsody-freddie-mercury-sexuality-confused-lgbt-gay-bi-erasure-straightwashing-1202017372/ | title= 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Doesn't Straightwash, but It's Confused About Freddie Mercury's Sexuality | work=[[Indiewire]]|first=Jude| last=Dry | date=2 November 2018 | access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.them.us/story/bohemian-rhapsody-queer-representation | title= Bohemian Rhapsody's Queer Representation Is Downright Dangerous | work=them.| first=Naveen| last=Kumar | date=3 November 2018 | access-date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell_2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Cain_2006&quot;/&gt; and granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: &quot;When I'm performing I'm an [[extrovert]], yet inside I'm a completely different man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers_1991&quot;/&gt; On this contrast to &quot;his larger-than-life stage persona&quot;, BBC music broadcaster [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]] adds he was &quot;lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience. Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury &quot;seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSBestSingers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-best-lead-singers-of-all-time-20110412/2-freddie-mercury-0762142 | work = Readers Pick the Best Lead Singers of All Time | title = 2.

Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, &quot;that’s something inbred, it's a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persian popinjay&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chapman |first1=Ian |title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |pages=86, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background. Feeling a connection to Britain prior to arriving in England, the young Bulsara was heavily influenced by British fashion and music trends while growing up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot;/&gt; According to his longtime assistant Peter Freestone, &quot;if Freddie had his way, he would have been born aged 18 in [[Feltham]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot;/&gt; Harris states, &quot;One of the things about Freddie was that he was very civilised and quite ‘English’. I’d go over to his flat near [[Shepherd's Bush]] in the afternoon, and he’d get out the fine china and the sugar lumps and we’d have a cup of tea.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Yates|first=Henry|date=23 February 2018|title=Bob Harris on Marc Bolan, David Bowie, Queen, Robert Plant and more...|magazine=[[Metal Hammer|Louder Sound]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/bob-harris-on-marc-bolan-david-bowie-queen-robert-plant-and-more|access-date=27 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, &quot;Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few. [[John Lennon]] was one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people's thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between. People with mere talent, like me, have not got the ability or power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20181107103954/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Freddie_Mercury_-_05-02-1981_-_Melody_Maker &quot;Mercury interview for Melody Maker]. queenarchives.com (5 February 1981).

Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]]. Mercury &quot;placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life&quot;, and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them. Mercury wrote a song for Delilah, &quot;his favourite cat of all&quot;, which appeared on the Queen album ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freestone |first=Peter |date=2001 |title=Freddie Mercury: An Intimate Memoir by the Man who Knew Him Best |publisher=Omnibus Press |page=234 |isbn=0711986746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury dedicated his liner notes in his 1985 solo album ''Mr. Bad Guy'' to Jerry and his other cats.

According to biographer [[Lesley-Ann Jones]], Mercury &quot;felt very much at home there.

==Illness==&lt;!-- ****NOTE**** Pay attention to how this article uses&lt;ref&gt; ****NOTE**** --&gt;
There had been signs that Mercury had been exhibiting HIV symptoms as early as 1982. Authors Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne have stated in their biographical book about Mercury, ''Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury'', that Mercury had secretly seen a doctor in New York City to get a white lesion checked on his tongue (which might have been [[hairy leukoplakia]], one of the first signs of an infection) a few weeks before Queen's final American appearance with Mercury on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on 25 September 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards Lamgthorne&quot;/&gt; They also stated that he had associated with someone who was recently infected with HIV on the same day of their final US appearance, in which he began to exhibit more symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards Lamgthorne&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.advocate.com/hiv/2016/11/23/freddie-mercurys-life-story-hiv-bisexuality-and-queer-identity|last=Anderson-Minshall|first=Diane|title=Freddie Mercury's Life Is the Story of HIV, Bisexuality, and Queer Identity|access-date=26 September 2020|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1986, the British press reported that Mercury had his blood tested for [[HIV/AIDS]] at a [[Harley Street]] clinic. A reporter for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', [[Hugh Whittow]], questioned Mercury about the story at [[Heathrow Airport]] as he was returning from Japan. Mercury denied he had the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sun October 1986&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Hugh|last=Whittow| title = Do I Look Like I'm Dying Of Aids?

The British press pursued the rumours over the next few years, fueled by Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring, and reports from former lovers to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid journals]].

He had no fear, really.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Montreux studio&quot; /&gt; Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, said: &quot;This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy.

After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home in [[Kensington]], West London. His former partner, Mary Austin, was a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last few weeks made regular visits to look after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot; /&gt; Near the end of his life, Mercury began to lose his sight, and declined so that he was unable to leave his bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot; /&gt; Mercury chose to hasten his death by refusing medication and took only painkillers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot;&gt;”Mary Austin Shares Her Memories” – March, 17th 2000.

Mercury spent and donated to charity much of his wealth during his lifetime, with his estate valued around £8 million at the time of his death. He bequeathed his home, Garden Lodge and the adjoining Mews, as well as a 50% of all privately-owned shares to Mary Austin. His sister, Kashmira Cooke, received 25%, as did his parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, which Cooke acquired upon their deaths.

The extent to which Mercury's death may have enhanced Queen's popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen's popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA_2007&quot; /&gt; In 1992, one American critic noted, &quot;What cynics call the 'dead star' factor had come into play—Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown_1992&quot; /&gt; The movie ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'', which featured &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, also came out in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=queen+waynes+world&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Hollywood Records Hails Older Queen Product|magazine=Billboard |date=25 July 1992|page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], Queen had sold 34.5&amp;nbsp;million albums in the United States by 2004, about half of which had been sold since Mercury's death in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Gold &amp; Platinum – 22&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2009 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=22 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701163039/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |archive-date=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous Queen album===

In November 1995, Mercury appeared posthumously on Queen's final studio album ''[[Made in Heaven]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/behind-the-albums/queen-made-in-heaven/|title=Made In Heaven: The Aptly Named Album That Drew The Curtain On Queen|last=Bell|first=Max|date=17 August 2017|website=uDiscoverMusic|access-date=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured Mercury's previously unreleased final recordings from 1991, as well as outtakes from previous years and reworked versions of solo works by the other members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaven&quot;/&gt; The album cover features the Freddie Mercury statue that overlooks Lake Geneva superimposed with Mercury's Duck House lake cabin that he had rented. This is where he had written and recorded his last songs at [[Mountain Studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaven&quot;/&gt; The sleeve of the album contains the words, &quot;Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaven&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/made-heaven/|title=Made in Heaven|last1=Brooks|first1=Greg|last2=Taylor|first2=Gary|publisher=Queenonline.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218165829/http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/made-heaven/|archive-date=18 February 2011|access-date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Featuring tracks such as &quot;[[Too Much Love Will Kill You]]&quot; and &quot;[[Heaven for Everyone]]&quot;, the album also contains the song &quot;[[Mother Love (Queen song)|Mother Love]]&quot;, the last vocal recording Mercury made before his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor, and Deacon later added the instrumental track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemieux|first=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording &amp; Release History of the Band|date=2013|publisher=Lulu|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he &quot;wasn't feeling that great&quot; and stated, &quot;I will finish it when I come back next time”. He never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montreux studio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the studio where Freddie Mercury sang his last song|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10486116/Inside-the-studio-where-Freddie-Mercury-sang-his-last-song.html|work=The Telegraph|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury has featured in international advertising to represent the UK. In 2001, a parody of Mercury, along with prints of other British music icons consisting of [[The Beatles]], Elton John, [[Spice Girls]], and [[The Rolling Stones]], appeared in the [[Eurostar]] national advertising campaign in France for the Paris to London route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/28586/freddy/eurostar |title=Eurostar – &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;|work=[[AdForum]]|access-date=8 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017 the airline [[Norwegian Long Haul|Norwegian]] painted the tail fin of two of its aircraft with a portrait of Mercury to mark what would have been his 71st birthday.

===Importance in AIDS history===
As the first major rock star to die of AIDS, Mercury's death represented an important event in the history of the disease.&lt;ref name=National/&gt; In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen founded [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]] and organised ''[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] for AIDS Awareness'', to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research, which took place on 20 April 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stothard_1992&quot;/&gt; The Mercury Phoenix Trust has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities. The tribute concert, which took place at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] for an audience of 72,000, featured a wide variety of guests including [[Robert Plant]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]), [[Roger Daltrey]] (of [[the Who]]), [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Elton John]], [[Metallica]], [[David Bowie]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Tony Iommi]] (of [[Black Sabbath]]), [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[George Michael]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Liza Minnelli]], and [[U2]] (via satellite).

===Appearances in lists of influential individuals===
Several popularity polls conducted over the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], broadcast by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm |title=BBC – 100 great British heroes |work=BBC News |date=21 August 2002 |access-date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes.&lt;ref name=&quot;James_2007&quot;/&gt; Although he had been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book ''The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell_2002&quot;/&gt; In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone.com2&quot;/&gt; Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in [[MTV]]'s 22 Greatest Voices in Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzpatrick_2006&quot;/&gt; In 2011 a ''Rolling Stone'' readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSBestSingers&quot;/&gt; In 2015, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine placed him second on their list of the 25 Best Rock Frontmen (and Women) of All Time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard_2015&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The 25 Best Rock Frontmen (and Women) of All Time |url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/6721847/best-rock-singers-of-all-time |access-date=10 March 2019 |magazine=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

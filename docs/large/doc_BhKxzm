One of the most classic [[macroeconomic]] inquiries is the effect of public capital investment on [[economic growth]]. While many analysts debate the magnitude, evidence has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between infrastructure investment and economic performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;/&gt; U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] economist David Alan Aschauer asserted an increase of the public capital stock by 1% would result in an increase of the [[total factor productivity]] by 0.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;&gt;Haan, J., Romp, W., and Sturum, J.E. (2007). Public Capital and Economic Growth. World Bank, Preliminary Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aschauer argues that the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|golden age of the 1950s and 1960s]] were partly due to the post-[[World War II]] substantial investment in [[critical infrastructure|core infrastructure]] (highways, mass transit, airports, water systems, electric/gas facilities). Conversely, the drop of U.S. productivity growth in [[1973–75 recession|the 1970s]] and [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1980s]] was in response to the decrease of continual public capital investment and not the decline of technological innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;/&gt; Likewise, the [[European Union]] nations have declined public capital investment through the same years, also witnessing declining [[productivity growth]] rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;/&gt; A similar situation emerges in [[developing nations]]. Analyzing [[OECD]] and non-OECD countries’ real-GDP growth rates from 1960 to 2000 with public capital as an explanatory variable (not using public investment rates), Arslanalp, Borhorst, Gupta, and Sze (2010) show that increases in the public capital stock does correlate with increases in growth. However, this relationship depends on initial levels of public capital and income levels for the country. Thus, OECD countries witness a stronger positive link in the short term while non-OECD countries experience a stronger positive link in the long term. Hence, developing countries can benefit from non-concessional foreign borrowing to finance high-prospect public capital investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Growth, International Monetary Fund&quot;&gt;Arslanalp, S., Borhorst, F., Gupta, S., and Sze, E. (2010). Public Capital and Growth. International Monetary Fund: Fiscal Affairs Department, Working Paper. Pp. 1-35. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this relationship of public capital and productivity, public capital becomes a third [[factor of production|input]] in the standard, [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[production function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad\qquad Y_t = A_t * (N_t, K_t, G_t) &lt;/math&gt;

where: 
:''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents real aggregate output of goods and services of the private sector
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents productivity factor or Hicks-Neutral technical change
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents aggregate employment of labor services
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents aggregate stock of nonresidential capital
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; represents flow of public capital stock (assuming services of public capital are proportional to public capital)&lt;ref&gt;Aschauer, D. A. (1989). Is Public Expenditure Productive? Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 23. Pp. 177-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this form, public capital has a direct influence on productivity as a third variable. Additionally, public capital has an indirect influence on [[multifactor productivity]] as it affects the other two inputs of labor and [[private capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Eberts, R. (1990). Public infrastructure and regional economic development. Economic Review (00130281), 26(1), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this unique nature, public capital investment, used in the production process of nearly every sector, is not sufficient on its own to generate sustained economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;/&gt; Thus, rather than the ends, public capital is the means. That is, instead of being seen as [[intermediate good]]s used as resources by businesses, public capital should be seen as goods which are used to make the [[final goods]] and services to consumers-taxpayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital Formation&quot;/&gt; Note that public capital levels should not be too high that it leads to financing costs and high tax rates issues which will negate the positive benefits of such investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Growth, International Monetary Fund&quot;/&gt; Moreover, infrastructure services carry the market-distorting features of pure, non-rival [[public goods]]; [[Network effect|network externalities]]; [[natural monopolies]]; and the [[Common-pool resource|common resource]] problem such as congestion and overuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;/&gt;

Empirical models that attempt to estimate the public investment and economic growth link involve a wide variety including: the [[Cobb-Douglas]] production function; a behavioral approach [[Cost curve|cost]]/[[Profit (economics)|profit]] function which includes public capital stock; [[Vector autoregression|Vector Auto Regression]] (VAR) models; and government investment growth [[regression analysis|regression]]s. These models nonetheless contend with [[reverse causation|reverse causality]], [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]], [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]], and [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]] in trying to capture the public capital and economic growth link.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;/&gt; [[New Keynesian]] models, though, analyze the effect of government spending through the supply side rather than traditional [[Keynesian]] models that analyzes it through the demand side. Therefore, a temporary surge of infrastructure investment yields an expansion of output, and vice versa that dwindling infrastructure, like in the 1970s, hamper longer-term movement in productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Crain, W.M. and Oakley, L.K. (1995) The Politics of Infrastructure. Journal of Law and Economics Vol. 38, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, new research on regional growth (as opposed to national growth with GDP) shows a strong positive relationship between public capital and productivity. Both [[fixed costs]] and [[transport]] costs lower with expanded infrastructure in localities and the resulting cluster of industries. As a result, economic activity grows along its pattern of trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital and Economic Growth&quot;/&gt; Therefore, the importance of [[business cluster|regional clusters]] and [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan economies]] comes into effect.

==Social benefit==

Beyond economic performance, public capital investment yields returns in [[quality of life]] indicators such as [[health]], [[safety]], [[recreation]], [[aesthetics]], and [[leisure|leisure time and activities]]. In example, highways provide better access and mobility for increased discretionary time and [[recreation|recreational outlets]]; [[mass transit]] can improve air quality with reduced number of private vehicles; improved municipal waste facilities reduces toxic [[Water pollution|groundwater contamination]] and better [[Open space reserve|green space]] aesthetics such as [[parks]]; expanded water facilities aids in health and sanitation and environment such as reducing odor and sewer overflows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, infrastructure adds to community ambience and quality of place with livelier [[downtown]]s, vibrant [[:wikt:waterfront|waterfront]]s, efficient [[land use]]s, compact spaces for [[commerce]] and [[recreation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping a New Federal Partnership&quot;&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and  Warren, D. Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, inadequate public capital impairs quality of life and social well-being. Over-capacity landfills lead to groundwater contamination, having deleterious effects on health. Deficient supply and quality of mass transit services impacts transit-dependents on their access to opportunity and resources. Increasing congestion in airports and roadways causes loss of discretionary time and recreational activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;/&gt; The lack of efficient U.S. [[freight]] and [[passenger train|passenger rail]] service will neither aid in handling the “perfect storm” of [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[Sustainable energy|energy]] [[sustainability]] nor meet the global competitive need of transporting goods and services at heightened speeds and times.&lt;ref&gt;Puentes, R. (2008). A Bridge to Somewhere: Rethinking American Transportation for the 21st Century. Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Report: Blueprint for American Prosperity series report.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the continued loss of footing in [[clean energy]] technology will contribute to U.S.’s future loss of prosperity on the global stage in terms of the [[carbon footprint]] and [[economy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookings MetroPolicy: Shaping a New Federal Partnership&quot;/&gt;

==Public capital initiatives==

===United States===

Perhaps the largest contribution to the [[public works]] system in the U.S. came out of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]’s [[New Deal]] initiatives particularly the creation of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) in 1935. At a time of a deep economic crisis, the WPA employed at its peak 3.35 million unemployed heads-of-households to work in rebuilding the country. The program helped construct millions of roads, bridges, parks, schools, hospitals, and levees while also providing educational programs, childcare, job training, and medical services. The overall [[government spending|public spending]] level for the program, unprecedented at the time, was $4.8 billion ($76 billion in 2008 dollars), and helped to stimulate the economy through public works projects.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, J. (2008). A Twenty-First Century WPA. Social Policy, 38(2), 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then, the U.S. has contributed to other large infrastructure programs including the [[Interstate Highway System]], 1956-1990, with a dedicated financing system through the gas tax and a matching contribution between federal government and states at 90% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, F. E. (2003). Perspectives in Civil Engineering. 1852-2002: 150 Years in Civil Engineering in the United States. American Society of Civil Engineers. Edited by Jeffrey S. Russell. Pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972 provided a public capital investment of $40 billion in constructing and upgrading sewage treatment facilities with “significant positive impacts on the Nation’s water quality.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;/&gt; Considered by the [[National Academy of Engineering]] to be the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century, the [[Electric grid|North American electric grid]] carries electricity over {{convert|300,000|mi|km}} on high-voltage [[transmission lines]] across the U.S. Though currently facing aging facilities and equipment, this public capital investment has ubiquitously reached millions of homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Stuller, J. (2009). Reinventing Edison. Conference Board Review, 46(1), 42-49. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. (2009). Power to the Plug: An Introduction to Energy, Electricity, Consumption, and Efficiency. Pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) is another example of large public capital investment. Of the $311 billion in appropriations, about $120 billion are set aside for crucial investment in Infrastructure and Science and Energy. Some of ARRA’s aims include [[smart grid]] technology, [[retrofitting]] of homes and federal buildings, automated [[Air traffic control|aviation traffic control]], advancing freight and passenger rail services, and upgrading water and waste facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, R., Bray, J., &amp; Brost, K (2009). United States Congress: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Retrieved Oct. 20, 2009, from House Appropriations Committee, Washington DC. Web site: http://appropriations.house.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

Worldwide, transformative public capital investments are taking place. [[China]]’s ambitious rapid [[high-speed rail]] program is estimated to extend 18,000&amp;nbsp;km by 2020. By the end of 2008, the country had a fleet of over 24,000 [[locomotives]], the most lines in the world, the fastest [[express train]] in service, and longest high-speed track in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Felon, C, Ramella, F, and Zuger, H. (2009) China’s Rail Revolution. ABB Review: Railways and Transportation. Vol. 2, Issue 10. Pp. 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Denmark]], and other countries in northern [[Europe]] that surround the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[North Sea]], continue to develop their rapid expansion of [[Wind power|off-shore wind farms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-3-economics-of-wind-power/chapter-2-offshore-developments/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100053/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-3-economics-of-wind-power/chapter-2-offshore-developments/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With continued expansion of terminals and connection to nation’s comprehensive transport system, the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] is one of the largest engineering and architectural projects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/business/about-the-airport/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, [[Chile]] installed five [[Combined cycle|combined cycle gas-turbined]] (CCGT) power plants to meet its nation’s growing energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industcards.com/cc-chile.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126204329/http://www.industcards.com/cc-chile.htm |archivedate=2013-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="8338" xml:space="preserve">'''Physical capital''' represents in [[economics]] one of the three primary factors of production. Physical capital is the apparatus used to [[produce]] a [[good]] and [[service (economics)|services]]. Physical capital represents the tangible man-made goods that help and support the production [[inventory]], [[cash]], [[equipment]] or [[real estate]] are all examples of physical capital


'''Definition'''
[[Gregory Mankiw|N.G. Mankiw]] definition from the book Economics: 
''[[Capital (economics)|Capital]] is the equipment and structures used to produce goods and services. Physical capital consists of man-made goods (or input into the process of production) that assist in the production process. Cash, real estate, equipment, and inventory are examples of physical capital.''&lt;ref&gt;MANKIW, Gregory N., TAYLOR, Mark P., Economics, 2015,03,P. 2, {{ISBN|978-1-4080-9379-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Capital goods represents one of the key factors of [[corporation]] function. Generally, capital allows a [[company]] to preserve [[liquidity]] while growing operations, it refers to physical [[assets]] in [[business]] and the way a company have reached their physical capital. While referring how companies have obtained their capital it is important to consider both - physical capital and [[human capital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;humancapital&quot;&gt; https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062616/human-capital-vs-physical-capital-what-difference.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Biased on economic theory, physical capital represents one of the three primary factors of production, that is also recognized as inputs production function. The others are natural resources (including land), and labour. The word &quot;Physical&quot; is used to distinguish physical capital from human capital and financial capital. &quot;Physical capital&quot; denote to fixed capital, all other sorts of real physical asset that are not included in the production of a product is distinguished from circulating capital. &lt;ref&gt;  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physical-capital.asp&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Physical capital in [[accounting]]'''
Biased on the order of [[solvency]] of a physical capital, it is listed on the [[balance sheet]]. The impact of [[investments]] of human capital and physical capital can be measured and analysed with the same [[ratios]] to measure and analyse the investment [[performance]] of physical assets. Both of these investments lead to fundamental improvements in the [[business model]] and better overall decision-making. The balance sheet provides an overview, which consist of both physical and human capital, of the value of all physical and some non-physical assets, but it also provides an overview of the capital raised to pay for those assets.
Physical capital is noted on the balance sheet as an [[asset]] at [[historical cost]], not [[market value]]. As a result, the [[book value]] of assets is generally higher than market value. Accountants refer to physical capital as a tangible asset. Compering the physical capital and human capital is easy to find on the balance, but the human capital is often only assumed. In addition to [[Social capital|goodwill]], analysts can value the impact of human capital on operations with [[efficiency]] ratios, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (ROE). The value of human capital can be also determined by the investors in the mark-up on products sold or the industry premium on salary, for instance a company is willing to pay more for an experienced programmer who can produce a higher-margin product. In this case the value of the programmer's experience is the amount the company is willing to pay over and above the market price. &lt;ref name=&quot;humancapital&quot; /&gt;


'''Production function'''
[[Production function]] definition by N.G. Mankiw:
''Production function is the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.''  &lt;ref&gt;MANKIW, Gregory N., TAYLOR, Mark P., Economics, 2015,03, P.136, {{ISBN|978-1-4080-9379-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-operation of four factors of production capital, [[land]], labour and [[organization]] crates the result in production of goods, biased on this fact no [[commodity]] is possible to produce without the help of these four factors, actually all four are usually used in some technical proportion, with the aim to maximize profit with a minimal cost by the best combination of factors of production. Best combination for producer is enabled by applying the principles of equip-marginal returns and substitution. The principle of equip-marginal returns states that, any producer can have maximum production only when the [[marginal returns]] of all the factors of production are equal. For instance, when the marginal product of the land is equal to that of labour, capital and organisation, the production becomes maximum. Production function shoes how much [[output (economics)|output]] producer can expect in exact proportion of labour and capital as well as of labour etc. Differently, production function is an indicator of the physical relationship between the inputs and output of a firm.
Like the demand function a production function is for a definite period. It shows the flow of inputs resulting into a flow of output during some time. The production function of a [[firm]] depends on the state of [[technology]]. With every development in technology the production function of the firm undergoes a change.
The new production function brought about by developing technology displays same inputs and more output or the same output with lesser inputs. Sometimes a new production function of the firm may be adverse as it takes more inputs to produce the same output.
Mathematical description of basic relationship between inputs and outputs:

Q = f (L, C, N)
Q = Quantity of output
L = Labour
C = Capital
N = Land

The level of output (Q) depends on the quantities of different inputs (L, C, N) available to the firm. In the simplest case, where there are only two inputs, labour (L) and capital (C) and one output (Q), the production function becomes.
Q =f (L, C)
The production function is a technical or [[engineering]] relation between input and output. If the natural laws of technology remain unchanged, the production function remains unchanged.

Features of Production Function:
The production function consists of 3 main features – [[Substitutability]], Complementarity and Specificity. 1. Substitutability: By changing the number and amount of some inputs, while the others stay unchanged, we achieve the possibility, to modify the total output. It is the substitutability of the factors of production that gives rise to the laws of variable proportions. 2. Complementarity: is that two or more inputs are to be used together as nothing will be produced if the quantity of either of the inputs used in the production process is zero. Another example of complementarity is the principles of returns to scale of inputs as it reveals that the quantity of all inputs has to increased simultaneously in order to attain a higher scale of total output. 3. Specificity: Every product has its own specific number and type of inputs. Machines and equipment's, specialized workers and raw materials or commodities are a few examples of the specificity of factors of production. This reveals that in the production process none of the factors can be ignored and in some cases ignorance to even slightest extent is not possible if the factors are perfectly specific. Production consists of time; [[hence]], the way the inputs are combined is determined to a large extent by the time period under consideration. The greater the time period, the greater the freedom the producer must vary the quantities of various inputs used in the production process. In the production function, variation in total output by varying the quantities of all inputs is possible only in the long run whereas the variation in total output by varying the quantity of single input may be possible even in the short run. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/production-function/production-function-meaning-definitions-and-features/6892&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social capital''' is the effective functioning of [[social group]]s through [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]], a shared sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], a shared understanding, shared [[Social norm|norms]], shared [[Value (ethics)|values]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[cooperation]], and [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]]. Social capital is a measure of the value of resources, both [[Tangibility|tangible]] (e.g., [[Public space|public spaces]], [[private property]]) and intangible (e.g., [[Social actor|actors]], [[human capital]], people), and the impact that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship, and on larger groups. It is generally seen as a form of capital that produces [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s for a [[common purpose]].

Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from [[Strategic alliance|strategic alliances]], and the evolution of [[Community|communities]].

== History ==
The term ''social capital'' was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=social+capital&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=0 |title=Google Ngram Viewer |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate of community versus [[Modernization theory|modernization]] of society and [[individualism]] has been the most discussed topic among the founders of [[sociology]]: such theorists as [[Ferdinand Tönnies|Tönnies]] (1887),&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Tonnies, F. (1955) [1887]. ''Community and Association''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] (1893),&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. (1893) &quot;De la Division du Travail&quot;. Les Classiques de Science Sociale.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]] (1905),&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, G. (1969) [1905] &quot;The Metropolis and Mental Life&quot;, in Richard Sennet (eds) ''Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber|Weber]] (1946)&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Weber, M. (1946) &quot;The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. In Hans H. Gert and Mills C. Wright (eds) ''From Max Weber''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; were convinced that [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanization]] were transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development of [[anomie]] and [[social alienation|alienation]] in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Wilmott, P. 1986. ''Social Networks, Informal Care and Public Policy''. London: [[Policy Studies Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th–19th century ===
The power of ''[[community governance]]'' has been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowles|first1=S.|last2=Gintis|first2=S.|year=2002|title=Social Capital and Community Governance|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=112|issue=483|pages=419–436|citeseerx=10.1.1.508.4110|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00077}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea of ''[[Homo economicus|Homo Economicus]]'' and subsequently with ''[[rational choice theory]]''. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship between ''modern society'' and the importance of ''old institutions'', in particular family and traditional communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such as [[James Madison]] (''[[The Federalist Papers]]'') and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (''[[Democracy in America]]'') to integrate concepts of social cohesion and [[connectedness]] into the [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] tradition in [[American politics (political science)|American political science]]. [[John Dewey]] may have made the first direct mainstream use of ''social capital'' in ''[[The School and Society]]'' in 1899, though he did not offer a definition.

In the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better.

=== 20th century ===
[[L. J. Hanifan]]'s 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the term ''social capital'' in reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;[[L.

J. Hanifan|Hanifan, L. J.]] 1920. ''The Community Center''. Boston: [[Silver Burdett]].&lt;/ref&gt; In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as:&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|130-1}}&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following the works of [[Ferdinand Tönnies|Tönnies]] (1887)&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; and [[Max Weber|Weber]] (1946),&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular, ''[[Social movement#Mass society theory|mass society theory]]''—as developed by [[Daniel Bell]] (1962),&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell|Bell, Daniel]]. 1962. &quot;America as a Mass Society.&quot; In ''[[The End of Ideology]]'', edited by D. Bell. New York: [[Collier Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nisbet]] (1969),&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Nisbet|Nisbet, Robert A.]] 1969. ''The Quest for Community''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice R. Stein]] (1960),&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice R. Stein|Stein, Maurice R.]] 1960. ''The Eclipse of Community: an Interpretation of American Studies''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[William H. Whyte]] (1956)&lt;ref&gt;[[William H. Whyte|Whyte, William H.]] 1956. ''[[The Organization Man]]''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;/ref&gt;—proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): &quot;The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.&quot; 

[[Jane Jacobs]] used the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the term ''social capital'', her usage referred to the value of networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Jane|url=https://archive.org/details/deathlifeofgre00jaco|title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities|publisher=Random House|year=1961|page=[https://archive.org/details/deathlifeofgre00jaco/page/138 138]|quote=&quot;If self-government in the place is to work, underlying any float of population must be a continuity of people who have forged neighborhood networks. These networks are a city's irreplaceable social capital. Whenever the capital is lost, from whatever cause, the income from it disappears, never to return until and unless new capital is slowly and chancily accumulated.&quot;|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political science|Political scientist]] Robert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article &quot;An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups&quot; in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.

Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] used the term in 1972 in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdieu 1972&quot;&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. (1972) ''Outline of a Theory of Practice''&lt;/ref&gt; and clarified the term some years later in contrast to [[cultural capital|cultural]], [[economic capital|economic]], administrative capital, [[physical capital]], [[political capital]], social capital and [[symbolic capital]]. Sociologists [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]] (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=James|date=1988|title=Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=94|pages=95–120|citeseerx=10.1.1.208.1462|doi=10.1086/228943|jstor=2780243}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Barry Wellman]] &amp; Scot Wortley (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry, and Scot Wortley. 1990. &quot;Different Strokes from Different Folks: Community Ties and Social Support.&quot; ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' 96:558–88.&lt;/ref&gt; adopted [[Glenn Loury]]'s 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn Loury|Loury, Glenn]]. 1977. &quot;A Dynamic Theory of Racial Income Differences.&quot; Ch. 8 in ''Women, Minorities, and Employment Discrimination'', edited by P. A. Wallace and A. Le Mund.  Lexington, MA: [[Lexington Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of a [[World Bank]] research programme and the subject of several mainstream books, including [[Robert Putnam]]'s ''[[Bowling Alone]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot;&gt;[[Robert Putnam|Putnam, Robert]]. 2000. ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Putnam &amp; [[Lewis Feldstein]]'s ''[[Better Together (book)|Better Together]]''.

All of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=N|year=2000|title=Community Citizenship and the Third Way|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=43|issue=9|pages=1395–1411|doi=10.1177/00027640021955955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and forms ==

Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital for [[policymakers]] is linked to the concept's duality, coming because &quot;it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.&quot; For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain;&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, D (2005) ''Social Capital'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions. 

Social capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Moran|first1=Peter|year=2005|title=Structural vs. Relational embeddedness: Social capital and managerial performance|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8190f9589b689b28b65d4e87fb6f9f6587d7fe95|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1129–1151|doi=10.1002/smj.486}}&lt;/ref&gt; the growth of entrepreneurial firms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stam|display-authors=etal|year=2014|title=Social capital of entrepreneurs and small firm performance: A meta-analysis of contextual and methodological moderators|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=29|issue=1|pages=152–173|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved performance of functionally diverse groups,&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Carson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the value derived from strategic alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Koka and Prescott 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced supply-chain relations.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath and Sparks 2005&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors&quot; (Baker 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;619).

Early attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital as a resource should be used for public good or for the benefit of individuals. [[Robert D. Putnam]] (1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast to those focusing on the individual benefit derived from the web of social relationships and ties individual actors find themselves in, attribute social capital to increased personal access to information and skill sets and enhanced power.&lt;ref&gt;Uzzi and Dunlap 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, individuals could use social capital to further their own career prospects, rather than for the good of organisations.

[[Nan Lin]]'s concept of social capital has a more individualistic approach: &quot;Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.&quot; This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson.&lt;ref&gt;as noted in Lin, Nan (2001). ''Social Capital'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Newton (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Newton|first1=Kenneth|year=1997|title=Social Capital and Democracy|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=40|issue=5|pages=575–586|doi=10.1177/0002764297040005004}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered social capital as subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes which influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation of [[intellectual capital]], suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nahapiet|first1=J.|last2=Ghoshal|first2=S.|year=1998|title=Social capital, intellectual capital and the organizational advantage|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=23|issue=2|pages=242–266|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.8940|doi=10.5465/amr.1998.533225|jstor=259373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definitional issues ===

A number of scholars have raised concerns about lack of precise definition of social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including in [[mainstream media]], that &quot;the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesser2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alejandro Portes|title=Knowledge and Social Capital: Foundations and Applications|date=1 February 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7507-7222-8|editor=Eric L. Lesser|pages=33|chapter=Social Capital: Its Origins and Applications in Modern Sociology|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQdKAf8-_yUC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[capital (economics)|capital]]'' is used by [[analogy]] with other forms of [[economic capital]], as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy with capital is misleading to the extent that, unlike traditional forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bollier]]: ''The Cornucopia of the Commons]'' ([http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/reclaiming-the-commons/the-cornucopia-of-the-commons link]), [[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|''yes!'' magazine]], 30 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; in fact it is depleted by non-use (''use it or lose it''). In this respect, it is similar to the now well-established economic concept of [[human capital]].

Robison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) reviewed various definitions of social capital and concluded that many did not satisfy the formal requirement of a definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robison|first1=L.J.|last2=Schmid|first2=A.A.|last3=Siles|first3=M.E.|year=2002|title=Is Social Capital Really Capital?|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=60|pages=1–21|citeseerx=10.1.1.195.8949|doi=10.1080/00346760110127074}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that definitions must be of the form A=B while many definition of social capital described what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, and what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definition of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined as ''[[sympathy]]'': the object of another's sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; One of the main advantages of having social capital is that it provides access to resources on preferential terms. Their definition of sympathy follows that used by [[Adam Smith]], the title of his first chapter in the [[The Theory of Moral Sentiments|''Theory of Moral Sentiments'']].

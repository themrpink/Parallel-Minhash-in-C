===Roman and Byzantine periods===
During the Roman period, Jenin was called &quot;Ginae&quot; and was settled exclusively by Samaritans (Heb. כותים). The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities'' (Book xx, chapter vi, verse 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical commentator [[F. W. Farrar]] raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, &quot;the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to [[Judea]] over [[Mount Tabor]]] would arrive&quot;, was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in [[Luke's Gospel]] at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, F. W., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/9.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Luke 9, accessed 11 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics dating from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era have been found here.&lt;ref&gt;Dauphin, 1998, p. 750&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslim Arab conquest of the Levant]] from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, &quot;is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon172&quot;&gt;Sharon 2017, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
Jenin came under [[Crusaders|Crusader]] rule in 1103.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalidi&quot;/&gt; The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon172&quot;/&gt; to distinguish it from the town of [[Zir'in]], which they called &quot;Petit Grin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalidi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_By7AAAAIAAJ |first=W.|last=Khalidi|authorlink=Walid Khalidi|year=1992|location=[[Washington D.C.]]|publisher=[[Institute for Palestine Studies]]|isbn=0-88728-224-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Crusaders it was a small [[seigniory]], forming part of the [[Principality of Galilee]] or the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon172&quot;/&gt; 

Shortly before the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, Jenin was captured by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[Saladin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon172&quot;/&gt; who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boas&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeology of the Military Orders: A Survey of the Urban Centres, Rural Settlements and Castles of the Military Orders in the Latin East (c.1120-1291) |first=Adrian|last=Boas|year=2006|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1220s, the geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] described Jenin as &quot;a small and beautiful town, lying between [[Nabulus]] and [[Beisan]], in the Jordan Province.

In 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, [[an-Nasir Yusuf]], and the first [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan in Egypt, [[Izz al-Din Aybak]], to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the [[Jordan River]], and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of [[Safed]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon174&quot;/&gt; In the late 13th century, Mamluk [[emir]]s (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan [[Qalawun]] ({{reign|1279|1290}}) &quot;to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of '[[Acre, Israel|Akka]], so as to protect the coast and the merchants.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ayalonp168&gt;Ayalon and Sharon, 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PehCQz9Rt8oC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=jenin+mamluk&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=jenin%20mamluk&amp;f=false p. 168].&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the stations of the Mamluk ''[[barid]]'' (postal route) between the Mamluk capital [[Cairo]] and [[Damascus]], it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon174&quot;&gt;Sharon 2017, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The geographer [[Al-Dimashqi (geographer)|al-Dimashqi]] mentioned Jenin around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in le Strange, 1890, p.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of the [[Lajjun|Lajjun Sanjak]] (Lajjun District).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon174&quot;/&gt; The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak.&lt;ref&gt;Rhode 1979, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turabay dynasty]] was the ruling house of the [[Bedouin]] Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon 2017, pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[daftar|tax register]]s from 1548–1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 [[akçe]]. All of the revenue went to a ''[[waqf]]'' (religious endownment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri|Qansuh al-Ghuri]] ({{reign|1501|1516}}).&lt;ref name=HA160/&gt; Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed ''[[sanjak-bey]]'' (district governor) by the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Husayn 1985, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the ''[[beylerbey]]'' (provincial governor) of [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]] that the stone [[caravanserai]] of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun ''sanjak-bey'' in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to [[Jerusalem]] and [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon 2017, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between [[Mount Carmel]] and [[Caesarea]], made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon 2017, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and ''sanjak-beys'' of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it &quot;does not exist anymore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon178&quot;&gt;Sharon 2017, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharon178&quot;/&gt; During the conflict between [[Fakhr al-Din II|Fakhr al-Din]] of the [[Ma'n dynasty]], who governed the sanjaks of [[Sidon-Beirut Sanjak|Sidon-Beirut]] and [[Safad Sanjak|Safed]], and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and ''sanjak-bey'' of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Husayn 1985, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and [[Ajlun]].&lt;ref name=Doumanip39&gt;Doumani, 1995, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt]] which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Quataertp107&gt;Quataert 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OX3lsOrXJGcC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, some members of the [[Jarrar clan|Jarrar family]], who formed part of the ''mallakin'' (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in [[Haifa]] to set up an export enterprise there.&lt;ref name=Yazbakp150&gt;Yazbak 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPseCvbPsKsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA150&amp;dq=jenin+ottoman&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=jenin%20ottoman&amp;f=false p. 150].&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birzeit.academia.edu/Hamedsalem/Papers/1202529/The_Archaeology_of_Warfare_Local_Chiefdoms_and_Settlement_Systems_in_the_Jenin_Region_during_the_Ottoman_Period_of_Palestine|title=The Archaeology of Warfare: Local Chiefdoms and Settlement Systems in the Jenin Region during the Ottoman Period of Palestine|author=Hamed Salem|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French explorer [[Victor Guérin|Guérin]] visited in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1874, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptionsam01gu#page/327/mode/1up 327]–[https://archive.org/stream/descriptionsam01gu#page/332/mode/1up 332]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s ''[[PEF Survey of Palestine|Survey of Western Palestine]]'' described Jenin as &quot;The capital of the district, the seat of a [[Caimacam]], a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II,  pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/44/mode/1up 44] -45&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate period===
[[File:British bombing of Jenin, 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings in Jenin dynamited by British forces, 1938]]

According to a [[1922 census of Palestine|census]] conducted in 1922 by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Jenin had a population of 2,637, consisting of 2,307 Muslims, 7 Jews, 108 Christians, 212 Hindus and 3 Sikhs.&lt;ref name=census1922/&gt; From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory]] authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on &quot;an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage&quot; that caused the British administration &quot;grave concern,&quot; according to a British report to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/gordon-corera/british-jenin|title=The British in Jenin|first=Gordon  |last=Corera |authorlink=Gordon Corera|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city played an important role in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], prompted by the death of [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of [[Ya'bad]] months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. After ordering the inhabitants to leave, about one quarter of the town was blown up.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The British in Jenin&quot;, ''History Today'', July 2002, [[Gordon Corera]], pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenin was used by [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]]'s [[Arab Liberation Army]] as a base.

===1948 War===
{{further|Battle of Jenin (1948)}}
In the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the city was defended by the [[Iraqi Army]], then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's [[Carmeli Brigade]] during the &quot;Ten Days' fighting&quot; following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber|Gelber, Yoav]] (2004) &quot;''Independence Versus Nakba''&quot;; [[Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir]] Publishing, {{ISBN|965-517-190-6}}, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical [[Battle for Jerusalem]], and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.

===Jordanian control===
In the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and after the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], Jenin came under [[Jordan]]ian rule. It was [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexed by Jordan]] in 1950.

The Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.

The [[Jordan]]ian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.&lt;ref name=Jordan1961/&gt;

Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died.

'''Gaius Julius Vindex''' (c.

However, with the assassination of Agrippina by [[Nero]], this faction was dissolved.  

In either late 67 or early 68 he rebelled against [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Nero]]. Though the aims of his followers may have been more complex, Vindex, as a senator, probably had the aim simply of replacing Nero with a better emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Murison, ''Galba, Otho and Vitellius: Careers and Controversies (Spudasmata: Studien zur Klassichen Philologie und ihren Grenzgebieten)'', p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[Cassius Dio]], Vindex &quot;was powerful in body and of shrewd intelligence, was skilled in warfare and full of daring for any great enterprise; and he had a passionate love of freedom and a vast ambition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 63.22.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In order to gain support, he declared his allegiance to the then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], [[Galba|Servius Sulpicius Galba]], as the new emperor, but the commander of the [[Germania Superior]] army, [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]] advanced against him.  The battle between their two forces took place near  Vesontio (modern [[Besançon]]).  What occurred then is unclear, but, despite a meeting between Verginius and Vindex, the forces under Verginius seem to have decided on a battle without orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard-330&quot;&gt;H. H. Scullard, ''From the Gracchi to Nero'', p.&amp;nbsp;330&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for plunder and the weakness of Verginius as a commander are possible explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Murison, ''Galba, Otho and Vitellius'',  p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; Vindex was defeated in the resulting battle and subsequently committed suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scullard-330&quot; /&gt; 

By June 68, military support for Galba led to Nero committing suicide. Galba, acclaimed by the Senate, struck coins to commemorate Vindex, to whom he owed his position as emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vagi2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David L.

Following normal Roman procedures, his name Gaius Julius indicated that his family had likely been given citizenship under [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], or perhaps Emperor [[Augustus]] or [[Caligula]].

'''Rigging''' comprises the system of ropes, cables and chains, which support a [[sailing ship]] or [[sail boat]]'s masts—''standing rigging'', including [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] and [[Stays (nautical)|stays]]—and which adjust the position of the vessel's sails and spars to which they are attached—the ''running rigging'', including [[halyard]]s, [[Braces (sailing)|braces]], [[Sheet (sailing)|sheets]] and [[Gaff vang|vang]]s.&lt;ref name = Oxford&gt;

The [[Finnish Air Force]] ordered 64 F-18C/Ds (57 C models, seven D models). All F-18D were built at St Louis, and then all F-18C were assembled in Finland. Delivery of the aircraft started in November 1995 and ended in August 2000.&lt;ref name=Senior_p33&gt;Senior, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hornet replaced the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21bis]] and [[Saab 35 Draken]] in Finnish service. The Finnish Hornets were initially to be used only for air defense, hence the F-18 designation. The F-18C includes the ASPJ (Airborne-Self-Protection-Jammer) jamming pod ALQ-165.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins_p100-1&quot;&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Navy later included the ALQ-165 on their F/A-18E/F Super Hornet procurement.

Finland is upgrading its fleet of F-18s with new avionics, including helmet mounted sights (HMS), new cockpit displays, sensors and standard [[NATO]] [[data link]]. Several of the remaining Hornets are going to be fitted to carry air-to-ground ordnance such as the [[AGM-158 JASSM]], in effect returning to the original F/A-18 multi-role configuration. The upgrade includes also the procurement and integration of new AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles. This Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) is estimated to cost between €1–1.6&amp;nbsp;billion and work is scheduled to be finished by 2016.

The [[Spanish Air Force]] (''Ejército del Aire'') ordered 60 EF-18A model and 12 EF-18B model Hornets (the &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;España&quot;, Spain), named respectively as C.15 and CE.15 by Spanish AF.&lt;ref name=Senior&gt;Senior.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish version was delivered from 22 November 1985 to July 1990.&lt;ref name=Boeing_Milestones/&gt;&lt;ref name=Senior_p25&gt;Senior, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; These fighters were upgraded to F-18A+/B+ standard, close to F/A-18C/D (plus version includes later mission and armament computers, databuses, data-storage set, new wiring, pylon modifications and software, new abilities as AN/AAS-38B NITE Hawk targeting FLIR pods).

In 1995 Spain obtained 24 ex-USN F/A-18A Hornets, with six more on option. These were delivered from December 1995 until December 1998.&lt;ref name=Senior_p27&gt;Senior, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Before delivery, they were modified to EF-18A+ standard.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p93&gt;Jenkins 2000, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first sale of USN surplus Hornets.

Spanish Hornets operate as an all-weather interceptor 60% of the time and as an all-weather day/night attack aircraft for the remainder. In case of war, each of the front-line squadrons would take a primary role: 121 is tasked with tactical air support and maritime operations; 151 and 122 are assigned to all-weather interception and air combat roles; and 152 is assigned the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses|SEAD]] mission. Air refueling is provided by KC-130Hs and Boeing 707TTs. Pilot conversion to EF-18 is centralized in 153 Squadron (Ala 15). Squadron 462's role is air defense of the [[Canary Islands]], being responsible for fighter and attack missions from Gando AB.

Spanish Air Force EF-18 Hornets have flown Ground Attack, SEAD, combat air patrol (CAP) combat missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, under NATO command, in Aviano detachment (Italy). They shared the base with Canadian and USMC F/A-18s. Six Spanish Hornets had been lost in accidents by 2003.&lt;ref name=Senior/&gt;

Over Yugoslavia, eight EF-18s, based at Aviano AB, participated in bombing raids in [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]] in 1999. Over Bosnia, they also performed missions for air-to-air combat air patrol, close air support air-to-ground, photo reconnaissance, forward air controller-airborne, and tactical air controller-airborne.

In late 2007, Switzerland requested to be included in the F/A-18C/D Upgrade 25 Program, to extend the useful life of its F/A-18C/Ds. The program includes significant upgrades to the avionics and mission computer, 12 ATFLIR surveillance and targeting pods, and 44 sets of [[AN/ALR-67]]v3 ECM equipment. In October 2008, the Swiss Hornet fleet reached the 50,000 flight hour milestone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milaviapress.com/news/archive/2008.php#48 &quot;Swiss Hornets reach 50,000 flight hours milestone&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019024440/http://www.milaviapress.com/news/archive/2008.php#48 |date=19 October 2008 }}.

The F/A-18A and F-18L land-based version competed for a fighter contract from Greece in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201927.html &quot;Greek fighter marathon nears end.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926010545/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201927.html |date=26 September 2009 }} ''Flight International'', 31 July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek government chose F-16 and [[Mirage 2000]] instead.

==Variants==
[[File:US Navy 050803-N-0295M-148 An F-A-18B Hornet, assigned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, folds-up its landing gear after taking off for a training flight from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md.jpg|thumb|An F/A-18B Hornet assigned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School|alt=]]
[[File:A-18D VMFAT 101.jpg|thumb|A Marine F/A-18D of [[VMFAT-101]] prepares for takeoff|alt=]]

===A/B===
The ''F/A-18A'' is the single-seat variant and the ''F/A-18B'' is the two-seat variant. The space for the two-seat cockpit is provided by a relocation of avionics equipment and a 6% reduction in internal fuel; two-seat Hornets are otherwise fully combat-capable. The B-model is used primarily for training.

In 1992, the original [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]] [[AN/APG-65]] radar was replaced with the Hughes (now [[Raytheon]]) [[AN/APG-73]], a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 are designated ''F/A-18A+''.

===C/D===
The ''F/A-18C'' is the single-seat variant and the ''F/A-18D'' is the two-seat variant. The D-model can be configured for training or as an all-weather strike craft. The &quot;missionized&quot; D model's rear seat is configured for a Marine Corps [[Naval Flight Officer]] who functions as a Weapons and Sensors Officer to assist in operating the weapons systems. The F/A-18D is primarily operated by the U.S. Marine Corps in the night attack and [[Forward air control|Forward Air Controller]] (Airborne) (FAC(A)) roles.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p64&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FA-18 inverted above an F-14.jpg|thumb|An F/A-18 inverted above an [[F-14]]]]
The F/A-18C and D models are the result of a block upgrade in 1987&lt;ref name=Boeing_Milestones/&gt; incorporating upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] air-to-air missile and [[AGM-65 Maverick]]&lt;ref name=FedAmSci/&gt; and [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] air-to-surface missiles. Other upgrades include the [[Martin-Baker]] NACES (Navy Aircrew Common [[ejection seat]]), and a self-protection jammer. A [[synthetic aperture radar|synthetic aperture ground mapping radar]] enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]] AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, the [[Loral Space &amp; Communications|Loral]] [[AN/AAS-38|AN/AAS-38 NITE Hawk]] [[FLIR]] (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) [[multi-function display]] (MFDs) and a color moving map.&lt;ref name=FedAmSci/&gt;

In addition, 60 D-model Hornets are configured as the night attack ''F/A-18D (RC)'' with ability for reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p64/&gt;  These could be outfitted with the [[ATARS]] electro-optical sensor package that includes a sensor pod and equipment mounted in the place of the M61 cannon.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p66&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 66–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1992, the F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engine, providing approximately 10% more maximum static thrust became the standard Hornet engine.&lt;ref name=Warplanes&gt;Donald, David. &quot;Boeing F/A-18 Hornet&quot;. ''Warplanes of the Fleet''. AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-880588-81-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1993, the AAS-38A NITE Hawk added a designator/ranger laser, allowing it to self-mark targets. The later AAS-38B added the ability to strike targets designated by lasers from other aircraft.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p61&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 61–62, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the C- and D- models ended in 2000. The last F/A-18C was assembled in Finland and delivered to the Finnish Air Force in August 2000.&lt;ref name=Senior_p33/&gt; The last F/A-18D was delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps in August 2000.&lt;ref name=Senior_p37/&gt;

In April 2018, the US Navy announced the retirement of the F/A-18C from combat roles after a final deployment that had ended the month prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/us/navy-retires-f-a-18c-hornet-from-combat-as-f-35c-nears-operational-status-1.522981|title=Navy retires F/A-18C Hornet from combat as F-35C nears operational status|access-date=20 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421030631/https://www.stripes.com/news/us/navy-retires-f-a-18c-hornet-from-combat-as-f-35c-nears-operational-status-1.522981|archive-date=21 April 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===E/F Super Hornet===

[[File:FA-18F-USN-RedRippers-20070406.jpg|thumb|A [[VFA-11]] F/A-18F Super Hornet performing evasive maneuvers during an air power demonstration above {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75}}]]

The single-seat ''F/A-18E'' and two-seat ''F/A-18F'', both officially named ''Super Hornet'', carry over the name and design concept of the original F/A-18 but have been extensively redesigned by McDonnell Douglas. The Super Hornet has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful [[General Electric F414|GE F414]] engines based on F/A-18's F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps' F/A-18D, the Navy's F/A-18F carries a [[naval flight officer]] as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer (WSO) role.  The Super Hornet is unofficially known as &quot;Rhino&quot; in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org - Ask Us - F-18E/F Rhino|website=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185621/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|title=F/A-18 Super Hornet/Rhino|website=aero-pix.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407114521/http://www.aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|archive-date=7 April 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|title=F/A-18E/F Rhino Breaks Speed of Sound|website=Military.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224232429/http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia.

===G Growler===
{{main|Boeing EA-18G Growler}}
The EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007. The Growler has replaced the Navy's [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowler]] and carries a Naval Flight Officer as a second crewman in an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) role.

===Other US variants===
;F-18(R): This was a proposed reconnaissance version of the F/A-18A. It included a sensor package that replaced the 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon. The first of two prototypes flew in August 1984. Small numbers were produced.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p66/&gt;

;RF-18D: Proposed two-seat reconnaissance version for the US Marine Corps in the mid-1980s. It was to carry a radar reconnaissance pod. The system was canceled after it was unfunded in 1988. This ability was later realized on the F/A-18D(RC).&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p66/&gt;

;[[X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing]]: A NASA F/A-18 has been modified to demonstrate the Active Aeroelastic Wing technology, and was designated ''X-53'' in December 2006.

===Export variants===
''These designations are not part of [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]].''

;F-18L: A proposed land-based export version of the single-seat F-18A with [[air-superiority fighter|air-superiority]] and [[attack aircraft|attack]] capabilities. This variant was to be lightened by the removal of carrier landing capability and assembled by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]].  Customers preferred the standard Hornet and the F-18L never entered mass production.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

:&quot;F/A-18A&quot; was the original company designation, designations of &quot;AF-18A&quot; &amp; &quot;ATF-18A&quot; have also been applied. Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a [[aircraft catapult|catapult attachment]], replacing the carrier [[tailhook]] with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an [[Instrument Landing System]]. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet's avionics even further. Since 2019 9 AF-18A have been delivered to Canada to be converted as CF-18A.

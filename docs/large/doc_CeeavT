The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the [[Siculo-Norman]] state in the former [[Roman province of Africa]]{{efn|Before it was finally conquered by the Muslims, this province was reorganised as the [[Exarchate of Africa|Byzantine exarchate of Africa]].}} (''[[Ifrīqiya]]'' in [[Tunisian Arabic]]), corresponding to [[Tunisia]] and parts of [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] today.  The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim);&lt;ref&gt;All the Arabic sources can be found in Michele Amari, ''Biblioteca arabo-sicula'' (Rome and Turin: 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since &quot;Africa&quot; was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, &quot;one ought not to speak of a 'Norman kingdom of Africa'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Houben, ''Roger II'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, &quot;[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya.&quot;&lt;ref name=dalli79&gt;Dalli, &quot;Bridging Europe and Africa&quot;, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under [[Roger II]] in 1146–48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded.  Early in the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the &quot;kingdom&quot; of Africa fell to the [[Almohads]] (1158–60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.

===Conquest of Tripoli and Mahdia===
In 1142/3, Roger II attacked [[Tripoli]], further south down the coast from Mahdia. In 1146 he besieged it and took it. The city had already been depleted by a series of famines and was practically in a state of civil war when Roger's troops assaulted it. It was still an important port on the sea route from the Maghreb to Egypt.&lt;ref name=abulafia33&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the minor emirs in the vicinity of Tripoli sought Sicilian overlordship after this. Yūsuf, the ruler of Gabès, wrote to Roger requesting &quot;the robes and letter of appointment making me ''[[Wali (administrative title)|wāli]]'' of Gabès, and I shall be your deputy there, as are the [[Banū Matrūh]] who hold Tripoli from you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 34, quoting Ibn al-Athīr, ''[[The Complete History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger complied and Yūsuf, in his new robes, read out the letter of appointment to an assemblage of notables. Gabès had long been an irritant to Mahdia, and al-Hasan of Mahdia attacked it and brought back Yūsuf to Mahdia, and stoned him to death. It is possible that Roger's attack on Mahdia in 1148 was a response to this insubordination on the part of its emir, but Ibn al-Athīr suggested that Roger was merely taking advantage of a famine in Africa, despite the fact that he had a treaty with al-Hasan until 1150.

In June 1148 Roger sent his admiral [[George of Antioch]], a former Mahdian officer, against al-Hasan. Off the island of [[Pantelleria]] the Sicilian fleet encountered a Mahdia ship bearing some carrier pigeons. George had the birds sent home with false messages that the fleet was headed for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. When the Sicilians reached Mahdia on 22 June, the emir and his court fled the unprepared city leaving their treasure behind. This was seized as booty, but the Sicilians were given only two hours to plunder the city while its Muslim inhabitants took refuge in Christian homes and churches. Roger quickly issued a royal protection, or ''amān'', to all the city's inhabitants. According to [[Ibn abī-Dīnār]], George &quot;restored both cities of Zawīla and Mahdiyya; lent money to the merchants; gave alms to the poor; placed the administration of justice in the hands of ''[[qadi]]'' acceptable to the population; and arranged well the government of these two cities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was released to encourage refugees to return.

On 1 July the city of [[Sousse]] (Susa), ruled by al-Hasan's son 'Ali, surrendered without a fight, and 'Ali fled to his father in [[Almohad Morocco]]. On 12 July [[Sfax]] fell after a short resistance. The Africans &quot;were treated humanely&quot; and an ''amān'' full of &quot;fine promises&quot; was granted for the entire province, according to Ibn al-Athīr.&lt;ref name=abulafia35&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun]], in his ''Kitab al-Ibar'', records the abuse the Christians of Sfax heaped on their Muslim neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 42 n. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The Banū Matrūh were left in power in Tripoli, and in Sfax Roger appointed Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furrīānī, whose father was brought to Sicily as a hostage for his son's good behaviour. The Arabic sources are unanimous in presenting Umar's father as encouraging his son to rebel nonetheless.&lt;ref name=abulafia37&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Barasht (Bresk) and the isles of [[Kerkennah]] fell to Roger, as did the unruly desert tribes. After the brief period of conquest and acquisition, &quot;the dominion of the Franks [Normans] extended from Tripoli to the borders of Tunis, and from the western Maghrib to Qayrawan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 35, quoting Ibn al-Athīr.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submission of Tunis and internal unrest===

Roger became involved in a war with Byzantium after 1148, and so was unable to follow up his conquests with an attack on [[Tunis]]. In fear, the Tunisians sent grain to Sicily in hopes of averting an attack, according to Ibn Idhari. This should probably be seen as tribute and submission, since Ibn Idhar writes that Roger was still in power in the city when the Almohads attacked it in 1159, although he was in fact dead.&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 35, quoting Ibn Idhari.&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian chronicler [[Andrea Dandolo]] is probably correct in asserting: &quot;and the kings of Tunis paid him [Roger] tribute&quot; (''regemque Tunixii sibi tributarium fecit'').&lt;ref name=abulafia35/&gt; Roger died in 1154, and was succeeded by his son [[William I of Sicily|William I]], who continued to rule Africa. His accession was taken for an opportunity by the native officials, who clamoured for more powers to tax. The Arabic historians Ibn al-Athīr and Ibn Khaldun, both hoped that Roger would defend his African lands against Almohad extremism and intolerance. After his death, some Muslim officials demanded that sermons be preached against the Almohads in the mosques.&lt;ref name=abulafia42&gt;Abulafia, &quot;The Norman Kingdom of Africa&quot;, 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almohads (al-Muwahiddin)==
{{Main|History of medieval Tunisia}}

The only strong Muslim power then in the [[Maghreb]] was at the newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber [[Abd al-Mu'min]]. He responded in several military campaigns which by 1160 compelled the Normans to retreat back to Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, A History of the Maghrib (Cambridge Univ. 19) p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Haskins, ''The Normans in European History'' (New York 1915, reprint Norton Library 1966) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The Almohads were also successful in driving off incursions by the [[Ayyubids]] in the 1180s, although they managed to occupy southern coastal areas intermittently during this period.&lt;ref&gt;http://al-qantara.revistas.csic.es/index.php/al-qantara/article/download/303/294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement and Empire===

[[Image:Almohad dynasty 1147 - 1269 (AD).PNG|thumb|left|Almohad Empire (1147–1269) at it greatest extent.]]

The [[Almohad]] movement [Arabic ''al-Muwahhidun'', &quot;the Unitarians&quot;] ruled variously in the Maghrib starting about 1130 until 1248 (locally until 1275).&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'' (San Francisco: HarperCollins 1989) pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 3, 41, 48–49, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Almohad&quot; is from the Spanish for the Arabic ''al-Muwahhidun''. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 105 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement had been founded by [[Ibn Tumart]] (1077–1130), a [[Masmuda]] Berber from the [[Atlas mountains]] of Morocco, who became the [[mahdi]]. After a pilgrimage to Mecca followed by study, he had returned to the Maghrib about 1218 inspired by the teachings of [[al-Ash'ari]] and [[al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 103, stating at although Ibn Tumart was clearly influenced by al-Ghazali, the two never personally met (citing Goldziher).&lt;/ref&gt; A charismatic leader, he preached an interior awareness of the Unity of God.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries'' (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 3–11, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; A puritan and a hard-edged reformer, he gathered a strict following among the Berbers in the Atlas, founded a radical community, and eventually began an armed challenge to the current rulers, the [[Almoravids]] (1056–1147).&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau reports (and criticizes) the story that the Almoravids (with Maliki legal backing) burned the book ''Revival of Religious Sciences'' by Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), which was said to have antagonized Ibn Tumart. Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement in North Africa'' (1969) pp. 6–8, 14&lt;/ref&gt; These Almoravids [Arabic ''al-Murabitun'', from ''Ribat'', e.g., &quot;defenders&quot;] had also been a Berber Islamic movement of the Maghrib,&lt;ref&gt;Predominantly of the [[Sanhaja]] confederacy of Berbers (then located across the far west Sahara), led particularly by the [[Lamtuna]] tribe. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 92–96, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr compares the earlier [[Kharijites]] (since localized near [[Jerba]] in southern Tunisia), the [[Almoravids]], and the [[Almohads]], each a Berber movement rebellious against a lax Arab orthodoxy, each movement seeking to achieve &quot;leading the Muslim good life [as] the professed aim of politics&quot;. Abun-Nasr (1971) p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; which had run its course and since become decadent and weak.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'' (San Francisco: HarperCollins 1989) pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Almoravids had once ruled from [[Mauritania]] (south of Morocco) toal-Andalus (southern Spain), Almoravid rule had never reached to Infriqiya.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ibn Tumart's death, [[Abd al-Mu'min]]al-Kumi (c.1090–1163) became the Almohad caliph, circa 1130.&lt;ref&gt;Abd al-Mu'min was the first non–Arab to take the caliphal title ''amiral-mu'minin'' [commander of the faithful]. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Abd al-Mu'min had been one of the original &quot;Ten&quot; followers of Ibn Tumart.&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately had attacked the ruling [[Almoravids]] and had wrestled Morocco away from them by 1147, suppressing subsequent revolts there. Then he crossed the straits, occupying [[al-Andalus]] (in  Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately, as a result of the Almohad invasion, whose zealots forced many of the conquered to choose between conversion or flight, the family of the Jewish philosopher and [[Talmud]]ist, [[Maimonides|Moshe ben Maimon]], then thirteen, had to flee [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] in 1148, eventually finding safety in [[Fatimid]] Egypt. Isaac Husik, ''A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy'' (Macmillan 1916, reprint Philadelphia 1940) p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many Jews eventually entered España. Yitzhak Baer, ''A History of the Jews in Christian Spain'' translated from Hebrew (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1961) pp. I:46–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seventy years later in 1212 defeat at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] proved to be a turning point not only for the Almohads (then under [[Muhammad an-Nasir]]), but also for Muslim rule in [[Andalucia]], España. Joseph Callaghan, ''A History of Medieval Spain'' (Cornell Univ. 1975) pp. 234, 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1152 he successfully invaded the [[Hammadid]]s of [[Bougie]] (in Algeria). His armies intervened in [[Zirid]] Ifriqiya, removing the Christian [[Sicily|Sicilians]] by 1160.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement in North Africa in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries'' (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 48–57, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Italian merchants from [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]] had already arrived, continuing the foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Italian merchants, as well as those of [[Aragon]], came to predominate in the western Mediterranean trade of the Maghrib starting in the Almohad era. Laroui (1977), pp. 201, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Abd al-Mu'min briefly presided over a unified Northwest African empire––the first and last in its history under indigenous rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia. Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the high point of Maghribi political unity. Yet twenty years later, by 1184, the revolt by the [[Banu Ghaniya]] had spread from the [[Balearic Islands]] to Ifriqiya ([[Tunisia]]), causing problems for the Almohad regime for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of the Maghrib===

[[Ibn Tumart]], the Almohad founder, left writings in which his theological ideas mix with the political. Therein he claimed that the leader, the mahdi, is infallible.&lt;ref&gt;An idea some [[sunni]] condemn as unorthodox, i.e., as similar to the [[shi'ite|shi'a]]. Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His writing are contained in ''Le Livre de Mohammed Ibn Toumert'' [The Book of M. ibn Tumart], edited by Jean–Dominique Luciani (Algiers 1903), introduced by [[Ignaz Goldziher]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Tumart created a hierarchy from among his followers which persisted long after the Almohad era (i.e., in Tunisia under the [[Hafsids]]), based not only on a specie of ethnic loyalty,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Every member of the community had to belong to a tribe&quot; under the control of their chief. Too, only Berbers of the Masmuda tribe could claim the title ''muwahiddin'' (Almohad). Abun-Nasr ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 105, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the &quot;Council of Fifty&quot; [''ahl al-Khamsin''], and the assembly of &quot;Seventy&quot; [''ahl al-Saqa''], but more significantly based on a formal structure for an inner circle of governance at would transcend tribal loyalties, namely, (a) his ''ahl al-dar'' or &quot;people of the house&quot;, a sort of privy council, (b) his ''ahl al-'Ashra'' or the &quot;Ten&quot;, originally composed of his first ten followers, and (c) a variety of offices. Ibn Tumart trained his own ''talaba'' or ideologists, as well as his ''huffaz'', who function was both religious and military. There is lack of certainty about some details, but general agreement at Ibn Tumart sought to reduce the &quot;influence of the traditional tribal framework.&quot; Later historical developments &quot;were greatly facilitated by his original reorganization because it made possible collaboration among tribes&quot; not likely to otherwise coalesce.&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; These organizing and group solidarity preparations made by Ibn Tumart were &quot;most methodical and efficient&quot; and a &quot;conscious replica&quot; of the Medina period of the prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mahdi Ibn Tumart also had championed the idea of strict Islamic law and morals displacing unorthodox aspects of Berber custom.&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) pt. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Ibn Tumart condemned unveiled women and musical instruments. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; at his early base at Tinmal, Ibn Tumart functioned as &quot;the custodian of the faith, the arbiter of moral questions, and the chief judge.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet because of the narrow legalism then common among [[Maliki]] jurists and because of their influence in the Almoravid regime,&lt;ref&gt;In al-Andalus the Maliki school had turned inward to develop only those issues already present in its own [[fiqh]]; this had led to the burning of al-Ghazali's book. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1970, 1977) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Tumart did not favor the Maliki school of law; nor did he favor any of the four recognized [[madhhab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Marshall Hodgson states that the Almohads did follow the [[Zahiri]] [[madhhab]]. ''The Venture of Islam'' in II:269. The Zahiris, not one of the recognized four, taught a &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of the sources of law.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the Maliki school of law survived and by default eventually functioned in an official fashion (except during the reign of [[Abu Yusuf Ya'qub]]al-Mansur (1184–1199) who was loyal to Ibn Tumart's teachings). After of century of oscillation, the caliph Abu al-'Ala Idris al-Ma'mun broke with the narrow ideology of prior Almohad regimes (first articulated by the mahdi Ibn Tumart) at had continued to function on and off, and for the most part, at the end, poorly; circa 1230, he affirmed the reinstitution of the then-reviving Malikite rite, perennially popular in al-Maghrib.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 111, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement'' (1969) pp. 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Averroes closeup.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ibn Rushd of Córdoba in detail from fresco &quot;[[The School of Athens]]&quot; by [[Raphael]]]]

The Muslim philosophers [[Ibn Tufayl]] (Abubacer to the Latins) of Granada (d.1185), and [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroës) of Córdoba (1126–1198), who was also appointed a Maliki judge, were dignitaries known to the Almohad court, whose capital became fixed at [[Marrakech]]. The sufi master theologian [[Ibn 'Arabi]] was born in Murcia in 1165. Under the Almohads architecture flourished, the Giralda being built in Seville and the pointed arch being introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Grasse, ''A Concise Enciclopedia of Islam'' (San Francisco 1991) pp. 174–175, 176–177, and 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;There is no better indication of the importance of the Almohad empire than the fascination it has exerted on all subsequent rulers in the Maghrib.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah Laroui, ''L'Histoire du Maghreb'' (Paris: Librairie François Masero 1970), translated as ''The History of the Maghrib'' (Princeton Univ. 1977) p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an empire Berber in its inspiration, and whose imperial fortunes were under the direction of Berber leaders. The unitarian Almohads had gradually modified the original ambition of strictly implementing their founder's designs; in this way the Almohads were similar to the preceding Almoravids (also Berber). Yet their movement probably worked to deepen the religious awareness of the Muslim people across the Maghrib. Nonetheless, it could not suppress other traditions and teachings, and alternative expressions of Islam, including the popular cult of saints, the [[sufis]], as well as the Maliki jurists, survived.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Abdallah Laroui, ''L'Histoire du Maghreb'' (Paris: Librairie François Masero 1970), translated as ''The History of the Maghrib'' (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 186–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sufis mystical orders spread after the collapse of the Almohad regime. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Almohad empire (like its predecessor the Almoravid) eventually weakened and dissolved. Except for the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, Spain was lost. In Morocco, the Almohads were to be followed by the [[Merinids]]; in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), by the [[Hafsids]] (who claimed to be the heirs of the unitarian Almohads).&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Grasse, ''A Concise Enciclopedia of Islam'' (San Francisco 1989, 1991) pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hafsid dynasty of Tunis==
The [[Hafsid dynasty]] (1230–1574) succeeded [[Almohad Empire|Almohad]] rule in Ifriqiya, with the Hafsids claiming to represent the true spiritual heritage of its founder, the Mahdi [[Ibn Tumart]] (c.1077–1130). Under the Hafsids, Tunisia would eventually regain for a time cultural primacy in the Maghrib.

===Political chronology===
Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti (or:al-Hintati)&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Abu Hafs 'Umar, son of the first Almohad caliph [['Abd al-Mu'min]] (r.1132–1163), his [[vizier]], and brother of the next caliph Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r.1163–1184). Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement in North Africa'' pp. 67–68; cf., Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the ''Ten'', the crucial early adherents of the ''Almohad'' movement [''al-Muwahhidun''], circa 1121. These ''Ten'' were companions of Ibn Tumart the Mahdi, and formed an inner circle consulted on all important matters. Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti, wounded in battle near [[Marrakesh]] in 1130, was for a long time a powerful figure within the Almohad movement. His son 'Umar al-Hintati was appointed by the Almohad caliph [[Muhammad an-Nasir]] as governor of Ifriqiya in 1207 and served until his death in 1221. His son, the grandson of Abu Hafs, was Abu Zakariya.&lt;ref&gt;Le Tourneau, ''The Almohad Movement in North Africa'' (Princeton Univ. 1969) pp. 24, 27, 32–33, 41, 65–66; Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 102, 108, 115, 120, 141; Laroui, ''History of the Maghrib'' pp. 179–180, 183–184, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tunis Hafsid flag.svg|left|thumb|Flag of Tunis under the Hafsids. (Catalan Atlas, circa 1375)]]

[[Abu Zakariya]]&lt;ref&gt;Abu Zakariya later was also known as Yahya I.&lt;/ref&gt; (1203–1249) served the Almohads in Ifriqiya as governor of [[Gabès]], then in 1226 as governor of [[Tunis]]. In 1229 during disturbances within the Almohad movement, Abu Zakariya declared his independence: hence, the start of the Hafsid dynasty. In the next few years he secured his hold on the cities of Ifriqiya, then captured [[Tripolitania]] (1234) to the east, and [[Algiers]] (1235) to the west and later added [[Tlemcen]] (1242). He solidified his rule among the Berber confederacies. Government structure of the Hafsid state followed the Almohad model, a rather strict centralization. Abu Zakariya's succession to the Almohads was briefly acknowledged in Friday prayer by several states in al-Andalus and in Morocco. Diplomatic relations were opened with Venice, Genoa, Sicily, and [[Aragon]]. Abu Zakariya became the foremost ruler in the [[Maghrib]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah Laroui, ''L'Histoire du Maghreb: Un essai de synthese'' (Paris: Librairie Francois Maspero 1970), translated as ''History of the Maghrib. An interpretive essay'' (Princeton Univ. 1977) pp. 178, 182, 195. Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 141–142, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an historic moment, the son of Abu Zakariya and self-declared caliph of the Hafsids, al-Mustansir&lt;ref&gt;The honorific surname of al-Mustansir was given to Abu 'Abd Allah, son of Au Zakariya. (In Tunisian history there was earlier another Abu 'Abd Allah, namely the Isma'ili ''dai'' who prepared the way for the Fatimid Mahdi; and there was also another Fatimid caliph known as al-Mustansir.)&lt;/ref&gt; (r.1249–1277), was recognised as caliph by Mecca and the Islamic world (1259–1261), following termination of the Abbasid caliphate by the Mongols (in 1258). Yet the moment passed; the Hafsids remained a local sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam'' 2: 291–292, 477. In 1261 Baybars had become sultan of Egypt and he revived the Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1270 King [[Louis IX of France]], whose brother was the king of Sicily, landed an army near Tunis; disease devastated their camp.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''History of the Crusades'' (Cambridge Univ. 1954; Harper reprint 1967) pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Hafsid influence was reduced by the rise of the Moroccan [[Marinids]] of [[Fez]], who captured and lost Tunis twice (1347, and 1357).&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 229–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Hafsid fortunes would recover; two notable rulers being Abu Faris (1394–1434) and his grandson Abu 'Amr 'Uthman (r. 1435–1488).&lt;ref&gt;Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 147–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end, internal disarray within the Hafsid dynasty created vulnerabilities, while a great power struggle arose between Spaniard and Turk over control of the Mediterranean. The Hafsid dynasts became pawns, subject to the rival strategies of the combatants. By 1574 Ifriqiya had been incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp.  48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and Trade===
[[Image:Millobacinomed.JPG|thumb|200px|Bacino del Mediterraneo, dall'Atlante manoscritto del 1582–1584 ca. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Vittorio Emanuele II, Roma (cart. naut. 2 – cart. naut 6/1–2).]]
The entire Maghrib, as well as Tunisia under the early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of prosperity due to the rise of Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., E. Ashtor, ''A Social and Economic History of the Near East in the Middle Ages'' (London: Collins 1976). Trade had quickened in the Mediterranean after the [[Fatimids]] in Egypt took over the trade to [[India]] from the [[Persian Gulf]] ports. In 996 there were said to be at least 160 Italian merchants in [[Cairo]]. Tunis was a major center of this east–west Mediterranean trade, which continued for four hundred years. ''Ibid.'' pp. 195–196. While Cairo sent west the spices of India and raw flax, Tunis chiefly sent silk, olive oil, and soap east. Ibid. pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians led to the development of practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit.&lt;ref&gt;Two commercial letters originally in Arabic sent from Tunis and addressed to merchants of Pisa, dated 1201, can be found in Robert S. Lopez and Irving W. Raymond, ''Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World. Illustrative documents translated with introductions and notes'' (Columbia Univ. 1955, 2001) pp. 384–388 'Solidarity of Muslim and Christian Merchants,' docs. no. 190 and no. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal customs ports were then: [[Tunis]], [[Sfax]], [[Mahdia]], [[Jerba]], and [[Gabes|Gabés]] (in modern Tunisia); [[Oran]], [[Bougie]] (Bejaia), and [[Bône]] (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and [[Tripoli]] (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or ''funduq'', until the duties and fees were paid. The Tunis [[customs|customs service]] was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or ''[[sharif|musharif]]'', called ''al-Caid'', who not only managed the staff collecting [[Duty (economics)|duties]] but also might negotiate [[contracts|commercial agreements]], conclude [[treaties]], and would act as [[judge]] in legal disputes involving foreigners. The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city–of–origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Spencer, ''Algiers in the Age of the Corsairs'' (1976) pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qanun (law)|Islamic law]] during this era had developed a specific institution to regulate community morals, or ''[[hisbah|hisba]]'', which included the order and security of [[Market (place)|public markets]], the supervision of market transactions, and related matters. The urban marketplace [Arabic ''souk'', pl. ''iswak''] was generally a street of shops selling the same or similar commodities (vegetables, cloth, metalware, lumber, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;In the villages and rural areas, there was generally a market day each week at a fixed location for trading and [[bartering]]&lt;/ref&gt; The city official charged with these responsibilities was called the ''[[muhtasib]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knut S. Vikor, ''Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law'' (Oxford Univ. 2004) pp. 195–198. Vikor points out at ''[[hisbah|hisba]]'', which means &quot;balance&quot; in Arabic, also has the sense of ''achieving the common good and acting against evil,'' duties required of all Muslims, but especially of the Sultan. In some current Islamist movements, it can be viewed as license to [[vigilante]] action, e.g., breaking into homes to smash bottles of alcohol. Such private initiative also challenges the legitimacy of the government to keep public order.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' (Oxford Univ. 2003) pp. 114, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In effecting public order in the urban markets, the ''muhtasib'' enforced fair commercial dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local [[price]] to rural people, honest [[weights and measures]], but not quality of goods nor price ''per se''), keeping roadways open, regulating the safety of building construction, ensuring the metal value of existing [[coin]]age and minting new coin. The authority of the ''muhtasib'', with his group of assistants, was somewhere between a ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor or trade commissioner and the mayor or a high city official. Often a leading judge or ''[[mufti]]'' held the position. The ''muhtasib'' did not hear contested [[litigation]], but nonetheless could order the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to [[debtor's prison]], order a shop closed, and expel from the city. The authority of the ''muhtasib'' did not extend into the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Knut S. Vikor, ''Between God and the Sultan. A History of Islamic Law'' (Oxford Univ. 2004) pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period from al-Andalus came Muslim and Jewish immigrants with appreciated talents, e.g., trade connections, crafts, and agricultural techniques. Regarding general prosperity, however, there was a sharp economic decline starting in the fourteenth century due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Laroui, ''History of the Maghrib'' p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, Mediterranean trade gave way to corsair raiding activity. {IN PROGRESS}

===Society and culture===

As a result of the initial prosperity, al-Mustansir transformed his capital [[Tunis]], constructing a palace and the Abu Fihr park; he also created an estate near [[Bizerte]] (said by [[Ibn Khaldun]] to be without equal in the world).&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; An unfortunate divide, however, developed between the governance of the cities and of the countryside; at times the city-based rulers would grant rural tribes autonomy ('iqta') in exchange for their support in intra-maghribi struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''History of the Maghrib'' pp. 211–212 (Banu Hilal), cf. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 145–146 (Beni Sulaim).&lt;/ref&gt; This tribal independence of the central authority meant also at when the center grew weak, the periphery might still remain strong and resilient.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; {IN PROGRESS}

Bedouin Arabs&lt;ref&gt;Here, the Banu Suaim. Most of the Banu Hilal had by this period moved on to Morocco. Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 129, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to arrive into the 13th century; with their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained influential. The Arab language came to be predominant, except for a few Berber-speaking areas, e.g., [[Kharijite]] Djerba, and the desert south. Also, Arab Muslim and Jewish migration continued to come into Ifriqiya from al-Andalus, especially after the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, the last Muslim state ruling on the Iberian peninsula. These newly arriving immigrants brought infusions of the developed arts of [[al-Andalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Andalusian tradition of music and poetry was discussed by [[Ahmad al-Tifashi]] (1184–1253) of Tunis, in his ''Muta'at al-Asma' fi 'ilm al-sama' '' [Pleasure to the Ears, on the Art of Music], in volume 41 of his enciclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin M. Liu and [[James T. Monroe]], ''Ten Hispano-Arabic Strophic Songs in the Modern Oral Tradition'' (Univ.of California 1989) pp. 2 &amp; 35; al-Tifasi's text translated pp. 36–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a hiatus under the [[Almohad Empire|Almohads]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Tumart is said not to have followed any recognized [[madhhab]] [see the ''Almohads or al-Muwahiddin'' era, the ''Rule over the Maghrib'' section, above]; yet the Almohads may have followed the Zahiri school of law (Hodgson, ''Venture of Islam'' in II:269), which is now extinct.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maliki]] school of law resumed its full traditional jurisdiction over the Maghrib. During the 13th century, the Maliki school had undergone substantial liberalizing changes due in part to Iraqi influence.&lt;ref&gt;Maghribi students were drawn to Iraq by the teachings left by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1209). By the end of the 13th century, Ibn Zaytun Haskuni Mishaddali had introduced transformations in Maliki fiqh which were incorporated in the Hafsid restoration. Mahsin Mahdi, ''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History'' pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hafsid jurisprudents the concept of ''maslahah'' or &quot;public interest&quot; developed in the operation of their [[madhhab]]. This opened up Maliki [[fiqh]] to considerations of necessity and circumstance with regard to the general welfare of the community. By this means, local ''custom'' was admitted in the [[Sharia]] of Malik, to become an integral part of the legal discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, ''Venture of Islam'' in II:478.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Maliki theologian Muhammad ibn 'Arafa (1316–1401) of Tunis studied at the Zaituna library, said to contain 60,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education was improved by the institution of a system of [[madrasah]]. Sufism, e.g., Sidi Bin 'Arus (d. 1463 Tunis) founder of the ''Arusiyya'' [[tariqah]], became increasingly established, linking city and countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham, ''The Sufi Orders in Islam'' (Oxford Univ. 1971) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sufi ''shaikhs'' assumed the religious authority once held by the unitarian Almohads, according to Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry blossomed, as did architecture. For the moment, Tunisia had regained cultural leadership of the Maghrib.&lt;ref&gt;Julien, ''History of North Africa'' pp. 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn Khaldun===
{{Main|Ibn Khaldun}}

A major social philosopher, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) is recognized as a pioneer in sociology, historiography, and related disciplines. Although having Yemeni ancestry, his family enjoyed centuries-long residency in [[al-Andalus]] before leaving in the 13th century for Ifriqiyah. As a native of Tunis, he spent much of his life under the Hafsids, whose regime he served on occasion.

Ibn Khaldun entered into a political career early on, working under a succession of different rulers of small states, whose designs unfolded amid shifting rivalries and alliances. at one point he rose to [[vizier]]; however, he also spent a year in prison. His career required several relocations, e.g., [[Fez]], [[Granada]], eventually [[Cairo]] where he died. In order to write he retired for a while from active political life. Later, after his pilgrimage to Mecca, he served as Grand Qadi of the [[Maliki]] rite in Egypt (he was appointed and dismissed several times). While he was visiting [[Damascus]], [[Timur|Tamerlane]] took the city; the conqueror interviewed the elderly jurist and social philosopher, yet Ibn Khaldun managed to escape back to his life in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]], ''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin 1957; reprint Univ. Chicago 1964) pp. 53–62 (in Egypt), pp. 58–60 (Timur); Cyril Glassé, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'' (HarperSanFrancisco 1991), &quot;Ibn Khaldun&quot; pp. 171–172. Ibn Khaldun lost his wife and children at sea (on their journey to Egypt) in 1384. Simon, ''Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Nature'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history and historiography written by Ibn Khaldun was informed in theory by his learning as a ''faylasuf'' [philosopher].&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]] (''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History'' (1957) pp. 30–33) understands that he was influenced directly by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1209) of Iraq, and at least indirectly by [[al-Farabi]], [[Ibn Sina]], and [[Ibn Rushd]]. [[Erwin Rosenthal]] (''Political Thought in Medieval Islam'' (1958) pp. 104–105) states that he favored and shared the views of [[al-Ghazali]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was his participation in the small unstable governments of the region at inspired many of his key insights. His history seeks to account for the apparent cyclical progression of historical states of the Maghrib, whereby: (a) a new ruling association comes to power with strong loyalties, (b) which over the course of several generations fall apart, (c) leading to the collapse of the ruling strata. The ''social cohesion'' necessary for the group's initial rise to power, and for the group's ability to maintain it and exercise it, Ibn Khaldun called ''[[Asabiyyah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Simon, ''Ibn Khalduns Wissenschaft von der Menschlichen Kultur'' (Leipzig 1959), translated by Fuad Baali as ''Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Culture'' (Lahore: Ashraf 1978) pp. 68–88, presents a discussion of this key concept, wherein ''asab'' means &quot;to bind&quot;, ''asabatun'' means &quot;the group&quot;, ''asabah'' means the &quot;paternal relationship&quot; in the law of inheritance [p. 68, 68n1], and ''asabiyah'' means &quot;the nature of the group&quot; [68–69].&lt;/ref&gt;

His seven-volume ''Kitab al-'Ibar'' [Book of Examples]&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]], in his ''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History'' pp. 63–71, discusses the subtleties of this title. ''Ibar'' can mean  &quot;instructive examples&quot; [64], &quot;bridge&quot; or medium of explanation [66], or &quot;bridge between meanings&quot; [71].&lt;/ref&gt; (shortened title) is a telescoped &quot;universal&quot; history, which concentrates on the Persian, Arab, and Berber civilizations. Its lengthy prologue, called the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' [Introduction], presents the development of long-term political trends and events as a field for the study, characterizing them as human phenomena, in quasi-sociological terms. It is widely considered to be a gem of sustained cultural analysis. Due to his downplaying (or denying) the role of the ethnic Arab people in the development of Islamic science, philosophy and politics, Ibn Khaldun did not attract sufficient interest among Arabs, his studies being neglected in Ifriqiyah—a trend that has lasted to the present day as his works are considered [[politically incorrect]] vis a vis [[Arab nationalism]]. However and naturally, in the Persian and Turkish worlds he acquired a sustained following.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]], ''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History. A study in the philosophic foundations of the science of culture'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin 1957); Heinrich Simon, ''Ibn Khalduns Wissenschaft von der Menschlichen Kultur'' (Leipzig 1959), translated by Fuad Baali as ''Ibn Khaldun's Science of Human Culture'' (Lahore: Ashraf 1978); Erwin I. J. Rosenthal, ''Political Thought in Medieval Islam'' (Cambridge Univ. 1958), Chapter IV, &quot;The Theory of the Power-State: Ibn Khaldun's study of civilization&quot; pp. 84–109; Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam'' in volume II: 476, 478–484 (p. 481 n.13, Hodgson criticizes the translation of the ''Maqaddimah'' by Franz Rosenthal); Abdullah Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) pp. 218–223; Cyril Glassé, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'' (HarperSanFrancisco 1991), &quot;Ibn Khaldun&quot; pp. 171–172; R. Idris, &quot;Society in the Maghrib after the disappearance of the Almohad&quot; in J. KiZerbo &amp; D. T. Niane (editors), ''General History of Africa'' (Univ. of California/UNESCO 1997) volume IV: 44–49, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later books of the ''Kitab al-'Ibar'', he focuses especially on the history of the Berbers of the Maghrib. The perceptive Ibn Khaldun in his narration eventually arrives at historical events he himself witnessed or encountered.&lt;ref&gt;There is said to be danger in contemporary use of his local histories, because Ibn Khaldun reluctantly employed highly nuanced &quot;folk Maghribi archetypes&quot; at conflate Berber and Arab tribal identities with static ''genres de vie'' (socio-economic lifestyles), creating &quot;mythological entities&quot; and a chaos of meaning. Aziz al-Azmeh, ''Ibn Khaldun in Modern Scholarship'' (London 1981) pp. 215–222. Compare: Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' pp. 218–223.&lt;/ref&gt; As an official of the Hafsids, Ibn Khaldun experienced first hand the effects on the social structure of troubled regimes and the long-term decline in the region's fortunes.

==Ottoman Caliphate, and the Beys==
{{Main|Ottoman Tunisia}}

[[Image:Ottoman small animation.gif|thumb|left|[[Ottoman Empire]] (1299–1918), here to 1683.]]
A long-term contest for the Mediterranean began in the sixteenth century, between Spaniards (who in 1492 completed the ''[[reconquista]]'') and Turks (who had captured [[Constantinople]] in 1453). Spain then occupied a series of ports in Northwest Africa, e.g., [[Oran]] (1505), [[Tripoli]] (1510), [[Tunis]] (1534). Some Muslim rulers encouraged Turkish forces to enter the area in order to counter the Spanish presence. The [[Hafsids]] of Tunis, however, saw in the Muslim Turks a greater threat and arranged a Spanish alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp. 51–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spain also had a tacit alliance with the [[Saadi dynasty|Sa'dids]] of Morocco. Laroui, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1970, 1977) pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] accepted many [[Barbary pirate|corsairs]] as their agents, who made [[Algiers]] their base, including Khair al-Din [Arabic name] and his brother Aruj (both known for red beards and called [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Barbarossa]]),&lt;ref&gt;The brothers hailed from the Greek island of Lesbos (Medelli). Wm. Spencer, ''Algiers in the Age of the Corsairs'' (Oklahoma Univ. 1976) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uluj Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;Uluj Ali, also spelled Ochiali, was a [[renegade (betrayer)|renegade]] of Italian ([[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n) origin. Later from the Sultan he received the name ''Kilij'' [Turkish for &quot;sword&quot;]. J.P.D.B.Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries. The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'' (New York: Wm. Morrow, Quill 1977) p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551 the corsair [[Dragut]] was installed in Tripoli; he entered [[Kairouan]] in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1977) p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1569 Uluj Ali, advancing from Algiers, seized Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Braudel in his ''''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philip II'' (Librairie Armand Colin 1949, 2d ed. 1966), translated by Siân Reynolds as ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' (Wm. Collins/Harper &amp; Row 1973, reprint 1976) in II: 1066–1068. Here Uluj Ali is called ''Euldj 'Ali''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Christian naval victory at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571,&lt;ref&gt;The combined fleets of various Christian powers, including Spain as well as [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]], under the leadership of Don Juan of Austria (half-brother of [[Philip II of Spain]]) met and defeated the Turkish fleet off the coast of western Greece. Algerian ships under Uluj Ali escaped. J.Beeching, ''The Galleys at Lepanto'' (New York: Scribner's 1982) pp. 184–187, 219, 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]] retook Tunis for Spain in 1573. Uluj Ali returned in 1574 with a large fleet and army to capture Tunis with finality, and then sent the last Hafsid to Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, &quot;Historical Setting&quot; 1–70 p. 22, in ''Tunisia. A country study'' (3rd ed. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Janissary Deys===
Following imposition in 1574 of permanent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] imperial rule, government in Tunisia was put on a more stable footing after a long period of flux and chaos. The [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] in Constantinople appointed a [[Pasha]] as the civil and military authority in Tunisia, which was made a province of the empire. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] became the language of the state. The capital city of Tunis was originally garrisoned with 4,000 [[janissary|Janissaries]], recruited primarily from [[Anatolia]], commanded by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]]. The Porte did not maintain the ranks of ''Janissaries'', rather the Pasha in Tunisia himself began to recruit such soldiery from many different regions. From 1574 to 1591 a council (the [[Divan|Diwan]]), composed of senior military (''buluk-bashis'') and local notables, advised the provincial government.

[[Image:Yenieri-aturkishjanissary-gentilebellini.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[Janissary]], drawing by [[Gentile Bellini]] (15th century).]]
The new energy of Turkish rule was welcome in Tunis, and by the [[ulama]]. Although the Ottomans preferred the [[Hanifi]] school of law, some Tunisian [[Maliki]] jurists were admitted into the administration. Yet the rule remained one of a foreign elite. In the countryside, efficient Turkish troops managed to control the tribes without compromising alliances, but their rule was unpopular. The rural economy was never brought under effective regulation by the central authority. For revenues the government continued to rely primarily on [[Barbary pirates|corsair]] raiding in the Mediterranean.

In 1591 Janissary junior officers (''deys'') who were not of Turkish origin forced the Pasha to acknowledge the authority of one of their own men, called the [[Dey]] (elected by his fellow deys). Relatively independent of the Ottomans, the Dey exercised control in the cities.
'Uthman Dey (1598–1610) and Yusuf Dey (1610–1637) managed well enough to establish peace and order in place of chronic social turbulence.

In the tribal rural areas, control and collection of taxes were assigned to a chieftain, called the [[Bey]] [Turkish]. Twice a year, armed expeditions (''mahallas'') patrolled the countryside, showing the arm of the central authority. As an auxiliary force, the Beys organized rural cavalry (''sipahis''), mostly Arab, recruited from what came to be called the &quot;government&quot; (''makhzan'') tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''Tunisia: Crossroads of the Islamic and European Worlds'' (1986) pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1971) pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

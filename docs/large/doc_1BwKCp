A '''multicast address''' is a logical identifier for a group of [[Host (network)|host]]s in a [[computer network]] that are available to process [[datagram]]s or frames intended to be [[multicast]] for a designated [[network service]]. Multicast addressing can be used in the [[link layer]] (layer 2 in the [[OSI model]]), such as [[Ethernet]] multicast, and at the [[internet layer]] (layer 3 for OSI) for [[Internet Protocol]] Version 4 (IPv4) or Version 6 (IPv6) multicast.

==IPv4==&lt;!--[[IPv4 multicast address]] redirects here--&gt;
[[IPv4]] multicast addresses are defined by the [[most-significant bit]] pattern of ''1110''. This originates from the [[classful network]] design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as ''Class D''. The [[CIDR notation]] for this group is {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0|4}}. The group includes the addresses from {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} to {{IPaddr|239.255.255.255}}. Address assignments from within this range are specified in RFC 5771, an [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) ''Best Current Practice'' document (BCP 51).

The address range is divided into blocks each assigned a specific purpose or behavior.

;Local subnetwork
:Addresses in the range of {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} to {{IPaddr|224.0.0.255}} are individually assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on the local [[subnetwork]] only. For example, the [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIPv2) uses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.9}}, [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) uses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.5}} and {{IPaddr|224.0.0.6}}, and [[Multicast DNS]] uses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.251}}. Routers must not forward these messages outside the subnet from which they originate.

;Internetwork control block
:Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|224.0.1.0}} to {{IPaddr|224.0.1.255}} are individually assigned by IANA and designated as the ''internetwork control block''. This block of addresses is used for traffic that must be routed through the public Internet, such as for applications of the [[Network Time Protocol]] using {{IPaddr|224.0.1.1}}.

;AD-HOC block &lt;!-- Note:  The hyphenated spelling is in the RFC.  --&gt;
:Addresses in three separate blocks are not individually assigned by IANA. These addresses are globally routed and are used for applications that don't fit either of the previously described purposes.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5771 Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Source-specific multicast
:The {{IPaddr|232.0.0.0|8}} (IPv4) and {{IPaddr|FF3x::|32}} (IPv6) blocks are reserved for use by [[source-specific multicast]].

;GLOP
:The {{IPaddr|233.0.0.0|8}} range was originally assigned by {{IETF RFC|2770}} as an experimental, public statically-assigned multicast address space for publishers and Internet service providers that wished to source content on the Internet. The allocation method is termed GLOP addressing and provides implementers a block of 255 addresses that is determined by their 16-bit [[autonomous system number]] (ASN) allocation. In a nutshell, the middle two [[octet (computing)|octet]]s of this block are formed from assigned ASNs, giving any operator assigned an ASN 256 globally unique multicast group addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multicasttech.com/faq/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516204230/http://www.multicasttech.com/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) File for Multicasting |publisher=Multicast Tech |archivedate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is not applicable to the newer 32-bit ASNs. {{IETF RFC|3180}}, superseding {{IETF RFC|2770}}, envisioned the use of the range for many-to-many multicast applications. Unfortunately, with only 256 multicast addresses available to each autonomous system, GLOP is not adequate for large-scale broadcasters.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

;Unicast-prefix-based
:The {{IPaddr|234.0.0.0|8}} range is assigned by {{IETF RFC|6034}} as a range of global IPv4 multicast address space provided to each organization that has {{IPaddr||24}} or larger globally routed unicast address space allocated; one multicast address is reserved per {{IPaddr||24}} of unicast space. A resulting advantage over GLOP is that the unicast-prefix mechanism resembles the unicast-prefix capabilities of IPv6 as defined in {{IETF RFC|3306}}.

;Administratively scoped
:The {{IPaddr|239.0.0.0|8}} range is assigned by RFC 2365 for private use within an organization.  Per the RFC, packets destined to administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses do not cross administratively defined organizational boundaries, and administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses are locally assigned and do not have to be globally unique.  The RFC also discusses structuring the {{IPaddr|239.0.0.0|8}} range to be loosely similar to the scoped IPv6 multicast address range described in {{IETF RFC|1884}}.

==IPv6==
Multicast addresses in [[IPv6]] use the prefix {{IPaddr|ff00::|8}}. IPv6 multicast addresses can be structured using the old format (RFC 2373) or the new format (RFC 3306, updated by RFC 7371).

Similar to a [[unicast]] address, the ''prefix'' of an IPv6 multicast address specifies its scope, however, the set of possible scopes for a multicast address is different. The 4-bit ''sc'' (or scope) field (bits 12 to 15) is used to indicate where the address is valid and unique.

The service is identified in the ''group ID'' field. For example, if {{IPaddr|ff02::101}} refers to all [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) servers on the local network segment, then {{IPaddr|ff08::101}} refers to all NTP servers in an organization's networks. The ''group ID'' field may be [[IPv6 address#Multicast address format|further divided]] for special multicast address types.

==Ethernet==
Ethernet frames with a value of 1 in the least-significant bit of the first octet&lt;ref group=note&gt;On Ethernet, the least-significant bit of an octet is the first to be transmitted. A multicast is indicated by the first transmitted bit of the destination address being 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of the destination [[MAC address]] are treated as multicast frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the destination address ({{macaddr|FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF}}) are sometimes referred to as [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcasts]], Ethernet generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast destination address in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received.

The IEEE has allocated the address block {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-00}} to {{macaddr|01-80-C2-FF-FF-FF}} for group addresses for use by standard protocols. Of these, the MAC group addresses in the range of {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-00}} to {{macaddr|01-80-C2-00-00-0F}} are not forwarded by [[802.1D]]-conformant [[MAC bridge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IEEE |url=http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf |title=Standard Group MAC Address: A Tutorial Guide |publisher=IEEE Standards Association |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[radio communication]], '''multipath''' is the [[radio propagation|propagation]] phenomenon that results in [[radio]] [[signalling (telecommunications)|signals]] reaching the receiving [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] by two or more paths. Causes of multipath include [[atmospheric ducting]], [[ionospheric reflection]] and [[refraction]], and [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] from water bodies and terrestrial objects such as mountains and buildings.

Multipath propagation causes multipath interference, including constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], and [[phase (waves)|phase shifting]] of the signal; destructive interference causes [[fading]].  This may cause a radio signal to become too weak in certain areas to be received adequately, so multipath propagation can be detrimental in radio communication systems.  Where the magnitudes of the signals arriving by the various paths have a distribution known as the [[Rayleigh distribution]], this is known as [[Rayleigh fading]]. Where one component (often, but not necessarily, a [[line of sight (telecommunications)|line of sight]] component) dominates, a [[Rice distribution|Rician distribution]] provides a more accurate model, and this is known as [[Rician fading]]. Where two components dominate, the behavior is best modeled with the [[Two-wave with diffuse power fading|two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP)]] distribution.

==Interference==
{{main|Wave interference}}

[[File:Phase shift.svg|thumb|Coherent waves that travel along two different paths will arrive with [[phase shift]], hence interfering with each other.]]
Multipath interference is a phenomenon in the physics of [[wave]]s whereby a wave from a source travels to a detector via two or more paths and the two (or more) components of the wave interfere constructively or destructively. Multipath interference is a common cause of &quot;[[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]]&quot; in analog television broadcasts and of [[fading]] of [[radio wave]]s.

[[Image:IdealTVpathnoghost.png|thumb|right|250px|A diagram of the ideal situation for TV signals moving through space: The signal leaves the [[transmitter]] (TX) and travels through one path to the receiver (the TV set, which is labeled RX)]]
[[Image:MultipathTVghost.png|thumb|right|250px|In this illustration, an object (in this case an aircraft) pollutes the system by adding a second path. The signal arrives at RX(receiver) by means 
of two different paths which have different lengths. The main path is the direct path, while the second is due to a reflection from the plane.]]

The condition necessary is that the components of the wave remain [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] throughout the whole extent of their travel.

The interference will arise owing to the two (or more) components of the wave having, in general, travelled a different length (as measured by [[optical path length]] – geometric length and [[refraction]] (differing optical speed)), and thus arriving at the detector out of [[phase (waves)|phase]] with each other.

The signal due to indirect paths interferes with the required signal in amplitude as well as phase which is called multipath fading.

==Examples==

In [[fax|facsimile]] and (analog) [[television]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], multipath causes [[jitter]] and [[ghosting (television)|ghosting]], seen as a faded duplicate image to the right of the main image. Ghosts occur when transmissions bounce off a mountain or other large object, while also arriving at the antenna by a shorter, direct route, with the receiver picking up two signals separated by a delay.

[[File:Multipath propagation diagram en.svg|thumb|Radar multipath echoes from an actual target cause ghosts to appear.]]

In [[radar]] processing, multipath causes ghost targets to appear, deceiving the radar [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]. These ghosts are particularly bothersome since they move and behave like the normal targets (which they echo), and so the receiver has difficulty in isolating the correct target echo. These problems can be minimized by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below the ground or above a certain height (altitude).

In digital radio communications (such as [[GSM]]) multipath can cause errors and affect the quality of communications. The errors are due to [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI). [[Equalization (communications)|Equalizers]] are often used to correct the ISI. Alternatively, techniques such as [[orthogonal frequency division modulation]] and [[rake receiver]]s may be used.

[[File:Gps-multipath-efect.png|thumb|left|GPS error due to multipath]]
In a [[Global Positioning System receiver]], Multipath Effect can cause a stationary receiver's output to indicate as if it were randomly jumping about or creeping. When the unit is moving the jumping or creeping may be hidden, but it still degrades the displayed accuracy of location and speed.

==In wired media==
Multipath propagation is similar in [[power line communication]] and in telephone [[local loop]]s. In either case, [[Impedance matching|impedance mismatch]] causes [[signal reflection]]. 

High-speed power line communication systems usually employ multi-carrier modulations (such as [[OFDM]] or [[Wavelet]] OFDM) to avoid the [[intersymbol interference]] that multipath propagation would cause. The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[power line communication|power lines]], phone lines, and [[ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]). G.hn uses OFDM with a [[cyclic prefix]] to avoid ISI. Because multipath propagation behaves differently in each kind of wire, G.hn uses different OFDM parameters (OFDM symbol duration, Guard Interval duration) for each media.

[[DSL modem]]s also use [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] to communicate with their [[DSLAM]] despite multipath. In this case the reflections may be caused by mixed [[wire gauge]]s, but those from [[bridge tap]]s are usually more intense and complex. Where OFDM training is unsatisfactory, bridge taps may be removed.

==Mathematical modeling==
[[File:Multipath impulse response.png|thumb|right|320px|Mathematical model of the multipath impulse response.]]
The mathematical model of the multipath can be presented using the method of the [[impulse response]] used for studying [[linear system]]s.

Suppose you want to transmit a signal, ideal [[Dirac delta function|Dirac pulse]] of [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] power at time 0, i.e.

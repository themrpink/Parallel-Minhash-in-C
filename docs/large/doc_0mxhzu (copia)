The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of [[Misgav Ladach]], a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montréal in 1994&lt;ref&gt;Stark M. Technique of cesarean section: Misgav Ladach method. In: Popkin DR, Peddle LJ (eds): Women’s Health Today. Perspectives on current research and clinical practice. Proceedings of the XIV World Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Montreal. Parthenon Publishing group, New York, 81–5&lt;/ref&gt; and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. There is also an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17904561&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nabhan AF | title = Long-term outcomes of two different surgical techniques for cesarean | journal = Int J Gynaecol Obstet | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17904561 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2007.07.011 | s2cid = 5847957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22752598&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudić I, Bujold E, Fatušić Z, Skokić F, Latifagić A, Kapidžić M, Fatušić J | title = The Misgav-Ladach method of cesarean section: a step forward in operative technique in obstetrics | journal = Arch.

===Anesthesia===
Both [[general anesthesia|general]] and [[regional anesthesia|regional anaesthesia]] ([[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]], [[epidural]] or [[combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia]]) are acceptable for use during caesarean section. Evidence does not show a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afolabi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Regional versus general anaesthesia for Caesarean section|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=10|pages=CD004350|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004350.pub3|pmid=23076903|vauthors=Afolabi BB, Lesi FE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins JL, Koonin LM, Palmer SK, Gibbs CP | title = Anesthesia-related deaths during obstetric delivery in the United States, 1979–1990 | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–84 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9054245 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199702000-00002 | s2cid = 21467445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia is better at preventing [[persistent postoperative pain]] 3 to 8 months after caesarean section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinstein |first1=Erica J |last2=Levene |first2=Jacob L |last3=Cohen |first3=Marc S |last4=Andreae |first4=Doerthe A |last5=Chao |first5=Jerry Y |last6=Johnson |first6=Matthew |last7=Hall |first7=Charles B |last8=Andreae |first8=Michael H |title=Local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for preventing persistent postoperative pain in adults and children |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=6 |pages=CD007105 |date=21 June 2018 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4 |pmid=29926477 |pmc=6377212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: [[pulmonary aspiration]] (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and [[Esophagus|esophageal]] [[intubation]].&lt;ref name=Afolabi/&gt; One trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afolabi&quot; /&gt;

Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled caesarean section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucklin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucklin BA, Hawkins JL, Anderson JR, Ullrich FA | title = Obstetric anesthesia workforce survey: twenty-year update | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 645–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16129992 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-200509000-00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional anaesthesia during caesarean section is different from the [[analgesia]] (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense [[nerve block]].

General anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.

===Prevention of complications===

Postpartum infection is one of the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kassebaum-2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kassebaum|first=NJ|author2=Bertozzi-Villa, A |author3=Coggeshall, MS |author4=Shackelford, KA |author5= Steiner, C |title=Global, regional, and national levels and causes of maternal mortality during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=The Lancet|date=2 May 2014|pmid=24797575 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60696-6 |volume=384 |issue=9947 |pages=980–1004|display-authors=etal|pmc=4255481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NICE2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25350672&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smaill |first1=Fiona M |last2=Grivell |first2=Rosalie M |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis for preventing infection after cesarean section |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=10 |pages=CD007482 |date=28 October 2014 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007482.pub3 |pmid=25350672 |pmc=4007637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity, estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high, and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections was found by a [[meta-analysis]] to substantially reduce the incidence of febrile morbidity.&lt;ref name=pmid25350672/&gt; Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans,&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; largely [[endometritis]], [[urinary tract infections]] and wound infections.

Some doctors believe that during a caesarean section, mechanical [[cervical dilation]] with a finger or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and [[lochia]] drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing the risk of death. The evidence {{As of|2018|lc=y}} neither supported nor refuted this practice for reducing postoperative morbidity, pending further large studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liabsuetrakul |first1=Tippawan |last2=Peeyananjarassri |first2=Krantarat |title=Mechanical dilatation of the cervix during elective caesarean section before the onset of labour for reducing postoperative morbidity |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=8 |pages=CD008019 |date=10 August 2018 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008019.pub3 |pmid=30096215 |pmc=6513223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure) is common in women who have spinal anaesthesia; intravenous fluids such as [[crystalloids]], or compressing the legs with bandages, stockings, or inflatable devices may help to reduce the risk of hypotension but the evidence is still uncertain about their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chooi |first1=C |last2=Cox |first2=JJ |last3=Lumb |first3=RS |last4=Middleton |first4=P |last5=Chemali |first5=M |last6=Emmett |first6=RS |last7=Simmons |first7=SW |last8=Cyna |first8=AM |title=Techniques for preventing hypotension during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=1 July 2020 |volume=7 |pages=CD002251 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002251.pub4 |pmid=32619039|pmc=7387232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother of [[Bindusara]] (born c. 320 BC, ruled 298&amp;nbsp;– c. 272 BC), the second [[Mauryan empire|Mauryan]] ''Samrat'' ([[emperor]]) of India, accidentally consumed poison and died when she was close to delivering him.

According to the ancient Chinese ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', Luzhong, a sixth-generation descendant of the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]], had six sons, all born by &quot;cutting open the body&quot;.

In the [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] text the [[Ulster Cycle]], the character [[Furbaide Ferbend]] is said to have been born by posthumous caesarean section, after his mother was murdered by his evil aunt [[Medb]].

The [[Babylonian Talmud]], an ancient [[Jew]]ish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed ''yotzei dofen''. It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lurie&quot;/&gt; There is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boss J | title = The Antiquity of Caesarean Section with Maternal Survival: The Jewish Tradition | journal = Medical History | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–31 | year = 1961 | pmid = 16562221 | pmc = 1034600 | doi = 10.1017/S0025727300026089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of [[Gaius Julius Caesar (name)#The cognomen Caesar|the etymology of ''Caesar'']]). Some stories involve Caesar himself being born from the procedure; this almost certainly false, as Caesar's mother [[Aurelia Cotta]] lived until his mid-40s. The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth, a practice sometimes called the ''Caesarian law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-10-25|title=The Truth About Julius Caesar and &quot;Caesarean&quot; Sections|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/10/caesarean-sections-named-emperor-julius-caesar/|access-date=2020-10-09|website=Today I Found Out|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catalonia|Catalan]] saint [[Raymond Nonnatus]] (1204–1240) received his surname—from the [[Latin]] ''non-natus'' (&quot;not born&quot;)—because he was born by caesarean section.

The practice continues, in fact the martyr Caesarius is invoked by the future mothers who, due to health problems or that of the baby, must give birth to their child by caesarean section.&lt;ref&gt;Pasero Roberta, Cesareo di Terracina, un santo poco conosciuto: è il protettore del parto cesareo, in &quot;DiPiù&quot;, anno XIV, n° 48, 3 dicembre 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation that the Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was born by the method now known as C-section are false.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed,&quot; by Christopher Wanjek, p. 5 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Although caesarean sections were performed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanDongen-2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...could not survive the trauma of a Caesarean&quot; ''Oxford Classical Dictionary, Third Edition'', &quot;Childbirth&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician [[Maimonides]] expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary to Mishnah Bekhorot 8:2&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb ''[[wikt:caedere|caedere]]'', &quot;to cut&quot;, with children delivered this way referred to as ''caesones''.  [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ''ab utero caeso'', &quot;cut from the womb&quot; giving this as an explanation for the [[cognomen]] &quot;Caesar&quot; which was then carried by his descendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanDongen-2009&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a [[false etymology]], it has been widely believed. For example, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines caesarean birth as &quot;the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Caesarean | Caesarian, adj. and n.&quot;. OED Online. June 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 June 2013 &lt;http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/26016&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, &quot;from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen ''Caesar''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;M-W_C_11&quot;&gt;{{citation | author = Merriam-Webster | author-link = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | edition = 11th | publisher = Merriam-Webster | year = 2003 | location = Springfield, Massachusetts, USA | isbn = 978-0-87779-809-5 | url = https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersc00merr_6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some link with Julius Caesar or with Roman emperors exists in other languages as well.  For example, the modern [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] terms are respectively ''Kaiserschnitt'', ''keisersnitt'', ''kejsersnit'', ''keizersnede'', ''kejsarsnitt'', ''keisarinleikkaus'', ''sezaryen'' and ''császármetszés'' (literally: &quot;emperor's cut&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;For a summary (in German), of an article (also in German) that deals usefully with many of the relevant historical and linguistic questions raised here, go here [http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html#Kaiserschnitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021301/http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html|date=6 January 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German term has also been imported into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (帝王切開 ''teiōsekkai'') and [[Korean language|Korean]] (제왕 절개 ''jewang jeolgae''), both literally meaning &quot;emperor incision&quot;. The Dutch term has been imported into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''bedah sesar'' means &quot;emperor’s or caesar’s surgery&quot;. Similarly, in western Slavic (Polish) ''cięcie cesarskie'', (Czech) ''císařský řez'' and (Slovak) ''cisársky rez'' means &quot;emperor's cut&quot;, whereas the south Slavic term is [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''царски рез'' and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''cárski réz'', literally ''[[Tsar|tzar]]'s cut''. The [[Russian language|Russian]] term ''kesarevo secheniye'' (Кесарево сечение ''késarevo sečénije'') literally means ''Caesar's section''. The Arabic term (ولادة قيصرية ''wilaada qaySaríyya'') also means &quot;caesarean birth.&quot; The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ניתוח קיסרי (''nitúakh Keisári'') translates literally as caesarean surgery. In Romania and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |title=Consulte o significado / Definição de cesariana no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa, o dicionário online de português contemporâneo |access-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019193949/http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |archive-date=19 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is usually called ''cesariana'', meaning from (or related to) [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Finally, the Roman ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name) [[Caeso (praenomen)|Caeso]] was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just [[folk etymology]] made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumenfeld-Kosinski|first1=Renate|title=Not of woman born : representations of caesarean birth in medieval and Renaissance culture|date=1991|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-8014-9974-6|edition=1st}} &quot;Appendix: Creative Etymology: ''Caesarean Section'' from Pliny to Rousset&quot; (pp. 143-153) presents an excellent history of the legend of caesarean births in Western culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling ===
{{See also|American and British English spelling differences}}
The term ''caesarean'' is spelled in various accepted ways, [[wikt:Caesarean#Alternative forms|as discussed at Wiktionary]]. The [[Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|United States National Library of Medicine (NLM)]] uses ''cesarean section'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68002585 |title=Cesarean Section |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other American medical works, e.g. ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', use ''caesarean'',&lt;ref name=&quot;fd&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/caesarean | title=Caesarean}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cesarean | title=Definition of CESAREAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''American Heritage Dictionary''&lt;ref name=&quot;fd&quot; /&gt; list ''cesarean'' first and other spellings as &quot;variants&quot;.

===Presence of father===

In many hospitals, the mother's partner is encouraged to attend the surgery to support her and share the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hugill |first1=K |last2=Kemp |first2=I |last3=Kingdon |first3=C |title=Fathers' presence at caesarean section with general anaesthetic: evidence and debate. |journal=The Practising Midwife |date=April 2015 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=19-22 |pmid=26328461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anaesthetist]] will usually lower the drape temporarily as the child is delivered so the parents can see their newborn.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Special cases==

In [[Judaism]], there is a dispute among the ''[[poskim]]'' (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether the first-born son from a caesarean section has the laws of a ''[[bechor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Chok Yaakov 470:2; Kaf ha-Chayim 470:3; {{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818005722/http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |archive-date=18 August 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a male child delivered by caesarean is not eligible for the ''[[Pidyon HaBen]]'' dedication ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |title=Pidyon HaBen&amp;nbsp;— Definition of Pidyon HaBen (Redemption of the Firstborn) |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019184726/http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |archive-date=19 October 2011 |access-date=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cohen-levi.org/the_cohens_heritage/pidyon_ha_ben.htm |title=Kohanim forever from the sources, who is a cohen, the blessing of the Cohanim,.

In rare cases, caesarean sections can be used to remove a dead [[fetus]]; otherwise, the woman has to labour and deliver a baby known to be a [[stillbirth]]. A [[late-term abortion]] using caesarean section procedures is termed a [[hysterotomy abortion]] and is very rarely performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medscape Abortion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Francis E|title=Elective Abortion|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/252560-overview|website=Medscape|publisher=Medscape|access-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214092044/http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3311.htm|archive-date=14 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

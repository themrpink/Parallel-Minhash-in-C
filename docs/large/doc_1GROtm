More strongly: a topological vector space is said to be '''[[normable]]''' if its topology can be induced by a norm. 
A topological vector space is normable if and only if it is Hausdorff and has a convex bounded neighborhood of {{math|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;springer&quot;&gt;http://eom.springer.de/T/t093180.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Let {{math|ùïÇ}} be a non-[[discrete space|discrete]] [[locally compact]] topological field, for example the real or complex numbers. 
A [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] topological vector space over {{math|ùïÇ}} is locally compact if and only if it is [[finite-dimensional]], that is, isomorphic to {{math|{{math|ùïÇ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} for some natural number {{mvar|n}}.

=== Completeness and uniform structure ===
{{Main|Complete topological vector space}}

The '''[[Complete topological vector space|canonical uniformity]]'''{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-19}} on a TVS {{math|(''X'', œÑ)}} is the unique translation-invariant [[Uniform space|uniformity]] that induces the topology {{math|œÑ}} on {{mvar|X}}. 

Every TVS is assumed to be endowed with this canonical uniformity, which makes all TVSs into [[uniform space]]s. 
This allows one to {{huh|date=September 2020}} about related notions such as [[Complete topological vector space|completeness]], [[uniform convergence]], Cauchy nets, and [[uniform continuity]]. etc., which are always assumed to be with respect to this uniformity (unless indicated other). 
This implies that every Hausdorff topological vector space is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | p=16}}
A subset of a TVS is [[Compact space|compact]] if and only if it is complete and [[totally bounded]] (for TVSs, a set being totally bounded is equivalent to it being [[precompact]]). But if the TVS is not Hausdorff then there exist compact subsets that are not closed. However, the closure of a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff TVS is again compact (so compact subsets are [[relatively compact]]). 

With respect to this uniformity, a [[Net (mathematics)|net]] (or sequence) {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä¢&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ‚àà ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is '''Cauchy''' if and only if for every neighborhood {{mvar|V}} of {{math|0}}, there exists some index {{mvar|i}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ‚àí ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ‚àà ''V''}} whenever {{math|''j'' ‚â• ''i''}} and {{math|''k'' ‚â• ''i''}}. 

Every Cauchy sequence is bounded, although Cauchy nets and Cauchy filters may not be bounded. 
A topological vector space where every Cauchy sequence converges is called '''[[sequentially complete]]'''; in general, it may not be complete (in the sense that all Cauchy filters converge). 

The vector space operation of addition is uniformly continuous and an [[Open and closed map|open map]]. Scalar multiplication is [[Cauchy continuous]] but in general, it is almost never uniformly continuous. 
Because of this, every topological vector space can be completed and is thus a [[Dense set|dense]] [[linear subspace]] of a [[complete topological vector space]]. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every TVS has a [[Complete topological vector space|completion]] and every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}} Every TVS (even those that are Hausdorff and/or complete) have infinitely many non-isomorphic non-Hausdorff completions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compact subset of a TVS (not necessarily Hausdorff) is complete.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=115-154}} A complete subset of a Hausdorff TVS is closed.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=115-154}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|C}} is a complete subset of a TVS then any subset of {{mvar|C}} that is closed in {{mvar|C}} is complete.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=115-154}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Cauchy sequence in a Hausdorff TVS {{mvar|X}} is not necessarily [[relatively compact]] (i.e. its closure in {{mvar|X}} is not necessarily compact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a Cauchy filter in a TVS has an [[Filters in topology|accumulation point]] {{mvar|x}} then it converges to {{mvar|x}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a series {{math|{{big|‚àë}}{{su|p=‚àû|b=''i''=1}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} converges&lt;ref group=note&gt;A series {{math|{{big|‚àë}}{{su|p=‚àû|b=''i''=1}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is said to '''converge''' in a TVS {{mvar|X}} if the sequence of partial sums converges.&lt;/ref&gt; in a TVS {{mvar|X}} then {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí 0}} in {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Swartz | 1992 | pp=27-29}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Finest and coarsest vector topology ===

Let {{mvar|X}} be a real or complex vector space. 

;Trivial topology

The '''[[trivial topology]]''' or '''indiscrete topology''' {{math|{ ''X'', ‚àÖ } }} is always a TVS topology on any vector space {{mvar|X}} and it is the coarsest TVS topology possible.  An important consequence of this is that the intersection of any collection of TVS topologies on {{mvar|X}} always contains a TVS topology.  Any vector space (including those that are infinite dimensional) endowed with the trivial topology is a compact (and thus [[locally compact]]) [[Complete topological vector space|complete]] [[Metrizable topological vector space|pseudometrizable]] [[Seminormed space|seminormable]] [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] topological vector space. It is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] if and only if {{math|1=dim ''X'' = 0}}. 

;Finest vector topology

There exists a TVS topology {{math|œÑ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{mvar|X}} that is finer than every other TVS-topology on {{mvar|X}} (that is, any TVS-topology on {{mvar|X}} is necessarily a subset of {{math|ùúè&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-04-22|title=A quick application of the closed graph theorem|url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/04/22/a-quick-application-of-the-closed-graph-theorem/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=What's new|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Narici|Beckenstein|2011|p=111}}  Every linear map from {{math|(''X'', œÑ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}} into another TVS is necessarily continuous.  If {{mvar|X}} has an uncountable [[Hamel basis]] then {{math|ùúè&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; [[Metrizable topological vector space|metrizable]].{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | p=111}}

=== Product vector spaces ===

A [[Cartesian product]] of a family of topological vector spaces, when endowed with the [[product topology]], is a topological vector space.  For instance, the set {{mvar|X}} of all functions {{math|''f'' : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù}}: this set {{mvar|X}} can be identified with the product space {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;‚Ñù&lt;/sup&gt;}} and carries a natural [[product topology]].  With this topology, {{mvar|X}} becomes a topological vector space, endowed with a topology called the &lt;em&gt;topology of [[pointwise convergence]]&lt;/em&gt;.  The reason for this name is the following: if {{math|(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a sequence of elements in {{mvar|X}}, then {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has [[limit of a sequence|limit]] {{math|''f'' ‚àà ''X''}} if and only if {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} has limit {{math|''f''(''x'')}} for every real number {{mvar|x}}.  This space is complete, but not normable: indeed, every neighborhood of the origin in the product topology contains lines; that is, sets {{math|ùïÇ ''f''}} for {{math|''f'' ‚â† 0}}.

=== Finite-dimensional spaces ===

Let {{math|ùîΩ}} denote {{math|‚Ñù}} or {{math|‚ÑÇ}} and endow {{math|ùîΩ}} with its usual Hausdorff normed [[Euclidean topology]].  Let {{mvar|X}} be a vector space over {{math|ùîΩ}} of finite dimension {{math|1=''n'' = dim ''X''}} and so that {{mvar|X}} is vector space isomorphic to {{math|ùîΩ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  {{mvar|X}} has a unique &lt;em&gt;[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]&lt;/em&gt; vector topology that is TVS-isomorphic to {{math|ùîΩ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which has the usual Euclidean (or product) topology, but it has a unique vector topology if and only if {{math|1=dim ''X'' = 0}}.  
This Hausdorff vector topology is also the finest vector topology on {{mvar|X}}. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|1=dim ''X'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''X'' = { 0 } }} has one vector topology: the trivial topology.
* The trivial topology on a vector space is Hausdorff if and only if the vector space has dimension {{math|0}}. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
If {{math|1=dim ''X'' = 1}} then {{mvar|X}} has two vector topologies: the usual [[Euclidean topology]] and the trivial topology.
* Since the field {{math|ùîΩ}} is itself a 1-dimensional topological vector space over {{math|ùîΩ}} and since it plays an important role in the definition of topological vector spaces, this dichotomy plays an important role in the definition of an [[absorbing set]] and has consequences that reverberate throughout [[functional analysis]]. 
{{collapse top|title=Proof outline|left=true}} 
The proof of this dichotomy is straightforward so only an outline with the important observations is given. As usual, {{math|ùîΩ}} is assumed have the (normed) Euclidean topology. Let {{mvar|X}} be a 1-dimensional vector space over {{math|ùîΩ}}. Observe that if {{math|''B'' ‚äÜ ùîΩ}} is a ball centered at 0 and if {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ  ''X''}} is a subset containing an &quot;unbounded sequence&quot; then {{math|1=''B'' ‚ãÖ ''S'' = ''X''}}, where an &quot;unbounded sequence&quot; means a sequence of the form {{math|(''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''x''){{su|p=‚àû|b=''i''=1}}}} where {{math|0 ‚â† ''x'' ‚àà ''X''}} and {{math|(''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;){{su|p=‚àû|b=''i''=1}} ‚äÜ ùîΩ}} is unbounded in normed space {{math|ùîΩ}}. Any vector topology on {{mvar|X}} will be translation invariant and invariant under non-zero scalar multiplication, and for every {{math|0 ‚â† ''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}, the map {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : ùîΩ ‚Üí ''X''}} given by {{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''s'') := ''s'' ''x''}} is a continuous linear bijection. In particular, for any such {{mvar|x}}, {{math|1=''X'' = ùîΩ ''x''}} so every subset of {{mvar|X}} can be written as {{math|1=''F'' ''x'' = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}} for some unique subset {{math|''F'' ‚äÜ ùîΩ}}. And if this vector topology on {{mvar|X}} has a neighborhood of 0 that is properly contained in {{mvar|X}}, then the continuity of scalar multiplication {{math|ùîΩ √ó ''X'' ‚Üí ''X''}} at the origin forces the existence of an open neighborhood of the origin in {{mvar|X}} that ''doesn't'' contain any &quot;unbounded sequence&quot;. From this, one deduces that if {{mvar|X}} doesn't carry the trivial topology and if {{math|0 ‚â† ''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}, then for any ball {{math|''B'' ‚äÜ ùîΩ}} center at 0 in {{math|ùîΩ}}, {{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''B'') = ''B'' ''x''}} contains an open neighborhood of the origin in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is thus a linear homeomorphism. ‚àé
{{collapse bottom}} 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
If {{math|1=dim ''X'' = ''n'' ‚â• 2}} then {{mvar|X}} has &lt;em&gt;infinitely many&lt;/em&gt; distinct vector topologies: 
* Some of these topologies are now descirbed: Every linear functional {{mvar|f}} on {{mvar|X}}, which is vector space isomorphic to {{math|ùîΩ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, induces a [[seminorm]] {{math|{{mabs|''f''}} : ''X'' ‚Üí ‚Ñù}} defined by {{math|1={{mabs|''f''}}(''x'') = {{mabs|''f'' (''x'')}}}} where {{math|1=ker ''f'' = ker {{mabs|''f''}}}}. Every seminorm induces a ([[Metrizable TVS|pseudometrizable]] [[locally convex]]) vector topology on {{mvar|X}} and seminorms with distinct kernels induce distinct topologies so that in particular, seminorms on {{mvar|X}} that are induced by linear functionals with distinct kernel will induces distinct vector topologies on {{mvar|X}}.
* However, while there are infinitely many vector topologies on {{mvar|X}} when {{math|dim ''X'' ‚â• 2}}, there are, &lt;em&gt;up to TVS-isomorphism&lt;/em&gt; only {{math|1 + dim ''X''}} vector topologies on {{mvar|X}}.  For instance, if {{math|1=''n'' := dim ''X'' = 2}} then the vector topologies on {{mvar|X}} consist of the trivial topology, the Hausdorff Euclidean topology, and then the infinitely many remaining non-trivial non-Euclidean vector topologies on {{mvar|X}} are all TVS-isomorphic to one another. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Non-vector topologies ===
;Discrete and cofinite topologies

If {{mvar|X}} is a non-trivial vector space (i.e. of non-zero dimension) then the [[discrete topology]] on {{mvar|X}} (which is always [[Metrizable space|metrizable]]) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a TVS topology because despite making addition and negation continuous (which makes it into a [[topological group]] under addition), it fails to make scalar multiplication continuous.  The [[cofinite topology]] on {{mvar|X}} (where a subset is open if and only if its complement is finite) is also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a TVS topology on {{mvar|X}}.

== Linear maps ==

A linear operator between two topological vector spaces which is continuous at one point is continuous on the whole domain. 
Moreover, a linear operator {{mvar|f}} is continuous if {{math|''f''(''X'')}} is bounded (as defined below) for some neighborhood {{mvar|X}} of 0.

A [[hyperplane]] on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}} is either dense or closed. 
A [[linear functional]] {{mvar|f}} on a topological vector space {{mvar|X}} has either dense or closed kernel. 
Moreover, {{mvar|f}} is continuous if and only if its [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is [[closed set|closed]].

== Types ==

Depending on the application additional constraints are usually enforced on the topological structure of the space. 
In fact, several principal results in functional analysis fail to hold in general for topological vector spaces: the [[closed graph theorem]], the [[Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], and the fact that the dual space of the space separates points in the space.

Below are some common topological vector spaces, roughly ordered by their ''niceness''.

* [[F-space]]s are [[complete space|complete]] topological vector spaces with a translation-invariant metric.  These include [[Lp space|{{math|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} spaces]] for all {{math|p &amp;gt; 0}}.  
* [[Locally convex topological vector space]]s: here each point has a [[local base]] consisting of [[convex set]]s. By a technique known as [[Minkowski functional]]s it can be shown that a space is locally convex if and only if its topology can be defined by a family of seminorms. Local convexity is the minimum requirement for &quot;geometrical&quot; arguments like the [[Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem]]. The {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} spaces are locally convex (in fact, Banach spaces) for all {{math|''p'' ‚â• 1}}, but not for {{math|0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1}}.
* [[Barrelled space]]s: locally convex spaces where the [[Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem]] holds.
* [[Bornological space]]: a locally convex space where the [[continuous linear operator]]s to any locally convex space are exactly the [[bounded linear operator]]s. 
* [[Stereotype space]]: a locally convex space satisfying a variant of [[reflexive space|reflexivity condition]], where the dual space is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on [[totally bounded space|totally bounded sets]].
* [[Montel space]]: a barrelled space where every [[closed set|closed]] and [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded set]] is [[compact set|compact]]
* [[Fr√©chet space]]s: these are complete locally convex spaces where the topology comes from a translation-invariant metric, or equivalently: from a countable family of seminorms. Many interesting spaces of functions fall into this class. A locally convex F-space is a Fr√©chet space.
* [[LF-space]]s are [[limit (category theory)|limits]] of [[Fr√©chet space]]s. [[ILH space]]s are [[inverse limit]]s of Hilbert spaces.
* [[Nuclear space]]s: these are locally convex spaces with the property that every bounded map from the nuclear space to an arbitrary Banach space is a [[nuclear operator]].
* [[Normed space]]s and [[seminormed space]]s: locally convex spaces where the topology can be described by a single [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[seminorm (mathematics)|seminorm]]. In normed spaces a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded.
* [[Banach space]]s: Complete [[normed vector space]]s. Most of functional analysis is formulated for Banach spaces.
* [[Reflexive space|Reflexive Banach space]]s: Banach spaces naturally isomorphic to their double dual (see below), which ensures that some geometrical arguments can be carried out. An important example which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reflexive is [[Lp space|{{math|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], whose dual is {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;‚àû&lt;/sup&gt;}} but is strictly contained in the dual of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;‚àû&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* [[Hilbert space]]s: these have an [[inner product]]; even though these spaces may be infinite-dimensional, most geometrical reasoning familiar from finite dimensions can be carried out in them. These include {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} spaces.
* [[Euclidean space]]s: {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|‚ÑÇ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the topology induced by the standard inner product. As pointed out in the preceding section, for a given finite {{mvar|n}}, there is only one {{mvar|n}}-dimensional topological vector space, up to isomorphism. It follows from this that any finite-dimensional subspace of a TVS is closed. A characterization of finite dimensionality is that a Hausdorff TVS is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional (therefore isomorphic to some Euclidean space).

== Dual space ==

Every topological vector space has a [[continuous dual space]]&amp;mdash;the set ''X*'' of all continuous linear functionals, i.e. [[continuous linear map]]s from the space into the base field {{math|ùïÇ}}. 
A topology on the dual can be defined to be the coarsest topology such that the dual pairing each point evaluation {{math|''X*'' ‚Üí ùïÇ}} is continuous. 
This turns the dual into a locally convex topological vector space. 
This topology is called the [[weak topology|weak-* topology]]. 
This may not be the only natural topology on the dual space; for instance, the dual of a normed space has a natural norm defined on it. 
However, it is very important in applications because of its compactness properties (see [[Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem]]).
Caution: Whenever {{mvar|X}} is a not-normable locally convex space, then the pairing map {{math|''X*'' √ó ''X'' ‚Üí ùïÇ}} is never continuous, no matter which vector space topology one chooses on  ''V*''.

== Properties ==
{{See also|Locally convex topological vector space#Properties}}

For any {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} of a TVS {{mvar|X}}, the [[Convex set|'''convex''']] (resp. '''[[Balanced set|balanced]], [[Absolutely convex set|disked]], closed convex, closed balanced, closed disked''') '''hull''' of {{math|S}} is the smallest subset of {{mvar|X}} that has this property and contains {{mvar|S}}. 

The closure (resp. interior, [[convex hull]], balanced hull, disked hull) of a set {{mvar|S}} is sometimes denoted by {{math|cl ''S''}} (resp. {{math|Int ''S''}}, {{math|co ''S''}}, {{math|bal ''S''}}, {{math|cobal ''S''}}). 

=== Neighborhoods and open sets ===

;Properties of neighborhoods and open sets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The open convex subsets of a TVS {{mvar|X}} (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) are exactly those that are of the form {{math|1=''z'' + { ''x'' ‚àà ''X'' : ''p''(''x'') &lt; 1 } = { ''x'' ‚àà ''X'' : ''p''(''x'' ‚àí ''z'') &lt; 1 } }} for some {{math|''z'' ‚àà ''X''}} and some positive continuous [[sublinear functional]] {{mvar|p}} on {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=177-220}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and {{mvar|U}} is an open subset of {{mvar|X}} then {{math|''S'' + ''U''}} is an open set in {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} has non-empty interior then {{math|''S'' ‚àí ''S''}} is a neighborhood of 0.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|K}} is an [[Absorbing set|absorbing]] [[Absolutely convex set|disk]] in a TVS {{mvar|X}} and if {{math|1=''p'' := ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Minkowski functional]] of {{mvar|K}} then{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | p=119-120}} 
:{{math|Int ''K'' {{space|1}} ‚äÜ {{space|1}} { ''x'' ‚àà ''X'' : ''p''(''x'') &lt; 1 } {{space|1}} ‚äÜ {{space|1}} ''K'' {{space|1}} ‚äÜ {{space|1}} { ''x'' ‚àà ''X'' : ''p''(''x'') ‚â§ 1 } {{space|1}} ‚äÜ {{space|1}} cl ''K''}}
* It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; assumed that {{mvar|K}} had any topological properties nor that {{math|''p''}} was continuous (which happens if and only if {{mvar|K}} is a neighborhood of 0).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every TVS is [[connected space|connected]]{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}} and [[Locally connected space|locally connected]].{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | p=35}} Any connected open subset of a TVS is [[arcwise connected]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let {{math|ùúè}} and {{math|ùúê}} be two vector topologies on {{mvar|X}}. Then {{math|ùúè ‚äÜ ùúê}} if and only if whenever a net {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä¢&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ‚àà ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|X}} converges 0 in {{math|(''X'', ùúê)}} then {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä¢&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí 0}} in {{math|(''X'', ùúè)}}.{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | p=43}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let {{mvar|ùí©}} be a neighborhood basis of the origin in {{mvar|X}}, let {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}}, and let {{math|''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}. Then {{math|''x'' ‚àà cl ''S''}} if and only if there exists a net {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä¢&lt;/sub&gt; = (''s''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''N'' ‚àà ùí©&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|S}} (indexed by {{math|ùí©}}) such that {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä¢&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí ''x''}} in {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | p=42}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;This shows, in particular, that it will often suffice to consider nets indexed by a neighborhood basis of the origin rather than nets on arbitrary directed sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

;Interior

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|S}} has non-empty interior then {{math|1=Int ''S'' = Int(cl ''S'')}} and {{math|1=cl ''S'' = cl(Int ''S'')}}.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''R'', ''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and {{mvar|S}} has non-empty interior then {{math|Int(''R'') + Int(''S'') ‚äÜ ''R'' + Int(''S'') ‚äÜ Int(''R''+''S'')}}.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|S}} is a [[Absolutely convex set|disk]] in {{mvar|X}} that has non-empty interior then 0 belongs to the interior of {{mvar|S}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | p=108}}
* However, a closed [[Balanced set|balanced]] subset of {{mvar|X}} with non-empty interior may fail to contain 0 in its interior.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | p=108}}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|S}} is a [[Balanced set|balanced]] subset of {{mvar|X}} with non-empty interior then {{math|{ 0 } ‚à™ Int ''S''}} is balanced; in particular, if the interior of a balanced set contains the origin then {{math|Int ''S''}} is balanced.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;If the interior of a balanced set is non-empty but does not contain the origin (such sets exists even in {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|‚ÑÇ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) then the interior of this set can not be a balanced set.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|x}} belongs to the interior of a convex set {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and {{math|''y'' ‚àà cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}}, then the half-open line segment {{math|1=[''x'', ''y'') := {''tx'' + (1 ‚àí ''t'')''y'' : 0 &lt; ''t'' ‚â§ 1} ‚äÜ Int ''S''}}.{{sfn | Schaefer|Wolff| 1999 | p=38}} If {{mvar|N}} is a [[Balanced set|balanced]] neighborhood of {{math|0}} in {{mvar|X}} then by considering intersections of the form {{math|''N'' ‚à© ‚Ñù ''x''}} (which are convex [[Symmetric set|symmetric]] neighborhoods of {{math|0}} in the real TVS {{math|‚Ñù ''x''}}) it follows that:
* {{math|1=Int ''N'' &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; [0, 1) Int ''N'' &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; [0, 1) ''N'' &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; (‚àí1, 1) ''N'' &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''N''}}, where {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; := { ''a'' ‚àà ùïÇ : {{mabs|''a''}} &lt; 1&amp;thinsp;}}}.
* if {{math|''x'' ‚àà Int ''N''}} and {{math|1=''r'' := sup { ''r'' &gt; 0 : [0, ''r'') ''x'' ‚äÜ Int ''N''} }} then {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}, {{math|[0, ''r'') ''x'' ‚äÜ Int ''N''}}, and if {{math|''r'' ‚â† ‚àû}} then {{math|''r'' ''x'' ‚àà cl ''N'' ‚àñ Int ''N''}}.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|C}} is convex and {{math|0 &lt; ''t'' ‚â§ 1}}, then {{math|''t'' Int ''C'' + (1 ‚àí ''t'') cl ''C'' ‚äÜ Int ''C''}}.{{sfn | Jarchow | 1981 | pp=101-104}}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Non-Hausdorff spaces and the closure of the origin ===

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{mvar|X}} is Hausdorff if and only if {{math|{ 0 } }} is closed in {{mvar|X}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|1=cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } = {{underset|''N'' ‚àà ùí©(0)|{{big|‚à©}}}} ''N''}} so every neighborhood of the origin contains the closure of {{math|{ 0 }}}.
&lt;li&gt;{{math|1=cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is a vector subspace of {{mvar|X}} and its subspace topology is the [[trivial topology]] (which makes {{math|1=cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} compact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every subset of {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is compact and thus complete (see footnote for a proof).&lt;ref group=proof&gt;Since {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} has the trivial topology, so does each of its subsets, which makes them all compact. It is known that a subset of any uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, if {{mvar|X}} is not Hausdorff then there exist compact complete subsets that are not closed.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } &amp;thinsp;‚äÜ&amp;thinsp; cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}} for every subset {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}}.&lt;ref group=proof&gt;If {{math|''s'' ‚àà ''S''}} then {{math|1=''s'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } = cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; (''s'' + { 0 }) = cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { ''s'' } ‚äÜ cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}}. Since {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } ‚äÜ cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}}, if {{mvar|S}} is closed then equality holds. Clearly, the complement of any set {{mvar|S}} satisfying the equality {{math|1=''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } = ''S''}} must also satisfy this equality.&lt;/ref&gt;
* So if {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} is open or closed in {{mvar|X}} then {{math|1=''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; ''S''}} (so {{mvar|S}} is a [[Tube lemma|&quot;tube&quot;]] with vertical side {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 &amp;thinsp;}}}).
* The [[quotient map]] {{math|1=''q'' : ''X'' ‚Üí ''X'' / cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is a [[Open and closed maps|closed map]] onto a Hausdorff TVS.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=107-112}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A subset {{mvar|S}} of a TVS {{mvar|X}} is [[Totally bounded space|totally bounded]] if and only if {{math|''S'' + cl { 0 } }} is totally bounded,{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-35}} if and only if {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}} is totally bounded,{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | p=25}}{{sfn | Jarchow | 1981 | pp=56-73}} if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map {{math|''X'' ‚Üí ''X'' / cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ({ 0 })}} is totally bounded.{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-35}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} is compact, then {{math|1=cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S'' &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} and this set is compact. Thus the closure of a compact set is compact&lt;ref group=note&gt;In general topology, the closure of a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff space may fail to be compact (e.g. the [[particular point topology]] on an infinite set). This result shows that this does not happen in non-Hausdorff TVSs. {{math|''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is compact because it is the image of the compact set {{math|''S'' √ó cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} under the continuous addition map {{math|‚ãÖ + ‚ãÖ &amp;thinsp;:&amp;thinsp; ''X'' √ó ''X'' ‚Üí ''X''}}. Recall also that the sum of a compact set (i.e. {{mvar|S}}) and a closed set is closed so {{math|''S'' + cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is closed in {{mvar|X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. all compact sets are [[relatively compact]]).{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | p=156}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vector subspace of a TVS is bounded if and only if it is contained in the closure of {{math|{ 0 &amp;thinsp;}}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=155-176}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|M}} is a vector subspace of a TVS {{mvar|X}} then {{math|''X'' / ''M''}} is Hausdorff if and only if {{mvar|M}} is closed in {{mvar|X}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every vector subspace of {{mvar|X}} that is an algebraic complement of {{math|cl { 0 } }} is a [[Complemented subspace|topological complement]] of {{math|cl { 0 &amp;thinsp;}}}. Thus if {{mvar|H}} is an algebraic complement of {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} in {{mvar|X}} then the addition map {{math|''H'' √ó cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } ‚Üí ''X''}}, defined by {{math|(''h'', ''n'') ‚Ü¶ ''h'' + ''n''}} is a TVS-isomorphism, where {{mvar|H}} is Hausdorff and {{math|cl { 0 } }} has the [[indiscrete topology]].{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | p=63}} Moreover, if {{mvar|C}} is a Hausdorff [[Complete topological vector space|completion]] of {{mvar|H}} then {{math|''C'' √ó cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }} is a completion of {{math|1=''X'' ‚âÖ ''H'' √ó cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; { 0 } }}.{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-35}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Closed and compact sets ===

;Compact and totally bounded sets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and [[Totally bounded space|totally bounded]].{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}}
* Thus, in a complete TVS, a closed and totally bounded subset is compact.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A subset {{mvar|S}} of a TVS {{mvar|X}} is [[Totally bounded space|totally bounded]] if and only if {{math|cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}} is totally bounded,{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | p=25}}{{sfn | Jarchow | 1981 | pp=56-73}} if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map {{math|''X'' ‚Üí ''X'' / cl&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ({ 0 })}} is totally bounded.{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-35}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every relatively compact set is totally bounded.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}} The closure of a totally bounded set is totally bounded.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image of a totally bounded set under a uniformly continuous map (e.g. a continuous linear map) is totally bounded.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=47-66}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|K}} is a compact subset of a TVS {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|U}} is an open subset of {{mvar|X}} containing {{mvar|K}}, then there exists a neighborhood {{mvar|N}} of 0 such that {{math|''K'' + ''N'' ‚äÜ ''U''}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|S}} is a subset of a TVS {{mvar|X}} such that every sequence in {{mvar|S}} has a cluster point in {{mvar|S}} then {{mvar|S}} is totally bounded.{{sfn | Schaefer | Wolff | 1999 | pp=12-35}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

;Closure and closed set

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and {{mvar|a}} is a scalar then {{math|1=''a''cl(''S'') ‚äÜ cl(''aS'')}}; if {{mvar|X}} is Hausdorff, {{math|''a'' ‚â† 0}}, or {{math|1=''S'' = ‚àÖ}} then equality holds: {{math|1=cl(''aS'') = ''a''cl(''S'')}}.
* In particular, every non-zero scalar multiple of a closed set is closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and {{math|''S'' + ''S'' ‚äÜ 2 cl ''S''}} then {{math|cl ''S''}} is convex.{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | pp=43-44}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''R'', ''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} then {{math|cl(''R'') + cl(''S'') ‚äÜ cl(''R''+''S'')}} and {{math|1=cl[cl(''R'') + cl(''S'')] = cl(''R''+''S'')}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}} Thus if {{math|''R'' + ''S''}} is closed then so is {{math|cl(''R'') + cl(''S'')}}.{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | pp=43-44}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and if {{mvar|R}} is a set of scalars such that neither {{math|cl ''S''}} nor {{math|cl ''R''}} contain zero then {{math|1=(cl ''R'') (cl ''S'') = cl(''RS'')}}.{{sfn | Wilansky | 2013 | pp=43-44}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The closure of a vector subspace of a TVS is a vector subspace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} then {{math|1=cl ''S'' = {{underset|''N'' ‚àà ùí©|{{big|‚à©}}}} (''S'' + ''N'')}} where {{math|ùí©}} is any neighborhood basis at the origin for {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=80}}
* However, {{math|1=cl ''S'' &amp;nbsp;‚äá&amp;nbsp; {{big|‚à©}} { ''U'' : ''S'' ‚äÜ ''U'', ''U'' open in ''X'' } }} and it's possible for this containment to be proper{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=108-109}} (e.g. if {{math|1=''X'' = ‚Ñù}} and {{mvar|S}} is the rational numbers).
* It follows that {{math|cl ''U'' ‚äÜ ''U'' + ''U''}} for every neighborhood {{mvar|U}} of the origin in {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Jarchow | 1981 | pp=30-32}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|X}} is a real TVS and {{math|''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}}, then {{math|{{underset|''r'' &gt; 1|{{big|‚à©}}}} ''rS'' ‚äÜ cl ''S''}} (observe that the left hand side is independent of the topology on {{mvar|X}}); if {{mvar|S}} is a convex neighborhood of the origin then equality holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sum of a compact set and a closed set is closed. However, the sum of two closed subsets may fail to be closed{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}} (see this footnote&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the sum of the {{mvar|y}}-axis and the graph of {{math|1=''y'' = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}}}, which is the complement of the {{mvar|y}}-axis, is open in {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In {{math|‚Ñù}}, the sum of {{math|‚Ñ§}} and {{math|{{sqrt|2}}‚Ñ§}} is a countable dense subset of {{math|‚Ñù}} so not closed in {{math|‚Ñù}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for examples).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{mvar|M}} is a vector subspace of {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|N}} is a closed neighborhood of 0 in {{mvar|X}} such that {{math|''U'' ‚à© ''N''}} is closed in {{mvar|X}} then {{mvar|M}} is closed in {{mvar|X}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every finite dimensional vector subspace of a Hausdorff TVS is closed. The sum of a closed vector subspace and a finite-dimensional vector subspace is closed.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

;Closed hulls

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a locally convex space, convex hulls of bounded sets are bounded. This is not true for TVSs in general.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=155-176}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The closed convex hull of a set is equal to the closure of the convex hull of that set (i.e. to {{math|cl(co(''S''))}}).{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The closed balanced hull of a set is equal to the closure of the balanced hull of that set (i.e. to {{math|cl(bal(''S''))}}).{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The closed [[Absolutely convex set|disked]] hull of a set is equal to the closure of the disked hull of that set (i.e. to {{math|cl(cobal(''S''))}}).{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''R'', ''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} and the closed convex hull of one of the sets {{mvar|S}} or {{mvar|R}} is compact then {{math|1=cl(co(''R'')) + cl(co(''S'')) = cl(co(''R''+''S''))}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=67-113}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If {{math|''R'', ''S'' ‚äÜ ''X''}} each have a closed convex hull that is compact (''i.e.'' {{math|cl(co(''R''))}} and {{math|cl(co(''S''))}} are compact) then {{math|1=cl(co(''R'' ‚à™ ''S'')) &amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp; co[cl(co(''R'')) ‚à™ cl(co(''S''))]}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

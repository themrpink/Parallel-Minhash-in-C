[[File:Table fructose.JPG|thumb|Crystalline fructose]]

Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Park | first=KY |author2=Yetley AE | title=Intakes and food sources of fructose in the United States | year = 1993 | volume = 58 | issue=5 Suppl | pages = 737S–747S | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | pmid=8213605| doi=10.1093/ajcn/58.5.737S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing [[table sugar]] (sucrose), [[high-fructose corn syrup]], [[agave nectar]], [[honey]], [[molasses]], [[maple syrup]], fruit and fruit [[juice]]s, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free [[monosaccharide]] or bound to glucose as [[sucrose]], a [[disaccharide]]. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in a food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars.

The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose, and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for [[apricot]]s the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose.

Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to [[pediatrics|pediatricians]] because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause [[diarrhea]] in children. The cells ([[enterocyte]]s) that line children's [[small intestine]]s have less affinity for fructose [[Small Intestine#Absorptions|absorption]] than for glucose and sucrose.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJCN fructose absorption&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riby|first=JE|author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Kretchmer N |title=Fructose absorption|year=1993|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=58|pages=748S–753S|pmid=8213606|issue=5 Suppl|doi=10.1093/ajcn/58.5.748S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unabsorbed fructose creates higher [[osmolarity]] in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the [[#Potential health effects|Health Effects]] section.

Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. [[Sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]] have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end-product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common table [[sugar|white granulated sugar]] and [[powdered sugar]], as well as [[brown sugar]].&lt;ref name=Kretchmer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kretchmer|first=N|author2=Hollenbeck CB|title=Sugars and Sweeteners|year=1991|publisher=CRC Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data obtained from Kretchmer, N. &amp; Hollenbeck, CB (1991). Sugars and Sweeteners, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, Inc.&lt;ref name=Kretchmer /&gt; for HFCS, and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.nal.usda.gov&quot; /&gt;

Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19064536|year=2008|last1=White|first1=J. S|title=Straight talk about high-fructose corn syrup: What it is and what it ain't|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=88|issue=6|pages=1716S–1721S|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.25825B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the popular belief, however, with the increase of HFCS consumption, the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed. Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guthrie | first=FJ |author2=Morton FJ | title=Food sources of added sweeteners in the diets of Americans | year=2000 | journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume=100 | issue=1 | pages=43–51 | doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(00)00018-3| pmid=10646004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fructose digestion and absorption in humans ==
{{more citations needed | section|date=May 2020}}
[[File:sucrase.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 4:''' Hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose by sucrase]]
[[File:fructosetransporter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 5:''' Intestinal sugar transport proteins]]
Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the [[hepatic portal vein]] and is directed toward the liver.

The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests [[active transport]], because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stipanuk | first=Marsha H | title=Biochemical, Physiological, and Molecular Aspects of Human Nutrition, 2nd Edition | publisher=W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via [[facilitated diffusion|facilitated transport]] involving [[GLUT5]] transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the [[enterocytes]], assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either [[GLUT2]] or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2.

=== Capacity and rate of absorption ===
The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5&amp;nbsp;g to 50&amp;nbsp;g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake.&lt;ref name=fuji /&gt; Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities.&lt;ref name=fuji&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fujisawa | first=T |author2=Riby J |author3=Kretchmer N  | title=Intestinal absorption of fructose in the rat | year=1991 | journal=Gastroenterology | volume=101 | pages=360–367 | pmid=2065911 | issue=2| doi=10.1016/0016-5085(91)90012-a }}&lt;/ref&gt; When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide [[sucrose]], absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the [[GLUT5]] transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ushijima | first=K |author2=Fujisawa T |author3=Riby J |author4=Kretchmer N  | title= Absorption of fructose by isolated small intestine of rats is via a specific saturable carrier in the absence of glucose and by the disaccharidase-related transport system in the presence of glucose | year=1991 | journal= Journal of Nutrition | volume=125 | pages=2156–2164 | pmid=7643250 | issue=8| doi=10.1093/jn/125.8.2156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent [[cotransport]] of fructose.
In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (&gt;2.4 g/kg body wt) increase transport proteins within three days of intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ferraris | first=R | title= Dietary and developmental regulation of intestinal sugar transport | year=2001 | journal= Journal of Biochemistry | volume=360 | pages=265–276 | pmid=11716754 | doi= 10.1042/0264-6021:3600265 | issue=Pt 2 | pmc=1222226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5 in skeletal muscle cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajduch|author2=Litherland GJ |author3=Turban S |author4=Brot-Laroche E |author5=Hundal HS |title=Insulin regulates the expression of the GLUT5 transporter in L6 skeletal muscle cells|date=Aug 2003|pmid=12914929|first1=E|volume=549|issue=1–3|pages=77–82|journal=FEBS Letters|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructolysis ===
{{Main|Fructolysis}}

The initial [[catabolism]] of fructose is sometimes referred to as [[fructolysis]], in analogy with [[glycolysis]], the catabolism of [[glucose]]. In fructolysis, the enzyme [[fructokinase]] initially produces [[fructose 1-phosphate]], which is split by [[aldolase B]] to produce the [[triose]]s [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) and [[glyceraldehyde]] [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content-nw/full/76/5/911/F3]. Unlike [[glycolysis]], in fructolysis the triose [[glyceraldehyde]] lacks a [[phosphate group]]. A third enzyme, [[triokinase]], is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower [[glycolytic]] pathway to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].

=== Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde ===
The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes [[hydrolysis]] by [[aldolase B]] to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be [[isomerization|isomerized]] to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.  The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis.

=== Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=MA Parniak |author2=Kalant N | title= Enhancement of glycogen concentrations in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes exposed to glucose and fructose | year=1988 | journal=Biochemical Journal | volume=251 | pages=795–802 | pmid=3415647 | issue=3 | pmc=1149073 | doi=10.1042/bj2510795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jia|first1=Guanghong|last2=Aroor|first2=Annayya R.|last3=Whaley-Connell|first3=Adam T.|last4=Sowers|first4=James R.|date=June 2014|title=Fructose and Uric Acid: Is There a Role in Endothelial Function?|journal=Current Hypertension Reports|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=434|doi=10.1007/s11906-014-0434-z|issn=1522-6417|pmc=4084511|pmid=24760443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medina Villaamil|date=2011-02-01|title=Fructose transporter Glut5 expression in clear renal cell carcinoma|journal=Oncology Reports|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=315–23|doi=10.3892/or.2010.1096|pmid=21165569|issn=1021-335X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the [[free fatty acid]] and glycerol [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] of plasma triglycerides.

== Potential health effects ==

=== Weight gain ===
In a [[meta-analysis]] of [[clinical trial]]s with controlled feeding — where test subjects were fed a fixed amount of energy rather than being allowed to choose the amount they ate — fructose was not an independent factor for weight gain; however, fructose consumption was associated with weight gain when the fructose provided excess calories.&lt;ref name=&quot;sieven&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sievenpiper JL, de Souza RJ, Mirrahimi A, Yu ME, Carleton AJ, Beyene J, Chiavaroli L, Di Buono M, Jenkins AL, Leiter LA, Wolever TM, Kendall CW, Jenkins DJ |title=Effect of Fructose on Body Weight in Controlled Feeding Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=Feb 21, 2012|volume=156 | issue = 4 |pages=291–304|pmid=22351714|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-4-201202210-00007|s2cid=207536440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiometabolic diseases ===
An expert panel of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] concluded that fructose is preferred in food and beverage manufacturing to replace sucrose and glucose due to the lower effect of fructose on blood glucose levels following a meal.&lt;ref name=efsa11/&gt; However, when consumed in excess as a sweetening agent in foods and beverages, fructose has been associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders that are part of [[metabolic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=MalikHu2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malik|first1=Vasanti S.|last2=Hu|first2=Frank B.|title=Fructose and Cardiometabolic Health: What the Evidence from Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tells Us|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=66|issue=14|year=2015|pages=1615–1624|issn=0735-1097|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2015.08.025|pmid=26429086|pmc=4592517}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clinical research]] has provided no or only limited direct evidence that fructose itself is associated with elevated [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s leading to metabolic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of dietary fructose on plasma lipids in healthy subjects|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = 2000-11-01|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 11063439|pages = 1128–1134|volume = 72|issue = 5|first1 = J.

It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of 's-Hertogenbosch}}

The city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''des Hertogen bosch''—&quot;the forest of the duke&quot;. The duke in question was [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry I]] of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls may still be seen. 

[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]
In the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]], The town suffered a catastrophic fire in 1463, which the then (approximately) 13-year-old Bosch probably witnessed; presumably, this fire provided inspiration for the fiery hell-scapes that would later make Bosch famous.

Until 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.

===Eighty Years' War===
The wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended by [[Claude de Berlaymont]], also known as [[Haultpenne]].

In the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender—an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).

===Louis XIV to Bonaparte===
After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV]] of France. In 1794 French revolutionary troops under the command of [[Charles Pichegru]] attacked the city. It was only weakly defended, and fell after a short siege. Pichegru then crossed the rivers and put an end to the Dutch Republic.

In the [[Batavian Republic]], that was established in 1795, both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights. From 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.

===Kingdom of the Netherlands===
The next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.

At the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.

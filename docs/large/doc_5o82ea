====Second Intifada====
Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=22&amp;ItemID=2075 |title=Zmag.org |publisher=Zmag.org |date=July 5, 2002 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021201010732/http://zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?sectionid=22&amp;itemid=2075 |archive-date=December 1, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miftah.org/PrinterF.cfm?DocId=2294 |title=Miftah.org |publisher=Miftah.org |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machsomwatch.org/media/tahseenYaqeen.asp?link=media&amp;lang=eng|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101055843/http://www.machsomwatch.org/media/tahseenYaqeen.asp?link=media&amp;lang=eng|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 1, 2007|title=מחסום WATCH|date=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were [[2000 Ramallah lynching|lynched in Ramallah]].

Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.

The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 [[Operation Defensive Shield]], with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum Barnea, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4780153,00.html 'Beitunian nights: The IDF in the West Bank'], [[Ynet]] 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Business Times1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Lotto Persio | first =Sofia | title =Palestinian militant 'plotting attack in Israel' shot dead by Swat team in West Bank | language = en|publisher =International Business Times (via Yahoo.com) | date =6 March 2017 | url =https://www.yahoo.com/news/palestinian-militant-plotting-attack-israel-111219006.html | access-date =6 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icph.birzeit.edu/Emergencey%20Publications/Child%20Report%20final%202002.pdf ICPH.birzeit.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612000219/http://icph.birzeit.edu/Emergencey%20Publications/Child%20Report%20final%202002.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretzdaily.com/captcha/index.php?d=haaretzdaily.com|archive-url=https://archive.today/20081211195047/http://www.haaretzdaily.com/captcha/index.php?d=haaretzdaily.com|url-status=dead|title=banned interdit verboden prohibido vietato proibido|date=December 11, 2008|archive-date=December 11, 2008|access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/wbgaza-4yrassessment.pdf |title=Siteresources.worldbank.org |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinercs.org/checkpoints.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427173009/http://www.palestinercs.org/checkpoints.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 27, 2006|title=Checkpoints|date=April 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Freedom_of_Movement/Siege.asp |title=Btselem.org |publisher=Btselem.org |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1761785.stm |title=The Palestinians under closure |work=BBC News |date=January 20, 2002 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has added to Ramallah's isolation.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Yasser Arafat]] established his West Bank headquarters, the [[Mukataa]], in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the ''de facto'' capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine. It hosts almost all governmental headquarters. In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in [[Gaza City]]. After suicide bombings in [[Haifa]], Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.
[[File:Ramallah Muqata'a 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mukataa]] in 2013.]]

On November 11, 2004 Arafat died at the [[Percy training hospital of the Armies]] near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Throughout 2005, while the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]] was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/5129.PDF Meeting minutes between Saeb Erekat and David Welch, ''Palestine Papers,'' 16 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic rehabilitation====
In December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for the 15-seat municipal council for a four-year term. The council elected [[Janet Mikhail]] as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/Displayarticle.asp?section=middleeast&amp;xfile=data/middleeast/2006/january/middleeast_january34.xml |title=Khaleejtimes.com |publisher=Khaleejtimes.com |date=January 2, 2006 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024336/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/Displayarticle.asp?section=middleeast&amp;xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2006%2Fjanuary%2Fmiddleeast_january34.xml |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karin Laub |url=http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060101/NEWS/201010358/1004/news |title=Ocala.com |publisher=Ocala.com |date=January 1, 2006 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munir Hamdan, a member of [[Fatah]] and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, &quot;The president and prime minister have their offices here.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; So do the parliament and all the government ministries&quot;, representing a &quot;collusion&quot; between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; [[Hatem Abdel Kader]], a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that &quot;If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of [[Salam Fayyad]] has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt;

Many foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name=Toameh&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Article.aspx?id=185283 &quot;'Palestine's new bride'&quot;], Khaled Abu Toameh, ''Jerusalem Post,'' 20 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, king [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/jordan/8904168/Jordans-King-Abdullah-visits-West-Bank-for-first-time-in-decade.html|title=Jordan's King Abdullah visits West Bank for first time in decade|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
This area enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about {{convert|615|mm|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/site/512/default.aspx?tabID=512&amp;lang=en&amp;ItemID=738&amp;mid=3171&amp;wversion=Staging|title=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics – State of Palestine|work=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minimum rainfall is {{convert|307|mm|0|abbr=on}} and maximum rainfall is {{convert|1591|mm|0|abbr=on}}.

The [[Köppen climate classification]] places Ramallah in the [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]] category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.

==Economy==
Ramallah has been described as the seat of power of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] and serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the [[Second Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/interviews/2009/0114_west_bank_gaza_dhillon.aspx |title=West Bank and Gaza Economy: Before and After the Crisis – Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603050907/http://www.brookings.edu/interviews/2009/0114_west_bank_gaza_dhillon.aspx |archive-date=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramallah construction boom is one of the most obvious signs of [[West Bank]] economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67129P20100802 | work=Reuters | title=Ramallah building boom symbolizes West Bank growth | date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and &quot;five-star&quot; hotels were erected, particularly in the [[Al-Masyoun]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; In 2010, &quot;more than one hundred&quot; Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from [[East Jerusalem]], because &quot;Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; One local boasted to a journalist that &quot;Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt; This boast was seconded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' which, in 2010, called Ramallah the &quot;de facto capital of the West Bank.&lt;ref name=Loungo&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/travel/06next-1.html Michael T.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Ramallah/Page-065.jpg 65]&lt;/ref&gt; with Christians forming the majority of the population. However, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically between 1948 and 1967, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. Slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants were Christian by 1967, the other half Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490336/Ramallah Ramallah].

Ramallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997.

In the aftermath of the 1936–39 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963 a hospital was opened.&lt;ref name=nyt96&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/05/world/foes-take-steps-to-cut-tension-in-west-bank.html |title=Foes Take Steps To Cut Tension In West Bank |newspaper=The New York Times |date= October 5, 1996 |access-date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present Ramallah Government Hospital and the Palestine Medical Centered are located on the land purchased by the Foundation.

During the annual &quot;Saturday of Light&quot; religious festival (which occurs on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter Sunday to commemorate the light that tradition holds shone from the tomb of Jesus), the scouts hold a parade through the city streets to receive the flame from Jerusalem. (The flame is ignited in Jerusalem's [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and is passed on through candles and lanterns to regional churches.) A variety of mosques and churches of different denominations dot the landscape.

It boasts a lively nightlife, with many restaurants including the [[Stars and Bucks Cafe]], a branch of the [[Tche Tche]] Cafe and the [[Orjuwan|Orjuwan Lounge]], described in 2010 as two among the &quot;dozens of fancy restaurants, bars and discotheques that have cropped up in Ramallah in the last three years&quot;.&lt;ref name=Toameh/&gt;

One hallmark of Ramallah is Rukab's Ice Cream, which is based on the resin of chewing gum and thus has a distinctive taste. Another is the First Ramallah Group, a boy- and girl-scout club that also holds a number of traditional dance ([[Dabka]]) performances and is also home to men's and women's basketball teams that compete regionally. International music and dance troupes occasionally make a stop in Ramallah, and the renowned Argentinian-Israeli pianist [[Daniel Barenboim]] performs there often. The [[Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center]], founded in 1996, is a popular venue for such events. The [[Al-Kasaba Theatre]] is a venue for plays and movies. In 2004, the state-of-the art Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/71.htm Jerusalemites.org], cultural dimensions {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185339/http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/cultural_dimensions/71.htm |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.

===Ramallah folklore===
Ramallah, like most Palestinian areas, has a rich folklore of song and dance. Songs accompanied people in every occasion whether it was the harvest season, roofing a house, traveling, coming back from travel, engagement, wedding, or even death. Most of the songs were sung by the women with the exception of Zaffeh and Mal'ab which are sung by the men at wedding celebrations. Palestinian educator Bahia Khalil's book &quot;Ramallah Folklore Songs and Traditions&quot; documents to a great extent this oral tradition inherited from one generation to another. The second edition of the book was published in 2002 by the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine, an organization for Palestinian-Americans from the Ramallah region living in the United States.

Foreign travelers to Palestine in late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the Palestinian people, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman's economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or &quot;thoub&quot; in Arabic

===Palestinian costume===
{{Main|Palestinian costumes}}
Though experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various [[empire]]s to have ruled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Byzantine empire]], and [[Ayyubids]], among [[History of Palestine|others]], have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.

Hanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE) such as Egyptian paintings depicting [[Canaanites]] in A-shaped garments.&lt;ref name=Twair&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McDonnell Twair|date=October 2006|title=Sovereign Threads|publisher=Palestine Heritage Foundation|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_December_2006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to 1940 AD, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; This shape is known to [[archaeology|archaeologists]] as the &quot;Syrian tunic&quot; and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] dating to 1200 BC.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneal&gt;{{cite web|author=Denise O'Neal|date=September–October 2005|title=Threads of Tradition:An Exhibition of Palestinian Folk Dress at Antiochian Village|publisher=Palestine Heritage Association|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Threads%20of%20Tradition_Antiochian%20Museum.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the [[fabric]], colours, [[Cut (clothing)|cut]], and [[embroidery]] motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.&lt;ref name=Grutz&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|date=January–February 1991|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|magazine=Saudi Aramco World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_July_2005.htm |title=Heritage Newsletter of the Palestinian Heritage Foundation Volume 6 |publisher=Palestineheritage.org |access-date=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white [[linen]] fabric embroidered with red silk thread. The headdress or ''smadeh'' worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.

{{short description|Instrumental introduction to an opera, ballet, or oratorio}}
'''Overture''' (from [[French language|French]] ''ouverture'', {{abbr|lit.|literally}} &quot;opening&quot;) in [[music]] was originally the [[instrumental]] introduction to a [[ballet]], [[opera]], or [[oratorio]] in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Temperley|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the early [[Romantic era]], composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] composed overtures which were independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the [[symphonic poem]]. These were &quot;at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Blom|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

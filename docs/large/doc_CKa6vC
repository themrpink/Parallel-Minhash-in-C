The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&amp;nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east–west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&amp;nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&amp;nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&amp;nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&amp;nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&amp;nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&amp;nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&amp;nbsp;60E and US&amp;nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&amp;nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA planning&quot;/&gt; Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32&amp;nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA planning&quot;/&gt;  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&amp;nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&amp;nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&amp;nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;1926 map&quot;&gt;{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |name-list-style= amp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA PA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&amp;nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1927 log&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, &quot;The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A popular song later promised, &quot;Get your kicks on Route 66!&quot;) The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, &quot;Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA planning&quot;/&gt;

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–56===
[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&amp;nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]

When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating &quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, or &quot;west&quot;. While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&amp;nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA US 11&quot;/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&amp;nbsp;11]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA US 11&quot;/&gt; [[U.S. Route 19|US&amp;nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&amp;nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&amp;nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&amp;nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&amp;nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&amp;nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&amp;nbsp;99]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA US 11&quot;/&gt;

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the [[Gulf Freeway (Houston)|Gulf Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 75|US&amp;nbsp;75]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Feldstein |title=A rare quiet interlude for area's first freeway/ Next major upgrade:  Causeway in 2002 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2009 |url=http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/45s/chron_27-june-99_gulf_freeway.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pasadena Freeway]] carried [[U.S. Route 66|US&amp;nbsp;66]],&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence between the [[Division of Highways (California)|Division of Highways]] and [[American Association of State Highway Officials]], transcribed at {{cite web |url=http://cahighways.org/065-072.html#066 |publisher= California Highways |title=State Route 66 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pulaski Skyway]] carried [[U.S. Route 1|US&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 9|US&amp;nbsp;9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title= Road Atlas |year=1946 |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/NewYorkCity/randmcnally_ra_1946_040.html |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |page= 42 |inset=New York and Vicinity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
[[File:US 34 (1961).svg|thumb|100px|1961 version of the U.S. Route shield]]

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of [[freeway]]s across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[Western United States|West]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.&lt;ref name=&quot;esso&quot;/&gt; Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]]. The 1985 removal of [[U.S. Route 66|US&amp;nbsp;66]] is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/californiahighwa196465calirich#page/n85/mode/2up |title= Route Renumbering: New Green Markers Will Replace Old Shields |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= March–April 1964 |volume= 43 |issue= 3–4 |pages= 11–13 |issn= 0008-1159 |accessdate= June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US&amp;nbsp;6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US&amp;nbsp;93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to [[Interstate 11]]. Three state capitals in the contiguous U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: [[Dover, Delaware]]; [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]; and [[Pierre, South Dakota]].

In 1995 the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] was defined to include both the Interstate Highway System and other roads designated as important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

AASHTO is in the process of eliminating all [[List of Intrastate U.S. Highways|intrastate U.S. Highways]] less than {{convert|300|mi|km}} in length &quot;as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials can reach agreement with reference thereto&quot;. New additions to the system must serve more than one state and &quot;substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AASHTO purpose&quot;/&gt; A version of this policy has been in place since 1937.&lt;ref name=newsigning1937&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://archive.org/stream/california193638highwacalirich#page/n521/mode/2up |title= New Signing Policy on U.S. Routes |journal= California Highways and Public Works |date= October 1937 |volume= 15 |issue= 10 |pages= 13, 28 |issn=  0008-1159 |access-date= July 24, 2015 |via= Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1925 routes==
The original major transcontinental routes in 1925, along with the [[auto trail]]s which they roughly replaced, were as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA planning&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1925 list&quot;/&gt;

US&amp;nbsp;10, US&amp;nbsp;60, and US&amp;nbsp;90 only ran about two thirds of the way across the country, while US&amp;nbsp;11 and US&amp;nbsp;60 ran significantly diagonally.  US&amp;nbsp;60's violation of two of the conventions would prove to be one of the major sticking points; US&amp;nbsp;60 eventually was designated as US&amp;nbsp;66 in 1926, and later it became a part of popular culture.  US&amp;nbsp;101 continues east and then south to end at [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1926 map&quot;/&gt;  The western terminus of US&amp;nbsp;2 is now at [[Everett, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rm&quot;/&gt;

[[File:20150320-OSEC-LSC-0080 (16299658674).jpg|upright|thumb|Liquid being poured into an Erlenmeyer flask]]

An '''Erlenmeyer flask''', also known as a '''conical flask''' ([[British English]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Classic Kit: Erlenmeyer flask | url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/issues/2008/july/erlenmeyerflask.asp | author = Andrea Sella | date = July 2008 | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''titration flask''', is a type of [[laboratory flask]] which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist [[Emil Erlenmeyer]] (1825–1909), who created it in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Erlenmeyer, &quot;Zur chemischen und pharmazeutischen Technik,&quot; ''Zeitschrift für Chemie und Pharmacie'', vol. 3 (January 1860), 21-22.  He wrote that he first displayed the new flask at a pharmaceutical conference in Heidelberg in 1857, and that he had arranged for its commercial production and sale by local glassware manufacturers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erlenmeyer flasks have wide bases, with sides that taper upward to a short vertical neck. They may be graduated, and often spots of [[ground glass]] or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] are used where they can be labeled with a [[pencil]]. It differs from the [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]] in its tapered body and narrow neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssgwlab.com/laboratory-glassware.html Laboratory Glassware. 17 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the application, they may be constructed from glass or plastic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/labware_scientific_instruments/labware_consumables/laboratory_flasks Laboratory Flasks Information. 15 July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; in a wide range of volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webassign.net/question_assets/tccgenchem2l1/glassware/manual.html Volumetric Glassware. 15 July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouth of the Erlenmeyer flask may have a beaded lip that can be [[bung|stopp]]ed or covered. Alternatively, the neck may be fitted with [[ground glass]] or other connector for use with more specialized stoppers or attachment to other apparatus. A [[Büchner flask]] is a common design modification used for [[filtration]] under vacuum.

==Uses==
===Use in chemistry===
[[File:Titration NaOH HCl PP.ogv|thumb|Method of swirling an Erlenmeyer flask during [[titration]]]]
The slanted sides and narrow neck of this flask allow the contents of the flask to be mixed by swirling, without risk of spillage, making them suitable for [[titrations]] by placing it under the [[Burette|buret]] and adding solvent and the indicator in Erlenmeyer flask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/titration_tutorial.shtml |title= Method of titration |website=www.sciencebuddies.org/ |date= |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such features similarly make the flask suitable for boiling liquids. Hot vapor condenses on the upper section of the Erlenmeyer flask, reducing [[solvent]] loss. Erlenmeyer flasks' narrow necks can also support [[filter funnel]]s.

The final two attributes of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]]. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]].  The receiving flask is filled with a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a fluted filter paper into the receiving flask. Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the filter funnel warm, avoiding the premature [[crystallization]].

Like [[Beaker (glassware)|beakers]], Erlenmeyer flasks are not normally suitable for accurate volumetric measurements. Their stamped volumes are approximate within about 5% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chemlab/techniques/flasks.html |title=Erlenmeyer Flasks and Beakers |website=www.dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616181106/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chemlab/techniques/flasks.html |archive-date=2016-06-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in biology===
[[File:Microcystis 1.jpg|thumb|''[[Microcystis]]'' floating colonies in an Erlenmeyer flask.]]
Erlenmeyer flasks are also used in [[microbiology]] for the preparation of [[microbial culture]]s. Erlenmeyer flasks used in cell culture are sterilized and may feature vented closures to enhance gas exchange during [[Incubator (culture)|incubation]] and shaking. The use of minimal liquid volumes, typically no more than one fifth of the total flask volume, and baffles molded into the flask's internal surface both serve to maximize gas transfer and promote chaotic mixing when the flasks are orbitally shaken. The oxygen transfer rate in Erlenmeyer flasks depends on the agitation speed, the liquid volume, and the shake-flask design.&lt;ref&gt;Soccol CR, Pandey A, Larroche C (2013). Fermentation Processes Engineering in the Food Industry. CRC Press Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Florida. {{ISBN|978-1439887653}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The shaking frequency has the most significant impact on oxygen transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Schiefelbein S, Fröhlich A, John GT, Beutler F, Wittmann C, Becker J (2013): &quot;Oxygen supply in disposable shake-flasks: prediction of oxygen transfer rate, oxygen saturation and maximum cell concentration during aerobic growth&quot;. Biotechnology Letters. 35 (8): 1223-30, doi:10.1007/s10529-013-1203-9, {{PMID|23592306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxygenase|Oxygenation]] and mixing of liquid cultures further depend on rotation of the liquid &quot;in-phase&quot;, meaning the synchronous movement of the liquid with the shaker table. Under certain conditions the shaking process leads to a breakdown of liquid motion – called &quot;out-of-phase phenomenon&quot;. This phenomenon has been intensively characterized for shake flask bioreactors. Out-of-phase conditions are associated with a strong decrease in mixing performance, oxygen transfer, and power input. Main factor for out-of-phase operation is the viscosity of the culture medium, but also the vessel diameter, low filling levels and/or a high number of baffles.&lt;ref&gt;Kloeckner W, Diederichs S and Buechs J (2014): &quot;Orbitally Shaken Single-Use Bioreactors&quot;. Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol. 138: 45-60, {{PMID|23604207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buechs J, Maier U, Mildbradt C et al. (2000b): &quot;Power consumption in shaking flasks on rotary shaking machines: II. Nondimensional description of specific power consumption and flow regimes in unbaffled flasks at elevated liquid viscosity&quot;. Biotechnol Bioeng. 68(6): 594-601, {{PMID|10799984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buechs J, Lotter S, Mildbradt C (2001b): &quot; Out-of-phase operating conditions, a hitherto unknown phenomenon in shaking bioreactors&quot;. Biochem Eng J. 7(2): 135-141, {{PMID|11173302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal restriction ==
To impede illicit drug manufacturers, the state of [[Texas]] previously restricted the sale of Erlenmeyer flasks to those who have the requisite permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dps.texas.gov/RSD/Precursor/Laws/index.htm|title=TxDPS - Laws and Regulations|website=www.dps.texas.gov|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 1, 2019, SB 616 amended the law so that permits are no longer required, but accurate inventory of this and certain other pieces of lab equipment must still be maintained, loss or theft must still be reported, and the owner must still allow audits of their records and equipment to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dps.texas.gov/rsd/Precursor/News/index.htm|title=TxDPS - News and Updates|website=www.dps.texas.gov|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laboratory glassware''' refers to a variety of equipment used in [[science|scientific]] work, and traditionally made of [[glass]]. Glass can be blown, bent, cut, molded, and formed into many sizes and shapes, and is therefore common in [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and analytical [[laboratory|laboratories]].  Many laboratories have training programs to demonstrate how glassware is used and to alert first–time users to the [[Laboratory safety#Safety hazards|safety hazards]] involved with using glassware.

==History==
[[File:Man Group portrait (detail).jpg|thumb|upright|Late 17th-century laboratory glassware in the painting by [[Cornelis de Man]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
The history of glassware dates back to the [[Phoenicia]]ns who fused [[obsidian]] together in [[campfire]]s making the first glassware.  Glassware evolved as other ancient civilizations including the Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans refined the art of glassmaking.  The art of glassmaking in 16th century [[Venice]] was refined to the point intricate shapes could be made.  Some time before the turn of the 19th century laboratory glass manufacture from [[Soda-lime glass|soda lime]] started in Germany.  Most laboratory glassware was manufactured in Germany up until the start of [[World War I]].  Before World War I, glass producers in the United States had difficulty competing with German laboratory glassware manufacturers because laboratory glassware was classified as educational material and was not subject to an import tax.  During World War I, the supply of laboratory glassware to the United States was cut off.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=William|title=The origin of pyrex|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=2006|volume=83|issue=5|page=692|doi=10.1021/ed083p692|bibcode=2006JChEd..83..692J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 [[Corning Inc.|Corning Glassworks]] developed [[borosilicate glass]], which was a boon to the war effort in the United States.  Though after the war, many laboratories turned back to imports, research into better glassware flourished.  Glassware became more immune to [[thermal shock]] while maintaining [[Chemically inert|chemical inertness]].  Further important technologies impacting the development of laboratory glassware included the development of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], and a drop in price to the point laboratory glassware is, in some cases, more economical to throw away than to re-use.&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donnelly |first1=Alan |date=March 1970 |title=History of Laboratory Glassware |journal=Laboratory Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laboratory glassware selection==
Laboratory glassware is typically selected by a person in charge of a particular laboratory analysis to match the needs of a given task.  The task may require a piece of glassware made with a specific type of glass.  The task may be readily performed using low cost, [[mass-produced]] glassware, or it may require a specialized piece created by a [[Scientific glassblowing|glass blower]].  The task may require controlling the flow of [[fluid]].  The task may have distinctive quality assurance requirements.

===Type of glass===
[[File:Verrerie-p1030903.jpg|thumb|Brown glass jars with some clear lab glassware in the background]]
Laboratory glassware may be made from several types of [[glass]], each with different capabilities and used for different purposes. [[Borosilicate glass]] is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] and can withstand [[thermal stress]]. [[Quartz glass]] can withstand very high temperatures and is transparent in certain parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Darkened brown or amber (actinic) glass can block [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] radiation.  Heavy-wall glass can withstand pressurized applications. [[Fritted glass]] is finely porous glass through which gas or liquid may pass.  Coated glassware is specially treated to reduce the occurrence of breakage or failure. [[Silanization|Silanized]] (siliconized) glassware is specially treated to prevent organic samples from sticking to the glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siliconized&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhargava|first1=Hemendra|title=Improved Recovery of Morphine from Biological Tissues Using Siliconized Glassware|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=1977|volume=66|issue=7|pages=1044–1045|url= |doi=10.1002/jps.2600660738|pmid=886442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific glass blowing===
Scientific glass blowing, which is practiced in some larger laboratories, is a specialized field of glassblowing.  Scientific glassblowing involves precisely controlling the shape and dimension of glass, repairing expensive or difficult-to-replace glassware, and fusing together various glass parts. Many parts are available fused to a length of [[glass tubing]] to create highly specialized piece of laboratory glassware.

===Controlling fluid flow===

When using glassware it is often necessary to control the flow of fluid.  It is commonly stopped with a [[Bung|stopper]]. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware.  Types of interconnecting components include [[glass tubing]],  T-connectors, Y-connectors, and glass adapters.  For a leak-tight connection a [[ground glass joint]] is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a [[Keck clips]]).  Another way to connect glassware is with a [[hose barb]] and flexible [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]]. Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a [[valve]], of which a [[stopcock]] is a common type fused to the glassware. Valves made entirely of glass may be used to restrict [[fluid]] flows. Fluid, or any material which flows, can be directed into a narrow opening using a [[Funnels (laboratory)|funnel]].

===Quality assurance===
====Metrology====
Laboratory glassware can be used for high precision volumetric measurements. With high precision measurements, such as those made in a testing laboratory, the [[Metrology|metrological]] grade of the glassware becomes important.  The metrological grade then can be determined by both the [[confidence interval]] around the nominal value of measurement marks and the traceability of the calibration to an NIST standard. Periodically it may be necessary to check the calibration of the laboratory glassware.&lt;ref name=&quot;metrology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castanheira|first1=I.|title=Quality assurance of volumetric glassware for the determination of vitamins in food|journal=Food Control|date=2006|volume=17|issue=9|pages=719–726|doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2005.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dissolved silica====
Laboratory glassware is composed of silica.  Silica is considered [[insoluble]] in most substances with a few exceptions such as [[hydrofluoric acid]].  Though insoluble a minute quantity of silica will [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]] which may affect high precision, low [[Reference range|threshold]] measurements of silica in water.&lt;ref name=&quot;silica_dissolution&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jia-Zhong|title=Laboratory glassware as a contaminant in silicate analysis of natural water samples|journal=Water Research|date=1999|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2879–2883|doi=10.1016/s0043-1354(98)00508-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleaning====
Cleaning laboratory glassware is sometimes necessary and may be done using multiple methods.  Glassware can be soaked in a detergent solution to remove grease and loosen most contaminations. These contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware may be able to withstand [[sonication]] as an alternative to scrubbing. For certain sensitive experiments glassware may be soaked in solvents, such as [[aqua regia]] or mild acids, to dissolve a trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to triple rinse glassware before suspending it upside down on drying racks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleaning_reagent&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=M.L.A.M.|title=Dissolved organic carbon in rainwater: Glassware decontamination and sample preservation and volatile organic carbon|journal=Atmospheric Environment|date=2007|volume=41|issue=39|pages=8924–8931|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.08.017|bibcode=2007AtmEn..41.8924C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

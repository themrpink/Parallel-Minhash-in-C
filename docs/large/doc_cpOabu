===Biodiversity===
Increasing the biodiversity of crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial microorganisms in the soil.&lt;ref name=coleman2012/&gt; Some studies point to increased nutrient availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter, such as arbuscular mycorrhizae, which increase nutrient uptake in plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;mader2000&quot;/&gt; Increasing biodiversity also increases the resilience of agro-ecological systems.&lt;ref name=baldwinCEFS/&gt;

===Farm productivity===
Crop rotation contributes to increased yields through improved soil nutrition. By requiring planting and harvesting of different crops at different times, more land can be farmed with the same amount of machinery and labour.

===Risk management===
Different crops in the rotation can reduce the risks of adverse weather for the individual farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/06/15/crop-rotation-a-vital-component-of-organic-farming/ |title = Crop Rotation – A Vital Component of Organic Farming|date = 2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1334&amp;context=agronomyfacpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
While crop rotation requires a great deal of planning, crop choice must respond to a number of fixed conditions (soil type, topography, climate, and irrigation) in addition to conditions that may change dramatically from year to the next (weather, market, labor supply).&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson2009&quot;/&gt; In this way, it is unwise to plan crops years in advance. Improper implementation of a crop rotation plan may lead to imbalances in the soil nutrient composition or a buildup of pathogens affecting a critical crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson2009&quot;/&gt; The consequences of faulty rotation may take years to become apparent even to experienced soil scientists and can take just as long to correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson2009&quot;/&gt;

Many challenges exist within the practices associated with crop rotation. For example, [[green manure]] from legumes can lead to an invasion of snails or slugs and the decay from green manure can occasionally suppress the growth of other crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;RHS&quot;/&gt;

'''Drawn butter''' is melted [[butter]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 1st edition, 1897, ''s.v.'' 'drawn'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fowler&quot;&gt;Damon Fowler, ''Classical Southern Cooking'', annotated edition, 2008, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; often served as a [[sauce]] for steamed [[seafood]]. Some cooks restrict the term to [[clarified butter]];&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer McLagan, ''Fat: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes'', 2008, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; while others insist that it should not be clarified.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jasper White]], ''Lobster at Home'', 1998, {{ISBN|0684800772}}, p. 33: &quot;Drawn butter is simply melted butter. For some unfathomable reason, many clam shacks and restaurants serve clarified butter... as drawn butter. They do not realize that the milk solids which are skimmed from clarified butter are what make drawn butter so tasty.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is served with [[seafood]], diners often add [[lemon juice]] to it.

==Drawn butter sauces==

In the 18th century, a small amount of flour and water or milk was often added to melted butter to thicken it and prevent it from separating. Later in the 19th century, increasing amounts of [[flour]] and water were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;fowler&quot; /&gt; These sauces may themselves be named simply &quot;melted butter&quot;, &quot;drawn butter&quot;, or &quot;drawn butter sauce&quot;, and flavored with [[vinegar]], [[salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[caper]]s, [[watercress]], and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher1916&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Marian Cole Fisher|title=Twenty Lessons in Domestic Science: A Condensed Home Study Course : Marketing, Food Principals &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;, Functions of Food, Methods of Cooking, Glossary of Usual Culinary Terms, Pronunciations and Definitions, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soBCAAAAIAAJ|year=1916|publisher=M.C.

'''Fish sauce''' is a liquid [[condiment]] made from fish or [[krill]] that have been coated in [[salt]] and fermented for up to two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGee |first1=Harold |title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |publisher=Scribners |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abe |first1=Kenji |last2=Suzuki |first2=Kenji |last3=Hashimoto |first3=Kanehisa |title=Utilization of Krill as a Fish Sauce Material |journal=Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi |date=1979 |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=1013–1017 |doi=10.2331/suisan.45.1013|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|234}} It is widely used as a staple seasoning in [[East Asian cuisine|East]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]].

Following widespread recognition of its ability to impart a savory [[umami]] flavor to dishes, it has been embraced globally by chefs and home cooks. The ''umami'' flavor in fish sauce is due to its [[glutamate]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coconutstudio.com/Fish%20Sauce.htm |title=Seashore Foraging &amp; Fishing Study: From Poot-Poot to Fish Sauce to Umami to MSG |accessdate=2009-09-06 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218145531/http://coconutstudio.com/Fish%20Sauce.htm |archivedate=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soy sauce]] is regarded by some in the West as a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce though they are very different in flavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|234}}

Fish sauce is not only added to dishes as a seasoning, but also used as a base in [[dipping sauce]]s.

== History ==
{{Chinese cuisine}}

=== Asia ===
Sauces that included fermented fish parts with other ingredients such as meat and soy bean were recorded in [[China]] 2300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/ketchup-a-saucy-history |title=Ketchup: A Saucy History|website=History |date=2012-07-20|last=Butler|first=Stephanie|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China, fish fermented with soybeans and salt was used as a condiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;web1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/wmzh/2007-10/11/content_11376810.htm |title=调料文化：酱油的由来 |publisher=Big5.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:酱]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Han dynasty]], soy beans were fermented without the fish into [[soy paste]] and its by-product [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;needham2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsing-Tsung|first=Huang|title=Joseph Needham: Science and Civilisation in China, Vol.6, Part 5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=0521652707}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|346, 358-359}} with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=Salt: A World History|year=2002|publisher=Walker and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8027-1373-5|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK7ec92n5x8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fish sauce, called ''kôechiap'' in [[Hokkien]] Chinese, or ''kecap'' in Indonesia might be the precursor of [[ketchup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lakshmi Gandhi |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/02/248195661/ketchup-the-all-american-condiment-that-comes-from-asia |title=Ketchup: The All-American Condiment That Comes From Asia|work=NPR |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|233}}

By 50–100 BC, demand for fish pastes in China had fallen drastically, with fermented bean products having become a major trade commodity. Fish sauce, however, developed massive popularity in Southeast Asia. Food scholars traditionally divide East Asia into two distinct condiment regions, separated by a bean-fish divide: Southeast Asia, mainly using fermented fish (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia) and Northeast Asia, using mainly fermented beans (China, Korea, Japan). Fish sauce re-entered China in the 17th and 18th centuries, brought from Vietnam and Cambodia by Chinese traders up the coast of the southern provinces Guangdong and Fujian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=South China Morning Post|last=Lim|first=Lisa|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/2103418/when-china-invented-ketchup-300bc-and-how-it-morphed|date=2017-07-21|title=When China invented ketchup in 300BC, and how it morphed from a preserved fish sauce to sweet tomato gloop|accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Historically, fish sauces were widely used in ancient Mediterranean cuisine. The earliest recorded production was between 4th–3rd century BC by the Ancient Greeks, who fermented scraps of fish called ''[[Garum|garos]]'' into one.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farnworth|first1=Edward R.|title=Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookfermente00farn|url-access=limited|date=2003|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=0849313724|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbookfermente00farn/page/n34 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been made with a lower salt content than modern fish sauces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grainger |first=Sally |title=Fish Sauce: An Ancient Condiment |url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/gf/gf111001dashboard_dining_tha |work=Good Food SAT 1 OCT 2011 |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] made a similar condiment called either [[garum]] or liquamen.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|235}} According to [[Pliny the Elder]], &quot;garum consists of the guts of fish and other parts that would otherwise be considered refuse, so that garum is really the liquor from putrefaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.435.xml?readMode=recto Natural History] Pliny, the Elder. LoebClassics.com&lt;/ref&gt; Garum was made in the Roman outposts of Spain almost exclusively from mackerel by salting the scrap fish innards, and then sun fermenting the flesh until it fell apart, usually for several months. The brown liquid would then be strained, bottled, and sold as a condiment. Remains of Roman fish salting facilities can still be seen, including in [[Roman fish salting factory|Algeciras]] in Spain and near [[Roman ruins of Creiro|Setúbal]] in Portugal. The process lasted until the 16th century, when garum makers switched to anchovy and removed the innards.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|235}}

Garum was ubiquitous in Classical Roman cooking. Mixed with wine it was known as ''oenogarum'', or with vinegar, ''oxygarum'', or mixed with honey, ''meligarum''. ''Garum'' was one of the trade specialties in [[Hispania Baetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Paul|title=Pompeii: The Last Day|date=2003|publisher=BBC|location=London|isbn=9780563487708|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} ''Garum'' was frequently maligned as smelling bad or rotten, being called, for example, &quot;evil-smelling fish sauce&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Robert I.|title=In Defense of Garum|journal=The Classical Journal|date=1 January 1983|volume=78|issue=3|pages=232–240|jstor=3297180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to be similar to modern ''[[Colatura di Alici]]'', a fish sauce used in [[Neapolitan cuisine]].{{who|date=May 2017}}

In [[English language|English]] ''garum'' was formerly translated as ''fishpickle''. The original [[Worcestershire sauce]] is a related product because it is fermented and contains anchovies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ingredients and manufacture==
Fish sauces historically have been prepared from different species of fish and shellfish, and from using the whole fish, or by using just fish [[blood]] or [[viscera]]. Most modern fish sauces contain only fish and [[edible salt|salt]], usually made from anchovy, shrimp, mackerel, or other strong-flavored, high oil fish. Some variants add [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s. For modern fish sauces, fish or shellfish is mixed with salt at a concentration of 10% to 30%. It is then sealed in a closed container for up to two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|234}}
 
Once the original draft has been made, some fish sauces will be produced through a re-extraction of the fish mass via boiling. To improve the visual appearance and add taste, second-pass fish sauces often have added caramel, molasses, or roasted rice.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee&quot;/&gt;{{RP|234}} They are thinner, and less costly. Some volume manufacturers of fish sauce will also water down a first-press to manufacture more product.

Fish sauce that has been only briefly fermented has a pronounced fishy taste. Extended fermentation reduces this and gives the product a [[nut (fruit)|nuttier]], richer and more savory flavor.{{according to whom|date=June 2014}} An anonymous article, &quot;Neuc-num&quot;, in [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]]'s 18th-century [[Encyclopédie]], states: &quot;It is said that Europeans become accustomed enough to this type of sauce&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |title=Fish Sauce |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0002.783 |website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional variations ==
=== Southeast Asia ===
Southeast Asian fish sauce is often made from [[anchovy|anchovies]], salt, and water, and is intensely flavoured. Anchovies and salt are arranged in wooden barrels to ferment and are slowly pressed, yielding the salty, fishy liquid. The salt extracts the liquid via [[osmosis]].

Southeast Asians generally use fish sauce as a cooking sauce. However, there is a sweet and sour version of this sauce which is used more commonly as a dipping sauce (see ''[[nước chấm]]'').

====Burma====
Fish sauce in [[Burma]] is called ''ngan bya yay'' (ငါးငံပြာရည်).&lt;ref&gt;Mi Mi Khaing, ''Cook and Entertain the Burmese Way'' (Rangoon, 1975) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambodia====
In [[Cambodia]], fish sauce is known as ''teuk trei'' (ទឹកត្រី), of which there are a variety of sauces using fish sauce as a base.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==== Indonesia ====
The [[Indonesia]]n semi-solid [[fish paste]] or fermented [[krill]] ''terasi'', the [[Cambodia]]n ''[[prahok]]'' and the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] fermented [[krill]] brick ''[[belacan]]'' or [[Budu (Malay language)|budu]] from liquid anchovies are other popular variations of fish sauces.

====Laos====
In [[Lao language|Lao]]/[[Isan language|Isan]], it is called ''nam pa''. A chunkier, more aromatic version known as ''[[padaek]]'' is also used.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==== Philippines ====
The [[Philippine condiments|Philippine]] fish sauce is known as ''patis''. It is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patis / Fish Sauce |url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/patis-fish-sauce |website=Market Manila |accessdate=13 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Patis'' is a by-product of ''[[bagoong]]'' production, which include ''[[bagoong isda]]'' (fermented fish) and ''[[bagoong alamang]]'' (fermented [[krill]]), as well as the rarer ''bagoong macabebe'' (fermented [[oyster]]s) and ''bagoong sisi'' (fermented [[clam]]s). The fish used are typically small like [[sardine]]s, [[anchovies]], [[ambassid]]s, and the [[Juvenile fish|fry]] of larger fish. Unlike other fish sauce variants, the fermented solids are not discarded but are sold as separate products. The ''patis'' is skimmed from the upper layers of fermenting ''bagoong'' and is not pressed. As such, ''patis'' usually takes longer to produce than other types of fish sauce as it is reliant on the readiness of ''bagoong''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fib&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vv&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Van Veen, A.G.|editor =Mrak, E.M. |editor2=Stewart, G.F.|title =Advances in Food Research|volume = 4|chapter =Fish Preservation in Southeast Asia|publisher =Academic Press|year =1953|page=217|isbn =9780080567495|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=h6-yzgZaTOAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ffg&quot;/&gt;

''Patis'' is nearly always cooked prior to consumption, even when used as an accent to [[salad]]s or other raw dishes. ''Patis'' is also used as an ingredient in cooked dishes, including a rice porridge called ''[[arroz caldo]]'', and as a condiment for fried fish. ''Patis'' is also used in place of table salt in meals to enhance the flavor of the food, where it can either be dashed from a dispensing bottle onto the food, or poured into a saucer and mixed with [[calamansi]] and [[labuyo chili]]s and used as a dipping sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Olympia, Minerva SD|editor =National Research Council (U.S.).

==== Thailand ====
Fish sauce in [[Thailand]] is called ''nam pla'' ({{lang-th|น้ำปลา}}). In [[Isan language|Isan]], it is called ''nam pa''. Similar to the Laotian ''padaek'' is ''[[pla ra]]'' ({{lang-th|ปลาร้า}}), also used in [[Thai cuisine]]. In Thailand, fish sauce is used both in cooking and also served at the table as a condiment, for instance in noodle soups. Nearly every Thai meal is served with ''phrik nam pla'' as a condiment: a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chopped [[bird's eye chili]]es. Sliced garlic is often added to this sauce.

Historically, there were two types of fish sauce made in Thailand: that made with a fresh-water fish, ''pla soi'', and sauce made from a salt-water fish, ''pla kratak''. Either fish is fermented for at least eight months, three parts fish to two parts salt. The resulting mash is filtered. This yields the best fish sauce, called the &quot;base&quot;. The dregs are then mixed with water and salt and again fermented for three to four months. This yields a second-grade fish sauce, mostly used in cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sukphisit |first1=Suthon |title=Fish Tails |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/food-and-drinks/1581906/fish-tails |accessdate=2018-11-25 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) banned the import of Thai fish sauces due to lack of information about tests for [[botulinum toxin]]. The toxin can cause death if more than 0.5 [[microgram]] is consumed. The Thai Office of Food Safety and Quality then tested 48 brands of fish sauce to determine the content of botulinum toxin in the products. Of 48 brands tested, 28 were genuine fish sauce from 18 production sites in 12 provinces. Twenty samples from production sites in eight provinces were adulterated fish sauce. Tests showed that none were contaminated with botulinum toxin types A, B, E and F and were free of [[clostridium botulinum]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=21 brands of Thai fish sauce free from botulinum toxin |url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/21-brands-thai-fish-sauce-free-botulinum-toxin/ |accessdate=2018-11-25 |work=Thai PBS |date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, rumours again surfaced concerning banned Thai fish sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA denies US ban on fish sauce from Thailand |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30357106 |accessdate=25 November 2018 |work=The Nation |date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vietnam ====
The variety from [[Vietnam]] is called {{lang|vi|nước mắm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robuchon|first1=Joël|title=[[Larousse Gastronomique]]|date=2009|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=9780600620426|page=714|edition=Updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two areas in Vietnam are most famous for producing fish sauce: {{lang|vi|[[Phú Quốc]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|vi|[[Phan Thiết]]|italic=no}}. Popular brands in the US include Mega Chef, Red Boat, 3 Crabs, Golden Boy, and {{lang|vi|Hòn Phan Thiết|italic=no}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kyle Hildebrant |url=https://ourdailybrine.com/fish-sauce-taste-test/ |title=Fish Sauce Taste Test, 13 Brands Compared – Our Daily Brine |publisher=Ourdailybrine.com |date=2014-02-17 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese fish sauces are made with anchovies, mackerel, scabbard fish and salt. High mercury concentration can be found in larger fish, especially if predator fish like scabbard fish.  They do not have any additives like sugar, hydrolyzed protein, or preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnolls.org/3089/what-are-hydrolyzed-soy-protein-and-hydrolyzed-wheat-protein-and-why-are-they-in-everything/ |title=What Are &quot;Hydrolyzed Soy Protein&quot; And &quot;Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein,&quot; And Why Are They in Everything? |publisher=Gnolls.org |date=2012-05-02 |last=Stanton |first=J. |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese prefer sauces without a strong smell, and transparent with a deep golden amber color. &quot;First press&quot; fish sauce, meaning the sauce is bottled from the first time the fermenting barrels are drained, also indicates quality. Lastly, when measuring the [[nitrogen]] level of fish sauces (N), most fish sauce on the market falls within the mid 20N range. Anything over 30N is considered high-grade, and 40N is optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phuquocislandguide.com/phu-quoc-fish-sauce/ |title=Everything you want to know about Phu Quoc Fish Sauce |publisher=Phuquocislandguide.com |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|vi|[[Nước chấm]]}} is a Vietnamese prepared fish-based condiment (also referred to as a &quot;sauce&quot;) that is savory, lightly sweet and salty tasting, and can be sour and spicy if [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[chili pepper]]s are added. The main components are fish sauce, water, and sugar.

{{lang|vi|[[Fish paste|Mắm]]}} is made much like fish sauce, except that it is not fermented as long, and the fish is kept along with its liquid extract, not just the extract. {{lang|vi|Mắm}} can be used as a base condiment in dipping sauces with additional ingredients or used in soups or stir-fries.

==== China ====
In China, fish sauce is called ''yúlù'' ({{lang-zh|鱼露}}, literally &quot;fish dew&quot;) and is native to the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. In Chaoshan cuisine, fish sauce is made with Reeve's shad (''Tenualosa reevesii''), which is unsuitable for direct eating due to being fatty, bony, and odorous.&lt;ref&gt;Flavorful Origins, Season 1, Episode &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japan ====
In Japan, fish sauce is called ''gyoshō'' (魚醤); another name is ''uoshōyu'' (魚醤油), literally 'fish soy sauce'. There are several variations used in regional cuisines. ''Ishiru'' in the [[Noto Peninsula]] is made from [[sardine]] and [[Squid (food)|squid]]. ''Shottsuru'', the best known type of Japanese fish sauce and often used as a synonym for all ''gyoshō'', is from [[Akita Prefecture]] and is mainly made from [[sailfin sandfish]]. ''Ikanago shoyu'' of [[Kagawa Prefecture]] is made from [[sand lance]]. They are used in ''[[nabemono]]'', in salad dressings, and as a flavoring ingredient in [[ramen]] soups.

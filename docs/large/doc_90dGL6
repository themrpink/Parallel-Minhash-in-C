'''Prince of Wales''' ({{lang-cy|Tywysog Cymru}}, {{IPA-cy|təˈwəsog ˈkəmrɨ}}) was a title held by native [[Wales|Welsh]] princes before the 12th century; the term replaced the use of the word ''king''. One of the last Welsh princes, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], was killed at the [[Battle of Orewin Bridge]] in 1282. [[Edward I]], [[King of England]], [[investiture|invested]] his son [[Edward II of England|Edward]] (born in [[Caernarfon Castle]] in 1284) as the first English Prince of Wales in 1301.

Since the 14th century, the title has been a [[Substantive title|dynastic title]] granted by the king or queen to the [[heir apparent]] to the English or [[British monarch]], but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to [[royal succession]]. The title is granted to the heir apparent as a personal honour or dignity, and is not heritable, [[merging with the Crown]] on accession to the throne. Since 1301, the title [[Earl of Chester]] has been given in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;pow-ps&quot;/&gt; The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours, if the eldest son of the monarch; typically this means being [[Duke of Cornwall]], which, unlike being Prince of Wales, inherently includes lands and constitutional and operational responsibilities.

The current and longest-serving Prince of Wales is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], the eldest son of [[Elizabeth II]], who is Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] and 15 other independent [[Commonwealth realm]]s as well as [[Head of the Commonwealth|Head]] of the 53-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The wife of the Prince of Wales is entitled to the title [[Princess of Wales]]. Prince Charles's first wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]], used that title, but his second wife, [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], uses only the title [[Duchess of Cornwall]] (or [[Duke of Rothesay|of Rothesay]] when in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-38656926|title=Duchess of Rothesay opens Rowett research building in Aberdeen|first=Ken|last=Macdonald|date=18 January 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;) because the other title has become so popularly associated with Diana.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The Prince of Wales is the heir apparent of the monarch of the United Kingdom. No formal public role or responsibility has been legislated by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] or otherwise delegated to him by law or custom, either as heir apparent or as Prince of Wales.

The current prince now often assists the queen in the performance of her duties, for example, representing the queen when welcoming dignitaries to London and attending state dinners during state visits. He has also represented the queen and the United Kingdom overseas at state and ceremonial occasions such as state funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince of Wales - Royal Duties|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/royal-duties|publisher=Clarence House|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen also has given the Prince of Wales the authority to issue [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrants]].

[[File:Coat of Arms of Charles, Prince of Wales.svg|thumb|220px|right|The [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|full armorial achievement]] of Charles, Prince of Wales (since 1958)]]

===Native Welsh usage===
For most of the post-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] period, [[Wales]] was divided into several smaller royal kingdoms. Before the [[Norman conquest of England]], the most powerful Welsh ruler at any given time was generally known as [[King of the Britons]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries, this title evolved into ''Prince of Wales'' (see {{lang|cy|[[Brut y Tywysogion]]}}). In [[Latin]], the new title was {{lang|la|Princeps Walliae}}, and in Welsh it was {{lang|cy|Tywysog Cymru}}. The literal translation of {{lang|cy|[[Tywysog]]}} is &quot;leader&quot; (compare the cognate [[Irish language|Irish]] word {{lang|ga|[[taoiseach]]}}; the verb {{lang|cy|tywys}} means &quot;to lead&quot;).

Only a handful of native princes had their claim to the overlordship of Wales recognised by the English Crown; however Wales had many Princes during self rule. The first known to have used such a title was {{lang|cy|[[Owain Gwynedd]]|italic=no}}, adopting the title Prince of the Welsh around 1165 after earlier using {{lang|la|rex Waliae}} (&quot;King of Wales&quot;).

{{lang|cy|Rhys ap Gruffydd|italic=no}} held the kingdom of {{lang|cy|[[Deheubarth]]|italic=no}} in south Wales from 1155 to 1197. He usually used the title ''Proprietary Prince of {{lang|cy|Deheubarth|italic=unset}}'' or ''Prince of South Wales'', but two documents have been discovered in which he uses the title ''Prince of Wales'' or ''Prince of the Welsh''. Rhys was one of the most successful and powerful Welsh princes and, after the death of {{lang|cy|Owain Gwynedd|italic=no}} of {{lang|cy|Gwynedd|italic=no}} in 1170, he became the dominant power in Wales. He is commonly known as The Lord {{lang|cy|Rhys|italic=no}}, in Welsh {{lang|cy|Yr Arglwydd Rhys}}.

[[Llywelyn the Great]], grandson of {{lang|cy|Owain Gwynedd|italic=no}}, is not known to have used the title ''Prince of Wales'' as such, although his use, from around 1230, of the style ''Prince of {{lang|cy|Aberffraw|italic=unset}}, Lord of Snowdon'' was tantamount to a proclamation of authority over most of Wales, and he did use the title ''Prince of North Wales'', as did his predecessor {{lang|cy|[[Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd]]|italic=no}}.

In 1240, the title was theoretically inherited by his son {{lang|cy|[[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]]|italic=no}}, though he is not known to have used it. Instead he styled himself as ''Prince of Wales'' around 1244, the first Welsh prince to do so. In 1246, his nephew {{lang|cy|[[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]|italic=no}} succeeded to the throne of {{lang|cy|Gwynedd|italic=no}}, and used the style as early as 1258. In 1267, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Montgomery]], he was recognised by both King [[Henry III of England]] and the [[papal legate|representative of the Papacy]] as Prince of Wales. In 1282, Llywelyn was killed during [[Edward I of England]]'s [[conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|conquest of Wales]] and although his brother {{lang|cy|[[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]]|italic=no}} succeeded to the Welsh princeship, issuing documents as prince, his principality was not recognised by the English Crown.

Three Welshmen, however, claimed the title of Prince of Wales after 1283.

The first was {{lang|cy|[[Madog ap Llywelyn]]}}, a member of the [[House of Gwynedd]], who led a nationwide revolt in 1294–5, defeating English forces in battle near [[Denbigh]] and seizing [[Caernarfon Castle]]. His revolt was suppressed, however, after the [[Battle of Maes Moydog|Battle of {{lang|cy|Maes Moydog|italic=no|nocat=y}}]] in March 1295, and the prince was imprisoned in London.

In the 1370s, {{lang|cy|[[Owain Lawgoch]]}} ('Red Hand'), an English-born descendant of one of {{lang|cy|Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|italic=no}}'s brothers, claimed the title of Prince of Wales, but was assassinated in France in 1378 before he could return to Wales to claim his inheritance.

{{lang|cy|[[Owain Glyndŵr]]}} was proclaimed Prince of Wales by his supporters on 16 September 1400, and held parliaments at [[Harlech Castle]] and elsewhere during his revolt, which encompassed all of Wales. It was not until 1409 that his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was suppressed by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].

===As title of heir apparent===
The tradition of conferring the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; on the [[heir apparent]] of the monarch is usually considered to have begun in 1301, when King [[Edward I of England]] invested his son Edward of Caernarfon with the title at a Parliament held in Lincoln. According to legend, the king had promised the Welsh that he would name &quot;a prince born in Wales, who did not speak a word of English&quot; and then produced his infant son, who had been born at [[Caernarfon]], to their surprise. However, the story may well be [[apocryphal]], as it can only be traced to the 16th century, and, in the time of Edward I, the English aristocracy spoke [[Norman French]], not English (some versions of the legend include lack of knowledge in both languages as a requirement, and one reported version has the very specific phrase &quot;born on Welsh soil and speaking no other language&quot;).

[[William Camden]] wrote in his 1607 work ''Britannia'' that originally the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was not conferred automatically upon the eldest living son of the King of England because Edward II (who had been the first English Prince of Wales) neglected to invest his eldest son, the future Edward III, with that title. It was Edward III who revived the practice of naming the eldest son Prince of Wales, which was then maintained by his successors:

{{quote|But King Edward the Second conferred not upon his sonne Edward the title of Prince of Wales, but onely the name of Earle of Chester and of Flint, so farre as ever I could learne out of the Records, and by that title summoned him to Parliament, being then nine yeres old. King Edward the Third first created his eldest sonne Edward surnamed the Blacke Prince, the Mirour of Chivalrie (being then Duke of Cornwall and Earle of Chester), Prince of Wales by solemne investure, with a cap of estate and Coronet set on his head, a gold ring put upon his finger, and a silver vierge delivered into his hand, with the assent of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/glameng.html#glam1 Glamorganshire]. Philological.bham.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2012-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, according to conventional wisdom, since 1301 the Prince of Wales has usually been the eldest living son (if and only if he is also the heir apparent) of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of the United Kingdom, 1801). That he is also the heir apparent is important. Following the death of Prince Arthur, the Prince of Wales, Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title—although only after it was clear that Arthur's wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], was not pregnant; when [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]] died while his father reigned, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] created Frederick's son [[George III of the United Kingdom|George]] (the king's grandson and new heir apparent) Prince of Wales. The title is not automatic and is not heritable; it merges into the Crown when a prince accedes to the throne, or lapses on his death leaving the sovereign free to re-grant it to the new heir apparent (such as the late prince's son or brother). Prince Charles was created Prince of Wales on 26 July 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41460|page=4733|date=29 July 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; some six years after he became heir apparent, and had to wait another 11 years for his [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|investiture]], on 1 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/biography/investiture/ |title=The Prince of Wales&amp;nbsp;— Investiture |publisher=Princeofwales.gov.uk |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title Prince of Wales is nowadays always conferred along with the Earldom of [[Chester]]. The convention began in 1399; all previous English Princes of Wales also received the earldom, but separately from the title of Prince. Indeed, before 1272 a hereditary and not necessarily royal [[Earl of Chester|Earldom of Chester]] had already been created several times, eventually merging in the Crown each time. The earldom was recreated, merging in the Crown in 1307 and again in 1327. Its creations since have been associated with the creations of the Prince of Wales.

On 31 October 1460,&lt;ref name=&quot;cokayne908&quot;&gt;Cokayne, and others, The Complete Peerage, volume XII/2, page 908.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] was briefly created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall and [[Lord Protector of England]] by an Act of Parliament following the [[Act of Accord]], as part of his arrangement to succeed [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as king instead of Henry's own son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies1856&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Silvester Davies|title=An English chronicle of the reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI written before the year 1471: with an appendix, containing the 18th and 19th years of Richard II and the Parliament at Bury St. Edmund's, 25th Henry VI and supplementary a|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_4UAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=26 July 2013|year=1856|publisher=Printed for the Camden Society|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Richard was killed on 30 December 1460 at the Battle of Wakefield.

==Heraldic insignia and investiture==
===Insignia===
{{main|Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales}}
{{for|theories about the origin of the ostrich feather badge and motto|Prince of Wales's feathers}}

[[File:Prince of Wales' feathers Badge.svg|thumb|[[Prince of Wales's feathers|The &quot;Prince of Wales's Feathers&quot;]]. This [[heraldic badge]] of the heir apparent is derived from the [[ostrich]] feathers borne by [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. The German [[motto]] &quot;''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}''&quot; means &quot;I serve&quot;.]]
As [[heir apparent]] to the reigning sovereign, the Prince of Wales bears the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]] [[cadency|differenced]] by a white label of three points. To represent Wales he bears the [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales]], crowned with the heir apparent's crown, on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon-en-surtout]]. This was first used by the future King Edward VIII in 1910, and followed by the current Prince of Wales, Prince Charles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishflags.net/princeofwales.html Prince of Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711195346/http://www.britishflags.net/princeofwales.html |date=11 July 2018 }}. britishflags.net. Retrieved on 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a [[heraldic badge|badge]] of [[Prince of Wales's feathers|three ostrich feathers]] (which can be seen on the reverse of the previous design for decimal [[British two pence coin]]s dated up to 2008); it dates back to the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]] and is his as the English heir even before he is made Prince of Wales.

In addition to these symbols used most frequently, he has a special standard for use in Wales itself. Moreover, as [[Duke of Rothesay]] he has a special coat of arms for use in [[Scotland]] (and a corresponding standard); as [[Duke of Cornwall]] the like for use in the Duchy of Cornwall. Representations of all three may be found at [[List of British flags]].

===Investiture===
{{see also|Investiture of the Prince of Wales}}
[[File:Cofia 1282, a protest against the investiture (1537984)4.jpg|thumb|Many Welsh nationalists were opposed to the investiture of Prince Charles at [[Caernarfon Castle]]. A large protest was organised in the town in the months before the Investiture.]]
Princes of Wales may be [[Investiture|invested]], but investiture is not necessary to be created Prince of Wales. Peers were also invested, but investitures for peers ceased in 1621, during a time when peerages were being created so frequently that the investiture ceremony became cumbersome and was replaced with [[Introduction (House of Lords)|Introduction]]. Most investitures for Princes of Wales were held in front of Parliament.

After falling into abeyance, the 20th century saw the practice of investing the Prince of Wales reintroduced. In 1911, the future [[Edward VIII]] underwent an investiture ceremony in [[Caernarfon Castle]] in Wales at the instigation of the Welsh politician [[David Lloyd George]]. Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s heir, the present Prince of Wales, was also invested there and underwent a similar ceremony in 1969.

In the ceremony (in its most recent form), during the reading of the [[letters patent]] creating the dignity, the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]] are delivered to the prince.

The coronet of the heir apparent bears four crosses pattée alternating with four [[fleur-de-lys|fleurs-de-lis]], surmounted by two half-arches (the Sovereign's crowns are of the same design, but use four half-arches). A gold rod is also used in the insignia; gold rods were formally used in the investitures of dukes, but survive now in the investitures of Princes of Wales only. Also part of the insignia are a ring, a sword and a robe.

==Other titles==
Since 1301 the title [[Earl of Chester]] has been granted to each heir apparent to the English throne who was also Prince of Wales. Both titles are given to each individual holder by the Sovereign and are not automatically acquired.&lt;ref name=&quot;pow-ps&quot;/&gt; The Earldom of Chester was one of the most powerful earldoms in [[medieval England]] extending principally over the counties of [[Cheshire]] and [[Flintshire]].

A Prince of Wales also holds a number of additional titles. As heir apparent to the English/British throne he is&amp;mdash;if the eldest living son of the monarch&amp;mdash;[[Duke of Cornwall]], which includes lands and constitutional and operational responsibilities. As heir apparent to the Scottish throne he is [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]], [[Lord of the Isles]], and [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]].

Individual princes have also held additional titles, which were theirs prior to becoming Prince of Wales. Before ascending the throne [[Henry VIII]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[George V]] were each [[Duke of York]]. Prior to his father inheriting the English throne in 1603, the future Charles I was created [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]] in Scotland. Both [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick]] (eldest son of George II) and his son [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]] (later George III) were [[Duke of Edinburgh]].

==Heir apparent versus heir presumptive==
The title Prince of Wales is given only to the heir apparent—somebody who cannot be displaced in the succession to the throne by any future birth. The succession had followed male-preference [[primogeniture]], which meant that the heir apparent was the eldest son of the reigning monarch or, if he was deceased, ''his'' eldest son and so on, or if the monarch's eldest son had died without issue, the monarch's second eldest son, etc. As such, a daughter of the sovereign who was next in line to the throne was never the heir apparent because she would be displaced in the succession by any future legitimate son of the sovereign.

Along with the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the United Kingdom in 2011 committed to the [[Perth Agreement]], which proposed changes to the laws governing succession, including altering the primogeniture to [[Absolute cognatic primogeniture|absolute cognatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Smith-Spark|url=http://us.cnn.com/2011/10/28/world/europe/uk-monarchy/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|title=Girls given equal rights to British throne under law changes|work=CNN|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] was introduced to the British parliament on 12 December 2012, published the next day, and received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/successiontothecrown.html Succession to the Crown Act.] Parliament of the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; It was brought into force on 26 March 2015,&lt;ref name=commencement&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/894/made Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (Commencement) Order 2015] at legislation.org.uk (retrieved 30 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as the other realms implemented the Perth Agreement in their own laws.&lt;ref name=inforce&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-03-26/HCWS490/ Statement by Nick Clegg MP, UK parliament website], 26 March 2015 (retrieved on same date).&lt;/ref&gt; No woman has yet held the title ''[[Princess of Wales]]'' in her own right.

Since the title of ''Prince of Wales'' is not automatic, there have been times when it was held by no one. There was no heir apparent during the reign of King [[George VI]], who had no sons. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] was heiress presumptive and was hence not titled Princess of Wales. There was also no Prince of Wales for the first several years of the reign of Elizabeth II. Prince Charles was not named Prince of Wales until 1958, when he was nine years old.

The title of ''Princess of Wales'' has always been held by the Prince's wife in her capacity as spouse of the heir apparent and therefore future [[queen consort]]. The current  Princess of Wales is [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], who automatically assumed the title upon her legal marriage to Prince Charles. Camilla however has chosen not to be publicly known by the title due to its association with her predecessor, [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]].

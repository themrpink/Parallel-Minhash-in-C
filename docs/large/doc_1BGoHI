&lt;/div&gt;
Every article on a historical topic should be assigned to as specific a sub-category under the [[:Category:History]] as possible, as well as to any non-history categories to which it belongs. Since Wikipedia has tens of thousands of articles on historical subjects, they shouldn't all be placed directly in [[:Category:History]]; there is an elaborate hierarchy of historical categories, described here, and only the lowest-level category need be assigned.

'''Category tree'''

*List of {{subpages}}
&lt;categorytree depth=0&gt;History&lt;/categorytree&gt;
[[Image:Crystal 128 kivio.png|noframe|48px|left]]

'''Organization of [[:Category:History]]'''

[[:Category:History]] contains only the most general articles, such as [[History]] and [[Human history]]. Other historical articles appear in one or more sub-categories
{{Hidden||
*[[:Category:History by nation]] contains the histories of modern nations. It should contain one category for each modern nation, for example [[:History of the United Kingdom]].
*[[:Category:History by region]] contains the histories of regions larger than a nation, for example [[:Category:European history]].
*[[:Category:History by period]] contains histories organized by chronology, for example [[:Category:Ancient history]].
*[[:Category:History by topic]] contains histories not organized by geography or chronology, for example [[:Category:History of science]].
*[[:Category:Historiography]] contains articles about the study of history and historians.

* See also: [[Wikipedia:Auto-categorization]]}}

'''Category names'''

The category for the history of the modern nation X should be called &quot;History of X&quot; or &quot;History of the X&quot; and included. 
&lt;!----
{{Hidden||
The history of subject Y should be categorized under &quot;History of Y&quot;. But the alternate name &quot;Xish history&quot; is acceptable. When a country no longer exists, there's no need to have a separate &quot;History of&quot; category for it. For example, since we have [[:Category:Ancient Rome]], there's no need for a category &quot;History of Ancient Rome&quot;.

When &quot;History of X&quot; becomes large (more than fifty articles, say), create sub-categories and move articles to them. Standard sub-categories include:
*&quot;Political history of X&quot;
*&quot;Economic history of X&quot;
*&quot;Religious history of X&quot;
*&quot;Legal history of X&quot;
*&quot;Cultural history of X&quot;
*&quot;Military history of X&quot;
*&quot;Presidents/Prime ministers/Monarchs/Heads of State/Rulers of X&quot; (delete as appropriate)

Don't create sub-categories until you have enough articles to populate them. As a rough guide, it's not worth creating a sub-category unless you have five articles to put in it.

&quot;Y history of X&quot; should be a sub-category of both &quot;History of X&quot; and of &quot;History of Y&quot;. For example, [[:Category:Military history of the United Kingdom]] is a sub-category of both [[:Category:Military history]] and of [[:Category:History of the United Kingdom]].
---&gt;
===Organization of national histories===
Few nations have neat histories: most have changed name, constitution and boundaries over their history. This section gives advice on creating sub-categories to reflect these changes.
{{Hidden||
Using the United Kingdom as an example:
*Have separate history categories for each major geographical part and historical predecessor of that nation: [[:Category:History of Wales]], [[:Category:History of England]], [[:Category:History of Scotland]], [[:Category:History of Great Britain]], [[:Category:History of Northern Ireland]], etc.
*Use the common names where possible even if this creates ambiguity. For example, England is both a historical nation and a geographical region: logically speaking we might prefer a category named like &quot;History of England (1066–1707)&quot;, but unfortunately no-one is likely to use such a category name unless they are familiar with the categorization scheme. So [[:Category:History of England]] must do for both.
*A geographical subdivision includes the categories for its parts; a historical subdivision includes the categories for its predecessors. This might create loops in the categories, for example [[:Category:History of Ireland]] is in [[:Category:History of the Republic of Ireland]] by the historical rule, and the latter is in the former by the geographical rule. This does no harm.
*The category &quot;History of X&quot; always belongs to the category for &quot;X&quot;, if it exists. So [[:Category:History of England]] belongs to [[:Category:England]].
*Put events in the most specific categor(ies) to which they apply. So the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] go in both [[:Category:History of England]] and [[:Category:History of Scotland]], but [[:Category:Seven Years' War]] goes in [[:Category:History of Great Britain]].
Here's an incomplete diagram showing these historical categories and how they relate in the category system: 
{{Wikipedia:WikiProject History/CategoryExample}}
(This diagram is far from complete: there is a [[:Category:British Empire]], not shown. [[:Category:History of the United Kingdom]] is in [[:Category:United Kingdom]] and so on. And there are many sub-categories. But it illustrates the principles.)
}}

'''Don't over-categorize'''

Having added an article to, say, [[:Category:Military history of the United Kingdom]], there's no need to also add that article to [[:Category:Military history]], [[:Category:History of the United Kingdom]], [[:Category:United Kingdom]] or [[:Category:History]]. The category hierarchy expresses the fact that every article about the military history of the UK is an article about military history and an article about the UK.

[[File:LewesBattle Big.jpg|thumb|300px|Monument to the Battle of Lewes]]
The '''Battle of Lewes''' was one of two main [[battle]]s of the conflict known as the [[Second Barons' War]]. It took place at [[Lewes]] in [[Sussex]], on 14 May 1264. It marked the high point of the career of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], and made him the &quot;uncrowned King of England&quot;.  [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] left the safety of [[Lewes Castle]] and [[St. Pancras Priory]] to engage the Barons in battle and was initially successful, his son [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]] routing part of the baronial army with a cavalry charge.  However Edward pursued his quarry off the battlefield and left Henry's men exposed.  Henry was forced to launch an infantry attack up Offham Hill where he was defeated by the barons' men defending the hilltop.  The royalists fled back to the castle and priory and the King was forced to sign the [[Mise of Lewes]], ceding many of his powers to Montfort.

== Background ==
Henry III was an unpopular monarch due to his autocratic style, displays of favouritism and his refusal to negotiate with his barons.  The barons eventually imposed a constitutional reform known as the [[Provisions of Oxford]] upon Henry that called for a thrice-yearly meeting led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] to discuss matters of government.  Henry sought to escape the restrictions of the provisions and applied to [[Louis IX of France]] to arbitrate in the dispute.  Louis agreed with Henry and annulled the provisions. Montfort was angered by this and rebelled against the King along with other barons in the [[Second Barons' War]].&lt;ref name=bt&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Lewes|url=http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/medieval/battleview.asp?BattleFieldId=22|work=UK Battlefields Resource Centre|publisher=Battlefields Trust|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war was not initially openly fought, each side toured the country to raise support for their army. A series of massacres of Jews in Worcester, London, Canterbury and other cities were conducted by Montfort's allies.&lt;ref name=KJ&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Continuum |ol = 24816680M |isbn = 9781847251862 |publication-place = London |title = The king's Jews |url = https://archive.org/details/kingsjewsmoneyma00mund |author = Robin R. Mundill |lccn = 2010282921 |publication-date = 2010 |oclc = 466343661 }}, see p 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=England|first=Joseph |last=Jacobs|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5764-england|volume=5|pages=161–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May the King's force had reached [[Lewes]] where they intended to halt for a while to allow reinforcements to reach them.&lt;ref name=bt/&gt; The King encamped at [[St. Pancras Priory]] with a force of infantry, but his son, Prince Edward (later King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]), commanded the cavalry at [[Lewes Castle]] {{convert|500|yd|m}} to the north.&lt;ref name=m271&gt;Maddicott, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; De Montfort approached the King with the intention of negotiating a truce or failing that to draw him into open battle.  The King rejected the negotiations and de Montfort moved his men from [[Fletching, East Sussex|Fletching]] to Offham Hill, a mile to the north-west of Lewes, in a night march that surprised the royalist forces.&lt;ref name=bt/&gt;&lt;ref name=m271/&gt;

== Deployment ==
The royalist army was up to twice the size of de Montfort's.&lt;ref&gt;Burne, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry held command of the centre, with Prince Edward, [[William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], and [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]], on the right; and [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], and his son, [[Henry of Almain]], on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five commanders&quot;&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/k-o/lewes.pdf English Heritage Battlefield Report: Lewes 1264]&lt;/ref&gt; The barons held the higher ground, overlooking Lewes and had ordered their men to wear white crosses as a distinguishing emblem.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; De Montfort split his forces into four parts, giving his son, [[Henry de Montfort]] command of one quarter; [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester|Gilbert de Clare]] with [[John FitzJohn]] and [[William of Montchensy]] another; a third portion consisting of Londoners was placed under [[Nicholas de Segrave]] whilst de Montfort himself led the fourth quarter with [[Thomas of Pelveston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;five commanders&quot;/&gt;

== Battle ==
The baronial forces commenced the battle with a surprise dawn attack on foragers sent out from the royalist forces.  The King then made his move.  Edward led a cavalry charge against Segrave's Londoners, placed on the left of the baronial line, that caused them to break and run to the village of [[Hamsey#Offham|Offham]].  Edward pursued his foe for some four miles, leaving the King unsupported.&lt;ref name=&quot;five commanders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich, pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was forced to launch an attack with his centre and right divisions straight up Offham Hill into the baronial line which awaited them at the defensive.  Cornwall's division faltered almost immediately but Henry's men fought on until compelled to retreat by the arrival of de Montfort's men that had been held as the baronial reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;five commanders&quot;/&gt;

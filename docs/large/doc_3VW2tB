===Castle===
{{Main|Winchester Castle}}
[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Winchester Round Table&quot; in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]
Winchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks, Winchester|Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ministry of Defence training&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]
The [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s. Since at least the 14th century, and still available today, a 'wayfarer's dole' of ale and bread has been handed out there. It was supposedly instigated to aid pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury]].

== Winchester in fiction ==

===Medieval===
In the medieval narrative poem, [[Sir Orfeo]], the main character Sir Orfeo is King of Winchester, which is said to be the modern name of [[Thrace]]. The final combat of the romance hero [[Guy of Warwick]] against the giant [[Colbrand (giant)|Colbrand]] takes place outside the walls of Winchester.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] author [[Sir Thomas Malory]] identified Winchester as the mythical home of [[Camelot]] and [[King Arthur]] in [[Le Morte d'Arthur]], his collection of medieval legends about the Arthurian myths.  (Malory's editor [[William Caxton]] disputed this, insisting that Camelot must be in [[Wales]]).

===19th century===
A scene in ''[[The History of Henry Esmond|Henry Esmond]]'' (1852) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] is set in the choir of Winchester cathedral. Winchester is in part the model for ''Barchester'' in the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire|Barsetshire]]'' novels of [[Anthony Trollope]], who attended Winchester College; ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) is said to be based on a scandal at the [[Hospital of St Cross]]. A fictionalised Winchester appears as ''Wintoncester'' in [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891). Some of the action in [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]'' (1892) takes place in the city—the Black Swan hotel mentioned in the story formerly stood at the end of Southgate St and is still acknowledged by a figure on the outside of the building.

In [[Charles Kingsley]]'s romantic history ''[[Hereward the Wake (novel)|Hereward the Wake]]'' (1866), Hereward smashes his ash lance against the doors of the [[Westgate, Winchester]] showing by the strength of his arm that it is he. William the Conqueror is so impressed that he pardons him.

===20th century===
A fictitious estate near Winchester is the scene of a crime in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] adventure, ''[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]'' (1922).

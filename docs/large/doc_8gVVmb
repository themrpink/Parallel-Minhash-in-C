Although the Umayyad's were harsh when it came to defeating their Zoroastrian adversaries,&lt;ref&gt;Marietta Stepaniants, Philosophy East and West Vol. 52, No. 2 (Apr., 2002), pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt; they did offer protection and relative religious tolerance to the Zoroastrians who accepted their authority.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, [[Umar II]] was reported to have said in one of his letters commanding not to &quot;destroy a synagogue or a church or temple of fire worshippers (meaning the [[Zoroastrians]]) as long as they have reconciled with and agreed upon with the Muslims&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Recorded by Ibn Abu Shayba in Al-Musanaf and Abu 'Ubaid Ibn Sallam in his book Al-Amwal, pp.123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Donner]] says that Zoroastrians in the northern parts of Iran were hardly penetrated by the &quot;believers&quot;, winning virtually complete autonomy in-return for tribute-tax or [[jizyah]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred M Donner, Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam,(May 2010), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Donner adds &quot;[[Zoroastrians]] continued to exist in large numbers in northern and western Iran and elsewhere for centuries after the rise of Islam, and indeed, much of the canon of Zoroastrian religious texts was elaborated and written down during the Islamic period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christians]] and Jews still continued to produce great theological thinkers within their communities, but as time wore on, many of the intellectuals converted to Islam, leading to a lack of great thinkers in the non-Muslim communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ochsenwald|first=William|author-link=William L.

Although non-Muslims could not hold the highest public offices in the empire, they held many bureaucratic positions within the government. An important example of Christian employment in the Umayyad government is that of [[Sarjun ibn Mansur]]. He was a [[Melkite]] [[Christians|Christian]] official of the early Umayyad Caliphate. The son of a prominent [[Byzantine]] official of [[Damascus]], he was a favourite of the early Umayyad caliphs [[Mu'awiya I]] and [[Yazid I]], and served as the head of the fiscal administration for [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] from the mid-7th century until the year 700, when Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] dismissed him as part of his efforts to Arabicize the administration of the Caliphate. According to the Muslim historians [[al-Baladhuri]] and [[al-Tabari]], Sanjur was a ''[[mawla]]'' of the first [[Umayyad]] caliph, [[Mu'awiya I]] ({{reign|661|680}}),{{efn|Mu'awiya I was generally favourably disposed towards Christians and, according to [[al-Ya'qubi]], the first Muslim caliph to employ Christians in administrative positions.{{sfn|Griffith|2016|p=31}}}} serving as his &quot;secretary and the person in charge of his business&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMBZ&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Morony|1996|p=216}} The hagiographies, although less reliable, also assign to him a role in the administration, even as &quot;ruler&quot; (''[[archon]]'' or even ''[[amir]]''), of Damascus and its environs, where he was responsible for collecting the revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMBZ&quot;/&gt; In this capacity, he is attested in later collections of source material such as that of [[al-Mas'udi]].{{sfn|Griffith|2016|p=31}} Sarjun ibn Mansur was replaced by [[Sulayman ibn Sa'd al-Khushani]], another Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sprengling213&quot;&gt;Sprengling 1939, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muawiya's marriage to [[Maysun bint Bahdal]] (Yazid's mother) was politically motivated, as she was the daughter of the chief of the [[Kalb]] tribe, which was a large [[Syriac Orthodox Christian]] Arab tribe in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; The Kalb tribe had remained largely neutral when the Muslims first went into Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam Volume VII page 265&quot;/&gt; After the plague that killed much of the Muslim army in Syria, by marrying Maysun, Muawiyah used the [[Syriac Orthodox Christians]] against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].

Tom Holland writes {{sfn|Holland|2013|p=402}} Christians, Jews, [[Samaritans]] and [[Manichaeans]] were all treated well by Muawiyah. Muawiyah even restored Edessa's cathedral after it had been toppled by an earthquake.{{sfn|Holland|2013|p=406}} Savagely though Muawiyah prosecuted his wars against the Romans, yet his subjects, no longer trampled by rival armies, no longer divided by hostile watchtowers, knew only peace at last. Justice flourished in his time, and there was great peace in the regions under his control. He allowed everyone to live as they wanted.&quot;{{sfn|Holland|2013|p=402}}&lt;ref&gt;John bar Penkaye page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muawiyah I]]'s family, including his progenitors, [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]] and his wife [[Hind bint Utbah]], were originally opponents of [[Islam]] and particularly of [[Muhammad]] until the [[Conquest of Mecca]], but they converted to the religion in 630. However, many early history books, e.g., ''The Islamic Conquest of Syria Fatuhusham'', by al-Imam al-Waqidi, state that, after their conversion to Islam, Muhammad appointed [[Muawiyah I]]'s father [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]] and his brother [[Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan]] as army commanders.

The defeat of the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] opened the way for Muslim expansion into Jerusalem and Syria.

In 639, Muawiyah was appointed as the governor of Syria by the second caliph, [[Umar]], after the two previous governors—his brother [[Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan]] and, before him, [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]]—died in a plague along with 25,000 other people.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Madelung| first = Wilferd| title = The Succession to Muhammad A Study of the Early Caliphate| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC| year = 1998| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-64696-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Chronology Of Islamic History 570-1000 CE, By H.U.

Muawiyah next set about creating allies. Muawiyah married Maysum, the daughter of the chief of the [[Banu Kalb|Kalb]] tribe, a large Jacobite Christian Arab tribe in Syria. His marriage to Maysum was politically motivated. The Kalb tribe had remained largely neutral when the Muslims first went into Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam Volume VII page 265&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam Volume VII, page 265, By Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt; Muawiyah now could use the Jacobite Christians to restore the ranks of the plague-depleted army against the Romans.

Rahman 1999 Page 72&lt;/ref&gt; With limited resources and the Byzantines just over the border, Muawiyah worked in cooperation with the local Christian population. To stop Byzantine harassment from the sea during the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]], in 649 Muawiyah set up a navy, which was manned by [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christians]], [[Copts]], and [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Christian]] sailors and Muslim troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Kennedy page 326&quot; /&gt;

Muawiya was one of the first to realize the full importance of having a navy; as long as the Byzantine fleet could sail the Mediterranean unopposed, the coastlines of Syria, Palestine and Egypt would never be safe. Muawiyah, along with Adbullah ibn Sa'd, the new governor of Egypt, successfully persuaded Uthman to give them permission to construct a large fleet in the dockyards of Egypt and Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;A Chronology Of Islamic History 570–1000 CE, By H.U.

===Historical significance===
{{History of the Levant}}
The Umayyad caliphate was marked both by territorial expansion and by the administrative and cultural problems that such expansion created. Despite some notable exceptions, the Umayyads tended to favor the rights of the old Arab families, and in particular their own, over those of newly converted Muslims (mawali). Therefore, they held to a less universalist conception of Islam than did many of their rivals. As G.R. Hawting has written, &quot;Islam was in fact regarded as the property of the conquering aristocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Hawting, ''The first dynasty of Islam: the Umayyad caliphate, AD 661–750'' (London, 2000), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the Umayyads, Arabic became the administrative language and the process of [[Arabization]] was initiated in the Levant, Mesopotamia, North Africa and Iberia. State documents and currency were issued in the Arabic. Mass conversions also created a growing population of Muslims in the territory of the Caliphate.

According to one common view, the Umayyads transformed the caliphate from a religious institution (during the [[rashidun|Rashidun caliphate]]) to a dynastic one.&lt;ref name=Previte-Orton236&gt;Previté-Orton (1971), pg 236&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Umayyad caliphs do seem to have understood themselves as the representatives of God on earth, and to have been responsible for the &quot;definition and elaboration of God's ordinances, or in other words the definition or elaboration of Islamic law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P. Crone and M. Hinds, ''God's caliph: religious authority in the first centuries of Islam'' (Cambridge, 1986), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Umayyads have met with a largely negative reception from later Islamic historians, who have accused them of promoting a kingship (''mulk'', a term with connotations of tyranny) instead of a true caliphate (''khilafa''). In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as ''khalifat rasul Allah'' (&quot;successor of the messenger of God&quot;, the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as ''khalifat Allah'' (&quot;deputy of God&quot;). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads &quot;regarded themselves as God's representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Hawting, ''The first dynasty of Islam: the Umayyad caliphate, AD 661–750'' (London, 2000), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In [[Historiography of early Islam|reconstructing this history]], therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] and [[Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri|Baladhuri]], that were written in the Abbasid court at [[Baghdad]].

Modern [[Arab nationalism]] regards the period of the Umayyads as part of the Arab Golden Age which it sought to emulate and restore.{{dubious|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--Arab nationalism does not equal &quot;re-establish the caliphate&quot; jihadism--&gt;
This is particularly true of Syrian nationalists and the present-day state of Syria, centered like that of the Umayyads on Damascus.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The Umayyad dynastic color was white, after the banner of Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hathaway | first = Jane | title = A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780791486108 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=L-lPC7DgepEC | page = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now one of the four [[Pan-Arab colors|Pan-Arab colours]] which appear in various combinations on the flags of most Arab countries.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Umayyad architecture}}
[[File:Umayyad Mosque, Damascus - 5139602246.jpg|thumb|Umayyad Mosque of Damascus]]
Throughout the [[Levant]], Egypt and [[North Africa]], the Umayyads constructed grand congregational mosques and desert palaces, as well as various garrison cities (''[[amsar]]'') to fortify their frontiers such as [[Fustat]], [[Kairouan]], [[Kufa]], [[Basra]] and [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]]. Many of these buildings feature Byzantine stylistic and architectural features, such as [[Roman mosaic]]s and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]]. Their most famous constructions include the [[Dome of the Rock]] at [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] at [[Damascus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Previte-Orton236&quot; /&gt; and other constructions include [[Hisham's Palace]], [[Qusayr 'Amra|Qusayr' Amra]], the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] and the [[Great Mosque of Aleppo]]. Some of these buildings, such as the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, reflect the diversity of the empire, as thousands of Greek, Persian, Coptic, Indian and Persian craftsmen were conscripted to construct them. The later Emirate of Cordoba (an offshoot of the Umayyad dynasty in exile) established many endearing architectural projects in the Iberian Peninsula such as the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] and [[Medina Azahara]], which influenced the architectural styles during the Middle Ages.

===Theological view of the Umayyads===
====Sunni====
Many Muslims criticized the Umayyads for having too many non-Muslim, former Roman administrators in their government, ''e.g.'', St. [[John of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ioTXW3316AC&amp;q=saint%20john%20umayyad%20administrators&amp;pg=PA48|title=A Companion to the History of the Middle East|first=Youssef M.|last=Choueiri|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books|isbn=9781405152044}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Muslims took over cities, they left the people's political representatives, the Roman tax collectors, and the administrators in office. The taxes to the central government were calculated and negotiated by the people's political representatives. Both the central and local governments were compensated for the services each provided. Many Christian cities used some of the taxes to maintain their churches and run their own organizations. Later, the Umayyads were criticized by some Muslims for not reducing the taxes of the people who converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter12/objectives/deluxe-content.html|title=Student Resources, Chapter 12: The First Global Civilization: The Rise and Spread of Islam, IV. The Arab Empire of the Umayyads, G. Converts and 'People of the Book'|publisher=occawlonline.pearsoned.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020521215309/http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/stearns_awl/chapter12/objectives/deluxe-content.html|archivedate=21 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] came to power, he reduced these taxes. He is therefore praised as one of the greatest Muslim rulers after the four [[Rightly Guided Caliphs]]. Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam who lived in 829 and wrote a biography on Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz&lt;ref&gt;Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the reduction in these taxes stimulated the economy and created wealth but it also reduced the government's budget, including, eventually, the defence budget.

The only Umayyad ruler who is unanimously praised by Sunni sources for his devout piety and justice is Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. In his efforts to spread [[Islam]], he established liberties for the ''[[Mawali]]'' by abolishing the [[jizya]] tax for converts to Islam. Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam stated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz also stopped the personal allowance offered to his relatives, stating that he could only give them an allowance if he gave an allowance to everyone else in the empire. After Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was poisoned in 720, successive governments tried to reverse Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz's tax policies, but rebellion resulted.

====Shi'a====
The negative view of the Umayyads held by [[Shias]] is briefly expressed in the Shi'a book &quot;Sulh al-Hasan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aal-yasin2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaykh Radi Aal-yasin|title=Sulh Al-Hasan|chapter-url=http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/sulh_al-hasan/24.htm|year=2000|publisher=Ansariyan Publishers|isbn=978-1-4960-4085-5|pages=297–344|chapter=Mu'awiya and the Shi'a Of 'Ali, Peace Be On Him|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040120234455/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/sulh_al-hasan/24.htm|archivedate=20 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shia hadiths, which are not considered authentic by Sunnis, [[Ali]] described them as the worst [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=92|title=Sermon 92: About the annihilation of the Kharijites, the mischief mongering of Umayyads and the vastness of his own knowledge|publisher=nahjulbalagha.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819194029/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=92|archivedate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shia sources, the Umayyad Caliphate is widely described as &quot;tyrannical, anti-Islamic and godless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPvZoG6NtLkC&amp;q=godless+umayyads&amp;pg=PA227|title=Black Banners from the East: The Establishment of the ʻAbbāsid State : Incubation of a Revolt|last=Sharon|first=Moshe|date=1983|publisher=JSAI|isbn=9789652235015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shias point out that the founder of the dynasty, Muawiyah, declared himself a caliph in 657 and went to war against Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, the ruling caliph Ali, clashing at the [[Battle of Siffin]]. Muawiyah also declared his son, Yazid, as his successor in [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty|breach of a treaty with Hassan]], Muhammad's grandson. Another of Muhammad's grandsons, [[Husayn ibn Ali]], would be killed by Yazid in the [[Battle of Karbala]]. Further Shia Imams, such as Muhammad's great-grandson, [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]] would be killed at the hands of ruling Umayyad caliphs.

====Bahá'í====
Asked for an explanation of the prophecies in the [[Book of Revelation]] (12:3), [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] suggests in [[Some Answered Questions]] that the &quot;great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bible|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:3&amp;version=NKJV|website=biblegateway.com|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the Umayyad caliphs who &quot;rose against the religion of Prophet Muhammad and against the reality of Ali&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu'l-Bahá|author-link=`Abdu'l-Bahá|origyear=1908|year=1990|title=Some Answered Questions|page=69|publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois|isbn=978-0-87743-190-9|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-13.html#pg69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=`Abdu'l-Bahá|author-link=`Abdu'l-Bahá|origyear=1908|year=1990|title=Some Answered Questions|page=51|publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois|isbn=978-0-87743-190-9|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-11.html#pg51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven heads of the dragon are symbolic of the seven provinces of the lands dominated by the Umayyads: Damascus, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Andalusia, and Transoxiana. The ten horns represent the ten names of the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty: Abu Sufyan, Muawiya, Yazid, Marwan, Abd al-Malik, Walid, Sulayman, Umar, Hisham, and Ibrahim. Some names were re-used, as in the case of Yazid II and Yazid III, which were not accounted for in this interpretation.

==Early literature==
The book ''Al Muwatta'', by Imam Malik, was written in the early Abbasid period in Medina. It does not contain any anti-Umayyad content because it was more concerned with what the Quran and what Muhammad said and was not a history book on the Umayyads.

Even the earliest pro-Shia accounts of al-Masudi are more balanced. Al-Masudi's ''Ibn Hisham'' is the earliest Shia account of Muawiyah. He recounted that Muawiyah spent a great deal of time in prayer, in spite of the burden of managing a large empire.&lt;ref&gt;Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Az-Zuhri stated that Muawiya led the Hajj Pilgrimage with the people twice during his era as caliph.

Books written in the early Abbasid period like al-Baladhuri's &quot;The Origins of the Islamic State&quot; provide a more accurate and balanced history. Ibn Hisham also wrote about these events.

Much of the anti-Umayyad literature started to appear in the later Abbasid period in Persia.

After killing off most of the Umayyads and destroying the graves of the Umayyad rulers apart from [[Muawiya II|Muawiyah]] and [[Umar II|Umar ibn Adb al-Aziz]], the history books written during the later Abbasid period are more anti-Umayyad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McAuliffe| first = Jane Dammen| title = The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F2oLiXT_66EC&amp;pg=PA166| year = 2006| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-53934-0| page = 166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasids justified their rule by saying that their ancestor [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] was a cousin of Muhammad.

The books written later in the Abbasid period in Iran are more anti-Umayyad. Iran was Sunni at the time. There was much anti-Arab feeling in Iran after the fall of the Persian empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Badiozamani| first1 = Badi| last2 = Badiozamani| first2 = Ghazal| title = Iran and America Re-Kind[l]ing a Love Lost| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NK6_hIN8SOwC&amp;pg=PA118| year = 2005| publisher = East West Understanding Press.| isbn = 978-0-9742172-0-8| page = 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-Arab feeling also influenced the books on Islamic history. ''Al-Tabri'' was also written in Iran during that period. ''Al-Tabri'' was a huge collection, preserving everything the compiler could find for future generations to codify and to judge whether the histories were true or false.

Their rivals chose other colours in reaction; among these, forces loyal to [[Marwan II]] adopted red. {{cite book | author=Patricia Crone | title=The Nativist Prophets of Early Islam |year=2012 |page=122}}. The choice of black as the colour of the Abbasid Revolution was already motivated by the &quot;black standards out of Khorasan&quot; tradition associated with the [[Mahdi]]. The contrast of white vs. black as the Umayyad vs. Abbasid dynastic colour over time developed in white as the colour of Shia Islam and black as the colour of Sunni Islam: &quot;The proselytes of the ʿAbbasid revolution took full advantage of the eschatological expectations raised by black banners in their campaign to undermine the Umayyad dynasty from within. Even after the ʿAbbasids had triumphed over the Umayyads in 750, they continued to deploy black as their dynastic colour; not only the banners but the headdresses and garments of the ʿAbbasid caliphs were black ... The ubiquitous black created a striking contrast with the banners and dynastic color of the Umayyads, which had been white ... The Ismaili Shiʿite counter-caliphate founded by the Fatimids took white as its dynastic color, creating a visual contrast to the ʿAbbasid enemy ... white became the Shiʿite color, in deliberate opposition to the black of the ʿAbbasid 'establishment'.&quot; Jane Hathaway, ''A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen'', 2012,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-lPC7DgepEC&amp;pg=PA96 p. 97f.] After the revolution, Islamic apocalyptic circles admitted that the Abbasid banners would be black but asserted that the Mahdi's standard would be black and larger.

The '''Abbasid Caliphate''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|ɪ|d|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ə|s|ɪ|d|}} {{lang-ar|اَلْخِلَافَةُ ٱلْعَبَّاسِيَّةُ}}, ''{{transl|ar|al-Khilāfah al-ʿAbbāsīyah}}'') was the third [[caliphate]] to succeed the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib]] (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} They ruled as [[caliphs]] for most of the caliphate from their capital in [[Round city of Baghdad|Baghdad]] in modern-day [[Iraq]], after having overthrown the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Abbasid Revolution]] of 750 CE (132&amp;nbsp;[[anno Hegirae|AH]]). The Abbasid Caliphate first centered its government in [[Kufa]], modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph [[Al-Mansur]] founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] capital city of [[Ctesiphon]]. The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on [[Greater Iran|Persian]] bureaucrats (notably the [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] family) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of [[mawla|non-Arab Muslims]] in the ''[[ummah]]'' (national community). [[Persianate customs|Persian customs]] were broadly adopted by the ruling elite, and they began patronage of artists and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canfield|first1=Robert L.|title=Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521522915|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad became a center of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]], culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].

Despite this initial cooperation, the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab ''[[mawali]]'' (clients)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABŪ MOSLEM ḴORĀSĀNĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-moslem-abd-al-rahman-b|website = www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate = 20 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122132055/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-moslem-abd-al-rahman-b|archive-date = 22 November 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iranian bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Government from the Earliest Times: Volume II: The Intermediate Ages p.720|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AhEab85xHAMC|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 9780198207900|first = S. E.|last = Finer}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were forced to cede authority over [[al-Andalus]] (Spain) to the [[Emirate of Córdoba|Umayyads]] in 756, [[Maghreb|Morocco]] to the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid]]s in 788, [[Ifriqiya]] and [[Southern Italy]] to the [[Aghlabids]] in 800, [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]] to the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]]s and [[Persia]] to the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]]s in the 870s, and [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] to the [[Isma'ili]]-[[Shia]] caliphate of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s in 969.

The political power of the caliphs was limited with the rise of the Iranian [[Buyids]] and the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], who captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055, respectively. Although Abbasid leadership over the vast [[Islamic empire]] was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function in much of the Caliphate, the dynasty retained control over its [[Mesopotamian]] domain. The Abbasids' period of cultural fruition and its (reduced) territorial control ended in 1258 with the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulagu Khan]] and the execution of [[Al-Musta'sim]]. The Abbasid line of rulers, and Muslim culture in general, re-centred themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power (with the brief exception of Caliph [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|Al-Musta'in of Cairo]]), the dynasty continued to claim religious authority until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1517.{{sfn|Holt|1984}}

==History==

===Abbasid Revolution (750–751)===
{{main|Abbasid Revolution}}
The Abbasid caliphs were [[Arab people|Arab]]s descended from [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same [[Banu Hashim]] clan. The Abbasids claimed to be the true successors of Prophet Muhammad in replacing the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] descendants of [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams|Banu Umayya]] by virtue of their closer bloodline to Muhammad.

The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], &quot;The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of [[Merv]] with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lapidus|2002|p=54}} The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. [[Mohammad ibn Ali Abbasi|Muhammad ibn 'Ali]], a great-grandson of Abbas, began to campaign in [[Greater Persia|Persia]] for the return of power to the family of Prophet Muhammad, the [[Hashemites]], during the reign of [[Umar II]].

During the reign of [[Marwan II]], this opposition culminated in the rebellion of {{ill|Ibrahim al-Imam|ca}}, the fourth in descent from Abbas. Supported by the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (Eastern Persia), even though the governor opposed them, and the Shia Arabs,{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}} he achieved considerable success, but was captured in the year 747 and died, possibly assassinated, in prison.

On 9 June 747 (15 Ramadan AH 129), [[Abu Muslim]], rising from Khorasan, successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule, which was carried out under the sign of the [[Black Standard]]. Close to 10,000 soldiers were under Abu Muslim's command when the hostilities officially began in [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Merv]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=102}} [[Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i|General Qahtaba]] followed the fleeing governor [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]] west defeating the Umayyads at the Battle of Gorgan, the Battle of Nahāvand and finally in the Battle of Karbala, all in the year 748.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

[[File:Balami - Tarikhnama - Abu'l-'Abbas al-Saffah is proclaimed the first 'Abbasid Caliph (cropped).jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Folio from the ''[[Tarikhnama]]'' of [[Muhammad Bal'ami|Bal'ami]] depicting [[As-Saffah|al-Saffah]] as he receives [[Bay'ah|pledges of allegiance]] in [[Kufa]]]]
The quarrel was taken up by Ibrahim's brother Abdallah, known by the name of [[As-Saffah|Abu al-'Abbas as-Saffah]], who defeated the Umayyads in 750 in the [[Battle of the Zab|battle near the Great Zab]] and was subsequently proclaimed [[caliph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Abbasids|volume=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this loss, Marwan fled to Egypt, where he was subsequently assassinated.

Immediately after their victory, As-Saffah sent his forces to [[Central Asia]], where his forces fought against [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] expansion during the [[Battle of Talas]]. The noble Iranian family [[Barmakids]], who were instrumental in building [[Round city of Baghdad|Baghdad]], introduced the world's first recorded [[paper mill]] in the city, thus beginning a new era of intellectual rebirth in the Abbasid domain. As-Saffah focused on putting down numerous rebellions in Syria and Mesopotamia. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] conducted raids during these early distractions.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

The first change made by the Abbasids under [[Al-Mansur]] was to move the empire's capital from [[Damascus]] to a newly founded city. Established on the [[Tigris River]] in 762, [[Baghdad]] was closer to the Persian ''mawali'' support base of the Abbasids, and this move addressed their demand for less Arab dominance in the empire. A new position, that of the [[Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate)|vizier]], was also established to delegate central authority, and even greater authority was delegated to local emirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliph al-Mansur centralised the judicial administration, and later, Harun al-Rashid established the institution of Chief Qadi to oversee it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tillier|first=Mathieu|doi=10.4000/books.ifpo.673|title=Les cadis d'Iraq et l'État Abbasside (132/750-334/945)|publisher=Presses de l’Ifpo|year=2009|isbn=978-2-35159-028-7|location=Damascus|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in a more ceremonial role for many Abbasid caliphs relative to their time under the Umayyads; the viziers began to exert greater influence, and the role of the old Arab aristocracy was slowly replaced by a Persian bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt; During Al-Mansur's time, control of [[Al-Andalus]] was lost, and the Shia revolted and were defeated a year later at the [[Alid revolt of 762–763|Battle of Bakhamra]].{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

The Abbasids had depended heavily on the support of Persians{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} in their overthrow of the Umayyads. Abu al-'Abbas' successor [[Al-Mansur]] welcomed non-Arab Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian cultures, it alienated many of their Arab supporters, particularly the [[Khorasanian Arabs]] who had supported them in their battles against the Umayyads. This fissure in support led to immediate problems. The Umayyads, while out of power, were not destroyed; the only surviving member of the Umayyad royal family ultimately made his way to Spain where he established himself as an independent [[Emir]] ([[Abd ar-Rahman I]], 756). In 929, [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] assumed the title of Caliph, establishing [[Al Andalus]] from [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] as a rival to Baghdad as the legitimate capital of the Islamic Empire.

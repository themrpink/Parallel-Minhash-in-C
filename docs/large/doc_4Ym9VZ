===Deleted songs===
*18a. &quot;De Belville was regarded as the [[James Crichton|Crichton]] of his age&quot; (Mountararat) was cut soon after the opening night of ''Iolanthe''.  The number appeared soon after Mountararat's Act II entrance, after Phyllis's comment about Strephon going about &quot;with a mother considerably younger than himself&quot;.  After a short dialogue (which would also be cut) about how people become peers, Mountararat sings a long song about De Belville, a [[polymath]] whose talents ranged from painting to literature to inventions.  Government was at a loss as to how to reward him &amp;ndash; until he inherited millions and obtained a seat in Parliament and &quot;a taste for making inconvenient speeches in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House (of Commons)]]&quot;.  He was promptly rewarded by being removed from that House by being given a peerage.  According to Reginald Allen's ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan'', as well as contemporaneous reviews, it was recited on the first night, rather than sung, and the middle stanza omitted.  The music has been lost, except for a leader violin part found in a private collection of band parts in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;This discovery was presented by Helga J. Perry and Bruce I. Miller in 2000 at the 11th International Conference on Nineteenth-Century Music at Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK.  See [http://listproc.ucdavis.edu/archives/mlist/log0002/0003.html 11th Conference on Nineteenth-Century Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903180139/http://listproc.ucdavis.edu/archives/mlist/log0002/0003.html |date=3 September 2004 }}, outline conference information.  It was subsequently published by the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society.  See Perry, H. J. and Miller, B. I. ''The Reward of Merit? An Examination of the Suppressed De Belville Song in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe''. Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
*21a. &quot;Fold your flapping wings&quot; (Strephon) was sung on the first night and cut soon afterwards.  The song, preceded by a recitative for Strephon (&quot;My bill has now been [[reading (legislature)|read]] a second time&quot;) appeared shortly after #21, following the exit of the two Earls and the Lord Chancellor and the entrance of Strephon.  The tone of the song is dark and angry, in marked contrast with the generally genial tone of ''Iolanthe'', and the lyrics make the case that bad behaviour by the underclasses is caused by their unfortunate circumstances: &quot;I might be as bad – as unlucky, rather – if I only had [[Fagin]] for a father.&quot;   The music to this song survives, and although most productions continue to omit it, the song has been used in some modern productions and as a separate concert piece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gsarchive.net/iolanthe/html/index.html Includes a brief introduction to &quot;Fold your flapping wings&quot; and a link to the lyrics and a midi file]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical and textual analysis==
[[File:Iolanthe Programme Inside.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Inside of the programme]]
At the time they wrote ''Iolanthe'', both Gilbert and Sullivan were in their peak creative years, and ''Iolanthe'', their seventh work together, drew the best from both composer and author. Sullivan's biographer, [[Arthur Jacobs]], wrote: &quot;[Sullivan] had composed a brilliant new score (his most subtle yet) to a scintillating libretto. ... ''Iolanthe'' is the work in which Sullivan's operetta style takes a definite step forward, and metamorphosis of musical themes is its characteristic new feature. ... By recurrence and metamorphosis of themes Sullivan made the score more fluid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs 1984, pp. 176–79&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's overture was superior in structure and orchestration to those that his assistants had constructed for the earlier operas.&lt;ref name=Ainger216&gt;Ainger, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his &quot;fairy&quot; music pays deliberate homage to the [[incidental music]] written by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] for an [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|1842 production]] of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring of the Nibelung|Ring]]'' cycle premiered in London earlier in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Fifield|Fifield, Christopher]]. ''[[Ibbs and Tillett]]: The Rise and Fall of a Musical Empire'', Chapter 3, pp. 25–26, London: Ashgate Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84014-290-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for the fairies reflects Wagner's style, and the score uses [[leitmotif]]s, including a distinctive four-note theme associated with the character of Iolanthe. The Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagnerian heroines such as [[Brünnhilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The score is wider in range of emotion and style, with innovative use of pizzicato strings, clever and varied underscoring of patter, the tender, sentimental eleventh-hour number for the title character, apt matching of the music to the absurd comedy of the lyrics, and a sustained first act finale with a series of dramatic situations that ends with the confrontation between the fairies and peers.&lt;ref name=Ainger216/&gt;

Gilbert, too, was influenced by earlier works, including ''[[The Mountain Sylph]]'' by [[John Barnett]]. Two characters in ''Iolanthe'', Strephon and Phyllis, are described as ''Arcadian'' shepherds. [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] was a legendary site of rural perfection, first described by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], that was a popular setting for writers of the 19th century. Gilbert had written an earlier work called ''[[Happy Arcadia]]''. He had also created several &quot;fairy comedies&quot; at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of [[James Planché]], are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes'' (1907–21).  Volume XIII. &quot;The Victorian Age&quot;, Part One. VIII. Nineteenth-Century Drama, § 15. W. S. Gilbert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Several of ''Iolanthe's'' themes are continued from ''Patience'', including the battle between the sexes and the satire on legal and political themes. ''Iolanthe'' is one of several of Gilbert's works, including among others ''[[The Wicked World]]'', ''[[Broken Hearts]]'', ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' and ''[[Princess Ida]]'', where the introduction of males into a tranquil world of women brings &quot;mortal love&quot; that wreaks havoc with the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/plays/broken_hearts/intro.html Introduction to ''Broken Hearts''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413153715/http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/plays/broken_hearts/intro.html |date=13 April 2017 }}, ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's absurdist style is on full display in ''Iolanthe''. For example, all the members of the House of Lords are in love with Phyllis, a ward of the Lord Chancellor. Gilbert satirically sets up the fantastical fairies as the agents of common sense in contrast with the nonsensical peers, who should be sober parliamentarians, while the most poetically romantic of the fairies, the &quot;Arcadian&quot; shepherd, Strephon, is chosen to lead both houses of Parliament.&lt;ref name=Crowther158/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; One of Gilbert's biographers, Andrew Crowther wrote: &quot;The things that make [the opera] memorable as a work of art [include] the peers entering in the full pomp of their formal robes, magnificent and ridiculous.&quot;&lt;ref name=Crowther158/&gt; Among many pot-shots that Gilbert takes at lawyers in this opera, the Lord Chancellor sings that, as a young lawyer, he decided to &quot;work on a new and original plan&quot; similar to the practice in other professions, that diligence, honesty, honour and merit should lead to promotion. Gilbert uses the &quot;fairy law&quot; as a proxy for mortal law, in which an &quot;equity draughtsman&quot; can, with &quot;the insertion of a single word&quot;, change the entire meaning of the law. Crowther notes: &quot;All kinds of tone ... mingle in this opera: whimsy, fantasy, romance, wit and political satire.&quot;

==Productions==
''Iolanthe'' had a successful initial run in London of 398 performances, spanning the holiday seasons of both 1882 and 1883. Gilbert designed the costumes himself, and sets were by the Drury Lane designer Henry Emden.&lt;ref name=R&amp;WAppendixVII&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. VII&lt;/ref&gt; In an unprecedented first for any play, the New York premiere was given on the same date &amp;ndash; 25 November 1882, with the composer's assistant, [[Alfred Cellier]], conducting there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=4143 Information about early American productions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210014232/http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=4143 |date=10 December 2008 }}; and Bradley, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, ''Iolanthe'' was first seen on 9 May 1885 at the Theatre Royal, [[Melbourne]], produced by [[J. C. Williamson]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British provinces, ''Iolanthe'' played &amp;ndash; either by itself, or in repertory &amp;ndash; continuously from February 1882 through 1885, then not again until late 1891. From then on, it was always present in the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s touring repertory, being included in some part of every season until the company's closure in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the costumes were redesigned by [[Percy Anderson]] in 1915 and by [[George Sheringham]] in 1932, and [[Peter Goffin]] designed new sets in 1957 and some new costumes in 1960.&lt;ref name=R&amp;WAppendixVII/&gt; After its original production, ''Iolanthe'' was not revived in London until 1901, making it the first of the operas to be revived after the composer's death the year before. It was also included in two Savoy repertory seasons, in 1907 and 1908&amp;ndash;09.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp 19–22&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iolanthe'' was the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera performed professionally in Britain by a non-D'Oyly Carte company. It was produced by the [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] (now English National Opera) in January 1962, immediately after the Gilbert copyrights expired.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gilbert and Sullivan Out of Copyright&quot;, ''The Times'', 1 January 1962, p. 14; and &quot;Savoy Opera Prospect in the New Era&quot;, ''The Times'', 5 January 1962, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was well received and was successfully revived for many seasons by Sadler's Wells until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Entertainments&quot;, ''The Times'', 9 October 1978, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Heyland]] restaged ''Iolanthe'' for D'Oyly Carte in 1977, the year of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee, with silver-themed designs.&lt;ref&gt;The new sets were by Bruno Santini. See [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O172555/theatre-costume-santini-bruno/ &quot;Theatre Costume&quot;], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 28 June 2015 ; and Bradley, pp. 40 and 359&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iolanthe'' has remained one of the most popular of the Gilbert and Sullivan works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley, p. 359&quot;&gt;Bradley, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of professional and amateur productions of the opera have been given throughout the English-speaking world, and the opera continues to be performed regularly today.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, David M.

;Literature and music
The science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] was a Gilbert and Sullivan fan.  His [[Foundation Trilogy]] was conceived after his reading ''Iolanthe'' started a train of thought about military empires.&lt;ref&gt;White, Michael.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=EWbMiyS9v98C&amp;pg=PA83 ''Foundation''], ''Isaac Asimov: A Life of the Grand Master of Science Fiction'', p. 83, Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7867-1518-9}}. Quote:  &quot;Asimov was travelling on the subway reading ... ''Iolanthe''.  The illustrations and their military theme started him thinking in terms of armies, wars, and empires.  Before he had arrived at [his publisher's] office he had the idea of writing about a galactic empire, based on the historical structure, rise, and fall of the Roman Empire.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Asimov | first=Isaac | url=http://www.pannis.com/SFDG/TheFoundationTrilogy/theStoryBehindTheFoundation.html | title=The Story Behind the ''Foundation'' | year=1982 | accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in &quot;[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]&quot;, a story in Asimov's ''[[I, Robot]]'', a robot, while in a state similar to drunkenness, sings snippets of Gilbert and Sullivan songs, including &quot;The Nightmare Song&quot; from ''Iolanthe''.  In [[Michael Chabon]]'s 2004 novel ''[[The Final Solution (novel)|The Final Solution]]'', Bruno the parrot sings bits from ''Iolanthe''.  The eponymous hero of [[David Nobbs]]' ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' has &quot;Iolanthe&quot; as a middle name, allegedly due to his being born during a performance of the opera. An illustrated booklet, ''A Parody on Iolanthe'', was written and published by D. Dalziel in 1883 and concerns the [[Alton Railroad|Chicago &amp; Alton Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalziel, D.

'''Daniel Bernoulli''' [[Fellows of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPA-de|bɛʁˈnʊli|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;Mangold, Max (1990). ''Duden — Das Aussprachewörterbuch''. 3. Auflage. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Dudenverlag.&lt;/ref&gt; {{OldStyleDate|8 February|1700|29 January}} – 17 March 1782) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nndb.com/people/776/000159299/|title=Daniel Bernoulli|last=|first=|date=|website=Notable Names Database|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the [[Bernoulli family]] from Basel. He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially [[fluid mechanics]], and for his pioneering work in [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. His name is commemorated in the [[Bernoulli's principle]], a particular example of the [[conservation of energy]], which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the [[carburetor]] and the airplane [[wing]].

==Early life==
[[File:HYDRODYNAMICA, Danielis Bernoulli.png|thumb|right|200px|Frontpage of ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'' (1738)]]
Daniel Bernoulli was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], in the Netherlands, into a [[Bernoulli family|family]] of distinguished mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]]. [https://mises.org/daily/4941/Daniel-Bernoulli-and-the-Founding-of-Mathematical-Economics Daniel Bernoulli and the Founding of Mathematical Economics], ''[[Mises Institute]]'' (excerpted from ''[[An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp, at that time in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the [[Protestant]]s. After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland.

Daniel was a son of [[Johann Bernoulli]] (one of the early developers of [[calculus]]) and a nephew of [[Jacob Bernoulli]] (an early researcher in [[probability theory]] and the discoverer of the mathematical constant [[E (mathematical constant)|e]]).&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt; He had two brothers, [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Niklaus]] and [[Johann II Bernoulli|Johann II]]. Daniel Bernoulli was described by [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] as &quot;by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ball&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rouse Ball |first=W. W. |authorlink=W. W. Rouse Ball |chapter=The Bernoullis |chapterurl=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Bernoullis/RouseBall/RB_Bernoullis.html |title=A Short Account of the History of Mathematics |publisher=Dover |origyear=1908 |year=2003 |isbn=0-486-20630-0 |edition=4th |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/shortaccountofhi0000ball }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father. Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the [[University of Paris]], Johann, unable to bear the &quot;shame&quot; of being compared  Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house. Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'' in his own book ''Hydraulica'' which he backdated to before ''Hydrodynamica''. Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Bernoulli_Daniel}} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around schooling age, his father, Johann Bernoulli, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician. However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics. He later gave in to his father's wish and studied business. His father then asked him to study in [[medicine]], and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;/&gt;  Daniel studied medicine at [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721.&lt;ref name=&quot;andhist&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson, John David|title=A History of Aerodynamics and its Impact on Flying Machines|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-521-45435-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a contemporary and close friend of [[Leonhard Euler]]. He went to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in 1724 as professor of mathematics, but was very unhappy there, and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;mactutor&quot;/&gt; He returned to the [[University of Basel]], where he successively held the chairs of [[medicine]], [[metaphysics]], and [[natural philosophy]] until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;

In May, 1750 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bernoulli%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical work==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--last 3 paragraphs are not cited--&gt;
His earliest mathematical work was the ''Exercitationes'' (''Mathematical Exercises''), published in 1724 with the help of [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach]].  Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation.  His chief work is ''Hydrodynamica'', published in 1738. It resembles [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]'s ''Mécanique Analytique'' in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle, namely, [[conservation of energy]].  This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides, to which, conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and [[Colin Maclaurin]], a prize was awarded by the [[French Academy]]: these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' and the investigations of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].  Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions, especially on problems connected with [[vibrating string]]s, and the solutions given by [[Brook Taylor]] and by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ball&quot;/&gt;

Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids. In particular, they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure. To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;The Turner Collection, Keele University, includes Bernoulli's diagram to illustrate how pressure is measured. See also part of Bernoulli's original Latin explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries. It was not until about 170 years later, in 1896 that [[Scipione Riva-Rocci|an Italian doctor]] discovered [[Sphygmomanometer|a less painful method]] which is still in use today. However, Bernoulli's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane; that is its air speed.

Taking his discoveries further, Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy. It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height. Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its specific kinetic energy for pressure, the former being the kinetic energy per unit volume. Mathematically this law is now written:

: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 \rho u^2 + P = \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

where P is pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity.

==Economics and statistics==
In his 1738 book ''Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis (Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk)'',&lt;ref&gt;English translation in {{cite journal|journal=Econometrica|volume=22|title=Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk|year=1954|pages=23–36|url=http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/GraduateTheoryUCSB/Bernoulli.pdf|jstor=1909829|doi=10.2307/1909829|last1=Bernoulli|first1=D.|issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernoulli offered a solution to the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] as the basis of the economic theory of [[risk aversion]], [[risk premium]], and [[utility]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: &quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-stpetersburg/ The St. Petersburg Paradox] by R. M. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernoulli often noticed that when making decisions that involved some uncertainty, people did not always try to maximize their possible monetary gain, but rather tried to maximize &quot;[[utility]]&quot;, an economic term encompassing their personal satisfaction and benefit. Bernoulli realized that for humans, there is a direct relationship between money gained and utility, but that it diminishes as the money gained increases.  For example, to a person whose income is $10,000 per year, an additional $100 in income will provide more utility than it would to a person whose income is $50,000 per year.{{sfnp|Cooter|Ulen|2016|pp=44–45}}

One of the earliest attempts to analyze a statistical problem involving [[censoring (statistics)|censored data]] was Bernoulli's 1766 analysis of [[smallpox]] [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] data to demonstrate the efficacy of [[inoculation]].&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in {{cite journal|year=2004|pmid=15334536|url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/biomedicalmodeling/pdf/Bernoulli&amp;Blower.pdf|title=An attempt at a new analysis of the mortality caused by smallpox and of the advantages of inoculation to prevent it|last1=Blower|first1=S|last2=Bernoulli|first2=D|volume=14|issue=5|pages=275–88|doi=10.1002/rmv.443|journal=Reviews in Medical Virology|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032605/http://www.semel.ucla.edu/biomedicalmodeling/pdf/Bernoulli%26Blower.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
In ''Hydrodynamica'' (1738) he laid the basis for the [[kinetic theory of gases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--history-of-thermodynamics/ 1019]|isbn=1-57955-008-8|url=https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied the idea to explain [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ball&quot;/&gt;

He worked with Euler on [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and the development of the [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Strength of Materials | authorlink=Stephen Timoshenko | author=Timoshenko, S.

According to [[Léon Brillouin]], the [[Superposition principle|principle of superposition]] was first stated by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753: &quot;The general motion of a vibrating system is given by a superposition of its proper vibrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin, L.]] (1946). ''Wave propagation in Periodic Structures: Electric Filters and Crystal Lattices'', McGraw–Hill, New York, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Bernoulli was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

===Special effects===
[[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) developed ''Back to the Future''{{'}}s special effects under the supervision of [[Ken Ralston]] and [[Kevin Pike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; The film contains approximately 27–32 special effects shots, compared to the 300 effects typical in higher-budget films of its time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=40}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; The effects studio worked simultaneously on effects for ''[[The Goonies]]'' and ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; ILM gave ''The Goonies'' priority because of its earlier release date.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=40}} Ralston took on the additional work of ''Back to the Future'' because it required few effects, and he was interested in realizing the then-planned ending of Marty driving the time machine into a nuclear explosion. Ralston found the schedule difficult; he worked on ''Cocoon'' during the day and ''Back to the Future'' at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt;

The team had nine-and-a-half weeks to develop the special effects, but once Universal Pictures moved up the release date, this was reduced to eight weeks. Ralston said that ILM was working on ''Back to the Future'' up to the last minute before it had to be handed over to print the theatrical film reels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|pp=40, 59}} The tight schedule impacted the special effects' quality. Ralston considered a scene where Marty's hand fades away as his future is altered disappointing. Fox was filmed separately from his hand and the two were [[Compositing|composited]] together; because the hand was filmed with a wide-angle lens, it appeared larger than normal and had to be scaled down. Zemeckis wanted the fade to be subtle, but it resulted in a small circle of the hand fading away and there was no time to fix it.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt;

In the same scene, Marty and his siblings fade away from a photo. ILM found it difficult to fade the photo's different aspects individually, especially as it is moving on the neck of a guitar.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} A replica of the guitar neck was constructed at four times the normal size; the guitar strings were made of cable up to a quarter-inch thick. An 11x14 inch aluminum plate was attached to the guitar to hold the enlarged photograph.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} ILM used a version of the photo without Marty or his siblings and individually pasted each character into the photo.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} When this did not work, four different photos were used: one containing the background, and one for each McFly sibling. A Tondreau Mechanical camera allowed them to cycle through each photo as it was aligned into the shot and print it to the film.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} The enlarged guitar was moved around to add to the realism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt;

The original nuclear test site was considered too complicated and expensive, with an estimated cost of $1{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColliderDifferences2020&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashFilmFridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; Art director [[Andrew Probert]] storyboarded the scene which would have been created using a combination of sets and miniature recreations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashFilmFridge&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} With the ending moved to the clock tower, ILM researched storms to achieve the right look.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=63}} Clouds were constructed from [[Polyester Fiberfill|polyester fiberfill]], suspended in a net and filmed from above while Ralston shone a powerful light from below.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}} He used a [[Potentiometer#Rheostat|rheostat]] to change the lights' intensity rapidly to imitate lightning.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}}

The lightning bolt that strikes the clock tower was described as &quot;the largest bolt of lightning in cinematic history&quot;.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}} [[Wes Takahashi]]'s animation department developed the effect. It was intended to originate far in the distance and move towards the camera, but the scene had been filmed too close to the clock tower and there was not enough space between it and the top of the frame for the effect to fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt; There was also an issue of showing the bolt onscreen for too long (initially 100–120 frames) as it made it more obvious that it was animated.&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}} The frame count was reduced to 30, but the effect did not look erratic enough.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}} Viewing the animation on a [[moviola]], Zemeckis picked out a single frame of the bolt in an &quot;S&quot; shape. He asked that the effect focus on that shape and be reduced to 20 frames.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt; The bolt was drawn in black ink on white paper; a glow and diffusion effects were added by the Optical department.&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt;

===The DeLorean time machine===
{{main|DeLorean time machine}}
[[File: San Diego Comic-Con 2011 - the Back to the Future Delorean (Mattel booth) (5977355864).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Silver-grey Back to the Future Delorean  |The DeLorean time machine on display in 2011]]
The DeLorean was developed under the supervision of Lawrence Paull,&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt; who designed it with artist [[Ron Cobb]] and illustrator Andrew Probert.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo11Things&quot;/&gt; They intended for the vehicle to look fixed together from common parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt; The time machine was conceived as a stationary device; at one point it was a refrigerator. Spielberg vetoed the idea, concerned that children might attempt to climb into one.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashFilmFridge&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis suggested the DeLorean because it offered mobility, a unique design, and the gull-wing doors would appear like an alien [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to a 1950s family.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt; The [[Ford Motor Company]] offered $75,000 to use a [[Ford Mustang]] instead; Gale responded that &quot;Doc Brown doesn't drive a fucking Mustang&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Michael Fink was hired as the art department liaison and tasked with realizing Cobb's sketches and overseeing the car's construction. Paull and Canton, who had worked with him on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''Buckaroo Bonzai'', respectively, recruited him. Fink had a project lined up but agreed to help in the free weeks he had remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt;

Three DeLoreans used were purchased from a collector—one for stunts, one for special effects, and one for normal shots.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=63}} They were unreliable and often broke down.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; {{convert|88|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was chosen as the time travel speed because it was easy to remember and looked &quot;cool&quot; on the speedometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphThings&quot;/&gt; A custom speedometer was built to simulate 88{{nbsp}}mph, as a 1979 law passed by then-President [[Jimmy Carter]] had limited cars to 85{{nbsp}}mph to reduce speeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo11Things&quot;/&gt; The Flux Capacitor, necessary for time travel, was called the Temporal Field Capacitor; Zemeckis said the name was not believable. From his work on the 1979 drama ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', Fink had learned of [[Neutron flux]]. He and Zemeckis simultaneously suggested renaming it the Flux Capacitor. Cobb and Probert had already placed the Flux Capacitor on the external and interior roof of the DeLorean. Fink placed it next to the driver.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt; Fink constructed the device using a [[NEMA enclosure types|NEMA box]] and backlit Torr High-Voltage relays. The time display was constructed from LMB boxes. When Fink left, he picked Michael Scheffe to replace him. Scheffe finished the Flux Capacitor build and built the &quot;Mr. Fusion&quot; replacement power supply out of a [[Krups]] coffee grinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFWebsite&quot;/&gt;

The flying DeLorean used a combination of live-action footage, animation, and a 1:5 scale (approximately {{convert|33|in|mm}} long) model built by [[Steve Gawley]] and the model shop crew and filmed against a [[Chroma key|blue screen]].{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=66,67}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; Months were spent building the model from epoxy, steel, and aluminum. Halogen lamps were fitted to the tires to simulate thrusters; the tires were made from aluminum to withstand the heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=66}} Blue chalk was rubbed on the windscreen to conceal the lack of riders—&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; the last effect produced by ILM.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=67}}

The act of the DeLorean traveling through time is referred to as the &quot;time slice&quot; effect. Zemeckis only knew that he wanted it to be a violent transition. He described it like a &quot;[[Neanderthal]] sitting on the hood of the Delorean and chipping away the fabric of time in front of him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt; He suggested a crack in time opening before the car, but animators could not determine what would be on the reverse of the opening visible to the audience. An electrical effect enveloping the car was abandoned because a similar process had been used in the science fiction film ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=60}} Other ideas included a wave of energy that moved over the car before exploding and blowing open a hole in time, and a &quot;cubist&quot; effect where the car would break into separate segments, each individually expanding in proportion before disappearing. Takahashi developed artwork showing the segments popping out from the Delorean and glowing. Gale liked the effect, but Zemeckis did not; Spielberg found it unrealistic.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=60}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt;

Takahashi animated separate effects like [[contrails]] and flashing lights; Zemeckis opted to use them all.&lt;ref name=&quot;FXGuide&quot;/&gt; The effects were drawn in black and white and optically manipulated afterward. This resulted in the Delorean appearing to emit various effects that strike in front of the car to create an explosion that opens the time slice. This was combined with practical effects including smoke, sparks, and flash-bulbs.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=60}} Fire emitting from the tires was intended to start the sequence but the gas jet mechanism repeatedly failed; it only functioned for two of the six shots required.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|pp=60, 62}} Peggy Regan animated flames and reflections for consistency.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=62}} The trails of fire left behind the Delorean were practical, but the actual movement was slow. The footage was sped up and smoke added where the car disappeared. Fox and Lloyd were filmed against a reflective mylar blue screen set to match the car park's wet surface and composited into the trails of fire.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=60}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCILM&quot;/&gt; Reflections of the actors were matte paintings filmed through a ripple glass to add texture.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=60}} A stuntman in a dog suit portrays Doc's dog when in the moving car.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayThings&quot;/&gt; It was suggested that the DeLorean emerge from the time slice in sections that slam into each preceding section. Norwood and Charlie Mullen outlined an animation and Ellen Lichtwardt animated a glow to the vehicle. The effect is so quick as to be imperceptible. Zemeckis preferred this as he did not want the audience to think too much about how everything worked.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=62}}

===Design===
[[File:Drew Struzan (2012).jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Drw Struzan looking to his left|Artist [[Drew Struzan]] in 2012. He designed the ''Back to the Future'' theatrical release poster.]]
In the film, the filmmakers used a stylized adaptation of 1950 [[aesthetics]] closer to TV show interpretations than an exact recreation. They used modern technologies—such as contemporary fabrics—because they felt the fashions of the time were less aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesJun1985AttheMovies&quot;/&gt; Using actual brand names like [[Texaco]] made the sets more realistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Paull said the producers mandated the inclusion of certain brands who had paid to appear in the film. An unnamed gas company offered a large sum to be included, but Paull used Texaco because it reminded him of a joke from ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=143–144}} This led to some disputes. [[Pepsi]]'s makers, [[PepsiCo]], did not want a joke about [[Tab (drink)|Tab]] in the film as its rival [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca Cola]] made it.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Twenty clock wranglers were needed for the opening scene to synch up the many clocks. They used [[pulleys]] to start the clocks in sync with the scene recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphThings&quot;/&gt; [[Drew Struzan]] produced the film's poster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerdistmerch&quot;/&gt; The producers hoped his in-demand poster artwork would help generate public interest in the film.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=53}}

To represent characters across three decades, the filmmakers did not want to have older actors stand-in for the younger ones. They believed the change would be obvious and detrimental to the film. Special effects artist [[Ken Chase (make-up artist)|Ken Chase]] was hired for his experience with prosthetics. He ran several make-up tests on the young actors to age them; initially, the results were discouraging. In particular, Chase said the result for Glover was terrible. Chase created a prosthetic neck and a [[bald cap]] with a receding hairline for Glover's character, but they were considered excessive. Chase found it difficult to balance aging the actors while retaining enough of their natural faces so they remained recognizable.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}

Casts were made of the actors' faces, from which plaster molds were made. Chase sculpted more subtle effects over the plaster molds using latex. For Lorraine, he crafted jowls and eye bags, plus body padding to reflect her increased weight and alcohol abuse.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|pp=56,59}} Instead of a receding hairline, Chase just changed the style of George's hair and used prosthetics to give him a less defined jawline.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} Biff's character changed more significantly; he was made to look fatter, given sideburns, and a [[comb over]] hairstyle to hide a growing bald-spot. Chase wanted him to look &quot;obnoxious&quot;.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} The prosthetics were combined with makeup and lighting visually aging the characters further.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}

Chase found the work frustrating compared to his more fantastical prostheses produced for other films that made it easier to hide defects. By comparison, blending small prosthetics into natural skin was harder.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}} The rubber latex did not reflect light the same way as natural skin. Chase used a [[stippling]] process—creating a pattern with small dots—to add varied colors to the actors' faces to better conceal where the skin and prosthetics met;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} close-up shots were avoided.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} Doc's appearance was not altered significantly. Chase used a technique where he painted latex on Lloyd's skin which, when removed, caused crinkles in the skin; other elements like [[liver spot]]s and shadows were painted on.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}}

==Release==
{{see also|1985 in film}}
By June 1985, the theatrical industry had seen a 14% decline in ticket sales over the previous year's $4{{nbsp}}billion record sales. The summer period (beginning in the final week of May) had 45 films scheduled for release, including action film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II]]'', adventure film ''The Goonies'', the comedies ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' and ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'' and the latest [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985June11&quot;/&gt; This represented a 25% increase in the number of releases over the previous year, leading to concerns among industry professionals that the competition would divide audiences and limit financial returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985June11&quot;/&gt; Financial success important as the average cost of making a film had increased to $14.5{{nbsp}}million and the average cost of marketing a film to $7{{nbsp}}million. A higher budget to secure a popular cast was considered a suitable risk as the resulting box office returns were typically higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985June11&quot;/&gt; Most of films expected to be released were aimed at younger audiences, focusing on fantasy and the supernatural. Reflecting the times, these fantasy elements often employed a technological source instead of a magical one.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt; Only a few films, like ''Cocoon'' and ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'', were targeted at adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt;

Initially, ''Back to the Future'' was scheduled to be released in May 1985.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=2}} It was pushed back to June&amp;nbsp;21, the earliest Zemeckis could have the film ready. The production delay following Stoltz's replacement pushed the release back to July&amp;nbsp;19, and later to August.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; After previewing the film, Sheinberg was impressed. He moved the release date forward to July&amp;nbsp;3, giving it an extra 16 days of theatrical screen time during the industry's most profitable period of the year. The move would offer approximately 100,000 extra screenings worth an estimated $40{{nbsp}}million. Sheinberg said he also wanted to avoid the negative perception of films released later in the summer period, instead of early like other blockbuster films.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt; The change required renegotiations with theater owners to secure screens in an already crowded marketplace. In some cities, it was legally required that exhibitors be shown a film prior to purchase. An unfinished cut of the film featuring a temporary music score and incomplete special effects was shown to exhibitors and young test audiences. Exhibitors described it as not at the same level as ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' or ''Ghostbusters'', but a guaranteed box office hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt; Fox was unavailable to promote the film because he was making ''[[List of Family Ties episodes#Film (1985)|Family Ties Vacation]]'' (1985) in London.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=113}}

===Box office===
In North America, ''Back to the Future'' received a wide release on Wednesday July&amp;nbsp;3, 1985, ahead of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] holiday weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985July3Maslin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMDaily&quot;/&gt; The film earned $3.6{{nbsp}}million during the opening Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMDaily&quot;/&gt; During its inaugural weekend, it earned a further $11.3{{nbsp}}million from 1,420 theaters—an average of $7,853 per theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMWeekends&quot;/&gt; ''Back to the Future'' finished as the number one film of the weekend ahead of the western ''[[Pale Rider]]'' ($7{{nbsp}}million) in its second weekend, and ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II'' ($6.4{{nbsp}}million) in its seventh.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMNAWeekendJul5to7&quot;/&gt; It retained the number one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $10.6{{nbsp}}million, ahead of the debuting action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' ($7.8{{nbsp}}million) and ''Cocoon'' ($5{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMNAWeekendJul12to14&quot;/&gt; It remained number one in its third weekend, ahead of the re-release of ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' ($8.8{{nbsp}}million) and ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'' ($5.4{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref name=&quot;BomNAWeekendJul19to21&quot;/&gt; In its fourth weekend it fell briefly to number two behind the comedy ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'' ($12.3{{nbsp}}million). It returned to number one in its fifth weekend with $8.4&amp;nbsp;million, and remained there for the following eight weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMWeekends&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesBOAug71985&quot;/&gt; Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said &quot;our second weekend was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great [[word of mouth]]. ''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' came out in August and it kicked us out of number one for one week and then we were back to number one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

The film remained a steady success through to September. By October, it had surpassed ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II''{{'}}s $149{{nbsp}}million box office earnings to become the year's highest-grossing film with $155{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesOct4Summ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt; In total, ''Back to the Future'' was the number one film for 11 of its 12 first weeks of release. It remained in the top ten highest-grossing films for its first 24 weeks of release.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMWeekends&quot;/&gt; By the end of its theatrical run, ''Back to the Future'' had earned an approximate box office gross of $210.6{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;BomBOSummary&quot;/&gt; This figure made it the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]], ahead of ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II'' ($150.4{{nbsp}}million), the sports drama ''[[Rocky&amp;nbsp;IV]]'' ($127.9{{nbsp}}million), and the drama ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' ($94.2{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref name=&quot;TheNumbersNA1985&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMNA1985&quot;/&gt; According to estimates by [[Box Office Mojo]], this indicates that over 59{{nbsp}}million tickets were bought to see the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMTickets&quot;/&gt; Industry experts suggest that as of 1997, the [[Film distribution|box office returns to the studio]]—minus the theaters' share—was $105.5{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyRentals&quot;/&gt;

Outside North America, the film earned a further estimated $170.5{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=115}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BomBOSummary&quot;/&gt; This made it the third-highest-grossing film behind the romantic drama ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' ($179.1{{nbsp}}million) and ''Rocky IV'' ($172.6{{nbsp}}million).{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=115}} Cumulatively, ''Back to the Future'' earned a worldwide gross of $381.1{{nbsp}}million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide, ahead of ''Rocky&amp;nbsp;IV'' ($300.5{{nbsp}}million) and ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II'' ($300.4{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref name=&quot;BomBOSummary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheNumbers85Worldwide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bom85Worldwide&quot;/&gt;

''Back to the Future'' received generally positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uproxxreception&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCReception&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWModernRecep&quot;/&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] called it the &quot;most sustained and entertaining&quot; of the summer's films.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesMaslinSpielberg&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] referenced Marty's dialogue during the &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; scene, saying the audiences' kids will love the film over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTimeOut&quot;/&gt; [[Paul Attanasio]] said the film offered a return to a focus on storytelling. He added that even though every facet seemed mechanically designed to create a broadly appealing film, it never felt too safe. Attanasio concluded that ''Back to the Future'' was a &quot;wildly pleasurable&quot; and sweet science-fiction comedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevWaPo&quot;/&gt; Several reviewers compared it favorably to the 1946 fantasy drama ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevVariety&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevRogerEbert&quot;/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] said Zemeckis had delivered a &quot;fine comic touch&quot; and humanity. He said the film had charm, humor, and held a lot of surprises that offered the film's &quot;greatest pleasures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevRogerEbert&quot;/&gt; Kirk Ellis (writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'') offered a similar sentiment, saying Zemeckis' direction added a comic humanity to the science-fiction setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt; Ellis called it the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] version of ''It's a Wonderful Life''. He said that despite Spielberg's role as a producer, ''Back to the Future'' was clearly Zemeckis' film, being more subtle, gentler, and less noisy.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;

[[Gene Siskel]] said that initially ''Back to the Future'' seems to be everything wrong with movies of its era aimed at a young audience. However, it subverted his expectations by avoiding traveling to an unidentifiable future or historical event to focus on the unique perspective through a relatable tale of a child being able to meet his parents in their youth. It offered something for both children and adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevSiskel&quot;/&gt; [[Sheila Benson]] was more critical; she called the film &quot;big, cartoonish and empty&quot;. She said that ''Back to the Future'' had an interesting premise but was overproduced and underdeveloped. Benson believed the film lacked tension because there was never any doubt that Marty would succeed, and the ending was left feeling hollow with materialistic rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesReview&quot;/&gt; Siskel countered that the tension came by defying the expectations of a typical time travel film in making the past mutable and the future uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevSiskel&quot;/&gt;

Kehr remarked that Gale and Zemeckis were among the first wave of filmmakers openly influenced by growing up on televised entertainment, and their inspirations are evident throughout ''Back to the Future''. He described it as &quot;zestfully tasteless&quot; with a uniquely American vulgarity, crassness and manic energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevDaveKehr&quot;/&gt; Attansio appreciated the film had irreverent humor that was not mean spirited. He felt the film succeeds by having an emotional core that keeps the audiences' interest among the laughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevWaPo&quot;/&gt;

Reviewers agreed that the exposition-heavy opening leads into a better half. Ray Loynd, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', described the opening as &quot;shaky&quot; and exposition heavy, but noting the rest of the film is filled with wit, wonder, and fresh ideas. He appreciated the comparisons between 1955 and 1985, and the &quot;delicious&quot; premise of Marty returning to the past only for his mother to fall for him romantically.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevVariety&quot;/&gt; Corliss agreed the opening was akin to a &quot;long fuse that explodes into comic epiphany mid way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTimeOut&quot;/&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] said it took a while to get to the action, but in describing the ending, he said it was a &quot;wow&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uproxxreception&quot;/&gt;

All the cast performances were generally well received, particularly those of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevWaPo&quot;/&gt; Reviewers were consistent in their praise for Fox's &quot;appealing&quot; performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevSiskel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uproxxreception&quot;/&gt; Several reviewers believed that Lloyd's performance stole the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevWaPo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevSiskel&quot;/&gt; Ellis said Lloyd was at his &quot;scene-stealing best&quot;, offering an uncontrolled performance that would redefine movie scientists for the modern audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt; Attanasio agreed; he said that Lloyd demonstrated that his unique &quot;intensity&quot; could carry a film.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevWaPo&quot;/&gt; [[Dave Kehr]] called Lloyd's character a tribute to every great mad scientist portrayed by the likes of [[Sid Caesar]] and [[John Belushi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RevDaveKehr&quot;/&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] and Ray Loynd said that both Fox and Lloyd were good, but that it was Glover and Thompson who were the standout performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevVariety&quot;/&gt; Loynd said that Glover's bumbling-to-confident George McFly was the highlight, supported by Thompson's &quot;deceptively passionate&quot; performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevVariety&quot;/&gt; Some reviewers considered the use of Libyan terrorists, an actual fear at the time, to be in poor taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevTHR&quot;/&gt;

===Performance analysis and aftermath===
The year 1985 was considered an unsuccessful year for the film industry. Despite a record number of film releases for the decade, many films failed at the box office, and ticket sales were down 17% compared with 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985Review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt; Industry executives believed the problem, in part, was a lack of original concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985July3&quot;/&gt; Films about fantasy and magic failed, as audiences leaned towards science-fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt; Janet Maslin said the fault for this lay partly with Spielberg, who had created such a successful template with films like ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' that many fantasy films had closely emulated them.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesMaslinSpielberg&quot;/&gt; There was also an over-saturation of youth-oriented films targeted at those under 18 years old. Executives were not fond of these films, but the financial rewards were too significant to ignore. Only a few films were aimed at older audiences, leading to surprise successes like ''Cocoon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985Xmas&quot;/&gt; Only ''Back to the Future'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II'' were successful blockbusters, earning more than double the box office of ''Cocoon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt; Films offering escapism and pro-America themes like ''Rambo: First Blood Part&amp;nbsp;II'' and ''Rocky&amp;nbsp;IV'' had also fared well.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985Xmas&quot;/&gt;

A glut of youth-targeted films like ''[[Return to Oz]]'' and ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'', and science-fiction comedies like ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[Real Genius]]'', and ''[[My Science Project]]'' had resulted in a string of failures. Executives said that the films were all very similar and marketed in the same way, offering no variety for audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesSeptBOOverview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt; ''Back to the Future'' was one of the few original concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985July3&quot;/&gt;

After years of poor performances, ''Back to the Future'', along with ''Fletch'', ''Brewster's Millions'', and ''Mask'', reversed Universal Picture's fortunes. This was credited to the foresight of Frank Price; it was the second-highest-grossing studio that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesOctMovieGiant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985Xmas&quot;/&gt; For Fox, before ''Family Ties'' and ''Back to the Future'', he was financially struggling, had no car or home, and contacted his agent using payphones. Afterward, he became one of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood, receiving marriage proposals and letters from fans around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1986August8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesFoxInterview&quot;/&gt; &quot;The Power of Love&quot; also gave ''Huey Lewis and the News'', their first number one song on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' and their first international success.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayLewis&quot;/&gt;

''Back to the Future'' was released in on [[VHS]] on May&amp;nbsp;22, 1986, priced at $79.95.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTImesVHS&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=122}} It was also the most rented cassette of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimes1986Casette&quot;/&gt; A sequel was not planned until after ''Back to the Future''{{'}}s release. A &quot;To Be Continued...&quot; graphic was added to the VHS release to promote awareness of future sequels.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPoTBC&quot;/&gt; When the film was released on [[DVD]] in 2002, the graphic was removed because Gale and Zemeckis wanted it to be as it had been in theaters.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=122}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPoTBC&quot;/&gt; It has not appeared in releases since.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPoTBC&quot;/&gt;

On the film's 25th-anniversary in 2010, it debuted on [[Blu-ray]]. The release included a six-part documentary including interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and associated music videos from all three films.

The ''Back to the Future'' soundtrack was released in July 1985, on [[cassette tape]], [[LP record]], and [[Compact disc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BTTFcomMusic&quot;/&gt; Sales were initially slow, but it eventually peaked at number 12 on the Billboard 200, in part because of the success of &quot;The Power of Love&quot;.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=94}}

===Cinematic analysis===
[[File:The Reagans with Michael J. Fox and Nancy McKeon.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Nancy McKeon, Michael J. Fox, Nancy Reagan, and then-United States President Ronald Reagan in October 1985|(Left to right) [[Nancy McKeon]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Nancy Reagan]], and then-United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] in October 1985. ''Back to the Future'' has been interpreted as an endorsement of Reagan-era policies concerning the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement.]]
The main theme of ''Back to the Future'' concerns taking control and personal responsibility over one's own destiny. A situation can be changed even if it seems otherwise impossible to overcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Thompson said the film represents how one moment can have a significant and lasting impact on a person's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubThompson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Gale said that Doc Brown provided the perfect summary of the theme running throughout the film series, when in ''[[Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;III]]'' he said: &quot;Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

Even so, Marty's future is enriched at the expense of others. At the start of the film, Marty is rejected at Battle of the Bands and admits his fears that his ambitions will remain unrealized. He worries he will end up like his parents and sees direct evidence in 1955 of George, also afraid of rejection, being unable to approach Lorraine; his fears risk Marty's future.&lt;ref name=&quot;UproxxAnalysis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt; Marty sets about manipulating the past to ensure his own survival without concern for what impact his presence in 1955 is having on others. On his return to 1985, he is rewarded with wealthier parents and a nicer car, but he has simultaneously damaged Biff's future, reducing him to a valet for the McFlys.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt; Glover was critical of the film's ending. He believed Marty's reward should have been happy parents in love with each other. He considered the ending a result of the film serving a corporate interest, promoting the accumulation of wealth and purchasing new things.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt; In 2015, Zemeckis said the ending was perfect for its time but would be different if he made it now. Gale disagreed and said he did not apologize for the scene. American audiences largely had no issue with this ending, but some international audiences criticized it.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=124}}

Despite rejection by film studios for not being raunchy enough,&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; ''Back to the Future'' alludes to sexual assault, racism, and the Oedipus complex—a psychiatric theory developed by psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] that says a child has an unconscious sexual desire for their opposite-sexed parent. This refers to the relationship between Marty and his future mother Lorraine in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1985PostMortemCanby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt; The relationships between parents and children are the basis of many elements of the film. Where most people can only know their parents, Marty is given the opportunity to see his parents as his peers, when they were his age and shared the same ambitions and dreams as him.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

The film can also be seen as promoting [[Reaganism]]—the political positions of then-president Ronald Reagan—promoting the older values of the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement. 1985 is presented as run down and in decay, while 1955 is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time seen through the lens of nostalgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt; Marty's future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant. This leads to a more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;UproxxAnalysis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt; The film uses many brand names of the time to make the setting more realistic—like [[Mountain Dew]], Pepsi, and Texaco—but the filmmakers were financially compensated for their inclusion, making them symbols of commercialism and thus materialistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;UproxxAnalysis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

Sorcha Ní Fhlainn argues that many 1980s films resulted from the American public's desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. Films like those in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and ''Back to the Future'' are designed to offer a child-like reassurance of safety and comfort. They emphasize idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader.{{sfn|Ní Fhlainn|2014|p=5}} Susan Jeffords notes that Doc Brown is an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who is in conflict with Libyan terrorists and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves.{{sfn|Ní Fhlainn|2014|p=7}}

The song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry is used during the film's final act. Berry resisted allowing the song to be used in the film at first. [[NPR]] argued that while this may have been a matter of money for Berry, there are underlying racial issues involved in Marty, a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian male]], rewriting history to invent the [[rock and roll]] music genre, which was heavily influenced by African American music styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt; The 1955 segment also presents a distorted view of America, showing an African American band playing at the high school dance at a time when they would never have been allowed to.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesReview&quot;/&gt; Similarly, the African American character Goldie Wilson is seemingly inspired to work towards becoming mayor by Marty's intervention, inspiring a Reagan-style initiative and self-reliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;UproxxAnalysis&quot;/&gt;

As film fans, Gale's and Zemeckis' influences are seen throughout ''Back to the Future''. There are references to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'' (1959), ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' (1977), the ''Star Wars'' film series, and television shows including ''[[Mister Peabody]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', and ''The Twilight Zone''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; There are also allusions to ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960)—based on the 1895 [[The Time Machine|novella of the same name]] by [[H. G. Wells]]—and ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' by [[Mark Twain]], in which the central character seemingly moves through time.{{sfn|Ní Fhlainn|2015|pp=165,166}} The DeLorean dashboard chronometer uses the same color scheme as the time device of ''The Time Machine''.{{sfn|Ní Fhlainn|2015|p=167}} Ray Loynd opined that Doc can be seen as a [[King Arthur]]-type, with Marty serving as his knight.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevVariety&quot;/&gt;

''Back to the Future'' is now considered a landmark of American cinema and an enduring popular culture [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesHoldUp&quot;/&gt; The film has global popular appeal and is particularly popular in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Argentina, the [[Netherlands]], and Japan.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=240–241}} It has continued to find fans decades after its release. In October 2015, the day Doc and Marty travel to at the end of ''Back to the Future'', and depicted in ''Back to the Future&amp;nbsp;II'', an estimated 27{{nbsp}}million social media users discussed the films; the most active users were in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRPopCulture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2015SocialMedia&quot;/&gt;

As of 2003, Gale continued receiving mail from fans, mainly addressing the trilogy's first film. Gale said he understood the continuing appreciation for the film as it was the &quot;purest&quot; and &quot;most complete&quot; film in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Fox compared it to ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939), saying it still appeals to children because they do not think of it as an old film.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWFoxLasting&quot;/&gt; In 2012, Thompson said her role as Lorraine was the greatest of her career. She said ''Back to the Future'' had remained relevant to new generations because of its core idea that the viewer's parents were once kids and had the same dreams they do.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubThompson&quot;/&gt; Dean Cundey believed it still resonated with fans because it offers the fantasy of going back in time to change things and make the present better.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Glover said he had watched it once and liked parts of it, but he believed it sent the wrong message that the hero is rewarded with wealthier parents and a new car instead of the reward being his parents are happily in love.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt; As of 2020, Wilson still carries around cards containing answers to fan questions he has been asked over the preceding years, to avoid constantly repeating himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWWilsonCards&quot;/&gt; Lloyd described being approached by fans from around the world, who have said the film inspired them to become a scientist.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=241}}

Many of the principal cast have reunited in the years since ''Back to the Future''{{'}}s release. Often these reunions are for charitable purposes, including [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation]] for [[Parkinson's disease]] (Fox was diagnosed with the disease at age 29), and [[Project HOPE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWMJFoxFoundation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWProjectHope&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2018Reunion&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THRGaleCameo&quot;/&gt; A 2019 reunion for the [[TCM Classic Film Festival#TCM Classic Film Festival|TCM Classic Film Festival]] featured the premiere of the film's 4K restored version.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWTCM&quot;/&gt; The cast has also appeared in advertisements only loosely related to ''Back to the Future'', trading on their associated popularity.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=242}}

The DeLorean is considered one of the most iconic vehicles in film history.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWDeLorean&quot;/&gt; DeLorean's creator [[John DeLorean]] was a fan of the film and sent personal letters to Gale and Zemeckis, thanking them for using his vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; The DeLorean was not a popular vehicle before the film's release. However, in the years since it has become a popular collectors item, and the [[DeLorean Motor Company]] issued kits that enabled fans to make their vehicle look more like the DeLorean time machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PasteMagLegacy&quot;/&gt; $78,500 was crowdfunded to restore one of the original cars used in the film and an associated documentary about the restoration, ''Out of Time: Saving the DeLorean Time Machine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PasteMagLegacy&quot;/&gt;

===Contemporary reception===
''Back to the Future'' is considered one of the greatest films ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire500&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THRJun14&quot;/&gt; It is listed in the film reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', which says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Michael J. Fox...became a full-fledged movie star thanks to this time-traveling comedy adventure... An extremely clever premise is further enlivened by quick-fire direction from Robert Zemeckis and a superb, witty script... Fox is perfect as the teen trying to unite his parents... Lloyd suitably foolish as the nutty scientist, while Glover and Lea Thompson (as Marty's mom) have a great time 
 playing their characters as both middle-aged parents and teenagers. A timeless comedy adventure.{{sfn|Schneider|2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, ''The New York Times'' listed it as one the 1,000 Best Movies Ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesBest&quot;/&gt; In 2005, the film's screenplay was listed as the fifty-sixth greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on the [[Writer's Guild of America]]'s (WGA) 101 Greatest Screenplays list.&lt;ref name=&quot;WGAGreatest1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WGAGreatest2&quot;/&gt; In 2006, it was listed at number{{nbsp}}10 on [[Film4]]'s ''[[50 Films to See Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Film4Die&quot;/&gt; In 2008, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' listed the film at number{{nbsp}}23 on its list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, behind the 1977 space opera ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. They said, &quot;Weird science and teenage dreams combine in a wish-fulfilment sci-fi lent heart by the fantastic Mr. Michael J.

Emory University is a global leader in [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] research and treatment. The university was one of three institutions that successfully treated [[medical evacuation|medical evacuees]] during the [[Ebola virus cases in the United States|2014 Ebola outbreak]]. In 2015, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC).&lt;ref name=&quot;bizjournals.com&quot;/&gt; The university will collaborate with the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]], the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response]] on the program, which will receive $12 million in funding over the next five years.

[[File:Emory Campus Aerial Image.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Aerial view of Emory University's main campus (bottom) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (top), Atlanta, Georgia]]
Emory University's original campus was established in [[Oxford, Georgia]] in 1836. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's main Atlanta campus, is home to [[Oxford College of Emory University]] and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;english&quot;/&gt; Many of the buildings were designed with [[Neoclassical architecture]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. In 1975, the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]] designated the campus as part of the [[Oxford Historic District (Oxford, Georgia)|Oxford Historic District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/104116387/Oxford-Historic-District-Newton-County-Georgia|title=Oxford Historic District, Newton County, Georgia|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|date=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emory's main Atlanta campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by [[Pittsburgh]] architect [[Henry Hornbostel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;archpaper.com&quot;&gt;[https://archpaper.com/2017/02/dobbs-university-center-emory-portman/ Wachs, Audrey. &quot;Emory University to replace a remarkable John Portman building with a new campus center.&quot; ''The Architects Newspaper'', February 13, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; covers more than 600 acres in [[Atlanta]]'s historic neighborhood of [[Druid Hills]]. The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, and Peavine Creek, a branch of the [[Peachtree Creek]], runs through the campus. The [[Arbor Day Foundation]] named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tree Campus USA Schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.arborday.org/programs/treecampususa/campuses.cfm | title= Tree Campus USA Schools | date=April 2015 | publisher=Arbor Day Foundation | accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Saltillo tile]].

In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a [[neofuturistic]] [[postmodernist]] design by local architect [[John C.

===Greek life===
Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's &quot;temple&quot; of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play a part in leavening Emory's campus life. For undergraduates, Greek life comprises approximately 30% of the Emory student population. The Office of Greek Life recognizes and regulates on-campus chapters of fraternities and sororities. Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residence Life &amp; Housing website|url=http://www.emory.edu/HOUSING/UNDERGRAD/opt_greek.html|website=Emory.edu|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

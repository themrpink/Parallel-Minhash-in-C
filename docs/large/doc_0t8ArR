Thoreau's friend [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|William Ellery Channing]] published his first biography, ''Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist'', in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Channing|first1=William Ellery|url=http://archive.org/details/poetnatthoreau00chanrich|title=Thoreau, the poet-naturalist, with Memorial verses|last2=Merrymount Press|last3=Sanborn|first3=F.

Goodspeed|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing and another friend, [[Harrison Blake]], edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international [[Thoreau Society]] and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

===Nature and human existence===
{{quote|Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.| Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;''Walden, or Life in the Woods'' (Chapter 1: &quot;Economy&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and [[canoeing]], of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that &quot;Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in ''Walden'', &quot;The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheever241&quot;&gt;Cheever, Susan (2006).

[[File:Thoreaus quote near his cabin site, Walden Pond.jpg|thumb|Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond]]
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred &quot;partially cultivated country&quot;. His idea of being &quot;far in the recesses of the wilderness&quot; of Maine was to &quot;travel the logger's path and the Indian trail&quot;, but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay &quot;Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher&quot; [[Roderick Nash]] wrote, &quot;Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Roderick. ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, &quot;I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheever241&quot; /&gt;

===Sexuality===
Thoreau [[bachelor|never married]] and was childless. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan. However, his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], or [[Asexuality|asexual]].&lt;ref name=harding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/millennialseduct00quin | url-access=registration | title=Millennial Seduction | publisher=Cornell University Press | author=Quinby, Lee | page=[https://archive.org/details/millennialseduct00quin/page/68 68]| isbn=978-0801486012 | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman.

===Politics===
{{Green anarchism |expanded=People}}
[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|left|John Brown &quot;Treason&quot; Broadside, 1859]]

Thoreau was fervently against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and actively supported the abolitionist movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;/&gt; He participated as a conductor in the [[Underground Railroad]], delivered lectures that attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his party.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Furtak|first=Rick|title=Henry David Thoreau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the ill-fated [[raid on Harpers Ferry]] and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to [[Pontius Pilate]] and likened Brown's execution to the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;}}

In ''[[The Last Days of John Brown]]'', Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Last Days of John Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as &quot;crazy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

Thoreau was a proponent of [[limited government]] and [[individualism]]. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which &quot;governs not at all&quot;, he distanced himself from contemporary &quot;no-government men&quot; ([[anarchists]]), writing: &quot;I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resistance&quot; /&gt;

Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as &quot;a progress toward true respect for the individual&quot; and theorized about further improvements &quot;towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;resistance&quot; /&gt; Echoing this belief, he went on to write: &quot;There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resistance&quot; /&gt;

It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against the British administration and Catholicism in ''A Yankee in Canada''. Despotic authority, Thoreau argued, had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian ''habitants'' had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=A Yankee in Canada|url=https://archive.org/details/yankeeincanada0000thor|url-access=registration|date=1961|publisher=Harvest House|location=Montreal|pages=[https://archive.org/details/yankeeincanada0000thor/page/105 105–107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; writing: &quot;Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject &quot;Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?&quot;, arguing the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/mjf/MJF1.html Transcendental Ethos] from The Thoreau Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, his condemnation of the [[Mexican–American War]] did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico &quot;unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army&quot; as a means to expand the slave territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

Thoreau was [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]. On one hand he regarded commerce as &quot;unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; and expressed admiration for its associated [[cosmopolitanism]], writing:

{{quote|I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;}}

On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

{{quote|I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that the corporations may be enriched.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;}}

Thoreau also favored [[bioregionalism]], the protection of animals and wild areas, [[free trade]], and taxation for schools and highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;/&gt; He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, [[technological utopianism]], [[consumerism]], [[philistinism]], mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;/&gt;

===Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities===
====Indian sacred texts and philosophy====
Thoreau was influenced by [[Hindu texts|Indian spiritual thought]]. In ''Walden'', there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter (&quot;Economy&quot;), he writes: &quot;How much more admirable the [[Bhagvat-geeta|Bhagvat-Geeta]] than all the ruins of the East!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who &quot;took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |date = 2007 |isbn = 978-0415939263 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also a characteristic of Hinduism.

Furthermore, in &quot;The Pond in Winter&quot;, he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:

[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|right|Krishna teaching Arjuna from ''[[Bhagavata Gita]], ''a text Thoreau read at Walden Pond ]]

{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;}}

Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's [[Ice trade|ice merchants]] were shipping ice to foreign ports, including [[Calcutta]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Additionally, Thoreau followed various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] customs, including a diet largely consisting of rice (&quot;It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;), [[flute playing]] (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of [[Krishna]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, and [[yoga]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

{{quote|Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Barbara S. &quot;Why Did Henry David Thoreau Take the Bhagavad-Gita to Walden Pond?&quot; ''Parabola'' 12.1 (Spring 1986): 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Biology====
[[File:Eggs BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|Bird eggs found by Thoreau and given to the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. Those in the nest are of [[yellow warbler]], the other two of [[red-tailed hawk]].]]
Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Asa Gray]] (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander Humboldt's New World''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including [[Louis Agassiz]] who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] and endorsed it,&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. ''A Historical Guide to Henry David Thoreau''. {{ISBN|0195138635}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

{{quote|1=The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation. (A quote from ''On the Origin of Species'' follows this sentence.)&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Berger, Michael Benjamin.

{{quote|text=Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ...

Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as &quot;his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical&quot;, viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ''Civil Disobedience''. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, ''Walden'' and ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'' (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he &quot;loved to wander&quot;.&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|date=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=666|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n673/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thoreau's writings went on to influence many public figures. Political leaders and reformers like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Russian (citizen)|Russian]] author [[Leo Tolstoy]] all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ''Civil Disobedience'', as did &quot;[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] theorist [[Frank Chodorov]] [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, ''Analysis'', to an appreciation of Thoreau&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including [[Edward Abbey]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Upton Sinclair]],&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, W. Barksdale, ''Walden Pond: A History''. Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. B.

''A Complex Fate: Gustav Stickley and the Craftsman Movement''. Preservation Press, 1996. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau also influenced naturalists like [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[E. O.

Skinner]], [[David Brower]], and [[Loren Eiseley]], whom ''Publishers Weekly'' called &quot;the modern Thoreau&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kifer, Ken ''[http://www.kenkifer.com/Thoreau/ Analysis and Notes on Walden: Henry Thoreau's Text with Adjacent Thoreauvian Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318110150/http://www.kenkifer.com/Thoreau/ |date=March 18, 2006 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; English writer [[Henry Stephens Salt]] wrote a biography of Thoreau in 1890, which popularized Thoreau's ideas in Britain: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Edward Carpenter]], and [[Robert Blatchford]] were among those who became Thoreau enthusiasts as a result of Salt's advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrick, George and Oehlschlaeger, Fritz (eds.) ''Toward the Making of Thoreau's Modern Reputation'', University of Illinois Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohandas Gandhi first read ''Walden'' in 1906 while working as a civil rights activist in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. He first read ''Civil Disobedience'' &quot;while he sat in a South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic ... unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (2011-05-04) [https://mises.org/daily/5250/Here-the-State-Is-Nowhere-to-Be-Seen Here, the State Is Nowhere to Be Seen], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although he was practicing civil disobedience before he read Thoreau's essay, Gandhi was quick to point out the debt he owed to Thoreau and other thinkers like him&quot;.Shawn Chandler Bingham, ''Thoreau and the sociological imagination : the wilds of society''. Lanham, Md. : Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008. {{ISBN|9780742560581}} p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He told American reporter [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], &quot;[Thoreau's] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence. Why I actually took the name of my movement from Thoreau's essay 'On the Duty of Civil Disobedience', written about 80&amp;nbsp;years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Webb. I Found No Peace. Garden City, 1938. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading &quot;On Civil Disobedience&quot; in 1944 while attending [[Morehouse College]]. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.&lt;ref&gt;King, M.L.

American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Thoreau's ''Walden'' with him in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''A Matter of Consequences''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he wrote ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional utopia about 1,000 members of a community living together inspired by the life of Thoreau.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''Walden Two'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau and his fellow [[Transcendentalists]] from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] were a major inspiration of the composer [[Charles Ives]]. The 4th movement of the [[Concord Sonata]] for piano (with a part for flute, Thoreau's instrument) is a character picture, and he also set Thoreau's words.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, James Peter.

Thoreau's ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement, with [[Emma Goldman]] referring to him as &quot;the greatest American anarchist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldman, Emma|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_U5ZYAAAAMAAJ|title=Anarchism and Other Essays|publisher=Mother Earth Publishing Association|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_U5ZYAAAAMAAJ/page/n67 62]|year=1917|author-link = Emma Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green anarchism]] and [[anarcho-primitivism]] in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological points-of-view from the writings of Thoreau.

===Adaptations===
In 2017, ''[[Walden, a Game]]'' was released on itch.io. Created by [[Tracy Fullerton]], it is an open world, first person videogame adaptation of Thoreau's ''[[Walden]]''. Players can build the protagonist's cabin, explore the environment, record flora and fauna, farm the land, visit Emerson's house and the town of Concord. At the end of each day players are invited to reflect on their journal which gradually fills up with reflections based on the player's journey and day-to-day experiences.  The game also includes letters between Thoreau and his contemporaries, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It also includes letters between his contemporaries to build a picture of Thoreau's reception as a writer and his connections in the literary and Transcendentalist scene in America at the time. The game was released for Playstation 4 in 2018.

==Criticism==
Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of &quot;unmanly&quot; [[effeminacy]] and &quot;womanish solitude&quot;, while deeming him a self-indulgent &quot;skulker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html &quot;Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions&quot;]. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that &quot;He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau &quot;repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;heathenish&quot; message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to &quot;lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:

{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

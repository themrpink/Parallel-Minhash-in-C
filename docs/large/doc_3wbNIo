'''François Boucher''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|uː|ʃ|eɪ}} {{respell|BOO|shay}}, {{IPAc-en|US|b|uː|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ}} {{respell|boo|SHAY}}; {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa buʃe|lang}}; 29 September 1703&amp;nbsp;– 30 May 1770) was a French [[painting|painter]], draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the [[Rococo]] style. Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and [[pastoral]] scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated painter and decorative artist of the 18th century.

==Life==
A native of [[Paris]], Boucher was the son of a lesser known painter Nicolas Boucher, who gave him his first artistic training. At the age of seventeen, a painting by Boucher was admired by the painter [[François Lemoyne]]. Lemoyne later appointed Boucher as his apprentice, but after only three months, he went to work for the engraver [[Jean-François Cars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Alastair Laing. &quot;Boucher, François.&quot; Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Marie-Jeanne Buzeau by Alexandre Roslin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Portrait of Marie-Jeanne Buzeau, wife of Boucher'' by [[Alexander Roslin]]]]

In 1720, he won the elite [[Grand Prix de Rome]] for painting, but did not take up the consequential opportunity to study in Italy until five years later, due to financial problems at the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot; /&gt; On his return from studying in Italy he was admitted to the refounded [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] on 24 November 1731.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700–1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 164. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Reception piece|morceau de réception]]'' (reception piece) was his ''Rinaldo and Armida'' of 1734.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;

Boucher married Marie-Jeanne Buzeau in 1733. The couple had three children together. Boucher became a faculty member in 1734 and his career accelerated from this point as he was promoted Professor then Rector of the Academy, becoming inspector at the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Royal Gobelins Manufactory]] and finally ''[[Premier Peintre du Roi]]'' (First Painter of the King) in 1765.

Boucher died on 30 May 1770 in his native Paris. His name, along with that of his patron [[Madame de Pompadour]], had become synonymous with the French Rococo style, leading the [[Goncourt brothers]] to write: &quot;Boucher is one of those men who represent the taste of a century, who express, personify and embody it.&quot;

Boucher is famous for saying that nature is &quot;trop verte et mal éclairée&quot; (too green and badly lit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houssaye|first=Arsène|title=Boucher et la peinture sous Louis XV|journal=Revue des deux mondes|volume=n. s. 3|year=1843|pages=70–98}} p. 86 (citing a letter to [[Nicolas Lancret]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boucher was associated with the gemstone engraver [[Jacques Guay]], whom he taught to draw. He also mentored the Moravian-Austrian painter [[Martin Ferdinand Quadal]] as well as the neoclassical painter [[Jacques-Louis David]] in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arthive.com/artists/31055~Martin_Ferdinand_Quadal|title=Martin Ferdinand Quadal – Biography, Interesting Facts, Famous Artworks|website=Arthive|access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Boucher made a series of drawings of works by Guay which Madame de Pompadour then engraved and distributed as a handsomely bound volume to favored courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/noticesurejacqu01letugoog/page/n168 10]–12 |last=Leturcq|first=Jean François|title=Notice sur Jacques Guay, graveur sur pierres fines du roi Louis xv.

==Painting==
[[File:The secret message, by François Boucher.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''The Secret Message'']]
Boucher took inspiration from artists such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/creating-new-europe-1600-1800-galleries/born-on-this-day-francois-boucher|title = Born on this Day: Francois Boucher|date = September 30, 2014|accessdate = |website = Victoria and Albert Museum|publisher = |last = Hoskin|first = Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher's early works celebrate the idyllic and tranquil portrayal of nature and landscape with great elan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 871018|title = Francois Boucher's Early Development|last1 = Voss|first1 = Hermann|date = March 1953|journal = The Burlington Magazine|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Barea|first2 = Ilse|publisher = Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd.|volume = 95|page = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his art typically forgoes traditional rural innocence to portray scenes with a definitive style of [[eroticism]] as his mythological scenes are passionate and intimately amorous rather than traditionally epic.  Boucher's paintings of a flirtatious shepherd and shepherdess in a woodland setting, featured in ''The Enjoyable Lesson'' (''The Flute Players'') of 1748 and ''An Autumn Pastoral'' (''The Grape Eaters'') of 1749, were based upon characters in a 1745 play by Boucher's close friend Charles-Simon Favart. Boucher's characters in those paintings later inspired a pair of figurines created by the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory, c. 1757–66.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarucchi|first=Jeanne Morgan|date=2016|title=The Shepherdess' Progress: From Favart to Boucher to Sèvres|url=|journal=Konsthistorisk Tidskrift (Journal of Art History, Stockholm)|volume=85:2|issue=2|pages=141–158|doi=10.1080/00233609.2016.1142474|s2cid=192925316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madame de Pompadour|Marquise de Pompadour]] (mistress of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]), whose name became synonymous with Rococo art, was a great admirer of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyde 455&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The &quot;Makeup&quot; of the Marquise: Boucher's Portrait of Pompadour at her Toilette|last = Hyde|first = Melissa|date = September 2000|journal = Art Bulletin|doi = 10.2307/3051397|pmid = |volume = 82|issue = 3|page = 455|jstor = 3051397|issn = 0004-3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marquise de Pompadour is often referred to as the &quot;godmother of Rococo&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyde 455&quot; /&gt; and Boucher's portraits were central to her self-presentation and cultivation of her image. For instance, Boucher's 'Sketch for a Portrait of Madame de Pompadour', displayed in the Starhemburg room at [[Waddesdon Manor]], acts as a surviving example of the oil preparation prior to the, now lost, portrait. In one hand she holds her hat, in the other she picks up a pearl bracelet with a portrait of the king – symbolising the relationship upon which her status depends.

Boucher's paintings such as ''The Breakfast'' (1739), a familial scene, show how he was as a master of the [[Genre works|genre]] scene, where he regularly used his own wife and children as models. These intimate family scenes are contrasting to the licentious style seen in his ''[[Odalisque]]'' portraits.

The dark-haired version of the ''Odalisque'' portraits prompted claims by the art critic [[Denis Diderot]] that Boucher was &quot;prostituting his own wife&quot;, and the ''[[The Blonde Odalisque|Blonde Odalisque]]'' was a portrait that illustrated the extramarital relationships of the King. Boucher gained lasting notoriety through such private commissions for wealthy collectors and, after Diderot expressed his disapproval, his reputation came under increasing critical attack during the last years of his career.

==Theatrical and tapestry designs==
[[File:François Boucher - La Nymphe Callisto, séduite par Jupiter sous les traits de Diane (1759).jpg|thumb|''[[Jupiter and Callisto (Boucher, 1759)|Jupiter and Callisto]]'', 1759]]
Along with his painting, Boucher also designed theater costumes and sets, and the ardent intrigues of the comic operas of [[Charles Simon Favart]] closely paralleled his own style of painting. [[Tapestry]] design was also a concern. For the [[Beauvais tapestry]] workshops he first designed a series of ''Fêtes italiennes'' (&quot;Italian festivals&quot;) in 1736, which proved to be very successful and often rewoven over the years, and then, commissioned in 1737, a suite of the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn B. Hiesinger, &quot;The Sources of François Boucher's 'Psyche' Tapestries&quot; ''Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin'' '''72''' No. 314 (November 1976), pp. 7–23.&lt;/ref&gt; During two decades' involvement with the Beauvais tapestry workshops Boucher produced designs for six series of hangings in all, like [[:File:Designed by François Boucher, French - Tapestry showing Psyche and the Basketmaker - Google Art Project.jpg|the tapestry showing Psyche and the Basketmaker from 1741–1742]].

Boucher was also called upon for designs for court festivities organized by that section of the King's household called the [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi]] and for the opera and for royal châteaux [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and [[Choisy-le-Roi|Choisy]]. His designs for all of the aforementioned augmented his earlier reputation, resulting in many engravings from his work and even reproduction of his designs on [[porcelain]] and [[biscuit-ware]] at the [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]] and [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] factories. The death of [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry|Oudry]] in 1755 put an end to its contribution to Beauvais but his collaboration with the Gobelins lasted until 1765, when he stepped down from his position as an inspector.

==Drawings and prints==

[[File:François Boucher, Aurora, c. 1733, NGA 111589.jpg|thumb|left|''Aurora'', c. 1733, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]

Boucher was a very prolific and varied draftsman. His drawings served not only as preparatory studies for his paintings and as designs for printmakers but also as finished works of art for which there was a great demand by collectors. Boucher followed standard studio practices of the time, by first working out the overall composition of his major canvases, and then making chalk studies for individual figures, or groups of figures. He also relied on oil and gouache sketches in the preparation of major commissions.

Gradually he made more and more sketches as independent works for the market. The [[:File:François Boucher - The Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg|''Adoration of the Shepherds'']] (Metropolitan Museum of Art), a free and painterly sketch in gouache, was long considered a preparatory sketch for Madame de Pompadour's private altarpiece ''La lumière du monde'' (ca. 1750, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon). Recent scholarship suggests, however, that it was made at least 10 years later as an autonomous work. In the last decade of his career the artist began to favor brown chalk, a fabricated medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bouc/hd_bouc.htm Perrin Stein. ''François Boucher (1703–1770)''] at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boucher was also a gifted engraver and etcher. Boucher etched some 180 original copperplates. He made many etchings after Watteau. He thus helped propagate a taste for reproductions of drawings. When his own drawings began to sell, 266 of them were etched in stipple substitutes by [[Gilles Demarteau]]. These were printed in red ink so they resembled red chalk drawings which could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of luxury dwellings.

Boucher's most original inventions were decorative, and he contributed to the fashionable style of [[chinoiserie]], after having etched 12 'Figures Chinoises' (Chinese figures) by Watteau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints &amp; People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ossip Zadkine''' ({{lang-ru|Осип Цадкин}}; 28 January 1888 – 25 November 1967) was a Russian-born French naturalized artist. He is primarily known as a sculptor, but also produced paintings and [[lithographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zadkine.com/born-in-1888 Zadkine Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Zadkine was born on 28 January 1888 as '''Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin''' ({{lang-ru|Иосель Аронович Цадкин}}) in the city of [[Vitsebsk]], part of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Belarus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zadkine.paris.fr/ossip-zadkine/sa-biographie/une-enfance-en-russie|title=Une enfance en Russie|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chagal-vitebsk.com/node/200|title=Александр Лисов. Цадкин и Витебск|work=chagal-vitebsk.com}} Archival materials reported in this article state that Iosel-Shmuila Aronovich Tsadkin, was of Jewish faith and studied in the Vitebsk City Technical School between 1900 and 1904, including two years in one class with would-be artists Marc Chagall (then Movsha Shagal) and Victor Mekler (then Avigdor Mekler). Thus, contrary to what Zadkine himself was saying, his father did not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion and his mother was not of a Scottish extraction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chagal-vitebsk.com/node/155|title=Людмила Хмельницкая. Витебское окружение Марка Шагала|work=chagal-vitebsk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born to a Jewish father and a mother named Zippa-Dvoyra, who he claimed to be of Scottish origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Ossip had 5 siblings: sisters Mira, Roza and Fania and brothers Mark and Moses. 

At the age of fifteen, Zadkine was sent by his father to [[Sunderland]] to learn English and ‘good manners’. He then moved to London and attended lessons at the [[Regent Street Polytechnic]] where he considered the teachers to be too conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sculptureinternationalrotterdam.nl/en/kunstenaars/ossip-zadkine-2|title=Ossip Zadkine, 1888-1967|work= Sculpture International Rotterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zadkine settled in Paris in 1910. He studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] for six months. In 1911 he lived and worked in [[La Ruche]]. While in Paris he joined the [[Cubist]] movement, working in a Cubist idiom from 1914 to 1925. He later developed his own style, one that was strongly influenced by African and Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La source grecque, l'enracinement d'une &quot;terre&quot;|url=http://www.zadkine.paris.fr/fr/ossip-zadkine/sa-biographie/la-source-grecque-lenracinement-dune-terre|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1921 he obtained French citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/ossip-joselyn-zadkine Ossip Joselyn Zadkine Facts], YourDictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Zadkine served as a stretcher-bearer in the French Army during World War I, and was wounded in action. He spent World War II in the US. His best-known work is probably the sculpture ''[[The Destroyed City]]'' (1951-1953), representing a man without a heart, a memorial to [[Rotterdam Blitz|the destruction of the center of the Dutch city of Rotterdam in 1940]] by the Nazi-German [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Age&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FtsQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YpMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4848,5178621&amp;dq=ossip-zadkine&amp;hl=en|title=Sculptor Dies|date=27 November 1967|newspaper=[[The Age]]|accessdate=20 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115104203/http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=FtsQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YpMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4848,5178621&amp;dq=ossip-zadkine&amp;hl=en|archivedate=15 January 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

He taught sculpture classes at [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] until 1958, students of his included artists Geula Dagan (1925–2008) and [[Genevieve Pezet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hauer|first=Caroline|date=2019-03-20|title=Paris: Le Messager, une oeuvre monumentale d'Ossip Zadkine - Quai d'Orsay - VIIème|url=https://www.parisladouce.com/2019/03/paris-le-messager-une-oeuvre.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Paris la Douce|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Zadkine died in Paris in 1967 at the age of 79 after undergoing abdominal surgery&lt;ref name=&quot;Age&quot; /&gt; and was [[Burial|interred]] in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]. 

=== Museums ===
His former home and studio in Montparnasse is now the [[Musée Zadkine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Musée Zadkine|url=https://www.artiststudiomuseum.org/studio-museums/musee-zadkine/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Artist's Studio Museum Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his former wife Prax died, she donated the house and art studio to the City of Paris for the formation of Musée Zadkine.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

There is also a Musée Zadkine in the village of [[Les Arques]] in the [[Midi-Pyrénées]] region of France. Zadkine lived in Les Arques for a number of years, and while there, carved an enormous Christ on the Cross and Pieta that are featured in the 12th-century church which stands opposite the museum.

==Personal life==
In August 1920, Zadkine married [[Valentine Prax]] (1897–1981), an Algerian-born painter of Sicilian and [[Northern Catalonia|French-Catalan]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Birnbaum|first=Paula J.|title=Women Artists in Interwar France: Framing Femininities|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351536714|location=|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Martin|title=Modern Figurative Paintings: The Paris Connection|last2=Winter|first2=Jeffrey|publisher=Schiffer Publishing|year=2004|isbn=9780764319624|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prax and Zadkine had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Prax, Valentine Henriette|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&amp;uselang=en&amp;returnto=Special:OAuth/authenticate&amp;returntoquery=%26oauth_consumer_key%3Dc656df92ac58925bbcb164666bde5baf%26oauth_token%3Db99444d40e395d11a456ec07011e9802|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Benezit Dictionary of Artists, Oxford Art Online|doi=10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.b00145672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadkine was a neighbor in [[Montparnasse]] and a friend of [[Henry Miller]] and he was represented by the character &quot;Borowski&quot; in Miller's novel, [[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|''Tropic of Cancer'']] (1934).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musée Zadkine|url=http://www.millerwalks.com/content/musee-zadkine|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053830/http://www.millerwalks.com/content/musee-zadkine|archivedate=2016-03-04|work=Walking Paris with Henry Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Turner: ''Renegade: Henry Miller and the Making of &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;'', Yale University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His other neighbors there included; [[Chaim Soutine]], and [[Tsuguharu Foujita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; 

While living in exile during wartime in Manhattan from 1942 to 1945, Zadkine had a relationship with American artist [[Carol Janeway]] and he created several portraits of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/334106.html?mulR=935772124%7C2|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections Object : Carol Janeway with Zadkine Sculpture|last=Art|first=Philadelphia Museum of|website=philamuseum.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's only child, Nicolas Hasle (born 1960), was the result of his affair with a Danish woman, Annelise Hasle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2011-03-31|title=Paris Must Justify Right To Sculptor Ossip Zadkine's Estate|url=https://www.artforum.com/news/paris-must-justify-right-to-sculptor-ossip-zadkine-s-estate-27892|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Artforum.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Hasle, a psychiatrist, who had been acknowledged by the artist and had his parentage legally established in France in the 1980s, has been party to a lawsuit with the City of Paris to establish his claim to his father's estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;estate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Art Newspaper|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Paris-must-justify-its-right-to-Zadkine-s-estate/23413|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|work=theartnewspaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-04-03|title=Ossip Zadkine: Who Owns the Sculptor’s Estate?|url=https://itsartlaw.org/2011/04/03/ossip-zadkine-who-owns-the-sculptors-estate/|access-date=2020-06-12|website=Center for Art Law|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

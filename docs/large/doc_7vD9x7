'''The King's School''' is a 13–18 [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]], [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]], [[boarding school|boarding]] and [[day school]] in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], England. It is a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and the [[Eton Group]]. It is Britain's oldest [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]; and is arguably the oldest [[List of the oldest schools in the world|continuously operating school]] in the world, since education on the Abbey and Cathedral grounds has been uninterrupted since AD 597.{{efn|name=shishi|[[Shishi Middle School]] in China claims a foundation c.142 BC but this is disputed owing to a gap in its functioning.}} 

==History==
[[File:Entrance to The King's School, Canterbury.jpg|130px|thumb|left|Entrance of the school]]
The school originated as a medieval cathedral school said to have been founded during the Late Antiquity in 597 AD, a century after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], by [[Augustine of Canterbury]], considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot; and a founder of the English Church, therefore making it arguably the world's oldest extant school. This is based on the fact that St Augustine founded an abbey (within the current school's grounds) where it is known that teaching took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the School&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kings-school.co.uk/about/history/|title=History of the School|website=The King's School, Canterbury|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] took place, the School was re-founded by [[royal charter]] in 1541. A Headmaster, a Lower Master, and fifty King's Scholars were established and the name &quot;King's School&quot;, was used for the first time, referring to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]] moved the school to the Mint Yard and acquired the Almonry building, which was in use for over 300 years.

Throughout the next 100 years, a number of former pupils achieved national recognition, helping the school to establish its reputation; these include the first Headmaster, [[John Twyne]], as well as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Harvey]] and [[John Tradescant the Younger]]. The buildings were improved and academic standards raised during the leadership of [[John Mitchinson (bishop)|John Mitchinson]], and around this period, the School became a &quot;[[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]&quot; with a national reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the School&quot;/&gt;

When Canon John “Fred” Shirley became Headmaster in 1935, the School was suffering from the effects of the depression, and he saw the School expanded greatly to around 600 pupils in some 30 years. He constructed further buildings in the Precincts, as well as helped the School to survive the war-time evacuation, and the School received a new Royal Charter from King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1946. During this time, the reputation of the School grew, helped by its academic and sporting successes.

The school was boys-only for almost 1,400 years, until the early 1970s, when girls were admitted to the Sixth Form for the first time, and the School has been fully co-educational since 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the School&quot;/&gt; The school is also the oldest charity in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubadm/76/7605.htm|title=House of Commons - The role of the Charity Commission and &quot;public benefit&quot;: Post-legislative scrutiny of the Charities Act 2006 - Public Administration Committee|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2019-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
In 2017, the school was subject to its latest regular, independent inspection.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011 inspection&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kings-school.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The_King_s_School_Canterbury_EQI_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406233010/https://www.kings-school.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The_King_s_School_Canterbury_EQI_report.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2018 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspection team praised the &quot;outstanding academic results&quot; and the pupils' integrity, self-assurance, and &quot;generosity of spirit&quot;. According to the ''[[Good Schools Guide]]'', the school is &quot;Highly successful, producing excellent results&quot;. The ''Guide'' also stated that &quot;You need to be creative, academically able and hard-working, as everything moves fast here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide&quot;&gt;[http://goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/the-kings-school-canterbury.html Good Schools Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210085920/http://goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/the-kings-school-canterbury.html |date=2009-02-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For formal occasions, the School traditionally gathered here. Archbishops of Canterbury addressed the School from the Staircase during Visitations. King George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth and Princess Elizabeth, presented the School's Royal Charter to the Dean on 11 July 1946.]]

==Traditions==
{{citation needed section|date=October 2017}}

King's has many traditions including:[[File:Priory block of the King's School.jpg|thumb|The Economics department is housed in the Priory block, which was originally built around 1100 as part of the medieval priory buildings, especially the brewery and bakehouse. It was later taken over by the King's School in 1936|310x310px]]
*'''Full Canterbury Dress:''' The name given to the school uniform, which consists of a white shirt with wing collar, black waistcoat, pinstripe trousers, black jacket, black socks, black tie and black shoes for the boys. Girls wear a white blouse, brooch, pinstripe skirt, black jacket, black tights and black shoes. When he came to the School, Fred Shirley, Headmaster (1935–1962), updated the school uniform to sports jackets. But within a year, the boys had asked to revert to their traditional garb. He tried again after the War when the School returned to Canterbury, this time taking a vote on the matter. But despite the difficulty in finding outmoded clothing in a time of clothes rationing, the boys once again decided to revert to tradition. In the mid-twentieth century, there were elaborate customs relating to such matters as buttons and the angle at which a boater was worn. The girls' version was introduced by Anthony Phillips, Headmaster.
*'''Court Dress:''' Worn on 'Commem Day', the last day of the school year, leavers wear court dress, consisting of white tie and black evening tailcoats, with breeches and black stockings. Purples wear their purple gowns and carry brown canes with gold handles while the Organ Scholars of the school wear black academic gowns over their court dress and carry black canes with Silver Handles.
*'''School Song:''' In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Harrow's ‘Forty Years On’ was often used. It was sung at concerts and penny readings. In 1914, two OKS – Henry Morice and Bertram Latter – composed their own offering entitled ‘The School of Theodore’. This concentrated on the School's antiquity. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury (668-90), was widely regarded as the founder of the King's School's ancestor school. The song was popular for a short time. 
*'''Colours Jumpers:''' Students who have been awarded full school colours in any sport are entitled to wear a white and blue cricket jumper instead of a regulation school black jumper. Those who receive 1st team colours are entitled to wear a special tie. More recently there has been the addition of the co-curricular colours for those excelling in drama, music and the arts. Recipients are entitled to wear a jumper with a maroon stripe. 
*'''Purples:''' Until recently called 'monitors', these are the school prefects, who are marked out by their distinctive purple gowns. Only those in the highest year at the school may be a purple. Each house generally has one purple (the Head of House). The purples are headed by the Captain of School and a Vice-Captain. A head scholar and two Vice-head scholars are also invited to become purples.
* '''The Goat on the Green Court:''' Something of a legend among pupils, the Captain of School is allegedly allowed to keep a goat on the large lawn in the centre of the school. This particular tradition is no longer practised. The Captain of School is also allowed to grow a beard and take his wife to lessons.
*'''King's Scholars:''' An academically-select group, marked by black jumpers with white trimmings that have recently replaced their distinctive black gowns, they process wearing surplices during school services in the Cathedral. To become a scholar, a pupil must take the Scholarship examinations at a standard approaching GCSEs prior to entry at the age of 12 to 14 (Exhibitioners may also be elected) or, in the case of honorary scholars, achieve exceptional GCSE results (9 A*s is usually the minimum) or AS Level results. King's Scholars are part of the Canterbury Cathedral Foundation and have a role in the Enthronement of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Scholars are admitted by the dean at the beginning of every school term; the scholars kneeling before the dean, who then touches their head and utters ‘Admitto Te’, formally acknowledging them as a King's Scholar. King's Scholars in the Upper Sixth are permitted to wear a black gown.
*'''Uniform Gating:''' A form of punishment that requires pupils to wear Canterbury Dress all day every day, while getting a form signed by someone in a position of authority (usually a teacher or a purple) at 15-minute intervals during their free time. This can prevent them from leaving the school at all for up to a week.
*'''Breakfast Gating:''' A form of punishment by which the pupil must report to breakfast and get a special slip, called a gating slip, signed at 7:30.
*'''Supper Leave/Pub Leave:''' A recent privilege extended to Sixth Formers, whereby pre-approved groups of people may go into town for supper or visit a pub for one night.
*'''The House Shout:''' Two shouting competitions. One takes place between The Grange and School House which, until the building of Mitchinson's House, were opposite each other. Held on the last day of each term. Members of the Grange would assemble outside Lattergate House (later renamed Algy's) from where School House is visible and call out the House Shout from that vantage point. School House would then come out and the Purple of Galpin's would adjudicate the victor on wittiness, clarity, volume and house spirit.[5] This tradition has not been held in recent years, although every year after the inter-house song competition, Galpin's House and School House have a similar, non adjudicated shouting match, with more emphasis on volume than anything else, often including the chant &quot;you're not singing any more&quot;. The second House Shout takes place between Linacre and Meister Omers, and is an annual tradition that is not adjudicated.
*'''Good Morning Assembly Calls:''' A tradition whereby if two people were considered in a relationship with each other, the respective boy's house would call out at the end of assembly 'good morning' to both partners in the relationship, by their surnames. For example, 'Good morning Smith, good morning Jones'. It has since been discouraged by senior staff. 
*'''Monitors' Canes:''' A privilege given to School Monitors (Purples) and House Monitors. Purples are allowed black canes and House monitors are allowed wood coloured canes. The Head of the [[combined cadet force|CCF]] is also allowed to carry a [[pace stick]].
*'''Younger Purples:''' A tradition in which a certain member of each house (traditionally the shortest person is chosen) are given the purple gown on days when it is a charity non-uniform day. This allows the designated person to exercise the rights of the Purples.
*'''Green Court Privilege:''' Only those in 6a (the final year) are allowed to walk across Green Court; everyone else must walk around it.
*'''Mint Yard Privilege:''' Only those in Galpin's and School House are allowed to walk on the Mint Yard Lawn during the Summer term
*'''Walpole Carnations:''' The Valentine's Day celebrations, organised by the girls of Walpole house. Pupils send a carnation with an anonymous message to a friend or lover.

==King's Week==
A festival of arts, held during the last week of the summer term, introduced by [[Fred Shirley]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kings-school.co.uk/co-curricular/kings-week/|title=King's Week Arts Festival|website=The King's School, Canterbury|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week features over 100 events, ranging from classical concerts to theatre performances, held in a multitude of locations around Canterbury. Many of the events are free to attend and require no booking and a number are broadcast live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kings-school.co.uk/news/kings-week-2019-gets-underway/|title=King's Week 2019 gets underway|date=2019-06-27|website=The King's School, Canterbury|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The week culminates in Commemoration day (known as &quot;Commem&quot;) on the last day of the school year when the school leavers in 6a wear court dress of white tie and tails, with breeches and black stockings, or their national dress, and the whole school attends a service to commemorate the school benefactors. Monitors also wear their gowns and can carry walking canes, or 'swagger sticks'.

==Office of Fair Trading investigation==
{{main|Independent school fee fixing scandal}}
In 2005, the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) provisionally found that the school exchanged detailed information about prospective fee increases with approximately 50 other prominent UK independent schools, including [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Sevenoaks School|Sevenoaks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press+releases/2005/214-05.htm Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051207013058/http://www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press+releases/2005/214-05.htm |date=2005-12-07 }}, [[Office of Fair Trading]], UK, 9 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The OFT stated that &quot;regular and systematic exchange of confidential information as to intended fee increases was anti-competitive and resulted in parents being charged higher fees than would otherwise have been the case.&quot;

==The Junior King's School, Canterbury==
The King's School also has a feeder preparatory school, the Junior King's School (JKS), previously Milner Court Preparatory School. The school is a coeducational boarding and day establishment and currently has around 400 pupils aged 3 to 13. Whilst there are boarding facilities available, the majority are day pupils. JKS is now located at Milner Court in [[Sturry]], having been originally based in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral. 

The current site was donated by [[Violet Milner, Viscountess Milner|Lady Milner]] following the death of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner]] in 1925. The buildings on site were opened by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in 1929, in his capacity as a close friend of Alfred Milner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.junior-kings.co.uk/pages/newsEvents/pages/80thAnniversary/docs/kiplingProgramme.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilfrid Oldaker]] was headmaster from 1945 to 1956 and was the last head to occupy the manor house as the headmaster's residence.&lt;ref&gt;David Lawrence Edwards, ''A History of the King's School, Canterbury'' (Faber &amp; Faber, 1957), pp. 172, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Further extensions include a sports hall (1999), a [[design and technology|CDT]] block (1991) and a new music department (2016).

==The King's School Shenzhen International==
The King’s School planned to open its first overseas branch in the Nanshan district of [[Shenzhen]], China in 2019. The school aims to blend The King's School's tradition of education with modern purpose, with design by award-winning London-based architects, Walters &amp; Cohen. The new campus was intended to be launched in two separate phases. The Pre-Prep section for children aged 3 – 6 was planned to open in Autumn 2019, and the Main School, which will include the Junior and Senior sections for children aged 6–18, should open the following year in 2020.

The '''Easter Bunny''' (also called the '''Easter Rabbit''' or '''Easter Hare''') is a folkloric figure and symbol of [[Easter]], depicted as a [[rabbit]] bringing [[Easter egg]]s. Originating among German [[Lutheran]]s, the &quot;Easter Hare&quot; originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behavior at the start of the season of [[Eastertide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Gary|title=Wondrous Innocence and Modern American Children's Culture|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195348132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Easter Bunny is sometimes depicted with clothes. In legend, the creature carries colored eggs in his basket, candy, and sometimes also toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to [[Santa Claus]] or the [[Christkind]], as they both bring gifts to children on the night before their respective holidays. The custom was first&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occultcenter.com/2008/03/easter_bunny_origins/ Easter Bunny – What Does He Have To Do With Easter?], occultcenter.com&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=April 2017}} mentioned in [[Georg Franck von Franckenau]]'s ''De ovis paschalibus''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Georg |last=Franck von Franckenau | author-link=Georg Franck von Franckenau | title=Disputatione ordinaria disquirens de ovis paschalibus / von Oster-Eyern | place=Heidelberg | year=1682 | series=Satyrae Medicae | volume=XVIII | page=6 | url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/09428/16F89A4DE8E09EA88DE2CFDFC5443B4D04B40E1F | access-date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('About Easter Eggs') in 1682, referring to a German tradition of an Easter Hare bringing Easter eggs for the children.

[[File:Intrude (25893577273).jpg|thumb|Inflatable Easter bunny in front of [[San Francisco City Hall]]]]
The hare was a popular motif in medieval church art.  In ancient times, it was widely believed (as by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Philostratus]], and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]) that the hare was a [[hermaphrodite]].&lt;ref name=meaning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrischapmanphotography.co.uk/hares/index.html|title=What does the Symbol Mean?|last=Chapman|first=Chris|year=2004|work=Three Hares Project|access-date=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=Rosalind%2C+the+Hare%2C+and+the+Hyena+in+Shakespeare%27s+As+You+Like+It&amp;btnG= |title=Rosalind, the hare, and the hyena in Shakespeare's As You Like It|journal = Shakespeare Quarterly|volume = 36|issue = 3|pages = 335–337|author=Marta Powell Harley|jstor = 2869713|year = 1985|doi = 10.2307/2869713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo317.html|title=Sir Thomas Browne (1646; 6th ed., 1672) Pseudodoxia Epidemica III:xvii (pp. 162–166)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that a hare could reproduce without loss of [[virginity]] led to an association with the [[Virgin Mary]], with hares sometimes occurring in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Northern Renaissance|Northern European]] paintings of the Virgin and [[Christ Child]].  It may also have been associated with the [[Holy Trinity]], as in the [[three hares]] motif.&lt;ref name=meaning/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threehares.blogspot.com/2006/02/why-three-hares_25.html |title=Three Hares as representation of the Trinity |publisher=Threehares.blogspot.com |date=2006-02-25 |access-date=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eggs===
{{main|Easter egg|Egg decorating}}
Eggs have been used as [[fertility]] symbols since [[ancient history|antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heller|first1=Steven|title=Seeing Rabbits|volume=68|work=Academic Search Complete|issue=2|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggs became a symbol in Christianity associated with rebirth as early as the 1st century AD, via the iconography of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] egg, and they became associated with Easter specifically in medieval Europe, when eating them was prohibited during the fast of [[Lent]]. A common practice in England at that time was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children prior to their fast.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Costa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/beyond-ishtar-the-tradition-of-eggs-at-easter/ |title=Beyond Ishtar: The Tradition of Eggs at Easter |last=D'Costa |first=Krystal |website=Scientific American |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328170422/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/beyond-ishtar-the-tradition-of-eggs-at-easter/ |archive-date=28 March 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a special dish, eggs would probably have been decorated as part of the Easter celebrations. Later, German [[Protestant]]s retained the custom of eating colored eggs for Easter, though they did not continue the tradition of [[fasting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/ShroveTues.html Shrove Tuesday Pancakes!] by Bridget Haggerty – Irish Culture &amp; Customs, World Cultures European, paragraph 5 line 2 refers to the Catholic custom of abstaining from eggs during Lent. Accessed 3/1/08&lt;/ref&gt; Eggs boiled with some flowers change their color, bringing the spring into the homes, and some over time added the custom of [[Egg decorating|decorating the eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Lucie L.|title=DYED IN Tradition|work=Academic Search Complete|issue=329|publisher=Vegetarian Times|date=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to this day typically dye their [[Easter egg]]s red,&lt;ref&gt;[http://greekfood.about.com/od/greekcookingtips/ht/redeggs.htm How To Dye Red Eggs with Onion Skins for Greek Easter] by Nancy Gaifyllia from Your Guide to Greek Food on About.Com Accessed April 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the color of blood, in recognition of the blood of the sacrificed [[Christ]] (and, of the renewal of life in springtime). Some also use the color green, in honor of the new foliage emerging after the long-dead time of winter. The [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] art of decorating eggs for Easter, known as [[pysanka|''pysanky'']], dates to ancient, pre-Christian times. Similar variants of this form of artwork are seen amongst other eastern and central European cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hallett|first1=Vicky|title=Egg-cellent art|volume=134|work=Academic Search Complete|issue=10|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=March 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an egg-giving hare went to the U.S. in the 18th century. Protestant German immigrants in the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] area told their children about the {{-&quot;}}''[[wikt:Osterhase|Osterhase]]''{{-&quot;}} (sometimes spelled {{-&quot;}}''Oschter Haws''{{-&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanworldonline.com/index.php/grus-vom-osterhasen-oschter-haws-song/ |title=Gruß vom Osterhasen: Oschter Haws Song |publisher=Germanworldonline.com |date=2011-04-23 |access-date=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Hase'' means &quot;hare&quot;, not rabbit, and in Northwest European folklore the &quot;Easter Bunny&quot; indeed is a [[hare]]. According to the legend, only good children received gifts of colored eggs in the nests that they made in their caps and [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]] before Easter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhmint.org/easter/symbols.htm Easter Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312234541/http://www.lhmint.org/easter/symbols.htm |date=2008-03-12 }} from Lutheran Hour Ministries.

==Alleged association with Ēostre==
In his 1835 ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', [[Jacob Grimm]] states &quot;The Easter Hare is unintelligible to me, but probably the hare was the sacred animal of [[Ostara]]&quot;. This proposed association was repeated by other authors including Charles Isaac Elton&lt;ref&gt;Charles Isaac Elton (1890). ''Origins of English History''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=April 2019}} and Charles J. Billson.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J Billson (1892). ''Folk-Lore'' vol. 3 issue 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Christina Hole wrote, &quot;The hare was the sacred beast of Eastre (or [[Ēostre]]), a Saxon goddess of Spring and of the dawn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hole (1961). ''Easter and its Customs''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=April 2019}} The belief that Ēostre had a hare companion who became the Easter Bunny was popularized when it was presented as fact in the [[BBC]] documentary ''Shadow of the Hare'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Attenborough, Sir David (Presenter) |date=April 12, 1993 |title=Wildlife on One Easter Special Shadow of the Hare |medium=Television |language=en |location=United Kingdom |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford ''Dictionary of English Folklore'' however states &quot;... there is no shred of evidence&quot; that hares were sacred to Ēostre, noting that [[Bede]] does not associate her with any animal.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Simpson and Stephen Roud (2000).

'''Doe Maar''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ska]] band with [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[reggae]] influences whose career peaked from 1978 to 1984. They are one of the most successful pop bands in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] history. 'Doe maar' translates as ''go ahead'' or ''just do it''.

==History==
===Early years and debut album===
Doe Maar was formed in 1978 by [[Ernst Jansz]] (CCC Inc., The Slumberlandband). Piet Dekker, with whom Jansz played in The Slumberlandband (1975) and The Rumbones (1977), introduced him to Jan Hendriks and Carel Copier in the spring of 1978 at the farm of Gé van de Donk, who later became their sound engineer. Recordings from this meeting exist on which they played, without any rehearsal, all the Dutch-language songs Jansz had written at that time.
Copier came up with the idea of the name after hearing the never officially recorded song &quot;Doe maar&quot;. When Jansz was asked to form the resident band of that year's Festival of Fools, he added five more members to the band: singers Truus de Groot (later Nasmak), Anouk Strijbosch, Wim van Oevelen (the band's eventual tour manager), and clowns Mart de Corte and Jan Bogaerts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Afterwards, the 9-piece line-up was reduced to the original four: [[Ernst Jansz]] (keyboards, sax, percussion), Jan Hendriks (&lt;!--Born: September 20, 1949; --&gt;guitar), Carel Copier (drums), and Piet Dekker (bass).

Dekker turned out to be a songwriter as well. One of his songs appeared in 1979 on a sampler album titled ''Uitholling overdwars'', made up of new Dutch-language bands. The band also released their self-titled debut album on the [[Telstar (Dutch record label)|Telstar]] label, omitting the sampler track &quot;Blozen&quot; ('blushing'); along with the ska and reggae influences in &quot;Hé hé&quot;, &quot;Als de morgen komt&quot; ('when morning comes'), &quot;Regen&quot; ('rain'), &quot;Je liet me staan&quot; ('you left me'), and &quot;Er verandert nix&quot; ('nothing really changes'), which became their trademark sound, there were also punk, rock 'n' roll, and calypso influences on this first album. The critics weren't impressed.

:''&quot;I fail to see how this lot will make a positive contribution to the future of Dutch music&quot;'' — Muziek {{proper name|Expres}}, January 1980{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Entering the new decade, Doe Maar hit the bubbling-under charts with the Caribbean/Indonesian flavoured &quot;Ik zou het willen doen&quot; ('I'd like to do it'), and the album sold 2000 copies.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} But it wasn't enough; Dekker left after falling out with Jansz. The band seriously considered splitting up,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} but not before finishing their spring tour. [[Joost Belinfante]]&lt;!-- (8 October 1946)--&gt;, a multi-instrumantalist with whom Jansz used to play in [[CCC Inc.]] and [[Slumberlandband]], took over for the time being.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===''Skunk''===
After completing their spring tour, the members of the band decided that they wouldn't split up. Jansz asked [[Henny Vrienten]], a professional musician and composer who had previously collaborated with Jansz, if he would join the band. Vrienten initially refused as he felt it wasn't advantageous to his career, but later changed his mind. Vrienten would eventually contribute to three songs on Doe Maar's second album ''Skunk'': &quot;32 jaar&quot; ('32 years'), &quot;Smoorverliefd&quot; ('madly in love'), and &quot;De laatste X&quot; ('the last time').

''Skunk'' was initially supposed to come out in December 1980, but Telstar postponed the album's release until March 1981, as the company did not believe that Doe Maar's efforts would survive amidst bigger names during the December period. Despite this, Telstar began to market the album and released samples to radio stations. Due to a miscommunication, DJs did not know that the record had not been released, and played the samples on the radio.

Listeners responded positively to &quot;32 jaar&quot;, although the original name of the song, &quot;Sinds 1 dag of 2&quot; ('since a day or two'), didn't stick and was difficult to remember. For this reason, Dutch radio DJ [[Frits Spits]] renamed it to the eventual title, &quot;32 jaar&quot;.
The song reached #29 in the Top 40, and ''Skunk'' eventually reached #1 on the Dutch Top 100 Albums. Thanks to this success, the band played a lot of concerts, although attendance was not as high as they desired. Despite having been replaced by Vrienten, Belinfante regularly joined and performed with the band, playing trombone and percussion.

===''Doris Day'' and breakthrough===
Carel Copier suffered from a torn muscle which basically ended his career. Searching for a replacement, the band recruited [[René van Collem]]&lt;!-- (1961)--&gt;, a seaside bartender who had previously released a single as a member of the band Steam. He joined in time to record the third album, of which the title track, &quot;[[Doris Day (song)|Doris Day]]&quot;, was a complaint against TV boredom. The song initially had a reference to the legendary movie program host [[Simon van Collem]], until it was discovered that he was in fact René's father. Vrienten's other efforts dealt with subjects such as unhappy marriages (&quot;Is dit alles&quot;, 'is this all'), failure to quit cigarettes, alcohol and junk food (&quot;OK&quot;), and desperately searching for a warm embrace (&quot;Radeloos&quot;, 'desperate'). Jansz delivered songs about girls rejecting him (&quot;Situatie&quot;, 'situation'), spending the night with him at a young age (&quot;Belle Helene&quot;, on which he played the sax solo himself), or being too experienced (&quot;De eerste keer&quot;, 'the first time'). With Belinfante, he co-wrote &quot;Nachtmerrie op hol&quot; ('nightmare on the loose'), about dreams of revisited exams.

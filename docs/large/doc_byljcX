==Total internal reflection and critical angle==
[[File:Refraction internal reflection diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right|Demonstration of no refraction at angles greater than the critical angle.]]
{{Main|Total internal reflection}}
When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as [[total internal reflection]]. The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the '''critical angle'''; in this case the refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.

[[Image:RefractionReflextion.svg|thumb|center|650px|Refraction of light at the interface between two media.]]

For example, consider a ray of light moving from water to air with an angle of incidence of 50°. The refractive indices of water and air are approximately 1.333 and 1, respectively, so Snell's law gives us the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2}\sin\theta_1 = \frac{1.333}{1}\cdot\sin\left(50^\circ\right) = 1.333\cdot 0.766 = 1.021,&lt;/math&gt;

which is impossible to satisfy. The critical angle θ&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for which θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equals 90°:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{crit} = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\sin\theta_2\right) = \arcsin\frac{n_2}{n_1} = 48.6^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dispersion==
{{Main|Dispersion (optics)}}

In many wave-propagation media, wave velocity changes with frequency or wavelength of the waves; this is true of light propagation in most transparent substances other than a vacuum.  These media are called dispersive.  The result is that the angles determined by Snell's law also depend on frequency or wavelength, so that a ray of mixed wavelengths, such as white light, will spread or disperse.  Such dispersion of light in glass or water underlies the origin of [[rainbow]]s and other [[optical phenomena]], in which different wavelengths appear as different colors.

In optical instruments, dispersion leads to [[chromatic aberration]]; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect.  This was especially true in [[refracting telescope]]s, before the invention of [[Achromatic lens|achromatic]] objective lenses.

==Lossy, absorbing, or conducting media==
{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of opacity}}
In a conducting medium, permittivity and index of refraction are complex-valued. Consequently, so are the angle of refraction and the wave-vector. This implies that, while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose normals make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal, the surfaces of constant amplitude, in contrast, are planes parallel to the interface itself. Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other, the wave is said to be inhomogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;Born and Wolf, sec.13.2, &quot;Refraction and reflection at a metal surface&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The refracted wave is exponentially attenuated, with exponent proportional to the imaginary component of the index of refraction.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, ''Optics'', sec. 4.8, Optical properties of metals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Orfanidis, ''Electromagnetic Waves &amp; Antennas'', sec. 7.9, Oblique Incidence on a Lossy Medium, [http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch07.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ireland.A2003004.jpg|thumb|250px|True-colour satellite image of [[Ireland]], known in Irish as {{lang|ga|Éire}}.]]

{{lang|ga|'''Éire'''}} ({{IPA-ga|ˈeːɾʲə|lang|Eire_pronunciation.ogg}}) is [[Irish language|Irish]] for &quot;[[Ireland]]&quot;, the name of an [[Ireland|island]] and a [[Republic of Ireland|sovereign state]].

== Etymology ==
{{Further|Ériu|Erin|Hibernia|Iverni}}
The modern Irish ''Éire'' evolved from the [[Old Irish]] word ''[[Ériu]]'', which was the name of a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] goddess. ''Ériu'' is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. The origin of ''Ériu'' has been traced to the [[Proto-Celtic]] reconstruction *''Φīwerjon-'' (nominative singular ''Φīwerjū'' &lt; Pre-Proto-Celtic ''-jō'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/CentreforAdvancedWelshCelticStudies/ResearchProjects/CompletedProjects/TheCelticLanguagesandCulturalIdentity/CelticLexicon.aspx|title=Celtic Lexicon - University of Wales|website=www.wales.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a descent from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] reconstruction *''piHwerjon-'', likely related to the adjectival stem *''piHwer-'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''pīvan'', ''pīvarī'' and ''pīvara'' and [[Persian language|Persian]] parvar(پروار) meaning &quot;fat, full, abounding&quot;). This would suggest a meaning of &quot;abundant land&quot;.

This Proto-Celtic form became *Īweriū in [[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Pub., 1997, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly likely that explorers borrowed and modified this term. During his exploration of northwest Europe (circa 320 BC), [[Pytheas of Massilia]] called the island  ''Ierne'' (written {{lang|grc|Ἰέρνη}}). In his book ''Geographia'' (circa 150 AD), [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] called the island  ''Iouernia'' (written {{lang|grc|Ἰουερνία}}; ''ou'' represented /w/). Based on these historical accounts, the Roman Empire called the island ''[[Hibernia]]''.

The evolution of the word would follow as such:
*[[Proto-Celtic]]  *''Φīwerjon-'' (nominative singular *''Φīwerjū'')
**[[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]]  *''Īweriū''
***[[Old Irish]]  ''Ériu''
****[[Irish language|Modern Irish]]  ''Éire''

A 19th century proposal, which does not follow modern standards of etymology, derives the name from [[Scottish Gaelic]]:
* ''ì'' (island) + ''thiar'' (west) + ''fónn'' (land), which together give ''ì-iar-fhónn'', or &quot;westland isle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Forbes|title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar|edition=2nd|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|year=1848|page=160|quote=&quot;The Celtic words ì, inns, an island, will forma key to the etymology of the names of many insular and peninsular places in the world; as, ''Ile'', Islay. ''Jura'' or ''Iura'', Jura. Uist, ''Uist'', ''Inchkeith'', isle of Keith. ''Eireinn'', or ''Eirionn'', ì-iar-fhónn, wetland isle; Ireland.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology fails in that ''tiar'' (the historical form) has no *téir forms which would allow the development of the *é of Éire; moreover, Old Irish (= Old Gaelic) ''í'' &quot;island&quot; was a late loan word from Old Norse ''ey'' &quot;island&quot;, and so did not exist in prehistoric Ireland.

=== Difference between ''Éire'' and ''Erin'' ===
While ''Éire'' is simply the name for the island of Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in [[English language|English]], ''Erin'' is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in ''[[Erin go bragh]]''. The distinction between the two is one of the difference between [[Grammatical case|cases]] of [[nouns]] in Irish. ''Éire'' is the [[nominative case]], the case that is used for nouns that are the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence, i.e., the noun that is ''doing'' something as well as the direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a sentence. ''Erin'' derives from ''Éirinn'', the Irish [[dative case]] of ''Éire'', which has replaced the nominative case in [[Gaeltacht na nDéise|Déise]] Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (where the usual word for Ireland is {{lang|gd|Èirinn}}) and [[Manx language|Manx]] (like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, a Goidelic Celtic language), where the word is spelled &quot;Nerin,&quot; with the initial ''n-'' probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition ''in''/''an'' &quot;in&quot; (cf. Irish ''in Éirinn'', Scottish ''an Èirinn''/''ann an Èirinn'' &quot;in Ireland&quot;). The [[genitive case]], ''Éireann'' (e.g. ''stair na hÉireann'' &quot;the history of Ireland, Ireland's history&quot;), is found in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. ''[[Iarnród Éireann]]'' (''Irish Rail''), ''[[Dáil Éireann]]'' (''Irish Parliament''), ''[[Republic of Ireland|Poblacht na hÉireann]]'' (''The Republic of Ireland'') or ''[[Northern Ireland|Tuaisceart Éireann]]'' (''Northern Ireland''),

Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] adopted in 1937 by the government under [[Éamon de Valera]] states that ''Éire'' is the name of the state, or in the English language, ''Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm Constitution of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430174659/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm |date=30 April 2008 }}&quot;. Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Retrieved on 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution's English-language [[Irish Constitution#Preamble (full text)|preamble]] also describes the population as &quot;We, the people of Éire&quot;. Despite the fact that Article 8 designated Irish as the &quot;national&quot; and &quot;first official&quot; language, ''Éire'' has to some extent passed out of everyday conversation and literature, and the state is referred to as ''Ireland'' or its equivalent in all other languages.
The name &quot;Éire&quot; has been used on Irish [[postage stamps of Ireland|postage stamps]] since 1922;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Hamilton-Bowen |title=Hibernian Handbook and Catalogue of the Postage Stamps of Ireland |year=2009 |editor=Roy Hamilton-Bowen |publisher=Rodgau Philatelic Service GmbH |location=Rodgau, Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt; on all [[Irish coinage]] (including [[Irish euro coins]]); and together with &quot;Ireland&quot; on passports and other official state documents issued since 1937. &quot;Éire&quot; is used on the [[Seal of the President of Ireland]].

Initially after 1937 the United Kingdom insisted on using only the name &quot;Eire&quot; and refused to accept the name &quot;Ireland&quot;. It adopted the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] putting in law that position. At the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London the organisers insisted that the Irish team march under the banner &quot;Eire&quot; notwithstanding that every other team was marching according to what their name was in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-17321873|title=Celebrating champions|first=Jennifer|last=O'Leary|date=9 March 2012|via=www.bbc.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506043240/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-17321873|archivedate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government generally avoided all reference to &quot;Ireland&quot; in connection with the state and used what Senator [[Thomas J. O'Connell|Thomas O'Connell]] described as &quot;sneering titles such as Eirish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/seanad/1948-12-10/3/?highlight%5B0%5D=eirish The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948], Seanad Éireann debate, Vol. 36 No. 2, Friday, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term &quot;Eirish&quot; was also used by some writers in the US, who referred to &quot;the Eirish people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8SE-AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Eirish%22&amp;dq=%22Eirish%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihvraQ8-PpAhW9QUEAHWibCKEQ6AEIVzAH ''The Literary Digest''], Volume 124, Funk and Wagnalls, 1938, pages 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Using the genitive form ''Éireann'' as an adjective, the UK media would refer to &quot;Eireann Ministers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D-0fAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Eireann+Ministers%22&amp;dq=%22Eireann+Ministers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinuo6B8OPpAhX0aRUIHfNWCZoQ6AEIXjAH ''Chronology of International Events and Documents''], Volume 4, Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1947, page 690&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Eireann Army&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3V_mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Eireann+Army%22&amp;dq=%22the+Eireann+Army%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH-8b17uPpAhUht3EKHUa0DqgQ6AEIKDAA ''The Motor''], Volume 78, page 213&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ireland Act 1949]] changed this to &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;. It was not until after the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] that the UK government accepted the preferred name of simply &quot;Ireland&quot;, at the same time as Ireland dropped its territorial claim over Northern Ireland.

Before the 1937 Constitution, &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; (the Irish name of the [[Irish Free State]]) was generally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1922/en/act/pub/0001/sched1.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519011550/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1922/en/act/pub/0001/sched1.html|archivedate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the Emergency]] (as [[World War II]] was known), Irish ships had &quot;EIRE&quot; (and the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]) painted large on their sides and deck, to identify them as neutrals.

In the 1947 [[Sinn Féin Funds case]], a co-defendant was cited as &quot;the Attorney General of Eire&quot; in the High and Supreme Court cases, and there were similar cases where &quot;Eire&quot; was used in the late 1940s as a descriptor of the state in English.&lt;ref&gt;''Buckley and others v. the Attorney General of Eire and Charles Stewart Power'', 1 Irish Reports [1950], 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922–1938 the [[List of international license plate codes#I|international plate on Irish cars]] was &quot;SE&quot;. From 1938 to 1962 it was marked &quot;EIR&quot;, short for Éire.

Irish politician [[Bernard Commons]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] suggested to the [[Dáil]] in 1950 that the government examine &quot;the tourist identification plate bearing the letters EIR ... with a view to the adoption of identification letters more readily associated with this country by foreigners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0119/D.0119.195003220018.html |title=Dáil Éireann – Volume 119 - 22 March, 1950 – Ceisteanna—Questions.

Under the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|1947 Convention]] [[Aircraft registration#List of countries/regions and their current registration prefixes and patterns|Irish-registered aircraft]] have carried a registration mark starting &quot;EI&quot; for Éire.

From January 2007, the Irish government nameplates at meetings of the [[European Union]] have borne both ''Éire'' and ''Ireland'', following the adoption of [[Irish language|Irish]] as a [[Languages of the European Union|working language of the European Union]].{{clear left}}

==Spelling ''Eire'' rather than ''Éire'' ==
When Irish-language texts were printed in [[Gaelic type]], diacritics were retained on upper-case letters as for lower-case letters. From the later 1940s, in conjunction with other reforms, printing switched to the same &quot;[[Roman type]]&quot; used for most other [[Latin alphabet]] languages. There was some uncertainty about whether the ''[[síneadh fada]]'' (acute accent) should be written on upper-case letters. While it was preserved in all-Irish texts, it was often omitted when short fragments of Irish appeared alone or in English texts. [[Noel Davern]] asked in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] in 1974 why Irish stamps had ''EIRE'' rather than ''ÉIRE''. The reply from the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Ireland)|Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] was:&lt;ref name=&quot;dailq1974&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=28 March 1974|title=Ceisteanna —Questions. Oral Answers. - Irish Postage Stamps.|journal=Dáil debates|volume=271|issue=8|pages=38 cc.1140–1|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1974032800038|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511152840/http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1974032800038|archivedate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The accent has been omitted on most Irish stamps issued over the past ten years in the interests of artistic balance and in accordance with a common practice in the printing of Irish in Roman script for display purposes. This is a prevailing typographical convention and is common to several European languages, including French.}}
Davern considered the spelling ''Eire'' to be worse than a misspelling, because ''eire'' is a separate word, meaning &quot;a burden, load or encumbrance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailq1974&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/eire|title=Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla (Ó Dónaill, 1977)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister stated, &quot;The word on the stamp ... does not mean 'eire' and it is not understood to mean 'eire' by anybody except Davern.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailq1974&quot; /&gt; Stamps later reverted to a Gaelic type with the accent preserved.

In 1938 the British government provided in the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] that British legislation would henceforth refer to the [[Irish Free State]] as &quot;Eire&quot; (but not as &quot;Ireland&quot;). This was altered by the [[Ireland Act 1949]], where the English-law name of the state was changed to &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland Act 1949, section 1(3)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1938 Act was repealed in 1981, and in 1996 a British journalist described ''Eire'' as &quot;now an oddity rarely used, an out-of-date reference&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=Understanding journalism: a guide to issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axT2G0W9sl0C&amp;pg=PA269|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415115995|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1937, the [[Eire Society of Boston]] is an influential [[Irish-American]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiresociety.org/eshistory.html The Eire Society of Boston's history page on-line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726021235/http://www.eiresociety.org/eshistory.html |date=26 July 2011 }} (seen on 25 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadiens have won the [[Stanley Cup]] more times than any other franchise.

{{Details|History of the Montreal Canadiens}}
The Canadiens organization operates in both English and French. For many years, public address announcements and press releases have been given in both languages, and the team website and social media outlets are in both languages as well. At home games, the first stanza of [[O Canada]] is sung in French, and the chorus is sung in English.

One of sport's oldest and most recognizable logos, the classic 'C' and 'H' of the Montreal Canadiens was first used together in the 1917–18 season, when the club changed its name to &quot;Club de hockey Canadien&quot; from &quot;Club athlétique Canadien&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=370513 |title=NHL.com – Ice Age: Playing the point on many issues – 02/08/2008 |last=Coffey |first=Phil |publisher=National Hockey League |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104146/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=370513 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before evolving to its current form in 1952–53. The &quot;H&quot; stands for &quot;hockey&quot;, not &quot;[[Habitants]],&quot; a popular misconception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/jerseys-and-logos/1909-1946 |title=Jerseys and Logos – 1909 – 1946 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324212551/http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/jerseys-and-logos/1909-1946 |archivedate=March 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NHL.com, the first man to refer to the team as &quot;the Habs&quot; was American [[Tex Rickard]], owner of the [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], in 1924.

[[File:Montreal canadiens unif.png|thumb|250px|Team uniforms]]
The team's colours since 1911 are blue, red, and white. The home [[Hockey jersey|sweater]] is predominantly red in colour. There are four blue and white stripes, one across each arm, one across the chest and the other across the waistline. The main road sweater is mainly white with a red and blue stripe across the waist, red at the end of both arm sleeves red shoulder yokes. The basic design has been in use since 1914 and took its current form in 1925, generally evolving as materials changed.&lt;ref name=jerseys/&gt; Because of the team's lengthy history and significance in Quebec, the sweater has been referred to as {{lang|fr|'La Sainte-Flanelle'}} (the holy flannel sweater).

The Canadiens used multiple designs prior to adopting the aforementioned design in 1914. The original shirt of the 1909–10 season was blue with a white C. The second season had a red shirt featuring a green [[maple leaf]] with the C logo, and green pants. Lastly, the season before adopting the current look the Canadiens wore a &quot;[[barber pole]]&quot; design jersey with red, white and blue stripes, and the logo being a white maple leaf reading &quot;CAC&quot;, &quot;Club athlétique Canadien&quot;.&lt;ref name=jerseys&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/jerseys-and-logos/1909-1946 |title=Our History – Logos and Jerseys |publisher=Canadiens.com |year=2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718004302/http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/jerseys-and-logos/1909-1946 |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three designs were worn during the 2009–10 season as part of the Canadiens centenary.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=489960 |title=Habs unveil Centennial initiatives |date=September 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 31, 2014 |publisher=Canadiens.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050356/http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=489960 |archivedate=November 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

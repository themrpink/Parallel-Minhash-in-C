ALEC also has ties to the [[State Policy Network]] (SPN), a national association of conservative and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] think-tanks.

==Notable policies and model bills==
The ALEC website states that its goal is to advance &quot;the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/|title=About ALEC|publisher=American Legislative Exchange Council|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205023422/http://www.alec.org/about-alec/|archive-date=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Donald Ray Kennard]], then a Louisiana state representative and ALEC national chairman, said, &quot;We are a very, very conservative organization...

Although ALEC originally focused on social issues such as [[abortion]], which it opposed, in more recent years the group has focused more on business and regulatory matters.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; According to [[John Nichols (journalist)|John Nichols]] of ''[[The Nation]]'', ALEC's agenda &quot;seems to be dictated at almost every turn by multinational corporations. It's to clear the way for lower taxes, less regulation, a lot of protection against lawsuits, [and] ALEC is very, very active in [the] opening up of areas via privatization for corporations to make more money, particularly in places you might not usually expect like public education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR FreshAir 21July2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Who's Really Writing States' Legislation? |work=[[Fresh Air]], WHYY |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/21/138537515/how-alec-shapes-state-politics-behind-the-scenes |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=July 21, 2011 |access-date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Brookings Institution]] study of state legislation introduced in 2011–2012 found that ALEC model bills that became law were linked most often to controversial social and economic issues. The study concluded that this phenomenon has hurt ALEC because, &quot;Dirtying its hands with social issues undermines ALEC's ability to exercise influence over fiscal ones.&quot;&lt;ref name=brookings/&gt;

According to research by Columbia University political scientist Alex Hertel-Fernandez, ALEC model legislation during the late 1970s focused primarily on social issues, such as abortion, drugs, gun laws, religious freedom and anti-busing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/state-capture-9780190870799|title=State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses, and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States — and the Nation|last=Hertel-Fernandez|first=Alex|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=9780190870799|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, the focus was primarily on criminal justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; By the 1990s, the focus was overwhelmingly on business deregulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;

=== Voter ID laws ===
After Obama's victory in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], ALEC's internal publication (which it provides to paying members) asserted, without evidence, that voter fraud contributed to his victory. ALEC said that groups like [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]] had engaged in voter-registration fraud whereby fake voter registrations were submitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/state-capture-9780190870799|title=State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses, and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States — and the Nation|last=Hertel-Fernandez|first=Alex|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=9780190870799|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2012, legislation based on ALEC model bills was introduced in many states to mandate or strengthen requirements that voters produce state-issued photographic identification. The bills were passed and signed into law in six states.&lt;ref name=&quot;governing2011&quot; /&gt; Voter identification bills introduced in 34 states would have made voting more difficult for students, the elderly, and the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pssst&quot; /&gt; According to research by Columbia University political scientist Alex Hertel-Fernandez, &quot;Of the 62 ID laws states considered during the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, more than half were proposed by lawmakers who... were all participants in the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC.

===Immigration===
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
The &quot;[[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]]&quot;, an Arizona law commonly known as &quot;SB 1070&quot;, was drafted during an ALEC meeting in December 2009 and became an ALEC model bill.&lt;ref name=nprprison&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/10/28/130833741/prison-economics-help-drive-ariz-immigration-law|title=Prison Economics Help Drive Ariz.

Bills similar to SB 1070 were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, and Utah, and have been introduced in 17 other states.&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt;

A 2018 study characterized ALEC as highly influential in the spread of policies intended to curb [[Sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]] (jurisdictions where immigration enforcement is not a law enforcement priority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Collingwood|first1=Loren|last2=El-Khatib|first2=Stephen Omar|last3=Gonzalez O’Brien|first3=Benjamin|s2cid=158569247|date=2018-11-28|title=Sustained Organizational Influence: American Legislative Exchange Council and the Diffusion of Anti-Sanctuary Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|volume=47|issue=3|pages=735–773|language=en|doi=10.1111/psj.12284|issn=0190-292X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act===
One of ALEC's model bills is the &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;, which classifies certain property destruction, acts of intimidation, and [[civil disobedience]] by environmental and [[animal rights]] activists as [[terrorism]]. This model bill appeared across the U.S. in various forms since it was drafted in 2003. The federal &quot;[[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]]&quot; has notable similarities, and at points almost verbatim language, to ALEC's model &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;. The Senate version of the &quot;[[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]]&quot; was sponsored by Senator [[James Inhofe]], a long-time member of ALEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Will |last=Potter |url=http://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/ag-gag-american-legislative-exchange-council/5947/ |title='Ag Gag' Bills and Supporters Have Close Ties to ALEC |work=Green is the New Red |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[ag-gag]] bills are also similar to ALEC's model &quot;Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&quot;, which would make it against the law to film, videotape, or take photographs on livestock farms in order to &quot;defame the facility or its owner&quot;. People found to be in violation would be put in a &quot;terrorist registry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oppel Jr., Richard A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/taping-of-farm-cruelty-is-becoming-the-crime.html|title=Taping of Farm Cruelty Is Becoming the Crime|date=April 6, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]].

===Criminal sentencing and prison management===
According to ''Governing'' magazine, &quot;ALEC has been a major force behind both privatizing state prison space and keeping prisons filled.&quot;&lt;ref name=governing2003 /&gt; ALEC has developed model bills advancing &quot;[[tough on crime]]&quot; initiatives, including &quot;[[truth in sentencing]]&quot; and &quot;[[three-strikes laws|three strikes]]&quot; laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pat Beall&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Beall|date=November 22, 2013|url=http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/big-business-group-behind-push-that-filled-florida/nbYTc/|title=Big business, legislators pushed for stiff sentences|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that by funding and participating in ALEC's Criminal Justice Task Force, [[private prison]] companies directly influence legislation for tougher, longer sentences. [[Corrections Corporation of America]] and [[Wackenhut Corrections]], two of the largest for-profit prison companies in the U.S. ({{as of|2004|lc=y}}), have been contributors to ALEC.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Amy (September 2004) [http://www.sentencingproject.org/Admin/Documents/publications/inc_prisonprivatization.pdf &quot;Prison Privatization and the Use of Incarceration&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714063407/http://www.sentencingproject.org/Admin/Documents/publications/inc_prisonprivatization.pdf |date=2007-07-14 }}. The Sentencing Project.&lt;/ref&gt; ALEC also has worked to pass state laws to allow the creation of private-sector for-profit prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Elk|last1=Mike|first2=Sloan|last2=Bob |year=2011|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/162478/hidden-history-alec-and-prison-labor|title=The Hidden History of ALEC and Prison Labor|journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/5/new_expos_tracks_alec_private_prison|title=New Exposé Tracks ALEC-Private Prison Industry Effort to Replace Unionized Workers with Prison Labor|work=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Gottschalk]], professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, said that ALEC has played a major role in &quot;liberating the private sector to employ penal labor and expand the privatization of corrections.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Gottschalk. ''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10731.html Caught: The Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics]''. Princeton University Press, 2014. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CzDFCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2012 that ALEC had &quot;a special interest in privatization—that is, on turning the provision of public services, from schools to prisons, over to for-profit corporations,&quot; and as such played a significant role in the &quot;[[Prison–industrial complex|penal–industrial complex]]&quot;. As an example, Krugman wrote that the [[American Bail Coalition]] had declared publicly that ALEC was its &quot;life preserver.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman (March 25, 2012). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/opinion/krugman-lobbyists-guns-and-money.html?_r=0 Lobbyists, Guns and Money]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved December 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, ALEC disbanded the task force that favored harsh sentencing and supported reducing [[prison overcrowding]] and lowering the costs associated with the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pat Beall&quot; /&gt; At that time, ALEC promoted investing taxpayer money in alternatives to incarceration, such as electronic monitoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pat Beall&quot; /&gt;

===Energy and the environment===
ALEC pushed for [[deregulation]] of the electricity industry in the 1990s. Maneuvering between two private sector members, the former energy trader, [[Enron]], and the  utilities trade association, [[Edison Electric Institute]] (EEI), resulted in EEI withdrawing its ALEC membership. Enron's position on the matter was adopted by ALEC and subsequently, by many state legislatures.&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt;

In 2011, ALEC adopted model legislation having to do with public &quot;[[right to know]]&quot; laws regarding what fluids are used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] (also known as &quot;fracking&quot;) that was promoted as a victory for the right of consumers to know about potential [[drinking water pollution|drinking water contaminants]], in spite of the fact that the bill contained &quot;loopholes that would allow energy companies to withhold the names of certain fluid contents, for reasons including that they have been deemed trade secrets&quot;.&lt;ref name=stealth/&gt;

ALEC has promoted a model bill that called plans in 2011 by the federal [[Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate [[greenhouse gas emissions]], a &quot;train wreck&quot; that would harm the economy, and it has supported efforts by various states to withdraw from regional [[climate change]] compacts.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt; In 2013, their resolution stated &quot;Alec is very concerned about the potential economic impact of greenhouse gas regulation on electricity prices and the harm EPA regulations may have on the economic recovery&quot;.&lt;ref name=guard2013/&gt; ALEC also has promoted a model bill that would call on the federal government to approve the proposed [[Keystone XL]] project, which would extend a [[synthetic crude oil]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from [[oil sands]] in Alberta, Canada to Nebraska.&lt;ref name=verma&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/republican-legislative-council-pushes-for-keystone-approval/article15968657/ |title=Republican legislative council pushes for Keystone approval|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 13, 2013|first=Sonia|last=Verma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/842268-alec-2013-annual-meeting-policy-report.html ALEC 2013 Annual Meeting Policy Report] via The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ALEC planned legislation that would weaken state clean energy regulations and penalize homeowners who install their own solar panels and [[Net metering|redistribute the electricity back into the grid]], whom ALEC has described as &quot;freeriders&quot; because they do not pay for the infrastructure costs of recirculating their generated power.&lt;ref name=guard2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldenberg|first1=Suzanne |last2=Pilkington|first2=Ed|date=December 4, 2013|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/alec-freerider-homeowners-assault-clean-energy |title=ALEC calls for penalties on 'freerider' homeowners in assault on clean energy|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, ALEC adopted a model bill saying that the role of human activity in causing [[climate change]] was uncertain, that man-made climate change could be &quot;deleterious, neutral or possibly beneficial,&quot; and that the cost of regulating [[greenhouse gas emissions]] could cause &quot;great economic dislocation.&quot; ALEC also has invited [[climate change deniers]], such as [[Craig Idso]], to speak at its national meetings. In 2015 [[Common Cause]] and the [[League of Conservation Voters]] pointed to such behavior to accuse ALEC of [[climate change denial|denying climate change]]. ALEC responded by threatening legal action, denying that ALEC supports climate change denial, and saying it has more recently welcomed debate on the subject and supported [[renewable energy]] and [[carbon tax]] policies to curb global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Tom|last1=Hamburger |first2=Joby|last2=Warrick |first3=Chris|last3=Mooney |title=This conservative group is tired of being accused of climate denial — and is fighting back|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/04/05/this-conservative-group-is-tired-of-being-accused-of-climate-denial-and-is-fighting-back/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several corporations have announced that their affiliations with ALEC will be allowed to lapse over disagreement with the group's opposition to action on climate change. These include [[Ford Motor Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/ford-quits-alec-lobby-conservative-environment|title=Ford becomes latest corporation to sever ties with conservative Alec lobby|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|date=17 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Petroleum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/23/alec-bp-british-petroleum-companies-conservative-lobbyist|title=BP joins list of companies fleeing Alec|first=Amy|last=Westervelt|date=23 March 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. A statement by Shell said &quot;its stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our own...We have long recognized both the importance of the climate challenge and the critical role energy has in determining quality of life for people across the world.&quot; An ALEC spokesperson responded &quot;Climate change activists have conflated our opposition to the government picking winners and losers as climate change denial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/250569-shell-to-leave-alec-over-climate-change-stance Shell to leave ALEC over climate change stance].

In December 2016, [[Tesla Motors]] (not an ALEC member) hosted an ALEC event in Washington, D.C., where ALEC promoted its &quot;Energy Innovation Project&quot;, that was partly funded by the [[ClearPath Foundation]]. The project guides states toward innovation and entrepreneurship surrounding U.S. energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-01/tesla-hosts-lobbying-group-shunned-by-ford-over-climate-stance |title=Tesla Hosts Lobby Group Shunned by Ford Over Climate Stance|work=Bloomberg.com |date= December 1, 2016 |access-date= December 2, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161202164521/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-01/tesla-hosts-lobbying-group-shunned-by-ford-over-climate-stance |archive-date= December 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-hosts-lobbying-group-shunned-202417431.html |title=Tesla Hosts Lobbying Group Shunned by Ford Over Climate Stance (Mirror) |publisher=Bloomberg/Yahoo |date= December 1, 2016 |access-date= December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC has promoted draft bills for restrictions on [[single-use plastic]] [[drinking straw]]s.

AT&amp;T and Verizon drafted ALEC model legislation prohibiting public broadband services and &quot;sunsetting&quot; the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN).&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite news|last=Kushnick|first=Bruce|title=ALEC, Tech and the Telecom Wars: Killing America's Telecom Utilities|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/alec-tech-and-the-telecom_b_1696830.html|access-date=22 April 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2017}} Names of its 172-member task force, the agenda of a December 2010 meeting, and its minutes that included a resolution regarding [[traffic pumping]] were published by [[Common Cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunications &amp; Information Technology Task Force Meeting ALEC States &amp; Nation Policy Summit – Washington, DC |url=http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/%7BFB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD4429893665%7D/telecom_35daymailing%20DC.pdf |publisher=Common Cause |access-date=April 22, 2014 |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205084203/http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/%7BFB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD4429893665%7D/telecom_35daymailing%20DC.pdf |archive-date=December 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Senate Bill 304 in Kansas was introduced, &quot;prohibiting cities and counties from building public broadband networks and providing internet service to businesses and citizens&quot;.&lt;ref name=wichita&gt;{{cite news|last=Lefler|first=Dion|title=Proposed bill to outlaw community broadband service in Kansas met with opposition|url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/02/01/3262071/proposed-bill-to-outlaw-community.html|access-date=April 22, 2014|newspaper=Wichita Eagle|date=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill contains an &quot;underserved area&quot; exemption for public wi-fi, but the exemption criterion is not met anywhere in Kansas. The city of [[Chanute, Kansas]], which has led broadband development since the 1980s, financed through its public electricity company, including free wi-fi in its college, hospital, and public spaces, and a 4g mobile data network, felt under attack by the bill.&lt;ref name=wichita/&gt; The bill failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/cable-co-blames-misinformation-for-failure-of-municipal-internet-ban/|title=Cable co. blames &quot;misinformation&quot; for failure of municipal Internet ban|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
ALEC opposes the [[individual mandate|individual health insurance mandate]] enacted by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly known as the &quot;ACA&quot; or &quot;Obamacare&quot;). ALEC filed an [[amicus brief]] in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'', urging the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] to strike down the [[individual mandate]] of the ACA. In 2011, ALEC published the &quot;State Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare&quot;, which has served as a road map for [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Repeal efforts|repeal efforts]].&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt; ALEC also has drafted a variety of model bills designed to [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Non-cooperation|block implementation of the law]].&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;

In August 2013, ALEC approved the &quot;Health Care Freedom Act&quot; as a model bill that aims to strip [[health insurers]] of their licenses to do business at the federal [[health care exchange]]s of ACA if they accepted any subsidies under the system. Sean Riley, the head of the ALEC Health and Human Services task force, said the aim of the proposed legislation was to protect businesses from the ACA's [[employer mandate]].&lt;ref name=pilkington/&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' journalist [[David Weigel]] has called the bill a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on the ACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/legal_case_against_obamacare_halbig_v_sebelius_and_state_legislatures.html|title=Obamacare Is Over (If You Want It)|journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 17, 2013|first=David|last=Weigel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health insurance experts have predicted that if the bill were widely adopted by Republican-controlled states, it would seriously disrupt the exchange and threaten the ACA.&lt;ref name=pilkington/&gt; [[Wendell Potter]], former health insurance executive and CMD fellow, said, &quot;You cannot build the healthcare system based on the free market unless you have subsidies. If they are taken away the whole thing collapses.&quot;&lt;ref name=pilkington/&gt;

In 1989, ALEC published the draft &quot;HIV Assault Act&quot;, which made it a crime for someone who is knowingly infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) to have sex with a person who is not infected, without disclosing the HIV infection. The bill made having such sex without disclosure a criminal offense, even when HIV was not transmitted. Alan Smith, who worked on the draft, said the proposed law was a response to worries that people with AIDS were deliberately infecting others, &quot;to make sure more people got it so more research money could be devoted to curing it&quot;.&lt;ref name=propubhiv&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/hiv-criminal-transmission|title=Sex, Lies and HIV: When What You Don't Tell Your Partner Is a Crime|first=Sergio|last=Hernandez|publisher=[[ProPublica]]|date=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
In the 1980s, ALEC pushed anti-gay propaganda, and urged legislators to oppose attempts to &quot;homosexualize society.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/state-capture-9780190870799|title=State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses, and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States — and the Nation|last=Hertel-Fernandez|first=Alex|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=9780190870799|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALEC said that homosexual relations were &quot;probably some of the most destructive and degrading institutions in America today&quot;. ALEC claimed homosexuality caused psychological harm, led to pedophilia, and that homosexuals sought to recruit the young.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Other issues===
ALEC has worked to privatize public education.&lt;ref name=nprpilkington&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/12/10/249956329/how-alec-serves-as-a-dating-service-for-politicians-and-corporations|title=How ALEC Serves As A 'Dating Service' For Politicians And Corporations|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It frequently promotes model bills that expand public-private partnerships in education.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;

It has provided model legislation that led to the enactment of [[Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117|aggressive personal and corporate income tax cuts in Kansas in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/weblogs/capitol-report/2013/dec/17/brownback-says-perception-of-alec-influe/|title=Brownback says perception of ALEC influence is 'overblown'|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=December 17, 2013|first=Scott|last=Rothschild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Sam Brownback]], who promoted and signed the legislation, was advised by the [[supply-side economist]] and ALEC board member, [[Arthur Laffer]], who said at the time that the cuts would pay for themselves and lead to increased growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/article1097282.html|title=Economist Arthur Laffer says tax cuts will help Kansas grow|newspaper=[[The Wichita Eagle]]|date=August 14, 2012|first=Brent D.|last=Wistrom}}&lt;/ref&gt; By fall 2014, however, the tax cuts had led to the depletion of a $700 million budget surplus, and although Kansas had experienced 6.6% job growth from 2010 to 2013, that figure lagged behind the nation's overall 8.8% job growth for the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-03/brownback-faces-blowback-as-kansas-tax-cuts-shutter-classrooms.html|title=Brownback Faces Blowback as Kansas Tax Cuts Shutter Classrooms|magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=November 2, 2014|first1=Tim|last1=Jones|first2=Jennifer|last2=Oldham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has promoted a model bill that [[tort reform|limits liability]] for [[parent companies]] that acquire [[subsidiaries]] responsible for [[asbestos]]-related injuries.&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt;

===Smoking===
In 1986, while ALEC was funded by the tobacco industry, it disputed the science linking tobacco smoke to health harms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/state-capture-9780190870799|title=State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses, and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States — and the Nation|last=Hertel-Fernandez|first=Alex|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=9780190870799|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that ALEC had taken action to oppose [[plain cigarette packaging]] laws outside the United States, including the UK and Australia.&lt;ref name=doward&gt;{{cite news|first=Jamie|last=Doward |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/15/cigarettes-plain-packets-alec-koch-brothers|title=US free market group tries to halt sales of cigarettes in plain packets in UK|work=The Guardian|date=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karla Jones, a task force director for ALEC, said that the brands were the corporations' most valuable assets. ALEC stated that generic cigarette packaging increased cigarette consumption, rather than reduced it.&lt;ref name=doward/&gt; ALEC's advocacy against &quot;plain packaging&quot; of tobacco products was cited as partial motivation for an academic study on the effectiveness of plain packaging, which found that &quot;plain packaging can reduce positive perceptions of smoking and dissuade tobacco use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Collin N. Smith, John D. Kraemer, Andrea C. Johnson &amp; Darren Mays, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4396458/ Plain packaging of cigarettes: do we have sufficient evidence?], ''Risk Management and Healthcare Policy'' 2015, 8: 21–30. [[doi:10.2147/RMHP.S63042]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and assistance ==
In addition to providing a forum for the drafting of model legislation that may be adapted easily, ALEC also provides assistance and training to its legislative members. The Oregon co-chairman of ALEC, [[Gene Whisnant]], described the organization in 2012 as a &quot;great resource&quot; for part-time legislators with limited staff resources.&lt;ref name=oregonian/&gt; [[Mark Pocan]], a Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and former member of the [[Wisconsin Assembly]], said in 2012 that ALEC advises members, &quot;'Don't just introduce a single piece of legislation, introduce 14.' That way people can't oppose any one bill.&quot;&lt;ref name=rizzo2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/at_arizona_gathering_alec_teac.html|title=At Arizona gathering, ALEC teaches lawmakers how to turn conservative ideas into law|newspaper=[[The Star Ledger]]|date=April 1, 2012|first=Salvador|last=Rizzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one ALEC meeting, media experts gave messaging advice and taught legislators how to use [[Twitter]] to move ALEC bills through their chambers.&lt;ref name=rizzo2/&gt; Attendants also offered to write [[op-ed]] articles in local newspapers for the legislators and to put lawmakers in touch with other subject matter experts.&lt;ref name=rizzo2/&gt;

==Secrecy and transparency==
Although ''Governing Magazine'' reported in 2003 that ALEC meetings traditionally had been open to the public,&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; news organizations have reported since then that many meetings are held in private. ALEC policy seminars are open to reporters and other nonmembers, but public conference agendas, unlike those distributed to members, do not include the names of presenters, the lists of legislative and private-sector board chairs, nor the corporate sponsors of the seminars.&lt;ref name=rizzo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; Task force meetings and bill-drafting sessions are held behind closed doors.&lt;ref name=rizzo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; Bloggers from [[ThinkProgress]] and [[AlterNet]] were removed from conferences for attempting to take photographs of such sessions and [[tweeting]] the names of ALEC members who participated.&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; In 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Dana Milbank]] was turned away from the ALEC annual &quot;policy summit&quot; and told by spokesperson Bill Meierling that subcommittee meetings and task force meetings were closed-door. Meierling said ALEC was introducing transparency gradually, but it &quot;can't just kick the doors open&quot;.&lt;ref name=milbank&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-alec-stands-its-ground/2013/12/04/ad593320-5d2c-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html|title=ALEC stands its ground|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Dana|last=Milbank|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Milbank incident, the [[Brookings Institution]] reported that ALEC's activities during its closed-door meetings are &quot;still a mystery&quot;, and that &quot;ALEC could have a tremendous influence over lawmaking in the American states, or it could have none at all—we just don't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=brookings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/12/06-american-legislative-exchange-council-jackman|title=ALEC's Influence over Lawmaking in State Legislatures|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|date=December 6, 2013|first=Molly|last=Jackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Nebraska legislator and former ALEC member [[Jeremy Nordquist]] described ALEC as a &quot;faceless organization&quot;, saying, &quot;It's allowing these corporate interests to just duck and cover, and hide from really stepping into the public square and putting their ideas forward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/why-alec-is-so-effective-124965955771|title=Why ALEC is so effective|network=[[MSNBC]]|date=January 22, 2014|series=[[All In with Chris Hayes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC does not disclose its membership list nor the origins of its model bills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=dentists/&gt; Lawmakers generally propose ALEC-drafted bills in their states without disclosing the ALEC authorship.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; For instance, in 2012 ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' analyzed more than 100 bills and regulations previously proposed by the administration of [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] and found a pattern of similarities with ALEC model bills that was &quot;too strong to be accidental&quot;. The connections were based &quot;not on similarity of broad ideas, but on specific numbers, time frames, benchmarks and language&quot;. Legislative staffers in the Christie administration had &quot;mined ALEC for advice on budgetary matters, Medicaid changes and privatizing government services...beginning in the earliest days of Christie's governorship&quot;. [[William Schluter]], vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said there was a &quot;clear connection between ALEC and the proposed New Jersey legislation&quot;. A Christie spokesperson denied any connection between the two.&lt;ref name=rizzo1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/alec_model_bills_used_in_nj_la.html |title=Some of Christie's biggest bills match model legislation from D.C. group called ALEC |newspaper=[[The Star Ledger]] |date=April 3, 2012 |first=Salvador |last=Rizzo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to this pattern came in November 2011, when former Florida State Representative [[Rachel Burgin]] introduced legislation to call on the federal government to reduce its corporate tax rate. She mistakenly included the [[Boilerplate text|boilerplate]] &quot;WHEREAS, it is the mission of the American Legislative Exchange Council to advance Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty...&quot;&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fcir.org/2012/04/18/alec-under-fire-in-florida/|title=ALEC Under Fire in Florida|publisher=[[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]]|date=April 18, 2012|first=Howard|last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the inclusion of the ALEC mission statement was discovered, the bill was withdrawn and resubmitted without the phrase. ''[[The American Prospect]]'' journalist Abby Rapoport wrote that the incident &quot;seems to confirm what many have assumed was occurring in state legislatures—and while Burgin's bill was hardly a major piece of legislation, ALEC's reach in important policy areas seems hard to overestimate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/case-you-were-underestimating-alecs-role|title=In Case You Were Underestimating ALEC's Role|work=[[The American Prospect]]|date=February 3, 2012|first=Abby|last=Rapoport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics sometimes argue that by adopting ALEC model bills without disclosure, state officials are handing off the duty of doing their own work to a business-centered lobby.&lt;ref name=rizzo1/&gt; In early 2012, Democratic lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin introduced the &quot;ALEC Accountability Act of 2012&quot;, which would have required corporations to disclose ALEC funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/alec-accountability-act-arizona-wisconsin_n_1268714.html|title=ALEC Accountability Act In Arizona, Wisconsin Would Make Conservative Group Disclose Funding|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 10, 2012|first=John|last=Celock}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arizona House of Representatives#Leadership information|Arizona House of Representatives Assistant Minority Leader]] [[Steve Farley]], sponsor of the Arizona bill, argued that corporations have the right to present arguments, but not secretly.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-united-states-of-alec/|title=Full Show: United States of ALEC|publisher=Moyers &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2013, access to ALEC model bills was restricted, and its website required a password to access them.&lt;ref name=rizzo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; On July 13, 2011, the [[Center for Media and Democracy]], in cooperation with ''[[The Nation]]'', posted 850 model bills created during a 30-year period, and created a web project, ''ALEC Exposed'', to host these model bills.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/2011/12/21/gIQA9ccRLP_story.html|title=Ghostwriter at work for Virginia's assembly?|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 27, 2011|first=Anita|last=Kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|last=Graves |first=Lisa |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |title=ALEC Exposed: State Legislative Bills Drafted by Secretive Corporate-Lawmaker Coalition |location=[[New York City|New York]] |date=July 15, 2011 |series=[[Democracy Now!]] |access-date=23 April 2012 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/7/15/alec_exposed_state_legislative_bills_drafted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nichols&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nichols |first=John |date=July 13, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/161978/alec-exposed/|title=ALEC Exposed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leak has been credited with triggering critical coverage about ALEC in both left-wing and mainstream media outlets.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt; ALEC subsequently published its model bills on its website,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} although the Brookings Institution wrote in 2013 that there was &quot;reason to believe&quot; its list was incomplete.&lt;ref name=brookings/&gt;

On October 1, 2012, [[Common Cause]], a liberal [[political advocacy group]], along with the [[Center for Media and Democracy]] (CMD), filed a lawsuit under a Wisconsin open records law alleging five Republican lawmakers did not disclose whether they had used personal e-mail accounts for correspondence with ALEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_21682498/wisconsin-groups-sue-over-lawmakers-emails-contact-conservative|title=Wisconsin: Groups sue over lawmakers' emails, contact with conservative organization ALEC|agency=Associated Press|date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, a Wisconsin legislative representative had requested of ALEC in June 2012 that all correspondence be sent to his personal account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/group-sue-5-gop-lawmakers-over-email-records-c272lu2-172169791.html Groups sue 5 GOP lawmakers over email records], Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Patrick Marley, October 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to CMD, the legislators settled the suit in late October 2012, allowing their personal e-mails to be searched for such contacts and paying $2,500 in court costs as part of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prwatch.org/news/2012/10/11828/cmd-and-common-cause-prevail-open-records-lawsuit-against-alec-legislators-wiscon|title=CMD and Common Cause Prevail in Open Records Lawsuit Against ALEC Legislators in Wisconsin|publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]]|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ALEC's North Carolina state chairman Jason Saine described the organization as &quot;a resource for experts you can tap that follow a philosophy that you do from a less government viewpoint&quot;, and said, &quot;It's not just some big secretive organization that it's been portrayed.&quot;&lt;ref name=newsobserver/&gt;

==Corporate influence and allegations of lobbying activity==
===Corporate influence===
The level of influence that the ALEC private-sector members hold over its public-sector members has been controversial. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', special interests have effectively turned ALEC's lawmaker members into &quot;stealth lobbyists&quot; for conservative causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;stealth&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' has described ALEC as &quot;a dating agency for Republican state legislators and big corporations,&quot; to set rightwing legislative agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;pilkington&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Free Lance-Star]]'' has reported that ALEC had become &quot;one of Big Business's most effective lobbying tools&quot;.&lt;ref name=freelancestar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=20020610&amp;id=PfEyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6087,2665669|title=ALEC's friends bill taxpayers: Biggest industries come to control lobbying council|date=June 10, 2002|newspaper=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|page=A1|first=Hank|last=Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' described the organization as a &quot;bill laundry&quot; that &quot;offers companies substantial benefits that seem to have little to do with ideology.&quot;&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; [[Chris Taylor (legislator)|Chris Taylor]], a Democratic Wisconsin state assemblyman who attended an ALEC conference in 2013, said, &quot;In my observation, it was the corporations and the right-wing think tanks driving the agendas.

ALEC legislative members generally deny being overly influenced by the organization or its model legislation, and argue that corporate input in the drafting process helps to promote business growth.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/07/09/meet-the-new-head-of-alec-the-free-market-group-of-state-legislators/|title=Meet the new head of ALEC, the free-market group of state legislators|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 9, 2014|first=Niraj|last=Chokshi}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;ALEC is unique in the sense that it puts legislators and companies together and they create policy collectively,&quot; said [[Scott Pruitt]], then an Oklahoma state representative and ALEC task force chair.&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; [[Vance Wilkins]], a former Republican speaker of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and ALEC member, said in 2002, &quot;Just because business writes a bill doesn't make it bad. We get bills from all angles. And we still have to debate the issue.&quot;&lt;ref name=freelancestar/&gt; Whisnant, ALEC's Oregon co-chair, acknowledged in 2012 that corporations sometimes write model bills to promote their own interests and added, &quot;But that doesn't mean I'll support them.&quot;&lt;ref name=oregonian/&gt; [[Harvey Morgan]], another former Virginia delegate and ALEC member, said of ALEC conferences, &quot;You know before you go that the big-business view will prevail, and that's not necessarily bad. I still would like them to be a little more objective.&quot;&lt;ref name=freelancestar/&gt;

[[Alan Rosenthal]], a former [[Rutgers University]] [[political science]] professor and expert on state legislatures and lobbying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/alan_rosenthal_influential_new_jersey_academic_dies.html|title=Alan Rosenthal, politically influential New Jersey academic, dies|date=July 11, 2013|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|first=Matt|last=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; said in 2012, &quot;Legislators don't sit down with a quill pen and draft legislation. I think legislators should have the right to turn to wherever they want to get the ideas they prefer... I have some confidence that they're not being flimflammed.&quot;&lt;ref name=oregonian/&gt;

Experts agree that, regardless of its propriety, the ALEC model has been very effective. ''[[Bloomberg Politics]]'' reported in 2014 that ALEC had &quot;no equal&quot; in accessing conservative policymakers.&lt;ref name=dentists/&gt; Rosenthal said of ALEC, &quot;You've had the interest groups having access and sitting on other task forces, but here you've really perfected it... You've not only got them gaining access and interacting with legislators but you have them shaping policy together. It seems to me that's a pretty major advance.&quot;&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt; Edwin Bender, executive director of the nonpartisan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/05/us-usa-politics-virginia-factbox-idUSBRE9A40FC20131105|title=Factbox: Candidates, money in Virginia governor's race|work=Reuters|date=November 5, 2013|first=Ian|last=Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-29/san-jose-pension-crush-spurs-bid-to-ease-california-pacts.html|title=San Jose Pension Crush Spurs Bid to Ease California Pacts|date=November 28, 2013|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|first=Alison|last=Vekshin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Institute on Money in State Politics]], has said, &quot;What makes ALEC different is its effectiveness in not just bringing the people together but selling a piece of legislation that was written by the industry and for the industry and selling it as a piece of mainstream legislation.&quot;&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt;

=== Allegations of lobbying activity ===
In April 2012, [[Common Cause]] filed a complaint with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] objecting to ALEC's tax status as a nonprofit organization and alleged that lobbying accounted for more than 60% of its expenditures. ALEC formally denied lobbying,&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Common Cause&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advocacy-group-files-irs-complaint-152625689.html |title=Advocacy group files IRS complaint against ALEC|publisher=Associated Press|date=April 23, 2012|first=Mike|last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Delores Mertz, who had previously served as chairwoman of the ALEC board, said she was &quot;concerned about the lobbying that's going on, especially with [ALEC's] 501(c)3 status&quot;.&lt;ref name=dailybeast /&gt; Reporting on the allegations, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' compared ALEC's work to that of lobbyists, noting, &quot;part of ALEC's mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work,&quot; and that being a nonprofit rather than a lobby group allows deductibility of membership dues and freedom from disclosing the names of legislators who attend its educational seminars or the executives who give presentations to those legislators.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; William Schluter, vice chairman of the New Jersey Ethics Commission and a former Republican state senator, said of ALEC's activities, &quot;When you get right down to it, this is not different from lobbying. It is lobbying. ...Any kind of large organization that adds to public policy or has initiatives involving public policy should be disclosed—not only their name, but who is backing them.&quot;&lt;ref name=rizzo1 /&gt; According to ''[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]'' magazine, ALEC legislators often have their travel expenses paid as &quot;scholarships&quot; and are &quot;wined and dined and golf-coursed&quot; by private sector members.&lt;ref name=governing2011 /&gt; In July 2013, Common Cause submitted a supplemental brief to the IRS complaining about these practices.&lt;ref name=ccsupplemental&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=8755339 |title=Supplemental Submission IRS Whistleblower complaint on ALEC |date=July 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331201937/http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=8755339 |archive-date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC responded to the original Common Cause complaint by denying it engaged in lobbying, while saying that liberal groups were attacking ALEC because &quot;they don't have a comparable group that is as effective as ALEC in enacting policies into law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |title=Republican Group Subject of IRS Complaint on Lobbying |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-23/republican-group-subject-of-irs-complaint-on-lobbying |first=Jonathan |last=Salant |date=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015}}, the IRS investigation remained open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/07/02/alec-11alive-atlanta-report/29632701/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150709000829/http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/07/02/alec-11alive-atlanta-report/29632701/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2015|title=A charity for lawmakers?

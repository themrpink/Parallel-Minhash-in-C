==Plot==
In 1941, bugler and career soldier Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt transfers to a rifle company at [[Schofield Barracks]] on the island of [[Oahu]]. Because Prewitt was also a boxer, Captain Dana &quot;Dynamite&quot; Holmes wants him on his regimental team. Prewitt refuses because he stopped fighting after he blinded a friend. Holmes makes Prewitt's life miserable; and ultimately orders [[First Sergeant]] Milton Warden to prepare a [[court-martial]]. Warden successfully suggests doubling Prewitt's company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by other [[non-commissioned officer]]s and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio.

Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. At the club, Maggio gets into an argument with stockade Sergeant Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes.

Warden, despite warning from another sergeant, risks prison after beginning an affair with Holmes' wife, Karen. Karen's marriage to Holmes is fraught with his unfaithfulness which was exacerbated after the stillbirth of a child and Karen's subsequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him.

Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk. This results in harsh treatment at the hands of Judson.  Prewitt discovers Lorene's name is really Alma and her goal is to make enough money at the club to return to the mainland and live a proper life. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two contemplate if they have a future together.

A sergeant named Galovitch, who is a member of Holmes' boxing team, picks a fight with Prewitt. The fight is reported to Holmes who observes it without intervening. Prewitt gets the best of Galovitch, and Holmes learns Galovitch started the fight, but Holmes issues no punishment. Higher-ranking officers observe Holmes' conduct and force his resignation in lieu of a court martial.

Maggio escapes the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson. His injuries are aggravated during his escape and he dies in Prewitt's arms.  Prewitt seeks revenge against Judson and the two stab each other in a back alley.  Judson dies from his wounds and Prewitt, severely injured, goes absent without leave and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for his absence.

The captain that replaces Holmes demotes Galovitch and affirms that boxing will not be used as a pathway to promotion.

Warden tells Karen about Prewitt. Karen tells Warden that Holmes' resignation is forcing them back stateside; but Warden divulges he is not interested in becoming an officer. Karen walks away with both realizing their relationship has ended.

The [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack Pearl Harbor.]] Warden keeps his head in the chaos. That night, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is killed when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a good soldier, but a hardhead.

Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on the ship that is taking them to the mainland. Lorene tells Karen that her &quot;fiancé&quot; died heroically during the Pearl Harbor attack and was awarded a silver star (none of which is true). She names Prewitt as the fiancé, and looks at his bugle mouthpiece which she is holding. Karen recognizes the name, but stays silent. Lorene says &quot;Isn't that a silly old name?&quot;

==Production==
[[File:Frank Sinatra as Maggio From Here to Eternity.jpg|thumb|right|Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra]]
Hollywood legend has it that Frank Sinatra got the role in the film by means of his alleged [[American Mafia|Mafia]] connections, and it was the basis for a similar subplot in ''[[The Godfather]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mafia&quot;/&gt; However, that has been dismissed on several occasions by the cast and crew of the film. Director [[Fred Zinnemann]] commented that &quot;the legend about a horse's head having been cut off is pure invention, a poetic license on the part of [[Mario Puzo]], who wrote ''[[The Godfather]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mafia&quot;&gt;Sinatra 1995, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of Sinatra's casting is that his then-wife [[Ava Gardner]] persuaded studio head [[Harry Cohn]]'s wife to use her influence with him; this version is related by [[Kitty Kelley]] in her Sinatra biography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mafia&quot;/&gt;

[[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gladys George]] were offered roles, but George lost her role when the director decided he wanted to cast the female roles against type, and Crawford's demands to be filmed by her own cameraman led the studio to take a chance on Deborah Kerr, also playing against type.

[[Kim Stanley]] heavily campaigned for the role of Lorene, which later garnered an [[Academy Award]] for [[Donna Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviesplanet.com/movies/88514/from-here-to-eternity/trivia &quot;From Here to Eternity (1953).&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929103204/http://www.moviesplanet.com/movies/88514/from-here-to-eternity/trivia |date=2011-09-29 }} ''moviesplanet.com.'' Retrieved: May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The on-screen chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr may have spilled off-screen; it was alleged that the stars became [[sexual partners]] during filming.&lt;ref&gt;Buford 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Differences from the novel==
[[File:From Here To Eternity (1953) - Trailer.webm|thumb|right|270px|The film's trailer]]
Several of the novel's controversial plot points were changed or eliminated for the film to satisfy the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code Office]] and the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=hischak&gt;Hischak [https://books.google.com/books?id=vfie60kGGuAC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage 2012, p. 75.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suid&gt;Suid, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ucQeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage 2002, p. 148 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Army cooperation was necessary in order to shoot on location at Schofield Barracks, use training aircraft, and obtain military footage of Pearl Harbor for use in the film, as well as for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage 2014, pp. 130–131.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nixon&gt;Nixon, Rob. [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/133547%7C0/From-Here-to-Eternity-The-Essentials.html &quot;From Here to Eternity: The Essentials.&quot;] ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]''. Retrieved: December 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to screenwriter Daniel Taradash, both the Code Office and the Army were impressed by his script, which reduced the number of censorship problems.&lt;ref&gt;Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=K60eBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage 1992, p. 50.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In the novel, Lorene was a prostitute at a brothel, but in the film, she is a hostess at a private social club.&lt;ref name=hischak /&gt; Karen's hysterectomy in the novel was caused by the unfaithful Holmes transmitting [[gonorrhea]] to her, but in the film, her hysterectomy resulted from a miscarriage, thus avoiding the topic of venereal disease. The changes were made to meet Code Office standards.&lt;ref name=suid /&gt;
 	
In the novel, several of the enlisted men fraternize with homosexuals, and one soldier commits suicide as a result, but homosexuality is not mentioned or directly explored in the film. Again, the change was made to satisfy the Code Office.&lt;ref name=suid /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beidler [https://books.google.ca/books?id=DtoLcIjLBiYC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127#v=onepage 1998, p. 127.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. E. Smyth has written that the film's treatment of Judson's behavior towards Maggio &quot;has all the indications of sexual abuse, and therefore reintroduces the fear of homosexuality in the 1930s military that the rest of the script had to repress for obvious reasons of censorship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage 2014, pp. 139–140.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 	
In the novel, Captain Holmes ironically receives his desired promotion, and is transferred out of the company. In the film, Holmes is forced to resign from the Army under threat of court-martial for his ill-treatment of Prewitt. The Army insisted on this change, which the filmmakers reluctantly made.&lt;ref name=hischak /&gt;&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage 2014, p. 136.]&lt;/ref&gt; Director Zinnemann later complained that the scene where Holmes is reprimanded was &quot;the worst moment in the film, resembling a recruiting short&quot;,&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt; and wrote, &quot;It makes me sick every time I see it.&quot;&lt;ref name=eagan&gt;Eagan [https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&amp;pg=PA472#v=onepage 2010, p. 472.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the novel, Judson's systematic abuse of Maggio and other prisoners, including Prewitt himself at one point, is portrayed in detail. However, in the film, Maggio's abuse happens [[offscreen]], and is told only verbally to Prewitt, who remains free. The Army required that the abuse of Maggio not be shown, and that Judson's behavior towards Maggio be portrayed as &quot;a sadistic anomaly, and not as the result of Army policy, as depicted in Jones' book&quot;.&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt; The filmmakers agreed, seeing these changes as improvements.&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt;&lt;ref name=eagan /&gt; Maggio, who survives and is discharged in the novel, dies in the film,&lt;ref name=hischak /&gt; having been combined with two other prisoner characters from the novel (one of whom is killed by Judson in the novel) to add drama and make Maggio a stronger, more tragic figure.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126], [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage 2014, pp. 135–136.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=K60eBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage 1992, p. 146.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=K60eBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage 1992, p. 149.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Army was further pacified by the filmmakers' inclusion of a line suggesting that Maggio's death was partially caused by his falling off a truck during a prison break, rather than solely by Judson's beatings.&lt;ref&gt;Suid [https://books.google.com/books?id=ucQeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage 2002, pp. 145–146.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Opening to rave reviews, ''From Here to Eternity'' proved to be an instant hit with critics and public alike, the Southern California Motion Picture Council extolling: &quot;A motion picture so great in its starkly realistic and appealing drama that mere words cannot justly describe it.&quot;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' agreed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The James Jones bestseller, ''From Here to Eternity'', has become an outstanding motion picture in this smash screen adaptation. It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business. The cast names are exceptionally good, the exploitation and word-of-mouth values are topnotch, and the prospects in all playdates are very bright, whether special key bookings or general run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;Brogdon, William. [https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=Variety100&amp;reviewid=VE1117791141&amp;content=jump&amp;jump=review&amp;category=1935&amp;cs=1 &quot;Review:'From Here to Eternity{{'&quot;}}]. ''Variety'', July 29, 1953. Retrieved: January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the actors, ''Variety'' went on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Burt Lancaster, whose presence adds measurably to the marquee weight of the strong cast names, wallops the character of Top Sergeant Milton Warden, the professional soldier who wet-nurses a weak, pompous commanding officer and the GIs under him. It is a performance to which he gives depth of character as well as the muscles which had gained marquee importance for his name. Montgomery Clift, with a reputation for sensitive, three-dimensional performances, adds another to his growing list as the independent GI who refuses to join the company boxing team, taking instead the 'treatment' dished out at the C.O.'s instructions. Frank Sinatra scores a decided hit as Angelo Maggio, a violent, likeable Italo-American GI. While some may be amazed at this expression of the Sinatra talent versatility, it will come as no surprise to those who remember the few times he has had a chance to be something other than a crooner in films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' applauded Frank Sinatra, remarking, &quot;He proves he is an actor by playing the luckless Maggio with a kind of doomed gaiety that is both real and immensely touching.&quot; ''[[Newsweek]]'' also stated that, &quot;Frank Sinatra, a crooner long since turned actor, knew what he was doing when he plugged for the role of Maggio.&quot; [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' concurred, writing that the film &quot;reveals that Frank Sinatra, in the part of Mr. Clift's best friend who winds up in the stockade, is a first-rate actor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarten |first=John |date=August 8, 1953 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=52 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast agreed; [[Burt Lancaster]] commented in the book ''Sinatra: An American Legend'' that, &quot;[Sinatra's] fervour, his bitterness had something to do with the character of Maggio, but also with what he had gone through the last number of years. A sense of defeat and the whole world crashing in on him... They all came out in that performance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mafia&quot;/&gt;

Despite the rivalry between their respective characters, Sinatra and Borgnine, both from Italian roots, became lifelong friends. They corresponded each other at Christmas season interchanging cards signed Maggio and Fatso. At a [[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]] honoring Sinatra, Borgnine mockingly reprised his Fatso Judson character.

The film was number one in the United States for four weeks during September 1953 with a gross of $2,087,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=12 Biggest Pix Grossers in September Paced by 'Eternity' ('Robe' Excluded)|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 7, 1953|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety192-1953-10#page/n3/mode/1up|accessdate=September 23, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a final gross of $30.5 million equating to earnings of $12.2 million, ''From Here to Eternity'' not only became [[1953 in film|one of the highest-grossing films of 1953]], but also one of the ten highest-grossing films of the decade. Adjusted for inflation, its box office gross would exceed US$277 million in 2017 dollars.&lt;ref name =&quot;Numbers&quot;/&gt;

Despite the positive response of the critics and public, the Army was reportedly not pleased with its depiction in the finished film, and refused to let its name be used in the opening credits.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage 2014, p. 148.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy|Navy]] also banned the film from being shown to its servicemen, calling it &quot;derogatory of a sister service&quot; and a &quot;discredit to the armed services&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage 2014, p. 147.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Holden]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Stalag 17]]'', felt that Lancaster or Clift should have won. Sinatra would later comment that he thought his performance of heroin addict Frankie Machine in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' was more deserving of an Oscar than his role as Maggio.

The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Billy Wilder's unflinchingly honest look at the effects of alcoholism may have had some of its impact blunted by time, but it remains a powerful and remarkably prescient film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lost_weekend |title=The Lost Weekend (1945) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |accessdate=November 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. When Don's girlfriend Helen drops by with two tickets for a concert that day, Don suggests that Wick attend with Helen. Knowing they had disposed of all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment and thinking he has no money for more, they go to the concert.

After finding ten dollars that Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat's Bar, calling in at a liquor store to purchase two bottles of rye on the way.  Don intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train, but he loses track of time due to his drinking. When he arrives home, he sees Wick leaving and Helen saying she will stay and wait for Don. Don  sneaks back into the flat, where he hides one of his bottles of liquor and drinks the other one.

On Friday, back at Nat's Bar, Nat criticizes Don for treating Helen so badly. Don tells Nat that he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called ''The Bottle''. He recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house, where the cloakroom mixed up their coats. He and Helen struck up a romance, and he remained sober during this time. When he goes to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about him being unemployed, wondering if he is good enough for their daughter. He loses his nerve and sneaks off. She goes to his flat, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: &quot;Don the writer&quot;, whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and &quot;Don the drunk&quot; who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him.

After telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a desperate search for the other bottle from the previous night, which he knows he has hidden away somewhere. After failing to find it, he visits another bar, where he is thrown out after trying to steal from a woman's purse because he didn't have enough to pay the bill. Back in his flat, he finds the bottle he had hidden and drinks himself into a stupor.

On Saturday, Don is broke and tries to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, but the pawnshops are closed for [[Yom Kippur]]. Desperate for money, he visits a woman who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious.

On Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics' ward where nurse Bim Nolan mocks him and other guests at &quot;Hangover Plaza&quot;.  Bim offers to help cure his [[delirium tremens]], but Don refuses help and escapes while the staff are occupied with a raving, violent patient.

On Monday, Don steals a bottle of whisky from a store and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. Helen then returns.  Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she stays overnight on his couch.

On Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen's coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that he traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races to Don's apartment and interrupts him just before he is about to shoot himself. As she pleads with him, Nat arrives to return Don's typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen convinces him that &quot;Don the writer&quot; and &quot;Don the drunk&quot; are the same person. He commits to writing his novel ''The Bottle'', dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. He drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey to make it undrinkable as evidence of his resolve.

==Production and notable features==
Wilder was originally drawn to this material after having worked with [[Raymond Chandler]] on the screenplay for ''[[Double Indemnity (1944 film)|Double Indemnity]]''. Chandler was a recovering alcoholic at the time, and the stress and tumultuous relationship with Wilder during the collaboration caused him to start drinking again. Wilder made the film, in part, to try to explain Chandler to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Shadows of Suspense | work = Double Indemnity Universal Legacy Series DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios]] | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy Wilder originally wanted [[Jose Ferrer]] for the role of Don, but he turned it down.  Charles Brackett's first choice for playing Helen was [[Olivia de Havilland]], but she was involved with a lawsuit that prevented her from being in any film at that time.  It has been said that [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Jean Arthur]] were also considered for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the film was shot at Paramount studios in Hollywood. Wilder, however, insisted they shoot part of the film on location in [[New York City]] to create a distinct sense of realism. On October 1, 1944, Wilder and his small crew began filming in New York, mostly along [[Third Avenue]] in Mid-town East Manhattan. To further create a realistic atmosphere, Wilder and his crew used hidden cameras, placing them behind boxes or in the back of trucks, and capturing Milland as he walked up 3rd Avenue among actual pedestrians who were unaware a film was being made. The production also had the unprecedented permission to film inside [[Bellevue Hospital]] in the alcoholic ward, a request that would be denied to future films. After completing filming in New York, the cast and crew returned to California to resume principal photography, where they recreated several New York locations, including a replica of [[P.J. Clarke's]], a tavern often frequented by author Charles Jackson.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillips&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Gene|title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813173672|pages=76–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&amp;q=%22lost+weekend%22+%22third%22&amp;pg=PT91|accessdate=8 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

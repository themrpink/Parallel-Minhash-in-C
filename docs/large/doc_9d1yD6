===Reparations===
German reparations to Belgium for damage incurred during the [[First World War]] was set at £12.5 billion [[pounds sterling]].
In 1919 under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the area of [[Eupen-Malmedy]], along with [[Moresnet]] was transferred to Belgium. &quot;[[Neutral Moresnet]]&quot; was transferred to Belgium, as well as the [[Vennbahn]] railway. An opportunity was given to the population to &quot;oppose&quot; against the transfer by signing a petition, which gathered few signatures, in large part thanks to intimidation by local authorities, and all regions remain part of Belgium today.

Belgian requests to annex territory considered as historically theirs, from the Dutch, who were perceived as collaborators, was denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated113&quot;/&gt;

Between 1923 and 1926, Belgian and French soldiers were sent to the [[Ruhr]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] to force the German government to agree to continue reparation payments. The [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] led the [[Dawes Plan]] which allowed the German government more leniency in paying reparations.

The League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the trustee for the former [[German East Africa]] which bordered the Belgian Congo to the east. It became [[Rwanda-Urundi]] (or &quot;Ruanda-Urundi&quot;) (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Roger Louis, ''Ruanda-Urundi 1884–1919'' (Oxford U.P., 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and unsubsidised Protestant missions. As late as 1962, when independence arrived, fewer than 100 natives had gone beyond secondary school. The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium's special representative to the Trusteeship Council: &quot;The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mary T. Duarte, &quot;Education in Ruanda-Urundi, 1946–61, &quot; ''Historian'' (1995) 57#2 pp 275–84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and culture===
[[File:Godshuis Boeveriestraat.JPG|thumb|right|A historic street in Belgium]]
The [[Expressionism]] painting movement found a distinctive form in Flanders under artists like [[James Ensor]], [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Léon Spilliaert]].

Belgian [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art grew during the inter-war period. [[René Magritte]]'s first surrealist painting, ''The Lost Jockey'', appeared in 1926. [[Paul Delvaux]] was also an extremely influential painter in this genre.

[[Franco-Belgian comics|Comic strips]] became extremely popular in Belgium during the 1930s. One of the most popular comics of the 20th century, [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' first appeared in 1929. The growth of comic strips was also accompanied by a popular art movement, exemplified by [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], [[Jijé]], [[Willy Vandersteen]] and [[André Franquin]].

==World War II==

{{main|Belgium in World War II}}
Belgium tried to pursue a policy of unaligned neutrality before the war, but on May 10, 1940 the country was [[Battle of Belgium|invaded by German forces]]. In the initial attacks, the fortifications which had been constructed to protect the borders like [[Fort Eben-Emael]] and the [[K-W Line]] were captured or bypassed by German forces. On May 28, after 18 days of fighting, Belgian forces (including the commander in chief, [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]])&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the 20th Century''; editors: Derrik Mercer [et al.] London: Dorling Kindersley {{ISBN|0-7513-3006-X}}; pp. 529–31&lt;/ref&gt; surrendered. The elected government of Belgium, under [[Hubert Pierlot]], escaped to form a [[government in exile]].

===Belgian Army in the United Kingdom===
[[File:Soldiers in the Belgium Congo - NARA - 197079.jpg|thumb|right|Belgian-Congolese ''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers, 1943]]
:''See also [[Free Belgian Forces]]''

After the defeat in 1940, significant numbers of Belgian soldiers and civilians managed to escape to Britain to join the Belgian army in Exile.

Belgian soldiers formed the [[1st Belgian Infantry Brigade]], which also included a battery of soldiers from Luxembourg, more often known as the ''Brigade Piron'' after its commanding officer, [[Jean-Baptiste Piron]]. The Brigade Piron was involved in the [[D-Day|Normandy Invasion]] and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation. Belgians also served in British special forces units during the war, forming a troop of [[No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando#No. 4 Belgian Troop|No.10 Commando]] which was heavily involved in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and [[Operation Infatuate|Landings on Walcheren]]. The [[5th Special Air Service]] (SAS) was entirely made up of Belgians.

Two Belgian squadrons, amounting to over 400 pilots, served in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the war, both [[349th Squadron (Belgium)|349]] and [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350 Squadrons]], which claimed over 50 'kills'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Ready, Jefferson: McFarland, ''Forgotten Allies'' (Vol.1), (1985) pp.254&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Corvettes]] and a group of [[Minesweeper (ship)|Minesweeper]]s were also operated by the Belgians during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], comprising some 350 men in 1943&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Thomas ''Foreign Volunteers of the Allied Forces: 1939–45'' (Osprey, 1998) pp. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant contribution was made by the [[Belgian Congo]]. Congolese soldiers of the [[Force Publique]] were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. The Congo was also a vitally important economic asset to the allied powers, particularly through its exports of rubber and uranium; in fact the uranium used during the [[Manhattan Project]] – including that used for the atomic bombs dropped on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] was supplied by the Belgian firm [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] from [[Katanga Province]] in the Belgian Congo.

===Occupation 1940–44===
[[File:Breendonk046.jpg|thumb|right|The gallow at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk Concentration Camp]], near [[Mechelen]]]]
:''See also [[Belgium in World War II]], [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Government]] and [[History of the Jews in Belgium#Holocaust|The Holocaust in Belgium]]''
Belgium was run by a Germany military government between its surrender and liberation in September 1944.

The former fort at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk]], near [[Mechelen]] was requisitioned by the Nazis and used for detainment and interrogation of Jews, political prisoners and captured members of the resistance. Of the 3,500 incarcerated in Breendonk between 1940 and 1944, 1,733 died.&lt;ref&gt;N. C., ''« Breendonk, Le Mémorial ne changera pas de nom »'', dans [[Le Soir]], 6 décembre 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; About 300 people were killed in the camp itself, with at least 98 of them dying from deprivation or torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier de réflection|url=http://www.eu-tagung-osthofen.eu|accessdate=3 November 2012|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} O. Van der Wilt (conservateur du Mémorial national du fort de Breendonk), ''Le projet pédagogique du Mémorial National du Fort de Breendonk'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, nearly 70,000 Jews were living in Belgium. Of these, 46 percent were deported from the [[Mechelen transit camp]], while a further 5,034 people were deported via the Drancy internment camp (close to Paris). From the summer of 1942 until 1944, twenty-eight transports left Belgium carrying 25,257 Jews and 351 Roma to eastern Europe. Their destination was often [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp. Over the course of the war, 25,257 Jews were transported (including 5,093 children) and 352 Roma over the Mechelen-Leuven railway to concentration camps. Only 1,205 returned home alive at the end of the war.

===Resistance===
:''See also [[Belgian Resistance]] and [[Comité de Défense des Juifs|CDJ]]''
Resistance against the German occupiers of Belgium can be seen at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The [[Pierlot IV Government|Government in Exile]] dealt with resistance collectively under the name ''Armée Secrète'', however this was just a broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist ''[[Front de l'Indépendance]]'', but there was also a far-right resistance movement, the ''Légion Belge'' which comprised dissident [[Rexism|Rexists]]. However, there were also other groups like ''Groupe G'' which had no obvious political affiliation.

Resistance to the occupiers chiefly came in the form of helping allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this, for instance the [[Comet line]] which evacuated an estimated 14,000 allied airmen to [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nichol and Tony Rennell, ''Home Run: Escape from Nazi Europe'' (Penguin, 2007) pp.470&lt;/ref&gt; Sabotage was also used, and ''Group G's'' activities alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 20 million man-hours of labor to repair damages done.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Russell. The Resistance: WWII Time Life Education (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance were also instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps, for instance the attack on the ''[[Twentieth convoy]]'' to [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp.There was also significant low-level resistance, for instance in June 1941, the [[City of Brussels|City Council of Brussels]] refused to distribute [[Yellow badge|Stars of David badges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation, with one estimate putting the number at some 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;The number provided by the Museum van Deportatie en Verzet ({{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}) puts the number at 20,000 Jews, including 3,000 children. Fogelman supplies a figure of 20,000 adults ''and'' 8,000 children in hiding.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
[[File:Rexvlag.png|thumb|right|The flag of the francophone pro-Nazi [[Rexism|Rexist]] party]]
:''See also [[Rexism]], [[DeVlag]], [[Flemish National Union|VNV]] and [[Verdinaso]]''
During the period of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi political organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities before and during the war. The most significant were the Flemish [[DeVlag]] and ''Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond'' ([[Flemish National Union|VNV]])  as well as the Catholic Walloon ''[[Rexism|Rexist]]'' movement. These organisations were also fundamental to encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German army. Two divisions of the [[Waffen SS]], the Flemish [[27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck|27th SS &quot;Langemarck&quot; Division]] and the Walloon [[28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien|28th SS &quot;Wallonien&quot; Division]]. Some organisations, like [[Verdinaso]] appealed directly to Flemish separatist ideologies, though they did not become very popular.

After the war, many of those who had collaborated – including many of the guards at [[Fort Breendonk]] – were tried, imprisoned or shot.

===Allied liberation 1944–45===
Belgium was liberated late in 1944 by Allied forces, including [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], and [[United States|American]] armies, including the [[1st Belgian Infantry Brigade|Brigade Piron]]. On 3 September 1944 the Welsh Guards liberated Brussels. The [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] seized [[Antwerp]] on 4 of September 1944, and the [[First Canadian Army]] began conducting combat operations around the port that same month. Antwerp became a highly prized and heavily fought-over objective because its deep-water port was necessary to keep the allied armies supplied. The [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in October 1944 was fought primarily on Dutch soil, but with the objective of opening the way for boats to Antwerp. The port city was also the ultimate objective of German armies during the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]]  which resulted in heavy fighting on Belgian soil during the winter of 1944–5.

Following liberation, large numbers of Belgians who had remained in the country during the occupation were mobilised into the Belgian army in 57 &quot;Fusilier Battalions&quot;. 100,000 Belgians were mobilised for the allies by the end of the war.

==WWII to present==

===The &quot;Royal Question&quot;===
{{Main|Royal Question}}

Immediately after the war, [[Leopold III of Belgium|Léopold III]], who had surrendered himself to the German army in 1940, was released; however, the issue of whether he had [[treason|betrayed]] his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was concerned that he might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met [[Hitler]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to [[Lilian Baels]]) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother [[Prince Charles of Belgium|Prince Charles]] presided as regent.

A referendum was proposed in 1950 to solve the problem. However, it produced a very close result. In [[Flanders]], the electorate voted 70% in favour (&quot;Yes&quot;) of his return but [[Wallonia]] voted 58% against. Brussels also returned a 51% &quot;No&quot; vote. Although the referendum narrowly produced a favourable result for Léopold (about 57.68% in the country as a whole), the militant socialist movement in Liège, Hainaut and other urban centres incited major protests and even called a [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium|General Strike]] against his return.

Because of the possibility that the situation might escalate even further, Léopold III abdicated on July 16, 1951, in favour of his 20-year-old son [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]].

===Occupation of Germany, Korean War and EDC===
[[File:Belgische Strijdkrachten Duitsland.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the area of [[West Germany]] occupied by Belgian forces after the Second World War, known as FBA-BSD]]
After the defeat of Germany in 1945, Belgian soldiers were assigned to occupy a section of [[West Germany]], known as ''[[Belgian Forces in Germany]]'' or FBA-BSD. The last Belgian soldiers left Germany in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Des soldats belges en Allemagne 1945–2002|url=http://www.klm-mra.be/klm-new/frans/main01.php?id=../BSD-FBA/fba-fr|publisher=KLM-MRA|accessdate=13 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130115041000/http://www.klm-mra.be/klm-new/frans/main01.php?id=../BSD-FBA/fba-fr|archivedate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Defence Community]] planned in the early 1950s would have involved Belgian soldiers, as well as soldiers from [[Germany]], [[France]] and other [[Benelux]] countries. Though the planned EDC was never actually realised, it was still responsible for a major re-organisation of the Belgian army along [[US Army]] lines. Belgium was also involved in [[NATO]].

In 1950, a unit of volunteers from the Belgian army was sent to fight for the [[United Nations]] in the [[Korean War]] against [[Chinese People's Volunteers|Chinese]] and [[North Korea]]n troops. The [[Belgian United Nations Command]] (or BUNC) arrived in Korea in early 1951, and fought at several key engagements of the conflict, including at the [[Battle of the Imjin River]], [[Battle of Haktang-ni|Haktang-ni]] and [[Battle of Chatkol|Chatkol]]. BUNC was decorated and received presidential citations from both the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|United States]] and [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation|Republic of Korea]]. Over 300 Belgians were killed in action during the conflict. The last Belgian soldiers returned from Korea in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgian Forces in the Korean War (BUNC)|url=http://hendrik.atspace.com/eng/Bunc.html|publisher=hendrik.atspace.com|accessdate=13 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812093826/http://hendrik.atspace.com/eng/Bunc.html|archivedate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bud|first=Guy|title=Belgians and the Korean War|url=http://www.belgiansandthekoreanwar.co.uk/|publisher=belgiansandthekoreanwar.co.uk|accessdate=13 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516024352/http://www.belgiansandthekoreanwar.co.uk/|archivedate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benelux and Europe===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-39998-0427, Paul-Henri Spaak.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Paul-Henri Spaak]], three-times [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] and author of the [[Spaak Report]], was a staunch believer in international bodies, including the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]] and [[European Economic Community|EEC]]]]
:''See also [[Benelux]], [[Nato]], [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]] and [[European Economic Community|EEC]]''
On September 5, 1944, the [[Benelux Customs Union]] was created. It entered into force in 1948, and ceased to exist on 1 November 1960, when it was replaced by the [[Benelux Economic Union]] after a treaty signed in [[The Hague]] on February 3, 1958. The [[Benelux Parliament]] was created in 1955.

The [[Treaty of Brussels]], signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the [[NATO]] agreement, which Belgium became an official member of on April 4, 1949. The headquarters of NATO are located in [[Brussels]], and the headquarters of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] near [[Mons]].

Belgium was also one of the original founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in July 1952 and of the [[European Economic Community]] formed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] on March 25, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium and the European Union|url=http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/policy/european_union/belgium_and_the_eu/|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=18 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102011429/http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/policy/european_union/belgium_and_the_eu/|archive-date=2 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgium has been a member of the [[Schengen area]] since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/belgium/index_en.htm|work=Member Countries|publisher=European Union|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Belgian &quot;Economic Miracle&quot;===
====Marshall Plan====
The American [[Marshall Plan]] (officially named the  &quot;European Recovery Program&quot; or ERP) gave Belgium $559 million in grants from 1948 to 1951; it was not a loan and there was no repayment. A central goal of the ERP was to promote the growth of productivity along the lines of American management and labor practices. Obstacles arose which clearly limited its impact. The interest among some Belgian employers in increasing rates of productivity per worker was motivated by the rise in wage levels. But the Americans also intended to inject a new &quot;spirit of productivity&quot; in Belgian industries, which implied, among other measures, a reinforcement of structures of corporatist negotiation between the social partners at a local level. The ambitions of the American strategy therefore extended beyond the defined goal of introducing a [[Fordism|Fordist]] type of economic system with high wages, high productivity, and low prices to consumers. After the belated establishment of the Belgian Office for the Increase of Productivity in 1952, the political character of the program became apparent. By incorporating American management principles, while at the same time decoding them and adapting them to the national situation, Belgian employers' organizations and trade unions skillfully exploited their position as intermediaries in order to appropriate the &quot;modernist&quot; label that they advocated. The &quot;policy of productivity&quot; was successful for a certain time because it matched the contours of the evolution of social reforms in Belgium. This policy success, however, was rendered impotent by the failure of the economic dimension of the productivity campaigns. The Americans had in effect failed to recognize the structural importance of the major financial groups which dominated heavy industry in Belgium. By not adopting the American notions of productivity, and more generally by not carrying out any large-scale programs of innovation and investment in the key sectors that they controlled in the aftermath of the war, these holding companies greatly restricted the scope for American influence.  Consequently, it was by other means, such as the training of managers, that the American paradigms entered into Belgian economic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bertrams, &quot;Productivite Economique et Paix Sociale au sein du Plan Marshall: Les Limites de l'influence Americaine aupres des Industriels et Syndicats Belges, 1948–1960,&quot;  [Economic Productivity and Social Peace Within the Marshall Plan: the Limits of American Influence on Belgian Industrialists and Trade Unionists, 1948–60]. ''Cahiers D'histoire du Temps Présent'' 2001 (9): 191–235. Issn: 0771-6435&lt;/ref&gt;

====Growth and poverty====
During the period 1945–1975, [[Keynesian]] economic theory guided politicians throughout Western Europe and this was particularly influential in Belgium. After the war, the government cancelled Belgium's debts. It was during this period that the well-known Belgian highways were built. In addition, both the economy and the average standard of living rose significantly. As noted by [[Robert Gildea]], &quot;Social and economic policy was designed to restore liberal capitalism tempered by social reform, as prepared for during the war. Trade unions were also involved in a price and wage policy to cut inflation and this, together with the Allied use of Antwerp as the main entry point for war supplies, produced the so-called Belgian miracle of high economic growth combined with high wages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Surviving Hitler and Mussolini: daily life in occupied Europe by Robert Gildea&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study, Belgian workers by 1961 earned wages “second only to those of the French in the Common Market area,” and earned 50% more than their Italian counterparts and 40% more than their Dutch counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1961/xx/belgium.htm | title=Tony Cliff: Belgium – strike to revolution? (Spring 1961)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite postwar affluence, however, many Belgians continued to live in poverty. An organisation of several poverty action groups, known as the National Action for Security of Subsistence, claimed that more than 900,000 Belgians (about 10% of the population) lived in poverty in 1967, while in the early Seventies, a group of social scientists called the Working Group on Alternative Economics estimated that about 14.5% of the Belgian population lived in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Victor George and Roger Lawson, eds. ''Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sphere of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated during the war and had been largely agricultural since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the [[History of the European Union#The three communities|European Union]] and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.

===The Second ''&quot;School War&quot;'' 1950–59===
{{main|Second School War}}
After victory in the 1950 elections, a [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC-CVP) government came to power in Belgium. The new education minister, [[Pierre Harmel]] increased the wages of teachers in private (Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the anti-clerical [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] and [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] as a &quot;declaration of war&quot;.

When the 1954 elections brought to power a coalition of [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]], the new Education Minister, [[Leo Collard]], immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by his predecessor, founding a large number of secular schools and only permitting teachers with a diploma, forcing many priests out of the profession. These measures sparked mass protests from the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually found by the next government (a Catholic minority led by [[Gaston Eyskens]]), and the ''&quot;Schools War&quot;'' was concluded by the November 6, 1958 &quot;School Pact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michel|first=ARIES ....

===Congolese independence and the Congo Crisis===
[[File:Congo Crisis dead hostages.jpg|thumb|Belgian soldier taking cover by the corpses of dead hostages, November 1964 in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] during [[Operation Dragon Rouge]]]]
{{Main|Congo Crisis}}

After riots in the Congo in 1959, the scheduled gradual transition to independence was speeded up dramatically.  In June 1960, the [[Belgian Congo]] was replaced by the short lived [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|First Republic of Congo]], led by the democratically elected and charismatic Congolese statesman [[Patrice Lumumba]], a former political prisoner. Belgian forces withdrew, leaving the military force, the [[Force Publique]], under Congo's control. Order broke down as mutinying soldiers attacked whites who remained in the country. Belgians forces were briefly sent in to evacuate Belgian nationals and army officers.

In July 1960, the southern state of [[Katanga Province]] declared its independence, forming the [[State of Katanga]]. Katanga's bid for sovereignty was supported by Belgian mining companies and soldiers, who had considerable assets in the area. Later that month, [[United Nations]] peacekeepers were deployed to the country. During this period of anarchy, the region of [[South Kasai]] also declared independence. Faced with the possibility that the [[Soviet Union]] would attempt to use the situation to install a sympathetic regime, western powers including Belgium, supported [[Joseph Mobutu]] who installed his own, right-wing regime in the Congo. Lumumba was murdered and civil war ensued. Belgian paratroopers were again deployed to the country, this time to rescue civilian hostages captured in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] during an operation known as ''[[Operation Dragon Rouge|Dragon Rouge]]''.  At the end Mobutu emerged as the ruler of the re-unified country, which he named [[Zaire]].

===The General Strike of 1960–61===
[[File:Metingue Brussele1960a.jpg|thumb|Walloon workers demonstration in Brussels in the winter of 1960]]
:''See also [[1960–1961 Winter General Strike]]''
In December 1960, Wallonia was gripped by a general strike in response the general decline of Wallonian manufacturing but it succeeded only in Wallonia, in a period of turbulence in the aftermath of the ''Second Schools War''. The Wallonian workers demanded federalism, in addition to structural reforms. Even though the strike had been intended to be nationwide, Flemish workers appeared reluctant to support it.

The [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike|Strike]] was led by [[André Renard]], the founder of &quot;[[Renardism]]&quot; which combined militant socialism with Walloon nationalism. The historian Renée Fox described Wallonia's alienation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of the 1960s (...), a major reversal in the relationship between Flanders and Wallonia was taking place. Flanders had entered a vigorous, post–World War II period of industrialization, and a significant percentage of the foreign capital (particularly from the United States, coming into Belgium to support new industries, was being invested in Flanders. In contrast, Wallonia's coal mines and time-worn steel plants and factories were in crisis. The region had lost thousands of jobs and much investment capital. A new Dutch-speaking, upwardly mobile &quot;populist bourgeoisie&quot; was not only becoming visible and vocal in Flemish movements but also in both the local and national policy...  [The strike of December 1960 against the austerity law of [[Gaston Eyskens]] ] was replaced by a collective expression of the frustrations, anxieties, and grievances that Wallonia was experiencing in response to its altered situation, and by the demands of the newly formed [[Walloon Movement#Independentism|Walloon Popular Movement]] for...regional autonomy for Wallonia...&lt;ref&gt;Renée C.

Nationwide the economy was generally healthy with an annual growth rate of 5% in the 1960s. However old inefficient factories were being shut down in textiles and leather goods. Coal miners were angered by the closure of used-up mines. Limburg miners at the Zwartberg mine rioted in 1966 to protest its closure. Two miners were killed by police and ten were injured, while nineteen policemen were hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Els Witte and Alain Meynen|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Em8G76kbkC&amp;pg=PA280|year=2009|publisher=Asp / Vubpress / Upa|page=280|isbn=9789054875178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 a series of worldwide crises adversely affected the Belgian economy.

===The &quot;Linguistic Wars&quot;===

This Flemish resurgence has been accompanied by a corresponding shift of political power to the Flemish, who constituted the majority of the population of around 60%. An official Dutch translation of the [[Belgian constitution|constitution]] was only accepted in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deschouwer |first=Kris |title=Ethnic structure, inequality and governance of the public sector in Belgium |journal=United Nations Research Institute for National Development |date=January 2004 |url=http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/$FILE/Deschou.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614025223/http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/%24FILE/Deschou.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic wars reached a climax in 1968 with the splitting of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] along linguistic lines into the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] and [[Université Catholique de Louvain]]. The government of [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]] fell over the issue in 1968.

{{Main|State reform in Belgium}}
The successive linguistic disputes have made the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties (Liberal -right wing-, Catholic -center- and, Socialist -left wing-) all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border was determined by the first Gilson Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain [[provinces]], [[arrondissements]] and [[municipalities]] were modified (among others, [[Mouscron]] became a part of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Voeren]] became a part of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]) and [[Municipalities with language facilities|facilities]] for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second Gilson Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German language area, with [[Brussels]] as a bilingual area.

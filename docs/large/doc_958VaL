In this message, he thanked his supporters and Australia and said that he had &quot;been very well looked after&quot;. A spokesman said that his condition was improving and that he had started taking short daily walks for exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Johnson, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=a2RY_dcGiNkA&amp;refer=australia &quot;East Timor's Ramos-Horta Thanks Supporters From Hospital Bed&quot;], Bloomberg.com, 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramos-Horta was released from the Royal Darwin Hospital on 19 March, although he said that he would stay in Australia for [[physical therapy]] for &quot;a few more weeks&quot;.

Ramos-Horta is a frequent speaker, along with other Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, at [[Peacejam]] conferences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} He has served as Chairman of the Advisory Board for TheCommunity.com, a web site for peace and human rights, since 2000. In 2001 he gathered the post 9/11 statements of 28 Nobel Peace Prize Laureates on the web site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/05/ltm.17.html |publisher=CNN | date=7 February 2001 | accessdate=7 May 2010 | title=Cnn Live This Morning}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has spearheaded other peace initiatives with his fellow Nobel Laureates.

Ramos-Horta supported the [[Iraq War|U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq]] and condemned the [[anti-American]] tone of [[Opposition to the Iraq War|its detractors]] as &quot;hypocritical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://state-of-flux.blogspot.com/2005/10/jose-ramos-horta-on-iraq.html U.S. Soldiers Are The Real Heroes In Iraq], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' 17 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s he had supported the cause of [[Kurdish people in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistan.org/Articles/horta.html Jose Ramos Horta, Nobel Peace Laureate, Speaks for Leyla Zana 28 May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127063906/http://kurdistan.org/Articles/horta.html |date=27 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 Ramos-Horta stated that he would ask the [[International Criminal Court]] to investigate the [[ruling junta of Myanmar]] if they continue to detain fellow Nobel Laureate [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15688 |title=Is it Time to Take Than Shwe to International Criminal Court? |author=Arkar Moe |date=20 May 2009 |work=[[The Irrawaddy]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606190411/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15688 |archivedate=6 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by August 2010, he had softened his views on [[Myanmar]], warmly receiving the Myanmar Foreign Minister [[Nyan Win]], and said that he wanted to improve relations and seek strong commercial ties with Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-asia/2010/08/21/timor-leste-seeks-strong-commercial-ties-myanmar |title=Timor Leste seeks 'strong' commercial ties with Myanmar |date=21 August 2010 |newspaper=[[The Brunei Times]] |accessdate=4 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731151611/http://www.bt.com.bn/news-asia/2010/08/21/timor-leste-seeks-strong-commercial-ties-myanmar |archivedate=31 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramos-Horta is an early [[signatory]] of the [[International Simultaneous Policy Organization|International Simultaneous Policy (SIMPOL)]] which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues. Lucas became a signatory in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Simpol-UK&quot;&gt;[http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 About] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729182456/http://simpol.org/index.php?id=62 |date=29 July 2013 }} Simpol-UK ([[International Simultaneous Policy Organization]])&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2009, he attended the funeral of the former President of the [[Philippines]] [[Corazon Aquino]]. He was the only foreign head of state to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8184761.stm|title=Thousands attend Aquino funeral|author=|date=5 August 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2010, he attended the [[inauguration]] of [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno S. Aquino III]], the 15th [[President of the Philippines]]. He was, again, the only [[head of state]] who attended the inauguration and the first dignitary to arrive in the Philippines for the inauguration..{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The two attendances effectively solidified East Timorese-Filipino diplomatic relations, to an extent where Filipino support for East Timorese ascension to [[ASEAN]] favorably increased.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Ramos-Horta is a Member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today’s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

In August 2017, ten Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including Ramos-Horta, urged [[Saudi Arabia]] to stop the executions of 14 young people for participating in the [[2011–12 Saudi Arabian protests]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/nobel-laureates-urge-saudi-king-to-halt-14-executions Nobel laureates urge Saudi king to halt 14 executions]&quot;.

The '''River Thames''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Thames.ogg|t|ɛ|m|z}} {{respell|TEMZ|'}}), known alternatively in parts as the '''River Isis''', is a river that flows through [[southern England]] including [[London]]. At {{convert|215|mi|km}}, it is the longest river entirely in England and the [[Longest rivers of the United Kingdom|second-longest in the United Kingdom]], after the [[River Severn]].

It flows through [[Oxford]] (where it is called [[the Isis]]), [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Henley-on-Thames]] and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. The lower reaches of the river are called the [[Tideway]], derived from its long [[tidal reach]] up to [[Teddington Lock]]. It rises at [[Thames Head]] in Gloucestershire, and flows into the [[North Sea]] via the [[Thames Estuary]]. The Thames drains the whole of [[Greater London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx|title=Ordnance Survey map|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|access-date=11 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424060625/http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx|archive-date=24 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its tidal section, reaching up to Teddington Lock, includes most of its London stretch and has a rise and fall of {{convert|23|ft|0}}. Running through some of the driest parts of mainland Britain and heavily abstracted for drinking water, the Thames' discharge is low considering its length and breadth: the Severn has a discharge almost twice as large on average despite having a smaller [[drainage basin]]. In [[Scotland]], the [[River Tay|Tay]] achieves more than double the Thames' average discharge from a drainage basin that is 60% smaller.

Along its course are 45 [[navigation lock]]s with accompanying weirs. Its [[drainage basin|catchment area]] covers a large part of south-eastern and a small part of western England; the river is fed by at least [[Tributaries of the River Thames|50 named tributaries]]. The river contains over 80&amp;nbsp;islands. With its waters varying from freshwater to almost seawater, the Thames supports a variety of wildlife and has a number of adjoining [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]], with the largest being in the remaining parts of the [[North Kent Marshes]] and covering {{convert|5449|ha}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003874 South Thames Estuary And Marshes SSSI] Natural England.

The Thames, from [[Middle English]] ''Temese'', is derived from the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic Celtic]] name for the river, ''Tamesas'' (from *''tamēssa''),&lt;ref name=MalloryAdams147&gt;Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams (1947). ''The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in Latin as ''Tamesis'' and yielding modern Welsh ''Tafwys'' &quot;Thames&quot;. The name may have meant &quot;dark&quot; and can be compared to other [[cognate]]s such as Russian темно ([[Proto-Slavic]] *''tĭmĭnŭ''), [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''tamsi'' &quot;dark&quot;, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''tumsa'' &quot;darkness&quot;, [[Sanskrit]] ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'' and Welsh ''tywyll'' &quot;darkness&quot; ([[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''temeslos'') and [[Middle Irish]] ''teimen'' &quot;dark grey&quot;.&lt;ref name=MalloryAdams147 /&gt; The origin is shared by many other river names in Britain, such as the [[River Tamar]] at the border of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], several [[River Tame (disambiguation)|rivers named Tame]] in [[the Midlands]] and [[North Yorkshire]], the [[River Tavy|Tavy]] on [[Dartmoor]], the [[River Team|Team]] of the North East, the [[River Teifi|Teifi]] and [[River Teme|Teme]] of [[Wales]], the [[River Teviot|Teviot]] in the [[Scottish Borders]] and a Thames tributary the [[River Thame|Thame]].

[[Kenneth H. Jackson]] has proposed that the name of the Thames is not [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (and of unknown meaning),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth H |author-link=Kenneth H. Jackson |year=1955 |title=The Pictish Language}} in {{cite book |editor=F. T. Wainright |title=The Problem of the Picts |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Nelson |pages=129–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Peter Kitson suggested that it is Indo-European but originated before the [[Celts]] and has a name indicating &quot;muddiness&quot; from a root ''*tā-'', 'melt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kitson |first=Peter R |year=1996 |title=British and European River Names' |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=94 |pages=73–118 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-968X.1996.tb01178.x |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for the antiquity of the name 'Thames' is provided by a Roman potsherd found at Oxford, bearing the inscription ''Tamesubugus fecit'' (Tamesubugus made [this]). It is believed that Tamesubugus' name was derived from that of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Henig M. &amp; Booth P. (2000). ''Roman Oxfordshire'', pp.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; Tamese was referred to as a place, not a river in the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] (c. AD 700).

The river's name has always been pronounced with a simple ''t'' /t/; the [[Middle English]] spelling was typically ''Temese'' and the Brittonic form ''Tamesis''. A similar spelling from 1210, &quot;Tamisiam&quot;, is found in the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Ellis Sandoz |title=The Roots of Liberty: Magna Carta... |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Amagi/Liberty Fund |pages=39, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thames through [[Oxford]] is sometimes called [[the Isis]]. Historically, and especially in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, gazetteers and cartographers insisted that the entire river was correctly named the Isis from its source down to [[Dorchester on Thames]] and that only from this point, where the river meets the Thame and becomes the &quot;Thame-isis&quot; (supposedly subsequently abbreviated to Thames) should it be so called. [[Ordnance Survey]] maps still label the Thames as &quot;River Thames or Isis&quot; down to Dorchester. Since the early 20th century this distinction has been lost in common usage outside of Oxford, and some historians suggest the name ''Isis'' is nothing more than a [[Clipping (morphology)|truncation]] of ''Tamesis'', the [[Latin]] name for the Thames. Sculptures titled ''Tamesis'' and ''[[Isis]]'' by [[Anne Seymour Damer]] can be found on the [[Henley Bridge|bridge]] at [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]] (the original terracotta and plaster models were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], [[London]], in 1785. They are now on show at the [[River and Rowing Museum]] in Henley).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendal|first1=Roger|last2=Bowen|first2=Jane|last3=Wortley|first3=Laura|title=Genius &amp; Gentility: Henley in the Age of Enlightenment|date=2002|publisher=River and Rowing Museum|location=Henley-on-Thames|isbn=9780953557127|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Coates]] suggests that while the river was as a whole called the Thames, part of it, where it was too wide to ford, was called *''(p)lowonida''. This gave the name to a settlement on its banks, which became known as [[Londinium]], from the Indo-European roots *''pleu-'' &quot;flow&quot; and *''-nedi'' &quot;river&quot; meaning something like the flowing river or the wide flowing unfordable river.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coates |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Coates |year=1998 |title=A new explanation of the name of London |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=203–229 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For merchant seamen, the Thames has long been just the &quot;London River&quot;. Londoners often refer to it simply as &quot;the river&quot; in expressions such as &quot;south of the river&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage Resources (2005). ''[http://chr.org.uk/legends.htm Legendary Origins and the Origin of London's place name] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709082221/http://www.chr.org.uk/legends.htm |date=9 July 2011 }}''.

The river gives its name to three informal areas: the [[Thames Valley]], a region of England around the river between Oxford and West London; the [[Thames Gateway]]; and the greatly overlapping [[Thames Estuary]] around the tidal Thames to the east of London and including the waterway itself. [[Thames Valley Police]] is a formal body that takes its name from the river, covering three [[Counties of England|counties]]. In non-administrative use, the river's name is used in those of [[Thames Valley University]], [[Thames Water]], [[Thames Television]], publishing company [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], [[Thameslink]] (north–south rail service passing through [[central London]]) and [[South Thames College]]. An example of its use in the names of historic entities is the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]].

==Administration==
The administrative powers of the [[Thames Conservancy]] to control river traffic and manage flows have been taken on, with some modifications by the [[Environment Agency]] and, in respect of the Tideway part of the river, such powers are split between the agency and the [[Port of London Authority]].

==Human activity==
The marks of human activity, in some cases dating back to [[British Iron Age|Pre-Roman Britain]], are visible at various points along the river. These include a variety of structures connected with use of the river, such as navigations, bridges and [[watermill]]s, as well as prehistoric [[burial mound]]s. A major maritime route is formed for much of its length for shipping and supplies: through the [[Port of London]] for international trade, internally along its length and by its connection to the British canal system. The river's position has put it at the centre of many events in British history, leading to it being described by [[John Burns]] as &quot;liquid history&quot;.

Two broad canals link the river to other [[river basin]]s: the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] ([[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]) and the [[Grand Union Canal]] (London to the Midlands). The Grand Union effectively bypassed the earlier, narrow and winding [[Oxford Canal]] which also remains open as a popular scenic recreational route. Three further cross-basin canals are disused but are in various stages of reconstruction: the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] (via [[Stroud]]), which operated until 1927 (to the west coast of England), the [[Wey and Arun Canal]] to [[Littlehampton]], which operated until 1871 (to the south coast), and the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]].

[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] and sailing clubs are common along the Thames, which is navigable to such vessels. [[Kayaking]] and [[canoeing]] also take place. Major annual events include the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] and [[the Boat Race]], while the Thames has been used during two [[Summer Olympic Games]]: [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] ([[Rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics|rowing]]) and [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] ([[Rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics|rowing]] and [[canoeing at the 1948 Summer Olympics|canoeing]]). Safe headwaters and reaches are a summer venue for organised swimming, which is prohibited on safety grounds in a stretch centred on [[Central London]].

The usually quoted [[river source|source]] of the Thames is at [[Thames Head]] (at {{gbmapping|ST980994}}). This is about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;As measured on Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; north of [[Kemble, Gloucestershire|Kemble]] parish church in southern [[Gloucestershire]], near the town of [[Cirencester]], in the [[Cotswolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Source |url=http://www.thamespathway.com/chapter1/the-source.aspx |publisher=THames Pathway |access-date=27 August 2020 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085612/http://www.thamespathway.com/chapter1/the-source.aspx |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Seven Springs, Gloucestershire|Seven Springs]] near [[Cheltenham]], where the [[River Churn|Churn]] (which feeds into the Thames near [[Cricklade]]) rises, is also sometimes quoted as the Thames' source,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-17858944|title=Tracing the source of the Thames|first=David|last=Bailey|date=15 May 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=12 September 2018|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085618/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-17858944|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dorothy Hart |url=http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm |title=Seven Springs and the Churn |publisher=The-river-thames.co.uk |date=9 May 2004 |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-date=16 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516000937/http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; as this location is furthest from the mouth, and adds some {{convert|14|mi|km}} to the river's length. At Seven Springs above the source is a stone with the Latin [[hexameter]] inscription &quot;Hic tuus o Tamesine pater septemgeminus fons&quot;, which means &quot;Here, O Father Thames, [is] your sevenfold source&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VCFu-2LuJgC&amp;q=%22septemgeminus+fons%22&amp;pg=PA11|title=I Never Knew That about the River Thames|first=Christopher|last=Winn|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Ebury Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780091933579|access-date=20 January 2019|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085617/https://books.google.com/books?id=_VCFu-2LuJgC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22septemgeminus+fons%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22septemgeminus+fons%22&amp;f=false|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] at Seven Springs flow throughout the year, while those at Thames Head are only seasonal (a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne]]). The Thames is the longest river entirely in England. (The [[List of rivers of the United Kingdom|longest river]] in the United Kingdom, the [[River Severn|Severn]], flows partly in [[Wales]]). However, as the River Churn, sourced at Seven Springs, is {{convert|14|mi|km}} longer than the section of the Thames from its traditional source at Thames Head to the confluence, the overall length of the Thames measured from Seven Springs, at {{convert|229|mi|km}}, is greater than the Severn's length of {{convert|220|mi|km}}. Thus, the &quot;Churn/Thames&quot; river may be regarded as the longest natural river in the United Kingdom.

The stream from Seven Springs is joined at [[Coberley]] by a longer tributary which could further increase the length of the Thames, with its source in the grounds of the [[National Star College]] at [[Ullenwood]].

The Thames flows through or alongside [[Ashton Keynes]], [[Cricklade]], [[Lechlade]], [[Oxford]], [[Abingdon-on-Thames]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Goring-on-Thames]] and [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]], [[Pangbourne]] and [[Whitchurch-on-Thames]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Wargrave]], [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]], [[Staines-upon-Thames]] and [[Egham]], [[Chertsey]], [[Shepperton]], [[Weybridge]], [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], [[Walton-on-Thames]], [[Molesey]] and [[Thames Ditton]]. The river was subject to minor redefining and widening of the main channel around Oxford, Abingdon and Marlow before 1850, since when further cuts to ease navigation have reduced distances further.

[[Molesey]] faces [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], and in [[Greater London]] the Thames passes [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Surbiton]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Teddington]], [[Twickenham]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] (with a famous view of the Thames from Richmond Hill), [[Syon House]], [[Kew]], [[Brentford]], [[Chiswick]], [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Fulham]], [[Putney]], [[Wandsworth]], [[Battersea]] and [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. In [[central London]], the river passes [[Pimlico]] and [[Vauxhall]], and then forms one of the principal axes of the city, from the [[Palace of Westminster]] to the [[Tower of London]]. At this point, it historically formed the southern boundary of the medieval city, with [[Southwark]], on the opposite bank, then being part of [[Surrey]].

Beyond central London, the river passes [[Bermondsey]], [[Wapping]], [[Shadwell]], [[Limehouse]], [[Rotherhithe]], [[Millwall]], [[Deptford]], [[Greenwich]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[New Charlton]] and [[Silvertown]], before flowing through the [[Thames Barrier]], which protects central London from flooding by [[storm surge]]s. Below the barrier, the river passes [[Woolwich]], [[Thamesmead]], [[Dagenham]], [[Erith]], [[Purfleet]], [[Dartford]], [[West Thurrock]], [[Northfleet]], [[Tilbury]] and [[Gravesend]] before entering the [[Thames Estuary]] near [[Southend-on-Sea]].

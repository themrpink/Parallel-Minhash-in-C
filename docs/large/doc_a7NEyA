===Parasitology===
{{main|Parasitology}}

Modern [[parasitology]] developed in the 19th century with accurate observations and experiments by many researchers and clinicians;&lt;ref name=ChengHistory&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheng |first=Thomas C. |title=General Parasitology |year=1973 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-170750-7 |pages=120–134|quote=The 19th century might be thought of as the genesis of modern parasitology.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term was first used in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Parasitology|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parasitology|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, James Annersley described [[amoebiasis]], protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich Lösch. [[James Paget]] discovered the intestinal nematode ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' in humans in 1835. James McConnell described the human liver fluke, ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', in 1875.&lt;ref name=Cox2004/&gt; [[Algernon Thomas]] and [[Rudolf Leuckart]] independently made the first discovery of the life cycle of a trematode, the sheep liver fluke, by experiment in 1881–1883.&lt;ref name=ChengHistory/&gt; In 1877 [[Patrick Manson]] discovered the life cycle of the [[filarioidea|filarial worms]], that cause [[lymphatic filariasis|elephantiatis]] transmitted by mosquitoes. Manson further predicted that the [[malaria]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium]]'', had a mosquito vector, and persuaded [[Ronald Ross]] to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897–1898. At the same time, [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] and others described the malaria parasite's life cycle stages in ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes. Ross was [[Nobel Prize controversies#Physiology or medicine|controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize]] for his work, while Grassi was not.&lt;ref name=Cox2004/&gt; In 1903, [[David Bruce (microbiologist)|David Bruce]] identified the protozoan parasite and the [[tsetse fly]] vector of [[African trypanosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis, Harold |authorlink=Harold Ellis (surgeon) |title=Sir David Bruce, a pioneer of tropical medicine |journal=British Journal of Hospital Medicine |volume=67 |issue=3 |page=158 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16562450 |doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.3.20624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccine===
{{further|Malaria vaccine}}

Given the importance of malaria, with some 220&amp;nbsp;million people infected annually, many attempts have been made to interrupt its transmission. Various methods of [[malaria prophylaxis]] have been tried including the use of [[antimalarial drug]]s to kill off the parasites in the blood, the eradication of its mosquito vectors with [[insecticide|organochlorine and other insecticides]], and the development of a [[malaria vaccine]]. All of these have proven problematic, with [[drug resistance]], [[insecticide resistance]] among mosquitoes, and repeated failure of vaccines as the parasite mutates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaria and Malaria Vaccine Candidates |url=https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/malaria-and-malaria-vaccine-candidates |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=11 February 2018 |date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and as of 2015 the only licensed vaccine for any parasitic disease of humans is [[RTS,S]] for ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' malaria.&lt;ref name=BBC2015&gt;{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Walsh |date=24 July 2015 |title=Malaria vaccine gets 'green light' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33641939?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_news&amp;ns_source=google_plus&amp;ns_linkname=news_central |newspaper=[[BBC]] |access-date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
{{further|Drug resistance}}

Poulin observes that the widespread [[prophylactic]] use of [[anthelmintic|anthelmintic drugs]] in domestic sheep and cattle constitutes a worldwide un[[controlled experiment]] in the life-history evolution of their parasites. The outcomes depend on whether the drugs decrease the chance of a helminth larva reaching adulthood. If so, natural selection can be expected to favour the production of eggs at an earlier age. If on the other hand the drugs mainly affects adult parasitic worms, selection could cause delayed maturity and increased [[virulence]]. Such changes appear to be under way: the nematode ''[[Teladorsagia circumcincta]]'' is changing its adult size and [[fecundity|reproductive rate]] in response to drugs.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=265–266}}

==Cultural significance==
[[File:THE CRINOLETTA DISFIGURANS AnOldParasite in aNewForm.png|thumb|upright|&quot;An Old Parasite in a New Form&quot;: an 1881 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] compares a [[crinoline|crinoletta]] [[bustle]] to a parasitic insect's [[exoskeleton]]]]

===Classical times===

In the [[classical era]], the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative: the ''parasitus'' was an [[patronage in ancient Rome|accepted role in Roman society]], in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, in return for &quot;flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matyszak |first=Philip |title=24 Hours in Ancient Rome: A Day in the Life of the People Who Lived There |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJY4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252 |year=2017 |publisher=Michael O'Mara |isbn=978-1-78243-857-1 |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Damon | first1=Cynthia | chapter=5 | title=The Mask of the Parasite: A Pathology of Roman Patronage| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEJ-aA_XQQQC | publisher=University of Michigan Press | year=1997 | page=148 | isbn=978-0472107605 | quote=A satirist seeking to portray client misery naturally focuses on the relationship with the greatest dependency, that in which a client gets his food from his patron, and for this the prefabricated persona of the parasite proved itself extremely useful.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{further|Parasitism (social offense)}}

Parasitism has [[Parasitism (social offense)|a derogatory sense]] in popular usage. According to the immunologist John Playfair,&lt;ref name=Playfair2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Playfair |first=John |title=Living with Germs: In health and disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSyDYxLPtDoC&amp;pg=PT19 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-157934-9 |page=19}} Playfair is comparing the popular usage to a biologist's view of parasitism, which he calls (heading the same page) &quot;an ancient and respectable view of life&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In everyday speech, the term 'parasite' is loaded with derogatory meaning. A parasite is a sponger, a lazy profiteer, a drain on society.&lt;ref name=Playfair2007/&gt;}}

The [[satire|satirical]] cleric [[Jonathan Swift]] refers to hyperparasitism in his 1733 poem &quot;On Poetry: A Rhapsody&quot;, comparing poets to &quot;vermin&quot; who &quot;teaze and pinch their foes&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Swift1733&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Swift, Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Swift |title=On Poetry: A Rapsody |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmIJAAAAQAAJ |year=1733 |publisher=And sold by J.

{{poemquote|The vermin only teaze and pinch
Their foes superior by an inch.
So nat'ralists observe, a flea
Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;

And these have smaller fleas to bite 'em.
And so proceeds ''[[ad infinitum]]''.

Is bit by him that comes behind:}}

===Fiction===

[[File:Parasites Katrin Alvarez.jpg|thumb|Fictional parasitism: oil painting ''Parasites'' by Katrin Alvarez, 2011]]

In [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'', and [[Dracula in popular culture|its many film adaptations]], the eponymous [[Count Dracula]] is a [[hematophagy|blood-drinking]] parasite. The critic [[Laura Otis]] argues that as a &quot;thief, seducer, creator, and mimic, Dracula is the ultimate parasite. The whole point of vampirism is sucking other people's blood—living at other people's expense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otis |first=Laura |title=Networking: Communicating with Bodies and Machines in the Nineteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEimJkOmW1kC&amp;pg=PA216 |year=2001 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=978-0-472-11213-5 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bacterial lawn 01.jpg|thumb|right|A bacterial lawn used in antibiotic resistance testing.]]
'''Bacterial lawn''' is a term used by [[microbiologist]]s to describe the appearance of [[bacteria]]l [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] when all the individual colonies on a [[Petri dish]] [[agar plate]] merge to form a field or mat of bacteria. Bacterial lawns find use in screens for [[antibiotic resistance]] and [[bacteriophage]] titering.

Bacterial lawns (often of ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'')  are also used extensively when as an assay method when using [[bacteriophage]] as tracers in studies of groundwater flow.

Although occasionally used as a synonym for [[biofilm]], the term primarily applies to the simple, clonal, unstructured mats of organisms that typically only form on laboratory growth media. Biofilms&amp;mdash;the aggregated form of [[microorganism]]s most commonly found in [[nature]]&amp;mdash; are generally more complex and diverse and marked by larger quantities of extracellular structural matrix relative to the cellular [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].

== Techniques ==
Bacterial lawns can be produced manually by evenly spreading a high amount of bacteria onto an agar plate using a sterile [[cotton swab]] or a [[Drigalski spatula]]. Alternatively an automated machine can be used such as a [[spiral plater]] where the plate is rotated and the sample is spread evenly using an automated dispenser.

'''Windows Media Player''' ('''WMP''') is a [[media player (application software)|media player]] and media library application developed by [[Microsoft]] that is used for playing [[sound reproduction|audio]], video and viewing images on personal computers running the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]], as well as on [[Pocket PC]] and [[Windows Mobile]]-based devices. Editions of Windows Media Player were also released for [[classic Mac OS]], {{nowrap|[[macOS|Mac OS X]]}} and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] but development of these has since been discontinued.

In addition to being a media player, Windows Media Player includes the ability to [[Ripping|rip]] music from and copy music to [[Compact disc|compact discs]], burn recordable discs in [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CD]] format or as data discs with playlists such as an [[MP3 CD]], synchronize content with a digital audio player (MP3 player) or other mobile devices, and enable users to purchase or rent music from a number of [[online music store]]s.

Windows Media Player replaced an earlier application called Media Player, adding features beyond simple video or audio playback.

Windows Media Player 11 is available for [[Windows XP]] and included in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]]. The default file formats are [[Windows Media Video]] (WMV), [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA), and [[Advanced Systems Format]] (ASF), and its own [[XML]] based playlist format called Windows Playlist ([[Windows Media Player Playlist|WPL]]). The player is also able to utilize a [[digital rights management]] service in the form of [[Windows Media DRM]].

Windows Media Player 12 is the most recent version of Windows Media Player. It was released on October 22, 2009 along with [[Windows 7]] and has not been made available for previous versions of Windows nor has it been updated since for [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], and [[Windows 10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LeBlanc|first=Brandon|title=Windows 7 Has Been Released to Manufacturing|url=http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2009/07/22/windows-7-has-been-released-to-manufacturing/|website=Blogging Windows|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/windows-media-player-12.aspx |title=Windows Media Player 12 - Windows 7 features |work=Windows |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922201144/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/windows-media-player-12.aspx |archivedate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These later versions of Windows instead use [[Groove Music]] (for audio) and [[Microsoft Movies &amp; TV]] (for video) as the default playback applications for most media; As of May 2020, Windows Media Player is still included as a Windows component. [[Windows RT]] does not run Windows Media Player.

==History==
[[File:Media Player v5.1 (Microsoft).jpg|thumb|Media Player 5]]
The first version of Windows Media Player appeared in 1991, when [[Windows 3.0]] with [[Windows 3.0#Windows_3.0_with_Multimedia_Extensions|Multimedia Extensions]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/32905 |title=Windows Version History
|date=September 23, 2011 |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |edition=4.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called Media Player, this component was included with &quot;Multimedia PC&quot;-compatible machines but not available for retail sale. It was capable of playing &lt;code&gt;.mmm&lt;/code&gt; animation files, and could be extended to support other formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://toastytech.com/guis/win3mme.html | title=Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions | work=Toasty Tech | accessdate=May 2, 2009 | first=Nathan | last=Lineback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used [[Media Control Interface|MCI]] to handle media files. Being a component of Windows, Media Player shows the same version number as that of the version Windows with which it was included.

Microsoft continually produced new programs to play media files. In November of the following year, [[Video for Windows]] was introduced with the ability to play [[digital video]] files in an [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] [[Container format (digital)|container format]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pctechguide.com/45DigitalVideo_Video_for_Windows.htm|title=Video for Windows
|accessdate=May 2, 2009|publisher=PC Tech Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; with codec support for [[Run-length encoding|RLE]] and [[Video1]], and support for playing uncompressed files. [[Indeo]] 3.2 was added in a later release. Video for Windows was first available as a free add-on to [[Windows 3.1]], and later integrated into [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT 4.0]]. In 1995, Microsoft released [[ActiveMovie]] with DirectX Media SDK. ActiveMovie incorporates a new way of dealing with media files, and adds support for streaming media (which the original Media Player could not handle). In 1996, ActiveMovie was renamed [[DirectShow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301631.aspx |title=DirectShow: Core Media Technology in Windows XP Empowers You to Create Custom Audio/Video Processing Components |date=July 2002 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |work=MSDN Magazine |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |first1 = Michael |last1 = Blome |first2 = Mike |last2 = Wasson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914214002/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301631.aspx |archivedate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Media Player continued to come with Windows until Windows XP, in which it was officially renamed Windows Media Player v5.1.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\system32\myplay32.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Windows XP. Microsoft Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;v5.1&quot; is the version number of Windows XP.)

In 1999, Windows Media Player's versioning broke away from that of Windows itself. Windows Media Player 6.4 came as an out-of-band update for [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows NT 4.0]] that co-existed with Media Player and became a built-in component of [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows ME]] and [[Windows XP]] with an ''mplayer2.exe'' stub allowing to use this built-in instead of newer versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224401/en-us|title=MPLAYER2.EXE Is Linked to Missing Export MSDXM.OCX|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=February 13, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314210342/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224401|archivedate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Media Player 7.0 and its successors also came in the same fashion, replacing each other but leaving Media Player and Windows Media Player 6.4 intact. [[Windows XP]] is the only operating system to have three different versions of Windows Media Player (v5.1, v6.4 and v8) side by side. All versions branded Windows Media Player (instead of simply Media Player) support DirectShow codecs. Windows Media Player version 7 was a large revamp, with a new user interface, visualizations and increased functionality. [[Windows Vista]], however, dropped older versions of Windows Media Player in favor of v11.

In 2004 Microsoft launched digital music store [[MSN Music]] for new Windows Media Player 10 to compete with Apple iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/msn-music-to-offer-free-songs/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.microsoft.com/2004/09/01/msn-launches-preview-release-of-music-download-service/ &lt;/ref&gt;
However, MSN Music was discontinued already in 2006 with the launch of [[Zune]] music players.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neowin.net/news/msn-music-shutting-down-for-zune &lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Windows Vista]], Windows Media Player supports the [[Media Foundation]] framework besides DirectShow; as such it plays certain types of media using Media Foundation as well as some types of media using DirectShow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd562786(VS.85).aspx |title=DSP Plug-in Packaging |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=[[MSDN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Media Player 12 was released with [[Windows 7]]. It included support for more media formats and added new features. With [[Windows 8]], however, the player did not receive an upgrade.

On April 16, 2012, Microsoft announced that Windows Media Player would not be included in [[Windows RT]], the line of Windows designed to run on ARM based devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx |title=Windows Announcing the Windows 8 Editions |publisher=The Windows Blog |date=April 16, 2012 |first=Brandon |last=LeBlanc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418070243/http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx |archivedate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Core playback and library functions===
Windows Media Player supports playback of audio, video and pictures, along with fast forward, reverse, file markers (if present) and variable playback speed (seek &amp; time compression/dilation introduced in WMP 9 Series). It supports local playback, streaming playback with multicast streams and progressive downloads. Items in a playlist can be skipped over temporarily at playback time without removing them from the playlist. Full keyboard-based operation is possible in the player.

Windows Media Player supports full media management, via the integrated media library introduced first in version 7, which offers cataloguing and searching of media and viewing media metadata. Media can be arranged according to album, artist, genre, date ''et al.'' Windows Media Player 9 Series introduced Quick Access Panel to browse and navigate the entire library through a menu. The Quick Access Panel was also added to the mini mode in version 10 but was entirely removed in version 11. WMP 9 Series also introduced ratings and Auto Ratings. Windows Media Player 10 introduced support for aggregating pictures, Recorded TV shows, and other media into the library. A fully featured tag editor was featured in versions 9-11 of WMP, called the Advanced Tag Editor. However, the feature was removed in Windows Media Player 12. Since WMP 9 Series, the player features dynamically updated ''Auto Playlists'' based on criteria. Auto Playlists are updated every time users open them. WMP 9 Series and later also supports ''Auto Ratings'' which automatically assigns ratings based on the number of times a song is played. Pre-populated auto playlists are included in Windows Media Player 9 Series. Custom Auto Playlists can be created only on [[Windows XP]] and later.

In Windows Media Player 11, the ''Quick Access Panel'' was removed and replaced with an Explorer-style navigation pane on the left which can be customized for each library to show the user selected media or metadata categories, with contents appearing on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnails featuring album art or other art depicting the item. Missing album art can be added directly to the placeholders in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1x1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution [[jpeg]]s). There are separate ''Tiles'', ''Icons'', ''Details'' or ''Extended Tiles'' views for ''Music'', ''Pictures'', ''Video'' and ''Recorded TV'' which can be set individually from the navigation bar. Entries for ''Pictures'' and ''Video'' show their thumbnails. Version 11 also introduced the ability to search and display results on-the-fly as characters are being entered, without waiting for ''Enter'' key to be hit. [[Incremental search]] results are refined based on further characters that are typed. ''Stacking'' allows graphical representations of how many albums there are in a specific category or folder.  The pile appears larger as the category contains more albums. The List pane includes an option to prompt the user to remove items skipped in a playlist upon save or skip them only during playback.

===Visualizations===
[[File:Windows Media Player 11 Mini-player - Visualization.png|thumb|right|Windows Media Player 11 running in mini mode (in Windows XP MCE) showing the &quot;Bars and Waves&quot; visualization]]
While playing music, Windows Media Player can show [[music visualization|visualizations]]. The current three visualizations are '''Alchemy''', which was first introduced in version 9, '''Bars and Waves''', which has been used since version 7, and '''Battery''', introduced version 8. &quot;Musical Colors&quot; was removed starting with version 9, but is retained if Windows Media Player was upgraded from version 7 or 8. Version 11 and above refrains from having the former &quot;Ambience&quot;, &quot;Particle&quot;, &quot;Plenoptic&quot;, and &quot;Spikes&quot; visualizations. The &quot;Battery&quot; visualization was similarly removed in later editions of version 12. The reason for their removal was that the visualizations do not support full screen controls (either the visualization gets shifted to the left while there is a thick black bar to the right side of the screen, that there are no full screen controls, or that the visualization have DXE Problems). More visualizations such as &quot;BlazingColors&quot;, &quot;ColorCubes&quot;, &quot;Softie the Snowman,&quot; and &quot;Yule Log&quot; used to be downloadable however, the downloads from Microsoft's website have mostly been taken down.

===Format support===
The player includes intrinsic support for [[Windows Media]] codecs and also WAV and MP3 media formats. On [[Windows XP]] and above with WMP 9 Series and later, the [[WMA Pro|Windows Media Audio Professional]] codec is included which supports multichannel audio at up to 24-bit 192&amp;nbsp;kHz resolution. Windows Media Player 11 includes the Windows Media Format 11 runtime which adds low bitrate support (below 128 kbit/s for [[WMA Pro]]), support for ripping music to ''WMA Pro 10'' and updates the original WMA to version 9.2.

Support for any media codec and container format can be added using specific [[DirectShow]] filters or [[Media Foundation]] codecs (Media Foundation codecs only in Windows Vista and later). The player will not play MP3 files that contain compressed [[ID3]] headers (&quot;tags&quot;); trying to do so results in a &quot;The input media file is invalid&quot; error message. MP3 playback support was built-in beginning with version 6.1 and audio CD playback was natively supported with version 7.

DVD playback features minus the necessary decoders were integrated into Windows Media Player 8 for [[Windows XP]]. The player activates DVD and Blu-ray playback functionality with support for menus, titles and chapters, parental controls and audio track language selection if compatible decoders are installed. MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital (AC-3) decoders were included beginning with Windows Media Player 11 on Windows Vista (Home Premium and Ultimate editions only).

Windows Media Player 12 adds native support for [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] video formats, [[Apple Lossless Audio Codec|ALAC]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio&lt;ref name=&quot;ArsWMP12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/10/hands-on-windows-media-player-12s-surprising-new-features.ars |title=Hands on: Windows Media Player 12's surprising new features |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |author=Peter Bright |work=ArsTechnica |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[3GP]]{{clarify |post-text=got no codec available for 3GP|date=November 2015}}, [[MP4]] and [[QuickTime File Format|MOV]] container formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/02/26/windows-7-rc-to-natively-support-to-mov-files |title=Windows 7 RC to natively support .mov files |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |work=Chakkaradeep Chandran |publisher=Neowin.net |date=February 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120703025255/http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/02/26/windows-7-rc-to-natively-support-to-mov-files |archivedate=July 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Media Player 12 is also able to play [[AVCHD]] formats (''.[[M2TS]]'' and ''[[.mts]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Win7CameraSupport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/E/6/5E66B27B-988B-4F50-AF3A-C2FF1E62180F/GRA-T538_WH08.pptx|title=Windows 7 next generation camera support|format=PPTX|work=Download Center|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227083315/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/E/6/5E66B27B-988B-4F50-AF3A-C2FF1E62180F/GRA-T538_WH08.pptx|archivedate=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Windows 10, Windows Media Player 12 can play [[FLAC]] , [[HEVC]], [[Advanced SubStation Alpha|ASS]] and [[SubRip]] subtitle, and [[Matroska]] container formats.

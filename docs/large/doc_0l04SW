The &quot;town center&quot; designation means while these communities may not have incorporated central governments, they do have specified boundaries surrounding the central business and residential areas for [[zoning]] purposes. The reason behind the &quot;town center&quot; designation is to cluster new development within established areas with existing infrastructure, thus discouraging [[urban sprawl]]. The implementation of the &quot;town center&quot; concept in Calvert County over the past two decades has for the most part been successful in preserving rural and agricultural areas outside the designated &quot;town centers&quot;, and stands as a key example of the [[smart growth]] planning strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecalvert.com/content/business/commercialrealestate/search/zoning_info.asp |title=Zoning Information |publisher=Calvert County Department of Economic Development |accessdate=2007-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011123941/http://www.ecalvert.com/content/business/commercialrealestate/search/zoning_info.asp |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mahātmā''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|t|m|ə|,_|-|ˈ|h|æ|t|-}}) is [[Sanskrit]] for &quot;great soul&quot;  (महात्मा ''mahātmā'': महा ''mahā'' (great) + आत्मं or आत्मन ''ātman'' [soul]). ''Mahātmā'' is similar in usage to the modern English term [[saint]] and can be translated to &quot;[[ascended master]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Mahātma |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[epithet]] is commonly applied to prominent people like [[Basava|Basaveshwara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/speech-details.php?nodeid=333|title=PM's address on the occasion of release of Commemorative Coin in honour of Mahatma Basaveshwara : Speeches : Prime Minister of India – Dr. Manmohan Singh (May 22, 2004 – 26th May 2014)|website=archivepmo.nic.in|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1105–1167), [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] (1869–1948), Munshiram (later [[Swami Shraddhananda]]) (1856–1926), [[Lalon Shah]] (1772–1890), [[Ayyankali]] (1863–1941), and [[Jyotirao Phule]] (1827–1890). It has also been historically used for a class of [[Jainism|Jain]] scholars.

==Mohandas Gandhi's title &quot;Mahatma&quot;==
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}
[[File:Mahatma-Gandhi, studio, 1931.jpg|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who is commonly referred as Mahatma in modern times|250x250px|thumb|right]]
According to some authors, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have used this title for Gandhi on 6 March 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that he was called Mahatma by the residents of Gurukul Kangadi in April 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inextlive.jagran.com/mahatma-gandhi-201210010040 और इस तरह गांधी महात्मा बन गए, 01-Oct-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and he in turn called the founder Munshiram a Mahatma (who later became [[Swami Shraddhananda]]). However, a document honoring him with the title &quot;Mahatma&quot; on 21 January 1915, in [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]], Gujarat, by [[Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta|Nautamlal Bhagvanji Mehta]] is preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gandhimuseum.org/site/sections/photo-section/ National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi]; [http://www.kamdartree.com/index.php?id=57&amp;stitle=Mahatma%20&amp;%20Kamdars KamdarTree.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This document remains the earliest record of the title &quot;Mahatma&quot; being bestowed upon Gandhi. The use of the term Mahatma in [[Jainism]] to denote a class of lay priests, has been noted since the 17th century. A Mahatma is someone who practices [[Trikaranasuddhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sankar R N|first1=Ajith|title=Ascertaining Linkages between Trikaranasuddhi and 'Tapping Spirituality as the Context of Leadership'|journal=IPE Journal of Management|date=Jul–Dec 2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–105|ssrn=2212138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Theosophy}} Theosophy&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Order of the Star in the East]] --&gt;==
The word, used in a technical sense, was popularized in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature in the late 19th century, when [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], claimed that her teachers were [[adept]]s (or Mahatmas) who reside in [[Asia]].

According to the Theosophical teachings, the Mahatmas are not disembodied beings, but highly evolved people involved in overseeing the spiritual growth of individuals and the development of civilizations. Blavatsky was the first person in modern times to claim contact with these Adepts, especially the &quot;Masters&quot; [[Koot Hoomi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]. [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote about mahātmās:&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn (1930), – p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Masters whom Theosophy presents to us are simply high-ranking students in life's school of experience. They are members of our own evolutionary group, not visitants from the celestial spheres. They are supermen only in that they have attained knowledge of the laws of life and mastery over its forces with which we are still struggling.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September and October 1880, Blavatsky visited [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]] at [[Shimla|Simla]] in northern India. Sinnett wrote ''[[The Occult World]]'' (1881) and [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

There has been a great deal of controversy concerning the existence of adepts. Blavatsky's critics have doubted the existence of her Masters.  See, for example, W. E. Coleman's &quot;exposes&quot;.

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, numerous individuals have claimed to be in contact with her Adept Teachers. These individuals have stated that they are new &quot;messengers&quot; of the Masters and they have conveyed various esoteric teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blavatskyarchives.com/latermessengers.htm Madame Blavatsky &amp; the Latter-Day Messengers of the Masters].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, various [[New Age]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and religious organizations refer to them as [[Ascended Master]]s, although their character and teachings are in several respects different from those described by Theosophical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine Light Mission==
The [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM) was a [[Contemporary Sant Mat movements|Sant Mat]]-based movement begun in India in the 1930s by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and formally incorporated in 1960. The DLM had as many as 2,000 Mahatmas, all from India or Tibet, who taught the DLM's secret meditation techniques called &quot;Knowledge&quot;.  The Mahatmas, called &quot;realized souls&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296&quot;&gt;Price, Maeve (1979): The Divine Light Mission as a social organization. (1) Sociological Review, 27, Page 279-296&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;apostles&quot;,  also served as local leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul V. Levine|Levine, Saul V.]] in {{cite book |author=Galanter, Marc |title=Cults and New Religious Movements: A Report of the American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-212-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hans Ji's death in 1966 his youngest son,  [[Prem Rawat]] (known then as Guru Maharaj Ji or Bagyogeshwar), succeeded him. The young guru appointed some new Mahatmas, including one from the United States.  In one incident, a prominent Indian Mahatma nearly beat a man to death in Detroit for throwing a pie at the guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Who in Gurus|first=Dennis |last=Bartel|page= 55|work=Harper's|date=November 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Prem Rawat replaced the Divine Light Mission organization with the Elan Vital and replaced the Mahatmas with initiators. The initiators did not have the revered status of the Mahatmas, and they were drawn mostly from Western followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296&quot;/&gt; In the 2000s, the initiators were replaced by a video in which Rawat teaches the techniques himself.

==In popular culture==
[[W. C. Fields#At Paramount|W.C. Fields]] used the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves when writing the script for ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940), in a play on both the word &quot;Mahatma&quot; and a phrase an aristocrat might use when addressing a servant, before leaving the house: &quot;My hat, my cane, Jeeves&quot;.

==Jain Mahatmas==

Among the [[Jain]]s the term  Mahatma is used for the class for scholars who are householders.

===Mahatma Hirananda of Mewad===
The Mewad Ramayana&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26670449 In pictures: Stunning Ramayana manuscript goes digital, BBC, 21 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; described as &quot;one of the most beautiful manuscripts in the world&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2014/06/13/mewar-ramayana/ The Mewar Ramayana at the British Library: How the complete digital version came to be]&lt;/ref&gt; has been digitally reunited after being split between organizations in the UK and India for over 150 years, by the British Library and CSMVS Museum in Mumbai.  The colophon states that the text,  commissioned by Acarya Jasvant for the library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar, was written by the Mahatma Hirananda,   was finished on Friday 25 November 1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages21and22.html#content  Ramayana – Pages 21 and 22 (British Library Add MS 15296-15297 and IO San 3621)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahatma Hirananda being a Jain scribe, incorporated traditional Jain scribal elements into the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages3and4.html#content  Ramayana – Pages 3 and 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain Mahatmas in the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]===
The famous [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]] often attributed to one Mohsin Fani, written around 1655 CE. is a text written in the Mughal period that describes various religions and philosophies the author encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxJgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=THE+DABIST%C3%81N,+OR+SCHOOL+OF+MANNERS&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=THE%20DABIST%C3%81N%2C%20OR%20SCHOOL%20OF%20MANNERS&amp;f=false  The Dabistán: Or, School of Manners: The Religious Beliefs, Observances, Philosophic Opinions and Social Customs of the Nations of the East, Fani Muhsin, Translated by David Shea, Anthony Troyer, Publisher, M. Walter Dunne, 1901 p. 275-276]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Section 11 is dedicated to Jainism. It states: &quot;Similar to the dervishes of both classes (Monk and [[Yati|Jatis]]) is a third sect, called Mahá-átma; group separated from the Oswal Jains, have the dress and appearance of Jatis; however, do not pluck their hair with tweezers, but cut it. They live the social life and spread the teaching of Mahavir and other Jain Trithankar in the society. They accumulate money, cook their meal in their houses, drink cold water, and take to them a wife.&quot; The term Mahatma was thus used for priests/scholars who were not celibate. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], 'Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'.

==Criticism==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] in his books&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1994), Johnson (1995) – p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that the &quot;Masters&quot; that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s. Aryel Sanat,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aryel Sanat (Miguel Angel Sanabria) is currently Adjunct Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the American University in Washington, D.C.&quot; // [https://books.google.com/books?id=0dHP2f_6k4YC&amp;dq=editions:jYIKHxJulMgC&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s About the author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurthy'' in 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti: private passion and perennial wisdom'', wrote that Johnson &quot;claims in all of his books that there were no Masters at all in early [[Theosophical Society|[Theosophical Society]]] history, &amp; that [[Helena Blavatsky|[Helena Blavatsky]]] '''invented''' them (as others had claimed she had invented her travels).&quot; Sanat wrote that Johnson &quot;'''deliberately''' ignores the main sources of evidence for their real physical existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theos-talk.com/archives/200005/tt00087.html ''Theosophy World.'']&lt;/ref&gt; What Sanat thought these were is not made quite clear.

'''Kirkstall Abbey''' is a ruined [[Cistercian]] monastery in [[Kirkstall]], north-west of [[Leeds city centre]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. It is set in a public park on the north bank of the [[River Aire]]. It was founded ''c.'' 1152. It was disestablished during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

The picturesque [[ruins]] have been drawn and painted by artists such as [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin]] and [[John Sell Cotman]].

Kirkstall Abbey was acquired by the [[Leeds Corporation]] as a gift from [[John Thomas North|Colonel North]] and opened to the public in the late 19th century. The gatehouse became a museum. Today it is part of the [[Leeds Museums &amp; Galleries]] group.

==Foundation==
[[De Lacy#Henry de Lacy.2C 4th Baron of Pontefract|Henry de Lacy]] (1070, Halton, – 1123), Lord of the manor of [[Pontefract]], 2nd [[Lordship of Bowland|Lord of Bowland]], promised to dedicate an abbey to the [[Virgin Mary]] should he survive a serious illness. He recovered and agreed to give the Abbot of [[Fountains Abbey]] land at  [[Barnoldswick]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] (now in [[Lancashire]]) on which to found a daughter abbey. [[Abbot]] Alexander with twelve Cistercian [[monks]] from Fountains went to Barnoldswick and after demolishing the existing church attempted to build the abbey on [[Henry de Lacy]]'s land. They stayed for six years but found the place inhospitable. Abbot Alexander set about finding a more suitable place for the abbey and came across a site in the heavily wooded Aire Valley occupied by hermits.&lt;ref name=vch&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |title=Houses of Cistercian monks:Kirkstall|

Alexander sought help from de Lacy who was sympathetic and helped acquire the land from William de Poitou. The monks moved from Barnoldswick to Kirkstall displacing the hermits, some of whom joined the abbey, the rest being paid to move. The buildings were mostly completed between 1152 when the monks arrived in Kirkstall and the end of Alexander's abbacy in 1182.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Kirkstall History|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/kirkstall/history/| publisher=shef.ac.uk |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millstone Grit]] for building came from [[Bramley, Leeds|Bramley]] Fall on the opposite side of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Con&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Kirkstall History Consolidation|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/kirkstall/history/consolidation/| publisher=shef.ac.uk |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==
[[File:Kirkstall Abbey Kirche Hauptschiff.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]
The English Cistercian houses, of which there are remains at [[Fountains Abbey|Fountains]], [[Rievaulx]], Kirkstall, [[Tintern]] and [[Netley]] were mainly arranged after the same plan, with slight local variations. As an example, below is the groundplan of Kirkstall Abbey, one of the best preserved.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

[[File:KirkstallAbbey.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Kirkstall Abbey]]
The church is of the Cistercian type, with a short [[chancel]] (3), and [[transept]]s (4) with three eastward [[chapel]]s to each, divided by solid walls. The building is plain, the windows are unornamented, and the [[nave]] (1) has no [[triforium]]. The windows and doorways have round heads, whereas the vaulting arches are pointed and the moldings and capitals also show early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] features.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Linstrum|first=Derek|title=Historic Architecture of Leeds|publisher=Oriel Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, the great east window was replaced with a smaller one. The tower over the crossing was made higher in the 16th century, just before dissolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The [[cloister]] to the south (5) occupies the whole length of the nave. On the east side stands the two-aisled [[chapter-house]] (7), between which and the south transept is a small [[sacristy]], and on the other side two small apartments, one of which was probably the [[parlour]] (8). Beyond this is the [[calefactory]] or day-room of the monks. Above this whole range of building runs the monks' dormitory, opening by stairs into the south transept of the church.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

On the south side of the cloister (5) there are the remains of the old refectory, running, as in Benedictine houses, from east to west, and the new refectory (12), which, with the increase of the inmates of the house, superseded it, stretching, as is usual in Cistercian houses, from north to south. Adjacent to this apartment are the remains of the kitchen, pantry and buttery. The arches of the lavatory are to be seen near the refectory entrance. The western side of the cloister is occupied by vaulted cellars, supporting on the upper story the dormitory of the [[lay brothers]] (9).{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

Extending from the south-east angle of the main group of buildings are the walls and foundations of a secondary group of buildings (17, 18). These have been identified as the hospitium or the abbot's house, but they occupy the position in which the infirmary is more usually found. The hall was a very spacious apartment, measuring 83&amp;nbsp;ft. in length by 48&amp;nbsp;ft. 9&amp;nbsp;inches in breadth, which was divided by two rows of columns. The fish-ponds lay between the monastery and the river to the south. The abbey mill was situated about 80 yards to the north-west. The millpool may be distinctly traced, together with the [[goit]] or mill stream.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}

== Dissolution and later history ==
[[File:Thomas Girtin 003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kirkstall Abbey, by [[Thomas Girtin]]]]
On 22 November 1539 the abbey was surrendered to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s commissioners in the Dissolution of the monasteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dis&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Kirkstall History Dissolution|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/kirkstall/history/dissolution/| publisher=shef.ac.uk |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded to [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1542, but reverted to the crown when Cranmer was executed in 1556.  Sir Robert Savile purchased the estate in 1584, and it remained in his family's hands for almost a hundred years.  In 1671 it passed into the hands of the Brudenell family, the [[Earl of Cardigan|Earls of Cardigan]]. Much of the stone was removed for re-use in other buildings in the area, including the steps leading to [[Leeds Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leeds nostalgia: Leeds Bridge |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/your-leeds/nostalgia/leeds-nostalgia-leeds-bridge-1-7215683 |accessdate=30 September 2018 |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century the picturesque ruins attracted artists of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and were painted by artists including [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[John Sell Cotman]] and [[Thomas Girtin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;YAS&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Celebrating 850 years of Kirkstall Abbey|url=http://www.medieval.yas.org.uk/content/kirkstall.html| publisher=Yorkshire Archaeological Society|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 the abbey was sold to [[John Thomas North|Colonel John North]], who presented it to [[Leeds City Council]]. The Council undertook a major restoration project and the abbey was opened to the public in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;IoE&quot;&gt;{{NHLE |num=1256668 |desc=Kirkstall Abbey |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Americans|African American]] novelist [[William Wells Brown]] visited Kirkstall Abbey in 1851, writing about his experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Joe|date=27 October 2020|title=Nature Prevails at Kirkstall Abbey|url=https://museumsandgalleries.leeds.gov.uk/featured/nature-kirkstall-abbey/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 October 2020|website=Leeds Museums and Galleries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using poetry and poetic language, he described the 'pensive beauty' of the desolate ruins in their 'pastoral luxuriance' showing his appreciation of British literature as well as an interest in nature and local history.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== The abbey today ==
[[File:Kirkstall Abbey Kapitelsaal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chapter house|Chapter House]] of the abbey]]
[[File:Kirkstall Abbey Kirche von Westen.jpg|thumb|right|Western Elevation of the abbey]]
The abbey is a Grade I [[listed building]] and [[Scheduled Monument|Scheduled Ancient Monument]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IoE&quot;/&gt; After a £5.5&amp;nbsp;million renovation programme there is a new visitor centre with interactive exhibits which illustrates the history of the abbey and the lives of the monks.  Entry to the Abbey itself is via the visitor centre – free of charge, but with a donation box. Occasionally, guided tours are available (free of charge).

The ''Leeds Shakespeare Festival'', performed by the [[British Shakespeare Company]], took place annually in the cloisters from 1995 until 2009. The abbey grounds are a public park, and are used for occasional events such as the annual Kirkstall Festival and the Kirkstall Fantasia open-air concerts.

On the other side of the main road, the Grade II* listed former abbey gatehouse now forms the [[Abbey House Museum]].

=== Fighting fires ===

[[File:Smokey3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Smokey Bear]] poster]]

In August 1944, to reduce the number of [[wildfire|forest fires]], the Forest Service and the [[Wartime Advertising Council]] began distributing fire education posters featuring a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The poster campaign was a success; the black bear would later be named [[Smokey Bear]], and would, for decades, be the &quot;spokesbear&quot; for the Forest Service. Smokey Bear has appeared in innumerable TV commercials; his popular catch phrase, &quot;Only YOU can prevent forest fires&quot;—later changed to wildfires—is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the United States. According to the [https://www.adcouncil.org/ Advertising Council], Smokey Bear is the most recognized icons in advertising history and has appeared almost everywhere via Public Service Announcements in print, radio, television. Smokey Bear, an icon protected by law, is jointly owned by the Forest Service, the Ad Council and the [https://www.stateforesters.org/ National Association of State Foresters].

In September 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000, to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. The report is entitled &quot;Managing the Impacts of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment: A Report to the President In Response to the Wildfires of 2000&quot;—The National Fire Plan for short. The National Fire Plan continues to be an integral part of the Forest Service today. The following are important operational features of the National Fire Plan:

*Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy: The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and the subsequent 2001 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy act as the foundation of the National Fire Plan.
*Basic Premise of the National Fire Plan: Investing now in an optimal firefighting force, hazardous fuels reduction, and overall community protection will provide for immediate protection and future cost savings.
*Funding: Initially (2001), the National Fire Plan provided for an additional $1,100,994,000 for the Forest Service for a total wildland fire management budget of $1,910,193,000. In 2008, the total amount for the Forest Service in wildland fire management (not including emergency fire suppression funding) is $1,974,276,000.

In August 2014, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, announced that the agency will have to put $400 to $500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends. The decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken, but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freking|first1=Kevin|title=MONEY ALLOCATED FOR FIGHTING FIRES TO RUN OUT|url=http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/california/2014/08/05/money-allocated-fighting-fires-run/13636869/|work=Associated Press|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia, the US Forest Services sent a contingent of firefighters. They worked alongside firefighters from other American fire departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fcztWHSqLE|title=US firefighters arrive to help with Australian fire crisis|publisher=ABC News|via=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Budget ==
Although part of the Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service receives its budget through the Subcommittee on Appropriations—Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.

The Forest Service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s, as it became the setting for the long running classic TV show ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', with storylines focusing on Lassie's adventures with various forest rangers.&lt;ref name=&quot;jcs&quot; /&gt;

The iconic collie's association with the Forest Service led to Lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the [[U.S. Senate]] and the Department of Agriculture, and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], which was dubbed by some as &quot;The Lassie Program&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jcs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the 2019 family comedy movie ''[[Playing with Fire (2019 film)|Playing With Fire]]'', [[John Cena]] plays a U.S. Forest Service firefighter who (along with his crew) watches over a group of rambunctious children while searching for their parents after rescuing them from a fire in the wilderness during a family vacation.

== Controversies ==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2016}}
The history of the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=M.A. |last=Bennett |first=Cathy |year=2003 |title=The U.S. Forest Service: Business as usual |url=https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/uop_etds/583 |department=History |publisher=University of the Pacific |place=Stockton, California |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values and resources include [[grazing]], [[Lumber|timber]], [[mining]], [[recreation]], wildlife habitat, and [[wilderness]]. Because of continuing development elsewhere, the large size of National Forests have made them ''de-facto'' wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species. In recent decades, the importance of mature forest for the [[spotted owl]] and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels.

In the 1990s, the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as [[airtanker]]s (''see'' [[U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal]]).

The policy on road building within the National Forests is another controversial issue: In 1999, President Clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the National Forests to &quot;assess their ecological, economic, and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=091000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;ttype=roadmain&amp;cid=FSE_003853&amp;position=RELATEDLINKS&amp;pname=Roadless-Home |title=Roadless Area Conservation |department=Forest Service |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration replaced this five and half years later, with a system where each state could petition the Forest Service to open forests in their territory to road building.

Some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/22/news/mn-56535 |title=Taxpayers losing money to loggers on U.S. land, Forest Service admits |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |place=Los Angeles, California |date=22 November 1997 |access-date=2009-04-03 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 draft report describing the legal basis which provides federal land managers a scope of decision making authority exceeding that of state fish and game departments has proven unexpectedly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/forest-service-tried-to-quash-paper-debunking-montana-wildlife-authority/article_91ef1437-4df9-5ea0-8667-728e6f63ae91.html |title=Forest Service tried to quash paper debunking Montana wildlife authority |last=Chaney |first=Rob |date=2017-09-25 |df=dmy-all |newspaper=[[Missoulian]] |place=Missoula, Montana |access-date=2017-09-25 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Forest Service was reprimanded by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Service had issued permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to build through parts of the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests and a right of way across the Appalachian Trail - in violation of both the National Forest Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR-LWam-121418&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wamsley |first1=Laurel |title=Quoting 'The Lorax', court pulls permit for pipeline crossing Appalachian Trail |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/14/676950106/quoting-the-lorax-court-pulls-permit-for-pipeline-crossing-appalachian-trail |accessdate=15 December 2018 |agency=NPR |date=14 Dec 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Forest''' is a classification of [[protected area|protected]] and managed [[federal lands]] in the [[United States]]. National Forests are largely [[forest]] and [[woodland]] areas owned collectively by the American people through the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and managed by the [[United States Forest Service]], a division of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. The National Forest Service is also a forestry research organization who provides financial assistance to state and local forestry industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=History &amp; Culture {{!}} US Forest Service|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/heritage|access-date=2020-10-16|website=www.fs.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Forest System was created by the [[Land Revision Act of 1891]], which was signed under the presidency of [[Benjamin Harrison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=G. M.|date=1977-01-01|title=Hour of trial: the conservation conflict in Colorado and the West, 1891--1907|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5021710|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This act took land to form National Parks in the West&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=G.

It was the result of concerted action by [[Los Angeles]]-area businessmen and property owners who were concerned by the harm being done to the watershed of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] by ranchers and miners. [[Abbot Kinney]] and forester [[Theodore Lukens]] were key spokesmen for the effort.

Timeline of Legislation: 

1897, the Organic Act was passed to protect watersheds and forests while still allowing the timber industry to continue.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

1905, congress established the US Forest Service as a division of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This agency was formed to map, maintain, and protect forests as well as provide water and timber for national benefit. Gifford Pinchot was appointed the head of the US Forest Service by President Roosevelt.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

1907, 99 million acres were added to the national forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1922, Secretary of Agriculture authorized the selling of national forest land in exchange for private land of equal value, which changed the national forest service from a conservation organization to one that focuses on the logging industry. &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1925, national forests were authorized to grant grazing permits for 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1944, the Sustained-Yield Forest Management Act was passed which encouraged the building of logging mills throughout the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1970, The National Environmental Policy Act was passed which required the environmental impact statements to be made for federal actions that may impact the environment. This allowed a legal standing to challenge the logging industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1973, the Endangered Species Act passed, giving forest advocates a legal basis to challenge logging if it threatened an endangered species.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1976, the National Forest Management Act was put into place to protect lands and ecosystems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It was to protect national forests from destructive logging practices, so Congress told the Forest System to develop regulations on the size of clearcuts, protect waterways, and restrict the rate of cutting to protect reforestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1994, the Northwest Forest Plan was announced by President Clinton to try and slow logging in old-growth forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

There have been multiple legislative acts to expand the scope of the Forests Service, as well as shrinking it, as seen in the history of section. Most currently, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] (2016-Present) has encouraged more forest products to be harvested in order to support a struggling economy. There is a plan to develop around 190 million acres of protected National Forests in order to increase logging, grazing, and energy resources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Grandoni|first=Dino|title=Analysis {{!}} The Energy 202: Forest Service sparks controversy for pushing logging, oil during pandemic|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2020/06/15/the-energy-202-forest-service-sparks-controversy-for-pushing-logging-oil-during-pandemic/5ee6835d602ff12947e8c134/|access-date=2020-10-16|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This would be done through shrinking the rules and regulations required to get permits to conduct such business. 

==Geography==
In the [[United States]] there are 155 National Forests containing almost 190 million acres (297,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/769&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=By the Numbers {{!}} US Forest Service|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/newsroom/by-the-numbers|access-date=2020-10-16|website=www.fs.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; of land. These lands comprise 8.5 percent of the total land area of the United States, an area about the size of [[Texas]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;. Some 87 percent of National Forest land lies west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the mountain ranges of the [[Western United States]]. [[Alaska]] has 12 percent of all National Forest lands&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;.

There are 1,200 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and 23 are National Historic Landmarks&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;. The National Forest system protects and manages 93 million acres of national forests&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;. The National Historic Preservation Act requires the service to identify, investigate, and protect cultural resources on the lands managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The U.S. Forest Service also manages all of the [[United States National Grassland]]s, and nearly 50% of the [[National Recreation Area|United States National Recreation Area]]s.

==Management==
[[Land management]] of these areas focuses on [[habitat conservation|conservation]], [[timber harvesting]], [[livestock]] [[grazing]], [[Drainage basin|watershed]] protection, [[wildlife]], and [[recreation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Managing the Land {{!}} US Forest Service|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land|access-date=2020-10-16|website=www.fs.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike national parks and other federal lands managed by the [[National Park Service]], extraction of natural resources from national forests is permitted, and in many cases encouraged&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. Forest products are the resources removed and harvested from national forests. They may be for  commercial or personal use such as “lumber, paper, and firewood as well as “special forest products” such as medicinal herbs, fungi, edible fruits and nuts, and other natural products”&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. However, the first-designated [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness areas]], and some of the largest, are on National Forest lands.

There are management decision conflicts between [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and [[environmentalist]]s, and natural resource extraction companies and lobbies (e.g. logging &amp; mining), over the protection and/or use of National Forest lands. These conflicts center on [[endangered species]] protection, logging of [[old-growth forest]]s, intensive [[clear cut logging]], undervalued [[stumpage]] fees, mining operations and [[mining claim]] laws, and logging/mining access road-building within National Forests. Additional conflicts arise from concerns that the [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, and forest [[understory]] are grazed by [[sheep]], cattle, and, more recently, rising numbers of [[elk]] and [[mule deer]] due to loss of [[predator]]s.

Many [[ski resort]]s and summer [[resort]]s operate on leased land in National Forests.

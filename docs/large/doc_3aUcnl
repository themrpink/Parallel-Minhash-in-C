'''Daylight saving time''' ('''DST'''), also '''daylight savings time'''{{void|Don't remove &quot;savings time&quot;. This has been discussed on the talk page and reliable sources were found for this usage.}} or '''daylight time''' (the United States and Canada) and '''summer time''' (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the spring (&quot;spring forward&quot;) and set clocks back by one hour in autumn (&quot;fall back&quot;) to return to [[standard time]]. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the autumn.

[[George Hudson (entomologist)|George Hudson]] proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895. The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] organized the first nationwide implementation starting on April 30, 1916. [[daylight saving time by country|Many countries]] have used it at various times since then, particularly since the [[1970s energy crisis]]. DST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, parts of Australia observe it, while other parts do not, and the United States observes it, while Arizona does not. Only a minority of the world's population uses DST; Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.

DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns. Computer software generally adjusts clocks automatically.

==Rationale==
[[Industrial society|Industrialized societies]] usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of [[Public transport|mass transit]], for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an [[agrarian society]]'s daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours&lt;ref name=&quot;Minnesota&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Daylight savings time |url= http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hinfo/swkly/1995-96/select/time.txt |work= Session Weekly |publisher= Minnesota House Public Information Office |year= 1991 |access-date= August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RoSPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Single/Double Summer Time policy paper |date= October 2006 |publisher= Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120913125519/http://www.rospa.com/RoadSafety/info/summertime_paper2006v2.pdf|archive-date=September 13, 2012 |url= http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/info/summertime_paper2006v2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[solar time]], which change [[season]]ally because of the Earth's [[axial tilt]]. North and south of the [[tropics]] daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in [[winter]], with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.

By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time, individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson_1895_p734&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= G.

While the times of sunrise and sunset change at roughly equal rates as the seasons change, proponents of daylight saving time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical [[Working time#Workweek structure|&quot;nine to five&quot;]] workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.snopes.com/science/daylight.asp|last= Mikkelson|first= David|title= Daylight Saving Time|website= Snopes|date= March 13, 2016|access-date= October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willett100&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= 100 years of British Summer Time |url= http://www.nmm.ac.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/british-summer-time/ |year= 2008 |publisher= National Maritime Museum |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141228021630/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/british-summer-time |archive-date= December 28, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters have also argued that DST decreases [[energy consumption]] by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is [[#Dispute over benefits and drawbacks|heavily disputed]].

The manipulation of time at higher latitudes (for example [[Iceland]], [[Nunavut]], [[Scandinavia]] or [[Alaska]]) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Bill would do away with daylight savings time in Alaska|url= http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/031702/leg_031702ala0060001.shtml|access-date= January 5, 2013|newspaper= Peninsula Clarion|date= March 17, 2002 |quote= &quot;Because of our high latitudinal location, the extremities in times for sunrise and sunset are more exaggerated for Alaska than anywhere else in the country,&quot; Lancaster said. &quot;This makes Alaska less affected by savings from daylight-saving time.&quot;|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102172846/http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/031702/leg_031702ala0060001.shtml|archive-date= November 2, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Rosenberg|first= Matt|title= Daylight Saving Time (Also Known as Daylight Savings Time)|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/daylightsavings/a/dst.htm|publisher= About|date= 2016|access-date= October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its [[time zone]], with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/11/why-daylight-saving-time-isnt-as-terrible-as-people-think/|title=Why daylight saving time isn't as terrible as people think|last=Swanson|first=Anna|date=March 11, 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Daylight saving in ancient Rome |author= Berthold |journal= The Classical Journal |volume= 13 |issue= 6 |pages= 450–451 |year= 1918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Roman timekeeping|Romans kept time]] with [[water clock]]s that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise ([[terce|''hora tertia'']]) started at 09:02 [[solar time]] and lasted 44 minutes at the winter [[solstice]], but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Daily Life in Ancient Rome: The People and the City at the Height of the Empire |author =Jérôme Carcopino |publisher =Yale University Press |chapter =The days and hours of the Roman calendar |isbn =978-0-300-00031-3 |year =1968 |author-link =Jérôme Carcopino |url =https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00carc_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century onwards, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so [[civil time]] no longer varied by season.

The relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight, and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Information for visitors |url= http://www.lordhoweisland.info/important-info.htm |publisher= Lord Howe Island Tourism Association |access-date= April 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503074945/http://www.lordhoweisland.info/important-info.htm |archive-date= May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-hour change is customary, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past. In all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally (i.e. during summer and not winter), the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring, and they are turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn. The practice, therefore, reduces the number of civil hours in the day of the springtime change, and it increases the number of civil hours in the day of the autumnal change. For a midnight change in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0. For the same clock in autumn, the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight, i.e. it would jump from 23:59:59.9 to 23:00:00.0.

In most countries that observe seasonal daylight saving time, the clock observed in winter is legally named &quot;standard time&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Time Zone Abbreviations – Worldwide List |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ |website=timeanddate.com |publisher=Time and Date AS |access-date=May 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the standardization of time zones to agree with the [[local mean time]] near the center of each region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=MacRobert |first1=Alan |title=Time in the Sky and the Amateur Astronomer |url=https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/time-in-the-sky-and-the-amateur-astronomer/ |publisher=Sky and Telescope |access-date=May 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception exists in Ireland, where its winter clock has the same offset ([[UTC±00:00]]) and legal name as that in Britain ([[Greenwich Mean Time]])—but while its summer clock also has the same offset as Britain's ([[UTC+01:00]]), its legal name is Irish Standard Time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1971/act/17/section/1/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB) |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Time Zones in Ireland |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/ireland |website=timeanddate.com |publisher=Time and Date AS |access-date=May 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to [[British Summer Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Time Zones in the United Kingdom |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/uk |website=timeanddate.com |publisher=Time and Date AS |access-date=May 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the holy month (the date of which is determined by the [[lunar calendar]] and thus moves annually with regard to the [[Gregorian calendar]]), the country's civil clocks observe [[Western European Time]] (UTC+00:00, which geographically overlaps most of the nation).

The time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions. Members of the [[European Union]] conduct a coordinated change, changing all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 [[Central European Time]] (CET), equivalent to 03:00 [[Eastern European Time]] (EET). As a result, the time differences across European time zones remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/at-what-time-should-clocks-go-forward-or-back-for-summer-time-faq-time|last= National Physical Laboratory|title= At what time should clocks go forward or back for summer time (FAQ – Time)|date= March 31, 2016|access-date= October 17, 2016|quote= The time at which summer time begins and ends is given in the relevant EU Directive and UK Statutory Instrument as 1&amp;nbsp;am.

For example, [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain Time]] is, for one hour in the autumn, zero hours ahead of [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] instead of the usual one hour ahead, and, for one hour in the spring, it is two hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of one.

The dates on which clocks change vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]], except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours for a few weeks per year. Since 1996, [[Summer time in Europe|European Summer Time]] has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.&lt;ref name=Myers /&gt; Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observed DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Baldwin |date= March 12, 2007 |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-gets-summertime-blues-as-the-clocks-go-forward-3-weeks-early-d5rjglj28bx |title= US gets summertime blues as the clocks go forward 3 weeks early |work= The Times |location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland [[Time in Chile|Chile]] observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at [[24-hour clock#Midnight 00:00 and 24:00|24:00]] local time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Historia Hora Oficial de Chile |date= October 1, 2008 |publisher= Chilean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service |language= es |url= http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries time is governed by regional jurisdictions within the country such that some jurisdictions change and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States (formerly in Brazil, etc.).{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=179–180}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/09/arizona-no-daylight-saving-time/98964644/|title= Why Arizona doesn't observe daylight-saving time|newspaper= [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From year to year, the dates on which to change clock may also move for political or social reasons. The [[Uniform Time Act of 1966]] formalized the United States' period of daylight saving time observation as lasting six months (it was previously declared locally); this period was extended to seven months in 1986, and then to eight months in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downing 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Downing |first1=Michael |title=One Hundred Years Later, the Madness of Daylight Saving Time Endures |url=http://theconversation.com/100-years-later-the-madness-of-daylight-saving-time-endures-93048 |access-date=May 14, 2020 |publisher=The Conversation |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Korch 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Korch |first1=Travers |title=The Financial History of Daylight Saving |url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/financial-history-daylight-saving-1.aspx |access-date=May 14, 2020 |publisher=Bankrate |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-58 §&amp;nbsp;110 |url= http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ058.109 |date= August 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 extension was motivated in part by lobbyists from the candy industry, seeking to increase profits by including [[Halloween]] (October 31) within the daylight saving time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=Thad |title=The Sweet Relationship Between Daylight Saving Time and Halloween |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-sweet-relationship-between-daylight-saving-time-and-halloween |access-date=May 14, 2020 |publisher=History |date=2017 |ref=Morgan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent history, Australian state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates. For example, in 2008 most states there that observed daylight saving time changed clocks forward on October 5, but [[Western Australia]] changed on October 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml |title= Implementation dates of daylight saving time within Australia |publisher= Bureau of Meteorology |date= September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and governments ==
Daylight saving has caused controversy since it began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downing-Prerau&quot;&gt;DST practices and controversies:
* {{harvp|''Spring Forward''|2005}}
* {{harvp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] argued that it enlarges &quot;the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Winston S. Churchill |title=A silent toast to William Willett |journal=Pictorial Weekly |date=April 28, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pundits have dubbed it &quot;Daylight Slaving Time&quot;.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|p=117}} Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening entertainment interests have opposed it; its initial adoption was prompted by energy crises and war.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|p=xi}}

The fate of Willett's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues. It attracted many supporters, including [[Arthur Balfour]], Churchill, [[David Lloyd George]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]], [[Edward VII]] (who used half-hour DST at Sandringham or &quot;[[Sandringham time]]&quot;), the managing director of [[Harrods]], and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition was stronger, including Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]], [[William Christie (astronomer)|William Christie]] (the [[Astronomer Royal]]), [[George Darwin]], [[Napier Shaw]] (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre owners. After many hearings, the proposal was narrowly defeated in a parliamentary committee vote in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=12–24}} The U.S. was even more skeptical; [[Andrew James Peters|Andrew Peters]] introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=72–73}}

The clock face of the figure reads &quot;ONE HOUR OF EXTRA DAYLIGHT&quot;. The bottom caption says &quot;Get Your Hoe Ready!&quot;|Retailers generally favor DST; [[United Cigar Stores]] hailed a 1918 DST bill]]

Germany led the way by starting DST ({{lang-de|[[:de:Sommerzeit|Sommerzeit]]}}) during [[World War I]] on April 30, 1916 together with [[Central Powers|its allies]] to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts. The political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21, 1916.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=51–70}} U.S. retailing and manufacturing interests led by [[Pittsburgh]] industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but they were opposed by railroads. The U.S.'s 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=80–101}}

The war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war, like Germany itself who dropped DST from 1919 to 1939 and from 1950 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/germany/berlin|title=Time Changes in Berlin Over the Years|website=timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was an exception; it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016).&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Myers|title=History of legal time in Britain|url=http://jsm28.user.srcf.net/british-time/|date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. was more typical; Congress repealed DST after 1919. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also an avid golfer like Willett, and he vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=103–110}} Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Garland|title=Ten years of daylight saving from the Pittsburgh standpoint|year=1927|publisher=Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh|oclc=30022847|url=http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/dst.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063039/http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/dst.html|archive-date=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and [[Cleveland]] to keep pace with New York.{{sfnp|''Spring Forward''|2005|pp=47–48}} Wilson's successor [[Warren G. Harding]] opposed DST as a &quot;deception&quot;, reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer. He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 8 am rather than 9 am during the summer of 1922. Some businesses followed suit, though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=115–118}}

In the UK, the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] supports a proposal to observe SDST's additional hour year-round, but that is opposed in some industries, such as postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoSPA&quot;/&gt; In some Muslim countries, DST is temporarily abandoned during [[Ramadan]] (the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner.

Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business.

=={{anchor|Mnemonic}}Terminology==
As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form ''daylight savings time'' (with an &quot;s&quot;) was already in 1978 much more common than the older form ''daylight saving time'' in American English (&quot;the change has been virtually accomplished&quot;). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. (&quot;Although ''daylight saving time'' is considered correct, ''daylight savings time'' (with an &quot;s&quot;) is commonly used.&quot;){{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|p=xv}} The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (''daylight-saving(s) time''). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms '''daylight saving''' (without &quot;time&quot;), '''daylight savings''' (without &quot;time&quot;), and '''daylight time'''.&lt;ref name=variants&gt;''Daylight saving time'' and its variants:

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using ''savings'' as the adjective—as in ''savings account'' or ''savings bond''—makes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_VmtjAU01YC&amp;pg=PA95|entry=daylight saving(s) time|dictionary=Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style|page=95|isbn=9780195135084|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal&lt;ref name=Willett /&gt; used the term ''daylight saving'', but by 1911 the term ''summer time'' replaced ''daylight saving time'' in draft legislation.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|p=22}} The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: ''Sommerzeit'' in German, ''zomertijd'' in Dutch, ''kesäaika'' in Finnish, ''horario de verano'' or ''hora de verano'' in Spanish, and ''[[w:fr:heure d'été|heure d'été]]'' in French.{{sfnp|''Seize the Daylight''|2005|pp=51–70}}

The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''British Summer Time'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''Central European Time'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').

The North American English mnemonic &quot;spring forward, fall back&quot; (also &quot;spring ahead&amp;nbsp;...&quot;, &quot;spring up&amp;nbsp;...&quot;, and &quot;...&amp;nbsp;fall behind&quot;) helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downing-Prerau&quot; /&gt;

Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005#Change to daylight saving time|2007 change to DST rules]] in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate [[Information technology|information technologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steve Lohr |title=Time change a 'mini-Y2K' in tech terms |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05daylight.html |work=New York Times |date=March 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=A. Gut |author2=L. Miclea |author3=Sz. Enyedi |author4=M. Abrudean |author5=I. Hoka |title=Database globalization in enterprise applications |book-title=2006 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics |year=2006 |pages=356–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ron Bean |url=http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Clock-2.html |title=The Clock Mini-HOWTO |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Raymond Chen |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/02/224672.aspx |title=Why does Windows keep your BIOS clock on local time? |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external [[leap second]] updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the [[tz&amp;nbsp;database]] also known as zoneinfo.

The lava caused little direct damage, but ash and sulphur dioxide spewed out over most of the country, causing three-quarters of the island's livestock to perish. In the following famine, around ten thousand people died, one-fifth of the population of Iceland. [Asimov, 1984, 152–53]{{fcn|date=August 2020}}

Other areas of Europe have known famines much more recently. France saw famines as recently as the 19th century. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, 1846–1851, caused by the failure of the potato crop over a few years, resulted in 1,000,000 dead and another 2,000,000 refugees fleeing to Britain, Australia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.

====20th century====
Famine still occurred in [[Eastern Europe]] during the 20th century. Droughts and famines in [[Imperial Russia]] are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years, with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years. Russia experienced eleven major famines between 1845 and 1922, one of the worst being the [[Russian famine of 1891–92|famine of 1891–92]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Macfarlane]]. &quot;[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-FAM.PDF The Dimension of Famine]&quot; (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian famine of 1921–22]] killed an estimated 5 million.

[[Famines in Russia and USSR|Famines continued]] in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the most notorious being the ''[[Holodomor]]'' in various parts of the country, especially the [[Volga Region|Volga]], and the Ukrainian and northern [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] SSR's during the winter of 1932–1933.

The [[Hunger Plan]], i.e. the Nazi plan to starve large sections of the Soviet population, caused the deaths of many. The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands, including Jews, totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR. This included 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory.

The 872 days of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=24841 |work=The St. Petersburg Times | title=Last Battle of Siege of Leningrad Re-Enacted |first=Irina |last=Titova |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818002907/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=24841 |archive-date=18 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine even struck in Western Europe during the [[Second World War]]. In the Netherlands, the {{Lang|nl|[[Dutch famine of 1944|Hongerwinter]]}} of 1944 killed approximately 30,000 people. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time.

Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s, new [[pesticide]]s, [[desert farming]], and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] influenced agriculture] world grain production increased by 250%. Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to [[soil contamination]], [[Soil salinity|salt accumulation due to irrigation]], [[erosion]]).

In 1994, David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), estimated the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Mario Giampietro 1994.

Other countries affected include Pakistan, Iran, and Mexico. This will eventually lead to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even while overexploiting its [[aquifers]], China has developed a grain deficit, contributing to the upward pressure on grain prices. Most of the three billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]].

After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits&amp;nbsp;– Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Pakistan. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains marginally self-sufficient.

Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, explores the ways in which [[climate change]] may affect future famines.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495–514.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future. Drawing on situations as diverse as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9 (online).&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weather induced famines in Asia during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three &quot;lines of defense&quot; that protect a community's [[food security]] from [[environmental change]]. The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as drought have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis |title=Weather shocks and agricultural commercialization in colonial tropical Africa: did cash crops alleviate social distress? |journal=World Development |volume=94 |issue=3 |date=June 2017 |pages=346–365 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.01.019 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/74029/1/Papaioannou_Weather%20shocks%20and%20agricultural_2017.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society. Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Evan D.G. |title=Food system vulnerability: Using past famines to help understand how food systems may adapt to climate change |journal=Ecological Complexity |date=December 2006 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=328–335 |doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2007.02.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, understanding how climate change may cause famines in the future requires combining both an assessment of local socio-economic and environmental factors along with [[climate models]] that predict where bad weather may occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simelton |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Fraser |first2=Evan D.G. |last3=Termansen |first3=Mette |last4=Forster |first4=Piers M. |last5=Dougill |first5=Andrew J. |title=Typologies of crop-drought vulnerability: an empirical analysis of the socio-economic factors that influence the sensitivity and resilience to drought of three major food crops in China (1961–2001) |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy |date=June 2009 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=438–452 |doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simelton |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Fraser |first2=Evan D.

Definitions of famines are based on three different categories—these include food supply-based, food consumption-based and mortality-based definitions. Some definitions of famines are:
* Blix&amp;nbsp;– Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates.{{sfn|Blix|Svensk näringsforskning|1971|p=}}
* Brown and Eckholm&amp;nbsp;– Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}
* Scrimshaw&amp;nbsp;– Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}
* Ravallion&amp;nbsp;– Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}
* Cuny&amp;nbsp;– A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}

Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the &quot;failure of exchange entitlements&quot; or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psrccaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, [[population growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14291581 |title='Top 10 culprits' for Horn of Africa hunger |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=1}}

According to a FEWSNET report, &quot;Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine | title=FEWSNET report: 260,000 people died in the Somalia famine &amp;#124; Oxfam International| date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and population pressure===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright|A child suffering extreme starvation in India, 1972]]
Thomas Malthus's ''Essay on the Principle of Population'' has made popular the theory of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]]—that many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries&lt;ref name=&quot;de Waal 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Waal |first1=Alex |title=The end of famine?

Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and [[List of epidemics|epidemic diseases]] such as the [[Black Death]] helped to cause hundreds of famines in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3609390/Poor-studies-will-always-be-with-us.html &quot;Poor studies will always be with us&quot;], ''The Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the [[Hundred Years' War]], crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html Don O'Reilly, &quot;Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orléans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109043743/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html |date=9 November 2006 }}&quot;, ''TheHistoryNet.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as [[drought]], can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the [[carrying capacity]] of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; Arizona and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.

Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.

===State-sponsored famines===
In certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine in absolute numbers]]), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government's [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture was one of the main causes of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].]]
In 1932, under the rule of the USSR, [[Ukraine]] experienced one of its largest famines when between 2.4 and 7.5 million peasants died as a result of a state sponsored famine. It was termed the [[Holodomor]], suggesting that it was a deliberate campaign of repression designed to eliminate resistance to collectivization. Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and a brutal reign of terror contributed to the widespread famine. The Soviet government continued to deny the problem and it did not provide aid to the victims nor did it accept foreign aid. Several contemporary scholars dispute the notion that the famine was deliberately inflicted by the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert William Davies|last2=Wheatcroft|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen G.

Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation occurred in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine and the government attempted to conceal it. While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 and 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the deadliest famines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title=Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers despite the strictures imposed by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes /&gt; During the 1973 [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia#Wollo famine|Wollo Famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the [[dictatorship]]s of Ethiopia and [[Sudan]] suffered massive famines, but the [[democracy]] of [[Botswana]] avoided them, despite also suffering a severe drop in national food production. In [[Somalia]], famine occurred because of a [[failed state]].

According to Amartya Sen (1999), &quot;there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy&quot;. Hasell and Roser have demonstrated that while there have been a few minor exceptions, famines rarely occur in democratic systems but are strongly correlated with [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/famines/|title=Famines|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famine prevention==
[[File:Famine in Algeria 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A starving child during the 1869 famine in [[Algeria]].]]
Relief technologies, including [[immunization]], improved [[public health]] infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impact of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from [[genocide]] campaigns, [[civil war]]s, [[agro-terrorism]], [[refugee]] flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.

Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] labelled Niger with emergency status, as well as Chad, Ethiopia, [[South Sudan]], Somalia and Zimbabwe. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html|title=Millions of people are on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa|website=Fao.org|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]'s region [[Darfur]].

[[Frances Moore Lappé]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' (1971) that vegetarian diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.

Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{refn|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot; and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with &quot;[[creative destruction]]&quot;.{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the &quot;political contract&quot; between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.

[[File:Russia Famine Saratov 1921.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. Russia, 1921.]]
The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population—adult women—lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a &quot;rebound&quot; with increased births.

Even though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958–61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983–85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.

===Overall food production===
[[File:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|right]]
Globally, the amount of food produced per person has kept rising, despite a growing world population. A local crop failure does not cause a famine unless there is also a lack of money to buy food from elsewhere. A war or political oppression can also disrupt distribution of otherwise adequate global supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2020/08/04/897804434/food-is-growing-more-plentiful-so-why-do-people-keep-warning-of-shortages Food Is Growing More Plentiful, So Why Do People Keep Warning Of Shortages?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===
{{Main|food security}}
Long term measures to improve food security, include investment in modern agriculture techniques, such as [[fertilizers]] and [[irrigation]],&lt;ref name=obama&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html &quot;Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but can also include strategic national [[food storage]].

[[World Bank]] strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 &quot;Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity |magazine=The Atlantic |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the [[Western world]], such as [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]], to the [[Indian Sub-continent]], called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing [[infrastructure]] and institutions that are in short supply in [[Africa]], such as a system of roads or public [[seed]] companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html|title=In Africa, Prosperity From Seeds Falls Short|date=10 October 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting farmers in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |date=18 June 2008 |journal=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and some rich nations press nations that depend on them for aid to cut back or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[privatization]] even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Africa&amp;nbsp;— Zambia: Fertile but hungry|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about ''WMCF'', because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613231421/http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html |date=June 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that ''WMCF'' establishes that the claim &quot;intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability&quot; is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by [[Keith Devlin]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=The Math Instinct / Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs)|year=2005|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1-56025-839-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560258391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''WMCF'' have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.

Lakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which [[intuitionist]]s and [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]]s have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]], the founder of the [[intuitionist]]/[[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, in his dissertation ''On the Foundation of Mathematics'', argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. [[Symbolic language (mathematics)|Symbolic language]] should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=712|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summing up==
''WMCF'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:
*The result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct [[conceptual metaphor]]s is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. [[Conceptual metaphor]] is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;
*[[Symbol]]ic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;
*Not transcendent, but the result of human [[evolution]] and [[culture]], to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;
*A system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;
*An open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;
*One of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.

The cognitive approach to [[formal system]]s, as described and implemented in ''WMCF'', need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as [[Edward Zalta]]'s [http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html theory of abstract objects]. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[history of ideas]].

Pyrite's metallic [[Luster (mineralogy)|luster]] and pale brass-yellow [[hue]] give it a superficial resemblance to [[gold]], hence the well-known nickname of ''fool's gold''. The color has also led to the nicknames ''brass'', ''brazzle'', and ''Brazil'', primarily used to refer to pyrite found in [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jackson, Julia A. |author2=Mehl, James |author3=Neuendorf, Klaus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA82 |via=Google Books |title=Glossary of Geology |publisher=American Geological Institute |year=2005 |page=82|isbn=9780922152766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fay, Albert H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fB4bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA103 |via=Google Books |title=A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry |publisher=United States Bureau of Mines |year=1920 |pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''pyrite'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πυρίτης λίθος}} (''pyritēs lithos''), &quot;stone or mineral which strikes fire&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|puri/ths1|πυρίτης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from {{lang|grc|πῦρ}} (''pyr''), &quot;fire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pu{{=}}r|πῦρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against [[steel]]; [[Pliny the Elder]] described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dana, James Dwight |author2=Dana, Edward Salisbury |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHS7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |title=Descriptive Mineralogy |edition=6th |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1911 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Georgius Agricola]]'s time, {{circa|1550}}, the term had become a generic term for all of the [[Pyrite group|sulfide minerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |translator1=Hoover, H.C. |translator1-link=Herbert Clark Hoover |translator2=Hoover, L.H. |translator2-link=Lou Henry Hoover |title=De re metallica |magazine=The Mining Magazine |location=London |orig-year=1912 |publisher=Dover |year=1950 |at=see footnote on p 112|title-link=De re metallica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or [[oxide]]s in [[quartz]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]], [[sedimentary rock]], and [[metamorphic rock]], as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in [[fossil]]s, but has also been identified in the [[sclerite]]s of [[Scaly-foot snail|scaly-foot gastropods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1107_031107_snailarmor.html |title=Armor-plated snail discovered in deep sea |website=news.nationalgeographic.com |access-date=2016-08-29 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. A substantial proportion of the gold is &quot;invisible gold&quot; incorporated into the pyrite (see [[Carlin-type gold deposit]]). It has been suggested that the presence of both gold and [[arsenic]] is a case of [[coupled substitution]] but as of 1997 the chemical state of the gold remained controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fleet, M.

Pyrite enjoyed brief popularity in the 16th and 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries as a source of [[Combustion|ignition]] in early [[firearm]]s, most notably the [[wheellock]], where a sample of pyrite was placed against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=Bruce|date=2003-01-01|title=An Interpretation of Firearms in the Archaeological Record in Virginia 1607-1625|url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CX2831100051/GVRL?u=lond95336&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=edf7e554|journal=Dissertations, Theses, and Masters Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite was used with [[flint|flintstone]] and a form of [[tinder]] made of [[stringybark]] by [[Kaurna people]], an [[Aboriginal Australian]] people of [[South Australia]], to start fires, long before [[British colonisation of South Australia]] around 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Schultz | first=Chester | title=Place Name Summary 6/23: Brukangga and Tindale’s uses of the word bruki| website=Adelaide Research &amp; Scholarship|publisher=[[University of Adelaide]] | date=22 October 2018 | url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/kwp/placenames/research-publ/6-23Brukangga.pdf | access-date=16 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture ''copperas'' ([[iron(II) sulfate]]). Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of [[heap leaching]]). The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate. In the 15th century, new methods of such leaching began to replace the burning of sulfur as a source of [[sulfuric acid]]. By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, it had become the dominant method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Industrial England in the Middle of the Eighteenth Century |journal=Nature |volume=83 |issue=2113 |date=1910-04-28 |pages=264–268 |doi=10.1038/083264a0|bibcode = 1910Natur..83..264. |hdl=2027/coo1.ark:/13960/t63497b2h |s2cid=34019869 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite remains in commercial use for the production of [[sulfur dioxide]], for use in such applications as the [[paper industry]], and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Thermal decomposition of pyrite into FeS ([[iron(II) sulfide]]) and elemental sulfur starts at {{cvt|540|C|||}}; at around {{cvt|700|C|||}}, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is about {{nowrap|1 atm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of extractive metallurgy |author=Rosenqvist, Terkel |edition=2nd |publisher=Tapir Academic Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-82-519-1922-7 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2mg2ine4AEC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer commercial use for pyrite is as the [[cathode]] material in [[Energizer]] brand non-rechargeable [[lithium battery|lithium batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Energizer Corporation |url=http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/lithiuml91l92_appman.pdf |title=Lithium-Iron Disulfide (Li-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) |series=Handbook and Application Manual |date=2017-09-19 |article=Cylindrical Primary Lithium [battery] |access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrite is a [[semiconductor material]] with a [[band gap]] of 0.95 [[Electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.esqsec.unibe.ch/%5Cpub%5Cpub_51.htm |title=Iron Disulfide (Pyrite) as Photovoltaic Material: Problems and Opportunities |author1=Ellmer, K. |author2=Tributsch, H. |name-list-style=amp |journal=Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Quantum Solar Energy Conversion – (QUANTSOL 2000) |date=2000-03-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115000025/http://www.esqsec.unibe.ch/pub/pub_51.htm |archive-date=2010-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure pyrite is naturally n-type, in both crystal and thin-film forms, potentially due to sulfur vacancies in the pyrite crystal structure acting as n-dopants.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Potential resolution to the doping puzzle in iron pyrite: Carrier type determination by Hall effect and thermopower |author1=Xin Zhang |author2=Mengquin Li |name-list-style=amp |journal=Physical Review Materials |volume=1 |date=2017-06-19 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.015402 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, pyrite was used as a [[Cat's-whisker detector|mineral detector]] in [[radio]] receivers, and is still used by [[crystal radio]] hobbyists. Until the [[vacuum tube]] matured, the crystal detector was the most sensitive and dependable [[detector (radio)|detector]] available—with considerable variation between mineral types and even individual samples within a particular type of mineral. Pyrite detectors occupied a midway point between [[galena]] detectors and the more mechanically complicated [[Cat's-whisker detector#Types|perikon]] mineral pairs. Pyrite detectors can be as sensitive as a modern 1N34A [[germanium]] [[diode]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSguAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |title=The Principles Underlying Radio Communication |series=Radio Pamphlet |volume=40 |department=U.S. Army Signal Corps |date=1918 |at=section&amp;nbsp;179, pp 302–305 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas H.

Pyrite is used to make [[marcasite jewelry]]. Marcasite jewelry, made from small faceted pieces of pyrite, often set in silver, was known since ancient times and was popular in the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; At the time when the term became common in jewelry making, &quot;marcasite&quot; referred to all iron sulfides including pyrite, and not to the orthorhombic FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mineral [[marcasite]] which is lighter in color, brittle and chemically unstable, and thus not suitable for jewelry making. Marcasite jewelry does not actually contain the mineral marcasite. The specimens of pyrite, when it appears as good quality crystals, are used in decoration. They are also very popular in mineral collecting. Among the sites that provide the best specimens, highlights the exploited in Navajún, La Rioja (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvo, Miguel and Sevillano, Emilia|date=1998|title=Pyrite crystals from Soria and La Rioja provinces, Spain|journal=The Mineralogical Record|volume=20|pages=451–456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] represents the main importing country with an import of around 376,000 tonnes, which resulted at 45% of total global imports. China is also the fastest growing in terms of the unroasted iron pyrites imports, with a [[Compound annual growth rate|CAGR]] of +27.8% from 2007 to 2016. In value terms, China ($47&amp;nbsp;million) constitutes the largest market for imported unroasted iron pyrites worldwide, making up 65% of global imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indexbox.io/blog/which-country-imports-the-most-unroasted-iron-pyrites-in-the-world/|title=Which Country Imports the Most Unroasted Iron Pyrites in the World? – IndexBox|website=www.indexbox.io|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland have demonstrated that FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be exfoliated into few-layers just like other two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene by a simple liquid-phase exfoliation route. This is the first study to demonstrate the production of non-layered 2D-platelets from 3D bulk FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, they have used these 2D-platelets with 20% single walled carbon-nanotube as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries, reaching a capacity of 1000 mAh/g close to the theoretical capacity of FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaur |first1=Harneet |last2=Tian |first2=Ruiyuan |last3=Roy |first3=Ahin |last4=McCrystall |first4=Mark |last5=Horváth |first5=Dominik V. |last6=Onrubia |first6=Guillermo L. |last7=Smith |first7=Ross |last8=Ruether |first8=Manuel |last9=Griffin |first9=Aideen |last10=Backes |first10=Claudia |last11=Nicolosi |first11=Valeria |last12=Coleman |first12=Jonathan N. |title=Production of Quasi-2D Platelets of Non-Layered Iron Pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by Liquid-Phase Exfoliation for High Performance Battery Electrodes |journal=ACS Nano |date=22 September 2020 |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=13418–13432 |doi=10.1021/acsnano.0c05292 |pmid=32960568 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c05292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal oxidation states for pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite==
From the perspective of classical [[inorganic chemistry]], which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite is probably best described as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S–S bonds. These [[persulfide]] units can be viewed as derived from [[hydrogen disulfide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, [[molybdenite]], [[molybdenum|Mo]]S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, features isolated sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. The mineral [[arsenopyrite]] has the formula Fe[[arsenic|As]]S. Whereas pyrite has S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunits, arsenopyrite has [AsS] units, formally derived from [[deprotonation]] of arsenothiol (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsSH). Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;[AsS]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vaughan, D. J. |author2=Craig, J. R. |title=Mineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-521-21489-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystallography==

Iron-pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the prototype compound of the [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] pyrite structure. The structure is simple [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] and was among the first [[crystal structures]] solved by [[X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=Brag1913&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bragg, W. L. |title=The structure of some crystals as indicated by their diffraction of X-rays |journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=89 |pages=248–277 |year=1913 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0083 |bibcode=1913RSPSA..89..248B |issue = 610 |jstor=93488|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the crystallographic [[space group]] ''Pa''{{overline|3}} and is denoted by the [[Zeitschrift für Kristallographie|Strukturbericht]] notation C2. Under thermodynamic standard conditions the [[lattice constant]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amounts to {{nowrap|541.87 pm}}.&lt;ref name=Birk1991&gt;{{cite journal |title = Sulfur deficiency in iron pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt;) and its consequences for band structure models |journal=Physical Review B |volume = 43 |pages = 11926–11936 |year=1991 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.43.11926 |bibcode=1991PhRvB..4311926B |issue=14 |last1=Birkholz |first1=M. |last2=Fiechter |first2=S. |last3=Hartmann |first3=A. |last4=Tributsch |first4=H. |pmid=9996968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cubic crystal system#unit cell|unit cell]] is composed of a Fe [[Bravais lattice|face-centered cubic sublattice]] into which the {{chem|S|2}} ions are embedded. (Note though that the iron atoms in the faces are not equivalent by translation alone to the iron atoms at the corners.) The pyrite structure is also used by other compounds ''MX''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of [[transition metals]] ''M'' and [[chalcogen]]s ''X'' = [[oxygen|O]], [[sulfur|S]], [[selenium|Se]] and [[tellurium|Te]]. Also certain [[pnictide|dipnictides]] with ''X'' standing for [[phosphorus|P]], [[arsenic|As]] and [[antimony|Sb]] etc. are known to adopt the pyrite structure.&lt;ref name=Bres1994&gt;{{cite journal |title = Bonding Trends in Pyrites and a Reinvestigation of the Structure of PdAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PdSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PtSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PtBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal = Z.

In the first bonding sphere, the Fe atoms are surrounded by six S nearest neighbours, towards six of the eight faces of a distorted octahedron. The material is a [[semiconductor]] and the Fe ions should be considered to be in a ''[[low spin]]'' [[divalent]] state (as shown by [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] as well as XPS), rather than a [[tetravalent]] state as the stoichiometry would suggest. The material as a whole acts as a Van Vleck [[Paramagnetism|paramagnet]], despite its low-spin divalency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Burgardt|first1=P.|last2=Seehra|first2=M. S.|date=1977-04-01|title=Magnetic susceptibility of iron pyrite (FeS2) between 4.2 and 620 K|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=22|issue=2|pages=153–156|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(77)90422-7|issn=0038-1098}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The positions of ''X'' ions in the pyrite structure may be derived from the [[fluorite]] structure, starting from a hypothetical Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure. Whereas [[fluorine|F]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occupy the centre positions of the eight subcubes of the cubic unit cell ({{frac|1|4}} {{frac|1|4}} {{frac|1|4}}) etc., the S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are shifted from these high symmetry positions along &lt;111&gt; axes to reside on (''uuu'') and symmetry-equivalent positions. Here, the parameter ''u'' should be regarded as a free atomic parameter that takes different values in different pyrite-structure compounds (iron pyrite FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: ''u''(S) = 0.385&lt;ref name=Stev1980&gt;{{cite journal|title = Experimental observation of the Effect of Crystal Field Splitting on the Electron Density Distribution of Iron Pyrite|journal = Inorg. Chem.|volume = 19|pages = 813–820|year = 1980|doi = 10.1021/ic50206a006|issue = 4|last1 = Stevens|first1 = E. D.|last2 = Delucia|first2 = M. L.|last3 = Coppens|first3 = P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The shift from fluorite ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.25 to pyrite ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.385 is rather large and creates an S–S distance that is clearly a binding one. This is not surprising as in contrast to F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; an ion S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is not a closed shell species. It is isoelectronic with a chlorine ''atom'', also undergoing pairing to form Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Both low spin Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the disulfide S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; moeties are closed shell entities, explaining the diamagnetic and semiconducting properties.

The S atoms have bonds with three Fe and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by [[crystallographic point group|point symmetry groups]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The missing [[centrosymmetry|center of inversion]] at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite. These consequences derive from the crystal electric field active at the sulfur lattice site, which causes a [[dipole#Atomic dipoles|polarisation]] of S ions in the pyrite lattice.&lt;ref name= BJPC1992&gt;{{cite journal|author = Birkholz, M. |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231101585 |title = The crystal energy of pyrite|journal = J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|volume = 4|pages = 6227–6240|year = 1992|doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/4/29/007|bibcode=1992JPCM....4.6227B|issue = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarisation can be calculated on the basis of higher-order [[Madelung constant]]s and has to be included in the calculation of the [[lattice energy]] by using a generalised [[Born–Haber cycle]]. This reflects the fact that the covalent bond in the sulfur pair is inadequately accounted for by a strictly ionic treatment.

Arsenopyrite has a related structure with heteroatomic As–S pairs rather than homoatomic ones. Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions is different from that of pyrite. Despite its name a chalcopyrite ({{chem|CuFeS|2}}) does not contain dianion pairs, but single S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; sulfide anions.

==Crystal habit==
[[File:Pyrite elbe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pyritohedron]]-shaped crystals from Italy]]
Pyrite usually forms cuboid crystals, sometimes forming in close association to form raspberry-shaped masses called [[framboid]]s. However, under certain circumstances, it can form [[Anastomosis|anastamozing]] filaments or T-shaped crystals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonev2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bonev | first1 = I.

Pyrite can also form shapes almost the same as a regular [[dodecahedron|dodecahedral]], known as pyritohedra, and this suggests an explanation for the artificial geometrical models found in Europe as early as the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;The pyritohedral form is described as a dodecahedron with [[pyritohedral symmetry]]; Dana J. et al., (1944), ''System of mineralogy'', New York, p 282&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2019}}

==Varieties==
[[Cattierite]] ([[Cobalt|Co]][[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[vaesite]] ([[Nickel|Ni]][[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are similar in their structure and belong also to the pyrite group.

Bravoite is a nickel-cobalt bearing variety of pyrite, with &gt;&amp;nbsp;50% substitution of [[nickel|Ni]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within pyrite. Bravoite is not a formally recognised mineral, and is named after the Peruvian scientist Jose J. Bravo (1874–1928).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-759.html Mindat – bravoite]. Mindat.org (2011-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing similar minerals==
It is distinguishable from [[native gold]] by its hardness, brittleness and crystal form. Natural gold tends to be anhedral (irregularly shaped), whereas pyrite comes as either cubes or multifaceted crystals. Pyrite can often be distinguished by the striations which, in many cases, can be seen on its surface. [[Chalcopyrite]] is brighter yellow with a greenish hue when wet and is softer (3.5–4 on Mohs' scale).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerals.net/mineral/sulfides/pyrite/pyrite.htm Pyrite on]. Minerals.net (2011-02-23). Retrieved on 2011-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenopyrite]] is silver white and does not become more yellow when wet.

==Hazards==
[[File:GoldinPyriteDrainage acide.JPG|thumb|A pyrite cube (center) has dissolved away from a host rock, leaving behind trace gold]]
Iron pyrite is unstable at Earth's surface: iron pyrite exposed to atmospheric oxygen  and water decomposes into [[iron oxides]] and [[sulfate]]. This process is accelerated by the action of ''[[Acidithiobacillus]]'' bacteria which oxidize pyrite to produce ferrous iron, sulfate, and protons ({{chem|H|+}}). These reactions occur more rapidly when pyrite is finely dispersed (framboidal crystals initially formed by [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms|sulfate reducing bacteria]] (SRB) in argillaceous sediments or dust from mining operations).

===Pyrite oxidation and acid mine drainage===
[[Sulfate]] released from decomposing pyrite combines with water, producing [[sulfuric acid]], leading to [[acid mine drainage]]. An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]]. 

:&lt;chem&gt;2FeS2{\scriptstyle (s)} + 7O2{\scriptstyle (g)} + 2H2O{\scriptstyle (l)} -&gt; 2Fe^{2+}{\scriptstyle (aq)} + 4SO4^{2-}{\scriptstyle (aq)} + 4H+{\scriptstyle (aq)}&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westech-inc.com/en-usa/industry-solutions/mineral-overview/acid-mine-drainage Acid Mine Drainage]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dust explosions===
Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently [[exothermic]] that underground [[coal mine]]s in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with [[spontaneous combustion]] in the mined-out areas of the mine. The solution is to [[Hermetic seal|hermetically seal]] the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen.{{citation needed|reason=the referenced book does not contain the word pyrite. And why would coal mines be relevant?&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roy, Coal Mining in Iowa, ''Coal Trade Journal'', quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=nH0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA609&amp;pg=PA613 History of Lucas County Iowa], State Historical Company, Des Moines (1881) pp. 613–615.&lt;/ref&gt;|date=November 2016}}

In modern coal mines, [[limestone]] dust is sprayed onto the exposed coal surfaces to reduce the hazard of [[dust explosion]]s. This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. In the long term, however, oxidation continues, and the [[hydrated]] [[sulfate]]s formed may exert crystallization pressure that can expand cracks in the rock and lead eventually to [[cave-in|roof fall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coal.2005.03.013 |title=Colliery and surface hazards through coal-pyrite oxidation (Pennsylvanian Sydney Coalfield, Nova Scotia, Canada) |year=2005 |last1=Zodrow |first1=E |journal=International Journal of Coal Geology |volume=64 |issue=1–2 |pages=145–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakened building materials===
Building stone containing pyrite tends to stain brown as pyrite oxidizes. This problem appears to be significantly worse if any [[marcasite]] is present.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Oliver (1918) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OksMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;pg=PA25 The Structural and Ornamental Stones of Minnesota].

==Pyritised fossils==

Pyrite and [[marcasite]] commonly occur as replacement [[pseudomorph]]s after [[fossils]] in [[black shale]] and other [[sedimentary rocks]] formed under [[Redox|reducing]] environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=D.

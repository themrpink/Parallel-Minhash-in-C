Because scientific experiments try to eliminate extraneous influences, he believes they are atypical of what goes on in nature. He suggests that the mechanistic explanations of the world that have continued from [[Laplace]] to [[Richard Dawkins]] should be replaced by an understanding that most of nature is cloud-like rather than clock-like. He regards the mind, soul and body as different aspects of the same underlying reality—&quot;dual aspect monism&quot;—writing that &quot;there is only one stuff in the world (not two—the material and the mental), but it can occur in two contrasting states (material and mental phases, a physicist might say) which explain our perception of the difference between mind and matter.&quot;{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1994|p=21}} He believes that standard physical causation cannot adequately describe the manifold ways in which things and people interact, and uses the phrase &quot;active information&quot; to describe how, when several outcomes are possible, there may be higher levels of causation that choose which one occurs.{{sfn|Sharpe|2003}}

Sometimes Christianity seems to him to be just too good to be true, but when this sort of doubt arises he says to himself, &quot;All right then, deny it,&quot; and writes that he knows this is something he could never do.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2007a|p=107}}

===On the existence of God===
Polkinghorne considers that &quot;the question of the existence of God is the single most important question we face about the nature of reality&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This and (unless noted otherwise) all subsequent quotations are from {{harvnb|Polkinghorne|1994|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotes with approval [[Anthony Kenny]]: &quot;After all, if there is no God, then God is incalculably the greatest single creation of the human imagination.&quot; He addresses the questions of &quot;Does the concept of God make sense? If so, do we have reason for believing in such a thing?&quot; He is &quot;cautious about our powers to assess coherence,&quot; pointing out that in 1900 a &quot;competent ... undergraduate could have demonstrated the 'incoherence'&quot; of quantum ideas. He suggests that &quot;the nearest analogy in the physical world [to God] would be ... the [[Quantum Vacuum]].&quot;{{sfn|Sharpe|2003}}

He suggests that God is the ultimate answer to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s great question &quot;why is there something rather than nothing?&quot; The atheist's &quot;plain assertion of the world's existence&quot; is a &quot;grossly impoverished view of reality ... [arguing that] theism explains more than a reductionist atheism can ever address.&quot; He is very doubtful of [[St Anselm]]'s [[Ontological Argument]]. Referring to [[Gödel's incompleteness theory]], he said: &quot;If we cannot prove the consistency of arithmetic it seems a bit much to hope that God's existence is easier to deal with,&quot; concluding that God is &quot;ontologically necessary, but not logically necessary.&quot; He &quot;does not assert that God's existence can be demonstrated in a logically coercive way (any more than God's non-existence can) but that theism makes more sense of the world, and of human experience, than does atheism.&quot;{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1998|pp=71–83}} He cites in particular:

* '''The intelligibility of the universe:''' One would anticipate that evolutionary selection would produce hominid minds apt for coping with everyday experience, but that these minds should also be able to understand the subatomic world and general relativity goes far beyond anything of relevance to survival fitness. The mystery deepens when one recognises the proven fruitfulness of mathematical beauty as a guide to successful theory choice.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1998|p=72}}
* '''The anthropic [[Fine-tuned universe|fine tuning of the universe]]:''' He quotes with approval [[Freeman Dyson]], who said &quot;the more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe in some sense must have known we were coming&quot;{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1994|p=76}} and suggests there is a wide consensus amongst physicists that either there are a very large number of other universes in the [[Multiverse]] or that &quot;there is just one universe which is the way it is in its anthropic fruitfulness because it is the expression of the purposive design of a Creator, who has endowed it with the finely tuned potentialty for life.&quot;{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1998|p=75}}
* '''A wider humane reality:''' He considers that theism offers a more persuasive account of ethical and aesthetic perceptions. He argues that it is difficult to accommodate the idea that &quot;we have real moral knowledge&quot; and that statements such as 'torturing children is wrong' are more than &quot;simply social conventions of the societies within which they are uttered&quot; within an atheistic or naturalistic world view.  He also believes such a world view finds it hard to explain how &quot;Something of lasting significance is glimpsed in the beauty of the natural world and the beauty of the fruits of human creativity.&quot;{{sfn|Polkinghorne|1998|pp=81–82}}

===On free will===
Polkinghorne regards the [[problem of evil]] as the most serious intellectual objection to the existence of God.  He believes that
{{quote|The well-known [[Theodicy#The free will theodicy|free will defence]] in relation to moral evil asserts that a world with a possibility of sinful people is better than one with perfectly programmed machines. The tale of human evil is such that one cannot make that assertion without a quiver, but I believe that it is true nevertheless. I have added to it the [[Theodicy#The free process theodicy|free-process defence]], that a world allowed to make itself is better than a puppet theatre with a Cosmic Tyrant.  I think that these two defences are opposite sides of the same coin, that our nature is inextricably linked with that of the physical world which has given us birth.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=14}}}}

===On creationism===
Following the resignation of [[Michael Reiss]], the director of education at the Royal Society—who had controversially argued that school pupils who believed in creationism should be used by science teachers to start discussions, rather than be rejected ''per se''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=16 September 2008 |title='Creationism' Biologist Quits Job |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7619670.stm |website=BBC News |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Polkinghorne argued in ''The Times'' that &quot;As a Christian believer I am, of course, a creationist in the proper sense of the term, for I believe that the mind and the purpose of a divine Creator lie behind the fruitful history and remarkable order of the universe which science explores. But I am certainly not a creationist in that curious North American sense, which implies interpreting Genesis 1 in a flat-footed literal way and supposing that evolution is wrong.&quot;, a position he rejects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Polkinghorne |first=John |date=19 September 2008 |title=Shining a Light Where Science and Theology Meet |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4790446.ece |work=The Times |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901144152/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4790446.ece |archive-date=1 September 2011 |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[Nancy Frankenberry]], Professor of Religion at [[Dartmouth College]], has described Polkinghorne as the finest British theologian/scientist of our time, citing his work on the possible relationship between [[chaos theory]] and [[natural theology]].{{sfn|Frankenberry|2008|p=340}} [[Owen Gingerich]], an astronomer and former Harvard professor, has called him a leading voice on the relationship between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science and the Trinity: Reviews |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300115307 |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010200512/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300115307 |archive-date=10 October 2012 |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized Polkinghorne for using primitive thinking and rhetorical devices instead of engaging in philosophy. When Polkinghorne argues that the minute adjustments of cosmological constants for life points towards an explanation beyond the scientific realm, Blackburn argues that this relies on a natural preference for explanation in terms of agency. Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne's books in &quot;despair at humanity's capacity for self-deception.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Blackburn|date=1 August 2002 |title=An Unbeautiful Mind |url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_01.html |work=The New Republic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123714/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_01.html |archive-date=29 September 2007 |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, [[Freeman Dyson]] called Polkinghorne's arguments on theology and natural science &quot;polished and logically coherent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |author-link=Freeman Dyson |year=1998 |title=Is God in the Lab? |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1998/may/28/is-god-in-the-lab/ |url-access=subscription |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=45 |issue=9 |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Simon Ings]], writing in the ''[[New Scientist]]'', said Polkinghorne's argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ings |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Ings |year=1998 |title=God Only Knows |url=http://www.polkinghorne.net/godonlyknows.html |magazine=New Scientist |volume=159 |issue=2141 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312133510/http://www.polkinghorne.net/godonlyknows.html |archive-date=12 March 2008 |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], formerly [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for Public Understanding of Science]] at Oxford, writes that the same three names of British scientists who are also sincerely religious crop up with the &quot;likable familiarity of senior partners in a firm of Dickensian lawyers&quot;: [[Arthur Peacocke]], [[Russell Stannard]], and John Polkinghorne, all of whom have either won the Templeton Prize or are on its board of trustees. Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the US, are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=99}} Polkinghorne responded that &quot;debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there's no give and take. He doesn't give you an inch. He just says no when you say yes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reisz/&gt; Nicholas Beale writes in ''[[Questions of Truth]]'', which he co-authored with Polkinghorne, that he hopes Dawkins will be a bit less baffled once he reads it.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|Beale|2009|p=29}}

[[A.&amp;nbsp;C. Grayling]] criticized the Royal Society for allowing its premises to be used in connection with the launch of ''Questions of Truth'', describing it as a scandal, and suggesting that Polkinghorne had exploited his fellowship there to publicize a &quot;weak, casuistical and tendentious pamphlet.&quot; After implying that the book's publisher, [[Westminster John Knox]], was a [[self-publisher]], Grayling went on to write that Polkinghorne and others were eager to see the credibility accorded to scientific research extended to religious perspectives through association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grayling |first=A.&amp;nbsp;C. |author-link=A. C. Grayling |year=2009 |title=Review of ''Questions of Truth: God, Science and Belief'', by John Polkinghorne and Nicholas Beale |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1998 |magazine=New Humanist |volume=124 |issue=2 |location=London |publisher=Rationalist Association |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Grayling, science historian Edward B. Davis praises ''Questions of Truth'', saying the book provides &quot;the kind of technical information...that scientifically trained readers will appreciate—yet they can be read profitably by anyone interested in science and Christianity.&quot; Davis concludes, &quot;It hasn't been easy to steer a middle course between fundamentalism and modernism, particularly on issues involving science. Polkinghorne has done that very successfully for a generation, and for this he ought to be both appreciated and emulated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Edward B. |date=17 July 2009 |title=The Motivated Belief of John Polkinghorne |url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2009/07/the-motivated-belief-of-john-polkinghorne |work=First Things |location=New York |publisher=Institute on Religion and Public Life |access-date=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fructose''', or '''fruit sugar''', is a simple [[Ketose|ketonic]] [[monosaccharide]] found in many plants, where it is often bonded to [[glucose]] to form the [[disaccharide]] [[sucrose]]. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and [[galactose]], that are absorbed directly into blood during [[digestion]]. Fructose was discovered by French chemist [[Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrunfaut (1847) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Sur une propriété analytique des fermentations alcoolique et lactique, et sur leur application à l’étude des sucres&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627013828/http://books.google.com/books?id=PJ45AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 |date=2014-06-27 }} (On an analytic property of alcoholic and lactic fermentations, and on their application to the study of sugars), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''21''' :  169–178.  On page 174, Dubrunfaut relates the discovery and properties of fructose.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fruton, J.S. Molecules of Life 1972, Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt;  The name &quot;fructose&quot; was coined in 1857 by the English chemist [[William Allen Miller]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=William Allen Miller|title=Elements of Chemistry: Theoretical and Practical'', Part III. Organic Chemistry; pages 52 and 57|publisher=John W.

Fructose is found in [[honey]], tree and vine fruits, flowers, [[Berry|berries]], and most [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]].

Commercially, fructose is derived from [[sugar cane]], [[sugar beet]]s, and [[maize]]. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] is a [[mixture]] of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a [[Chemical compound|compound]] with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for [[palatability]] and [[taste]] enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. About 240,000 [[tonne]]s of crystalline fructose are produced annually.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Wach &quot;Fructose&quot; in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_047.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive consumption of fructose (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to [[insulin resistance]], [[obesity]], elevated [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s, leading to [[metabolic syndrome]].&lt;ref name=MalikHu2015/&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] stated that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on [[postprandial]] [[blood sugar]] levels, and noted that &quot;high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as [[dyslipidaemia]], insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;efsa11&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to fructose and reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (ID 558) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 | author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies | journal=EFSA Journal | year=2011 | volume=9 | issue=6 | pages=2223 | doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2223 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, stating that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake, at levels consumed in the normal UK diet, leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445503/SACN_Carbohydrates_and_Health.pdf|title=Carbohydrates and Health|publisher=UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, Public Health England, TSO, Williams Lea, Norwich, UK|date=2015|accessdate=1 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319190958/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445503/SACN_Carbohydrates_and_Health.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;fructose&quot; was coined in 1857 from the Latin for ''fructus'' (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, ''[[-ose]]''.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fructose. Origin and meaning of fructose|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|date=2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092022/https://www.etymonline.com/word/fructose|archivedate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called fruit sugar and levulose.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

[[File:DL-Fructose num.svg|thumb|255px|upright=1.5|{{sm|d}}- and {{sm|l}}-isomers of fructose (open-chain form)]]

Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure owing to the stability of its [[hemiketal]] and internal hydrogen-bonding. This form is formally called {{sm|d}}-fructopyranose. In water solution, fructose exists as an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]  mixture of 70% fructo[[pyranose]] and about 22% fructo[[furanose]], as well as small amounts of three other forms, including the acyclic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Institute of Organic Chemistry| url=http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416050839/http://www.oci.unizh.ch/edu/lectures/material/AC_BII/Kap14/kap14.html| archivedate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===

==== Fructose and fermentation ====
Fructose may be anaerobically [[Ethanol fermentation|fermented]] by [[yeast]] or [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McWilliams | first=Margaret | title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition | isbn=978-0-13-021282-5 | year=2001 | url=https://archive.org/details/foodsexperimenta00mcwi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast enzymes convert sugar (glucose, or fructose) to [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The carbon dioxide released during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid, unless the fermentation chamber is left open to the air. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in bottled fermented beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keusch |first=P |title=Yeast and Sugar- the Chemistry must be right |url=http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220064304/http://www.chemie.uni-regensburg.de/Organische_Chemie/Didaktik/Keusch/D-fermentation_sugar-e.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ====
Fructose undergoes the [[Maillard reaction]], non-enzymatic browning, with [[amino acids]]. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food [[palatability]], as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of [[mutagenic]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dills | first=WL | title=Protein fructosylation: Fructose and the Maillard reaction | year=1993 | journal=Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=58 | issue=5 Suppl | pages=779–787| doi=10.1093/ajcn/58.5.779S | pmid=8213610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dehydration ====
Fructose readily dehydrates to give [[hydroxymethylfurfural]] (&quot;HMF&quot;).
This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr068360d | volume=106 | title=Synthesis of transportation fuels from biomass: chemistry, catalysts, and engineering | date=September 2006 | journal=Chem. Rev. | pages=4044–98 | last1 = Huber | first1 = GW | last2 = Iborra | first2 = S | last3 = Corma | first3 = A | issue=9 | pmid = 16967928 | url=https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&amp;context=george_huber }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and functional properties ==

=== Sweetness of fructose ===
{{See also|Sweetness#Examples of sweet substances}}
The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose.&lt;ref name=Hanover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanover|first1=L. M.|last2=White|first2=J. S.|title=Manufacturing, composition, and applications of fructose.|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=1 November 1993|volume=58|issue=5|pages=724S–732S|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/58/5/724S.abstract|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|issn=0002-9165|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414002156/http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/58/5/724S.abstract|archivedate=14 April 2016|doi=10.1093/ajcn/58.5.724S|pmid=8213603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oregon State University&quot;&gt;Oregon State University. &quot;Sugar Sweetness&quot;. http://food.oregonstate.edu/sugar/sweet.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516050325/http://food.oregonstate.edu/sugar/sweet.html |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Othmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Thomas D.|chapter=Sweeteners|journal=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|date=1 January 2000|doi=10.1002/0471238961.19230505120505.a01.pub2|language=en|df=|isbn=978-0471238966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jana|first1=A.H.|last2=Joshi|first2=N.S.S.|title=Sweeteners for frozen [desserts] success – a review|journal=Australian Journal of Dairy Technology|date=November 1994|volume=49|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9500465|accessdate=7 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208033252/http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9500465|archivedate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar.  Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Taste Chemistry| last=Shallenberger| first=R.S.| year=1994| publisher=Chapman and Hall | isbn=978-0-7514-0150-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5&amp;nbsp;°C as 50&amp;nbsp;°C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to [[anomeric]] distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Othmer&quot;/&gt;

[[File:relativesweetness.png|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 2:''' Relative sweetness of sugars and sweeteners]]

The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose) and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Othmer&quot;/&gt;

Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components.&lt;ref name=Nabors&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nabors  | first=LO | title =American Sweeteners | year=2001 | pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Othmer&quot;/&gt;

=== Fructose solubility and crystallization ===
Fructose has higher water solubility than other sugars, as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt; Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Foods: Experimental Perspectives, 4th Edition| last=McWilliams| first=Margaret| year=2001| publisher=Upper Saddle River, NJ : Prentice Hall| isbn=978-0-13-021282-5| url=https://archive.org/details/foodsexperimenta00mcwi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy ===
Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners.&lt;ref name=Nabors /&gt; Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low [[relative humidity]] (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used.&lt;ref name=Hanover /&gt;

=== Freezing point ===
Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation.

=== Fructose and starch functionality in food systems ===
Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during [[starch gelatinization|gelatinizing of starch]], causing a greater final viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=White | first=DC |author2=Lauer GN | title=Predicting gelatinization temperature of starch/sweetener system for cake formulation by differential scanning calorimetry I.

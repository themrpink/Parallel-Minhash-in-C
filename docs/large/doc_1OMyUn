===Acquisitions and restructuring===
On 22 April 1987, BAe acquired [[Royal Ordnance]], the British armaments manufacturer, for £190&amp;nbsp;million. Subsequently, the German armaments specialist [[Heckler &amp; Koch|Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH]] was folded into this division following its acquisition by BAe four years later.

In 1988, BAe purchased the [[Rover Group]] from the British government of [[Third Thatcher ministry|Margaret Thatcher]].

In 1991, BAe acquired a 30% interest in [[Hutchison Telecommunications]] through a [[stock swap]] deal, where Hutchison was given a controlling stake of 65% in BAe's wholly owned subsidiary – [[Microtel Communications Ltd]].&lt;ref name=BAE-H-33&gt;{{cite news|title =The Facts : 2004|url =http://www.na.baesystems.com/PressKit/Facts.pdf|publisher =na.baesystems.com|page =107|accessdate =9 June 2012|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070125134301/http://www.na.baesystems.com/PressKit/Facts.pdf|archive-date =25 January 2007|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BAE-H-38/&gt;&lt;ref name=OBS-H-04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/mobile-wireless-broadband/cellular-wireless-broadband/policy-and-background/history-of-cellular-services/ |title=History of Cellular services |accessdate=9 June 2012 |publisher=licensing.ofcom.org.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205065028/http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/mobile-wireless-broadband/cellular-wireless-broadband/policy-and-background/history-of-cellular-services/ |archive-date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1991, BAe formed a naval systems joint venture, [[BAeSEMA]], with the [[Sema Group]].&lt;ref name=BAE-H-33/&gt; BAe acquired Sema's 50% share in 1998. 1991 also saw BAe begin to experience major difficulties.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;our property company [Arlington Securities] was hit with a lousy market. Sales of the [[Rover Group]] sank by about a fifth and losses mounted. The government's defence spending volumes underwent a major review. Losses in our commercial aerospace division increased dramatically with the recession in the airline industry.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During mid-1992, BAe wrote off £1 billion of assets, largely as part of [[Layoff|redundancies]] and restructuring of its regional aircraft division.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAe soars&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/bae-soars-out-of-the-red-1.741912 |first = Chris |last = Stone |title = BAe soars out of the red |work=The Herald |publisher=Caledonian Newspapers Ltd. |pages = 3, 7 |date = 16 September 1993 |accessdate = 7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largest asset write-off in UK corporate history.

Evans decided to sell non-core business activities which included The [[Rover Group]], [[Arlington Securities]], BAe Corporate Jets, BAe Communications and [[Ballast Nedam]]. Although the rationale of diversification was sound (to shield the company from cyclical aerospace and defence markets) the struggling company could not afford to continue the position: &quot;We simply could not afford to carry two core businesses, cars and aerospace. At one point Rover was eating up about £2 billion of our banking capacity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard (1999). ''Vertical Take-off'', p. 6. London: Nicholas Brealey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-85788-245-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; BAe Corporate Jets Ltd and Arkansas Aerospace Inc were sold to [[Raytheon]] in 1993. During 1994, the Rover Group was sold to [[BMW]] and [[British Aerospace Space Systems]] was sold to [[Matra Marconi Space]]. In 1998, BAe's shareholding of [[Orange S.A.|Orange plc]] was reduced to 5%.&lt;ref name=BAE-H-38&gt;{{cite news |title = BAe's record-breaking sterling Eurobond issue |url = http://www.treasurers.org/system/files/TTOct99Brake14-15.pdf |date = 22 June 1999 |access-date = 11 June 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507093254/http://www.treasurers.org/system/files/TTOct99Brake14-15.pdf |archive-date = 7 May 2013 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orange shareholding was a legacy of the 30% stake in Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) Ltd.

During 1994, BAeSEMA, [[Siemens Plessey]] and [[GEC-Marconi]] formed ''UKAMS Ltd'' as part of the [[PAAMS|Principal Anti-Air Missile System]] (PAAMS) consortium. UKAMS would become a wholly owned subsidiary of BAe Dynamics in 1998. During 1995, [[Saab AB|Saab Military Aircraft]] and BAe signed an agreement for the joint development and marketing of the export version of the [[JAS 39 Gripen]]. In 1996, BAe and [[Matra Defense]] agreed to merge their missile businesses into a joint venture called [[Matra BAe Dynamics]]. In 1997, BAe joined the [[Lockheed Martin]] [[F-35 Lightning II|X-35 Joint Strike Fighter]] team. During the following year, BAe acquired the UK operations of [[Siemens Plessey|Siemens Plessey Systems]] (SPS) from [[Siemens AG]], while DASA purchased SPS' German assets.&lt;ref name=SP-H-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=SP-H-02/&gt;

During the 1990s, BAe was the largest exporter based in the United Kingdom; a [[Competition Commission]] report released in 2005 calculated a ten-year aggregate figure of £45 billion, with defence sales accounting for approximately 80%.&lt;ref&gt;Competition Commission (1995) [http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/364c3.pdf British Aerospace Public Limited Company and VSEL Plc: A report on the proposed merger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302075701/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/364c3.pdf |date=2 March 2005}} p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to BAE Systems===
During the late 1990s, European defence consolidation became a prevailing practice; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business: The Company File: Defense merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 July 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ambition led to numerous reports linking various European defence groups – mainly with each other but also with American defence contractors. During July 1998, merger discussions commenced between BAe and DASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BAe and Dasa discuss proposals for merger: Aerospace groups still have 'important issues to resolve'|work=Financial Times |page=1 |date=24 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms for such a merger had been reportedly agreed between British Aerospace Chairman [[Richard Evans (businessman)|Richard Evans]] and DASA CEO [[Jürgen E. Schrempp|Jürgen Schrempp]] in December 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftBAeDASA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=The largest aerospace companies gather next week for the Farnborough air show but the event will be without its long-time unofficial host|work=Financial Times|page=11|date=17 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spiegel |first =Peter |title=End of an era at BAE: how Sir Richard Evans changed the UK defence industry |newspaper=Financial Times |date =17 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the British [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] (GEC) put its defence electronics business [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAe's management opted to abandon the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival.&lt;ref&gt;BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000). Retrieved on 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman2000&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Turpin|title=BAE eyes US targets after profit rockets|work=The Scotsman|publisher=The Scotsman Publications|page=26|date = 4 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, Evans stated that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftBAeDASA&quot; /&gt;

Schrempp was angered by BAe' reversal, and opted to pursue other partner companies for DASA to merge with. On 11 June 1999, the Spanish aircraft company [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] (CASA) a memorandum of understanding for such a merger,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=White|author2=Nicoll, Alexander |title=DaimlerChrysler wins fight for Spain's Casa: Deal boosts aerospace industry consolidation in Europe|work=Financial Times|date=1999-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1999, DASA agreed to merge with Aérospatiale-Matra to create the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Nicoll |author2=Skapiner, Michael |title=Flying in formation: The merger of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Aérospatiale-Matra may pave the way for a larger European grouping or the first transatlantic defence tie-up, argue Alexander Nicoll and Michael Skapinker |work=Financial Times|date=1999-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 July 2000 was &quot;day one&quot; for the new company, which became the world's second-largest aerospace company after [[Boeing]] and the second-largest European [[arms industry|arms manufacturer]] after BAE Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eads.eu/1024/en/eads/history/chronos/2000.html |title=History of EADS |publisher=EADS |accessdate=2009-10-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603121737/http://www.eads.eu/1024/en/eads/history/chronos/2000.html |archive-date=3 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEC merger to create a solely British company, compared to the prospective Anglo-German company that would have resulted from merging with DASA, was promoted as having superior prospects for further penetration of the lucrative defense market of the United States. The newly combined company, which was initially referred to as the &quot;New British Aerospace&quot;, was officially formed on 30 November 1999; it is named [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jan/19/7 |title=BAe set to sign A8bn GEC deal with merger |work=The Guardian |date=19 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption investigation and criticisms==
{{main|Al-Yamamah arms deal}}

There have been allegations that the Al Yamamah contracts were a result of [[bribery|bribes]] (&quot;douceurs&quot;) to members of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] and government officials. Some allegations suggested that the former Prime Minister's son [[Mark Thatcher]] may have been involved; he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother's connections in his business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/corruption/submission-0900.php |title=Submission from the Campaign Against Arms Trade to the International Development Committee's Inquiry into corruption |accessdate=19 August 2006 |date= September 2000 |publisher=Campaign Against Arms Trade |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060619115415/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/corruption/submission-0900.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK National Audit Office]] investigated the contracts and has so far never released its conclusions – the only NAO report ever to be withheld. The BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' observed that it is ironic that the once classified report analysing the construction of [[MI5|MI5's]] [[Thames House]] and [[MI6|MI6's]] [[SIS Building|Vauxhall Cross]] headquarters has been released, but the Al Yamamah report is still deemed too sensitive.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The 2007 documentary film [[Welcome Aboard Toxic Airlines]] contained evidence that vital data was withheld from a 1999–2000 Australian Senate Inquiry into the health and flight safety issues relating to oil fumes on the [[BAe 146]]. The film also contains an Australian Senator speech about money being paid by BAe for silence on the fumes issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Marconi Electronic Systems''' ('''MES'''), or '''GEC-Marconi''' as it was until 1998, was the defence arm of [[General Electric Company plc|The General Electric Company]] (GEC). It was demerged from GEC and bought by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) on 30 November 1999 to form [[BAE Systems]]. GEC then renamed itself [[Telent|Marconi plc]].

MES exists today as '''BAE Systems Electronics Limited''', a subsidiary of BAE Systems, but the assets were rearranged elsewhere within that company. MES-related businesses include [[BAE Systems Submarine Solutions]], [[BAE Systems Surface Ships]], [[BAE Systems Insyte]] and [[Selex ES]] (now a part of [[Leonardo S.p.A.]]).

==History==
[[File:Marconi Radar dish at Norwich Aiport.jpg|thumb|Marconi [[S Band|S]]511 radar located at [[Norwich International Airport]]]]
MES represented the pinnacle of GEC's defence businesses which had a heritage of almost 100 years. Following GEC's acquisition of Marconi as part of [[English Electric]] in 1968, the Marconi brand was used for its defence businesses, e.g. Marconi Space &amp; Defence Systems (MSDS), Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd (MUSL). GEC's history of military products dates back to [[World War I]] with its contribution to the war effort then including radios and bulbs. [[World War II]] consolidated this position with the company involved in many important technological advances, most notably [[radar]].

Between 1945 and GEC's demerger of its defence business in 1999, the company became one of the world's most important [[defence contractor]]s. GEC's major defence related acquisitions included [[Associated Electrical Industries]] in 1967, [[English Electric Company]] (including its [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] subsidiary) in 1968, [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]] in 1985, parts of [[Ferranti]]'s defence business in 1990, [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering]] in 1995 and [[Kvaerner Govan]] in 1999. In June 1998, MES acquired [[Tracor]], a major American defence contractor, for $1.4bn.

===Demerger===
The 1997 merger of American corporations [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]], which followed the forming of [[Lockheed Martin]], the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence managing director [[John Weston (businessman)|John Weston]] commented &quot;Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrea|last=Rothman|author2=Landberg, Reed |title=Europe Defense Firms Feel Pressure to Unite |url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2544541&amp;date=19970615&amp;query=Pressure+to+Unite |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=15 June 1997 |accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Business: The Company File: Defence merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |publisher=BBC |date=10 July 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]] (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Jones|title=Europe cries foul as New BAe emerges |work=[[The Times]] |date=20 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman [[Richard Evans (businessman)|Richard Evans]] and DASA CEO [[Jürgen E. Schrempp|Jürgen Schrempp]] in December 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftBAeDASA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=The largest aerospace companies gather next week for the Farnborough air show but the event will be without its long-time unofficial host |work=[[Financial Times]] |page=11 |date=17 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of [[George Simpson, Baron Simpson of Dunkeld|George Simpson]] as GEC managing director in 1996, ''The Independent'' had said &quot;some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Russell|last=Hotten |title=GEC confirms Simpson job|work=The Independent |page=17|date=19 March 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAE abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000). Retrieved 27 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftBAeDASA&quot;/&gt; The merger created a [[vertically integrated]] company which ''The Scotsman'' described as &quot;[a combination of British Aerospace's] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Louise|last=Nevill|title=BAe and Marconi moving toward merger|work=The Scotsman |page=17|date=4 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speculation Rises on GEC Merger |work=The Scotsman |date=28 December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with Aérospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ([[EADS]]), a [[horizontal integration]]. EADS has since considered a merger with [[Thales Group|Thales]] to create a &quot;fully rounded&quot; company.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrated&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting it together? |work=The Economist |date=20 July 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While MES was responsible for the majority of GEC's defence sales other GEC companies achieved defence related sales, principally [[Alstom|GEC Alsthom]], [[Marconi Communications|GEC-Plessey Telecommunications]] (GPT) and GEC Plessey Semiconductors.

== History ==

===Origin and etymology===
The 'Ndrangheta was already known during the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|reign of the Bourbons of Naples]]. In the spring of 1792, there was the first official report in history on the 'Ndrangheta, and a mission as &quot;Royal Visitor&quot; was entrusted to [[Giuseppe Maria Galanti]]; these traveled far and wide throughout most of [[Calabria]], often also making use of reports (answers written on the basis of a sort of questionnaire to fixed questions, prepared by himself) of local notables deemed reliable and trusted. This resulted in a bleak picture, as well as on the economic situation in the region, especially on that of public order.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.librerianeapolis.it/libri-84159/105-storia-87052/1945-scritti-sulla-calabria-giuseppe-maria-galanti|title=SCRITTI SULLA CALABRIA|publisher=librerianeapolis.it|author=Augusto Placanica|language=it|access-date=6 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422035801/http://www.librerianeapolis.it/libri-84159/105-storia-87052/1945-scritti-sulla-calabria-giuseppe-maria-galanti|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been analyzed by various contemporary historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.augustoplacanica.it/bibliografiacur|publisher=Università degli Studi di Salerno|author=Augusto Placanica|title=Travel Journal in Calabria (1792), followed by reports and memoirs written on the occasion, critical edition, Napoli, SEN 1982|language=it|access-date=6 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226185732/http://www.augustoplacanica.it/bibliografiacur|archive-date=26 February 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giornale di viaggio in Calabria&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.store.rubbettinoeditore.it/giornale-di-viaggio-in-calabria.html|title=Giornale di viaggio in Calabria|publisher=rubbettinoeditore.it|author=Luca Addante|language=it}}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reciproca.it/Contributi/Capitanata/note/note.htm|title=Relazione letta al Convegno di Studi su: &quot;Le istituzioni nel Mezzogiorno e l'opera di Francesco Ricciardi&quot;, Foggia, 1993|via=reciproca.it|author=Franca Assante|author2=Domenico Demarco|language=it|access-date=6 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506064528/http://reciproca.it/Contributi/Capitanata/note/note.htm|archive-date=6 May 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Luca Addante writes in the introduction to the re-edition of Galanti's report (&quot;Giornale di viaggio in Calabria&quot;, Rubbettino Editore, 2008):&lt;ref name=&quot;Giornale di viaggio in Calabria&quot;/&gt; &quot;the murders, thefts, the kidnappings were infinite; the ignorance of the clergy was scandalous; the village notables, obsessed with the idea of enriching themselves and then ennobling themselves, rapacious monopolizers of local administrations, who grew up in the shadow of a decadent nobility whose remains were being prepared.&quot; Galanti, in particular, reports in the Giornale the descriptions of disturbing crime phenomena, noting how the inefficient administration of justice, the corruption and the monopoly of the [[barons]], was starting to produce cases, as in [[Maida, Calabria|Maida]], of &quot;a small bunch of young, freeloaded young men who commit violence with the use of firearms. Justice is idle because without force and without a system. Malicious people become policemen (a sort of urban guard).&quot; In the District of [[Gerace]], &quot;the raids of the criminals in the countryside are general. Almost all the militiamen are the most troublemakers in the province because the criminals and the debtors adopt this profession and are guaranteed by commanders in contempt of the laws. With this, the crimes, which grow every day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.tropeamagazine.it/galanti/|title=Giornale di viaggio in Calabria (1792)|publisher=tropeamagazine.it|author=Giuseppe Maria Galanti|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the prefect of [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio Calabria]] already noticed the presence of so-called ''camorristi'', a term used at the time since there was no formal name for the phenomenon in Calabria (the [[Camorra]] was the older and better known criminal organization in [[Naples]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;relazione2008&quot;&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg15/lavori/documentiparlamentari/indiceetesti/023/005/INTERO.pdf ''&quot;Relazione annuale sulla 'Ndrangheta&quot;''] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6LQmzM0xd?url=http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg15/lavori/documentiparlamentari/indiceetesti/023/005/INTERO.pdf |date=27 November 2013 }}, Italian [[Antimafia Commission]], February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;behan9&quot;&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1880s, there is ample evidence of 'Ndrangheta-type groups in police reports and sentences by local courts. At the time they were often being referred to as the ''picciotteria'', ''onorata società'' (honoured society) or ''camorra'' and ''mafia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli36&quot;&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

These secret societies in the areas of Calabria rich in olives and vines were distinct from the often anarchic forms of [[Brigandage in the Two Sicilies|banditry]] and were organized hierarchically with a code of conduct that included [[omertà]] – the code of silence – according to a sentence from the court in [[Reggio Calabria]] in 1890. An 1897 sentence from the court in [[Palmi, Calabria|Palmi]] mentioned a written code of rules found in the village of [[Seminara]] based on [[honour]], secrecy, violence, solidarity (often based on blood relationships) and mutual assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;gratteri23&quot;&gt;Gratteri &amp; Nicaso, ''Fratelli di sangue'', pp. 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the folk culture surrounding 'Ndrangheta in [[Calabria]], references to the Spanish [[Garduña]] often appear. Aside from these references, however, there is nothing to substantiate a link between the two organizations. The [[Calabrian dialects|Calabrian]] word 'Ndrangheta derives from [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Turone, Giuliano |title= Il delitto di associazione mafiosa|publisher= Giuffrè editore |year= 2008 |page=97 |isbn= 978-88-14-13917-8 |quote= Il vocabolo deriva infatti dal greco antico ανδραγαθία e significa valore, prodezza, carattere del galantuomo.}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=OrS8in3ETtAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq='ndranghet+deriva+greco+antico&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=CGNATs_lApDzsgaR05WFCQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511122004/https://books.google.com/books?id=OrS8in3ETtAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq='ndranghet+deriva+greco+antico&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=CGNATs_lApDzsgaR05WFCQ |date=11 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ἀνδραγαθία ''andragathía'' for &quot;[[heroism]]&quot; and manly &quot;[[virtue]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ndragaqi/a|ἀνδραγαθία|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ἀνδράγαθος ''andrágathos'', compound words of ἀνήρ, ''anḗr'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ἀνδρóς, ''andrós''), i.e. man,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nh/r|ἀνήρ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀγαθός, ''agathós'', i.e. good, brave,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)gaqo/s|ἀγαθός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning a courageous man.&lt;ref&gt;[[headword|lemma]] ''{{lang|el|ανδραγαθία}}''; {{cite book|title=Dictionary of Modern Greek|first=Georgios|last=Babiniotis|author-link=Georgios Babiniotis|publisher=Lexicology Centre|location=Athens|title-link=Babiniotis dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Andreia: Studies in manliness and courage in classical antiquity|editor1-first=Ralph M.|editor1-last=Rosen|editor2-first=Ineke|editor2-last=Sluiter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ko1iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aner+agathos+andragathia|page=55|publisher=Brill|year=2003|isbn=9789004119956}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of Calabria the verb '''ndranghitiari'', from the Greek verb ''andragathízesthai'',&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ndragaqi/zomai|ἀνδραγαθίζεσθαι|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; means &quot;to engage in a defiant and valiant attitude&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gratteri21&quot;&gt;Gratteri &amp; Nicaso, ''Fratelli di sangue'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Until 1975, the 'Ndrangheta restricted their Italian operations to Calabria, mainly involved in extortion and blackmailing. Their involvement in cigarette contraband expanded their scope and contacts with the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and the Neapolitan [[Camorra]]. With the arrival of large public works in Calabria, skimming of public contracts became an important source of income. Disagreements over how to distribute the spoils led to the [[First 'Ndrangheta war]] killing 233 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickie137&quot;&gt;Dickie, ''Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd8ctqMyE3EC&amp;pg=PT137 pp. 137–40] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223093130/https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd8ctqMyE3EC&amp;pg=PT137 |date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing factions began to kidnap rich people located in northern Italy for ransom. A high-profile case was the 1973 [[kidnapping of John Paul Getty III]], who had his severed ear mailed to a newspaper in November, and later released in December following the negotiated payment of $2.2 million by Getty's grandfather, [[J.

The [[Second 'Ndrangheta war]] raged from 1985 to 1991.

== Characteristics ==
Italian anti-organized crime agencies estimated in 2007 that the 'Ndrangheta has an annual [[revenue]] of about [[Euro|€]] 35–40 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]50–60 billion), which amounts to approximately 3.5% of the [[GDP]] of Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/italy.johnhooper &quot;Move over, Cosa Nostra.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201174301/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/italy.johnhooper |date=1 December 2016 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1750008.ece &quot;Mafiosi move north to take over the shops and cafés of Milan&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012205908/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1750008.ece |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[The Times]]'', 5 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes mostly from illegal drug trafficking, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets.&lt;ref name=&quot;mon150807&quot;&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [https://archive.today/20130107095300/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3214,36-944807@51-944809,0.html &quot;Six morts dans un règlement de comptes mafieux en Allemagne&quot;].

According to a US Embassy cable [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked]] by [[WikiLeaks]], Calabria would be a [[failed state]] if it were not part of Italy. The 'Ndrangheta controls huge segments of its territory and economy, and accounts for at least three percent of Italy's GDP through drug trafficking, extortion, skimming of public contracts, and usury. Law enforcement is hampered by a lack of both human and financial resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;cable&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/12/08NAPLES96.html |title=Can Calabria Be Saved? |publisher=Wikileaks.ch |date=2 December 2008 |access-date=19 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512011747/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/12/08NAPLES96.html |archive-date=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time090311&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057944,00.html &quot;Italy's Brutal Export: The Mafia Goes Global&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726091837/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057944,00.html |date=26 July 2011 }}, ''Time'', 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal difference with the Mafia is in recruitment methods. The 'Ndrangheta recruits members on the criterion of blood relationships resulting in an extraordinary cohesion within the family clan that presents a major obstacle to investigation. Sons of '''ndranghetisti'' are expected to follow in their fathers' footsteps, and go through a grooming process in their youth to become ''giovani d'onore'' (boys of honour) before they eventually enter the ranks as ''uomini d'onore'' (men of honour). There are relatively few Calabrian mafiosi who have opted out to become a [[pentito]]; at the end of 2002, there were 157 Calabrian witnesses in the state [[witness protection program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mpr0204&quot; /&gt; Unlike the [[Sicilian Mafia]] in the early 1990s, they have meticulously avoided a head-on confrontation with the Italian state.

Prosecution in Calabria is hindered by the fact that Italian judges and prosecutors who score highly in exams get to choose their posting; those who are forced to work in Calabria will usually request to be transferred right away.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt; With weak government presence and corrupt officials, few civilians are willing to speak out against the organization.

Both the Sicilian [[Cosa Nostra]] and the 'Ndrangheta are loose confederations of about one hundred organised groups, also called &quot;''[[cosca|cosche]]''&quot; or families, each of which claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village, though without ever fully conquering and legitimizing its monopoly of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli&quot; /&gt;

There are approximately 100 of these families, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 members in Reggio Calabria.&lt;ref name=&quot;mon150807&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli32&quot;&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rel2003&quot;&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/bicam/14/Antimafia/documenti/relazann2003II.pdf ''&quot;Relazione annuale&quot;''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127141114/http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/bicam/14/Antimafia/documenti/relazann2003II.pdf |date=27 November 2009 }} (PDF), Commissione parliamentare d'inchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalità organizzata mafiosa o similare, 30 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates mention 6,000–7,000 men; worldwide there might be some 10,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt;

Most of the groups (86) operate in the [[Province of Reggio Calabria]], although a portion of the recorded 70 criminal groups based in the Calabrian provinces [[Province of Catanzaro|Catanzaro]] and [[Province of Cosenza|Cosenza]] also appears to be formally affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta.&lt;ref name=&quot;varese&quot; /&gt; The families are concentrated in poor villages in Calabria such as [[Platì]], [[Locri]], [[San Luca]], [[Africo]] and [[Altomonte]] as well as the main city and provincial capital [[Reggio Calabria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rep250407&quot;&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/01/sezioni/politica/inchiesta-citta/potere-reggioc/potere-reggioc.html ''&quot;La pax della 'ndrangheta soffoca Reggio Calabria&quot;''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711115813/http://www.repubblica.it/2007/01/sezioni/politica/inchiesta-citta/potere-reggioc/potere-reggioc.html |date=11 July 2007 }}. ''La Repubblica''. 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Luca]] is considered to be the stronghold of the 'Ndrangheta. According to a former 'ndranghetista, &quot;almost all the male inhabitants belong to the 'Ndrangheta, and the [[Territorial Abbey and Sanctuary of Santa Maria di Polsi|Sanctuary of Polsi]] has long been the meeting place of the affiliates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli29&quot;&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Bosses from outside Calabria, from as far as Canada and Australia, regularly attend the meetings at the Sanctuary of Polsi.&lt;ref name=&quot;varese&quot; /&gt;

The basic local organizational unit of the 'Ndrangheta is called a ''[[Locale ('Ndrangheta)|locale]]'' (local or place) with [[jurisdiction]] over an entire town or an area in a large urban center.&lt;ref name=&quot;nicaso1&quot;&gt;Nicaso &amp; Danesi, ''Made Men'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fEQAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA23 p. 23] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102011850/https://books.google.com/books?id=5fEQAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA23 |date=2 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''locale'' may have branches, called '' [['ndrina]]'' (plural: '' 'ndrine''), in the districts of the same city, in neighbouring towns and villages, or even outside Calabria, in cities and towns in the industrial North of Italy in and around [[Turin]] and [[Milan]]: for example, [[Bardonecchia]], an alpine town in the province of [[Turin]] in [[Piedmont]], has been, the first municipality in northern [[Italy]] dissolved for alleged mafia infiltration, with the arrest of the historical 'Ndrangheta boss of the city, [[Rocco Lo Presti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivio.lastampa.it/articolo?id=7df2c08bd4df55dc2e1f841d2ea6e3d150ed289a Bardonecchia comune chiuso per mafia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404012923/http://archivio.lastampa.it/articolo?id=7df2c08bd4df55dc2e1f841d2ea6e3d150ed289a |date=4 April 2015 }} [[La Stampa]] 29 aprile 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The small towns of [[Corsico]] and [[Buccinasco]] in Lombardy are considered to be strongholds of the 'Ndrangheta. Sometimes ''sotto 'ndrine'' are established. These subunits enjoy a high degree of autonomy – they have a leader and independent staff. In some contexts the '' 'ndrine'' have become more powerful than the ''locale'' on which they formally depend.&lt;ref name=&quot;paoli29&quot; /&gt; Other observers maintain that the '' 'ndrina'' is the basic organizational unit. Each '' 'ndrina'' is &quot;autonomous on its territory and no formal authority stands above the &quot;'' 'ndrina'' boss&quot;, according to the [[Antimafia Commission]]. The '' 'ndrina'' is usually in control of a small town or a neighborhood. If more than one '' 'ndrina'' operates in the same town, they form a ''locale''.&lt;ref name=&quot;varese&quot; /&gt;

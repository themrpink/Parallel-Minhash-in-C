=== The Jewish Female Body image ===
Sarah Bernhardt's identity as a Jewish woman elicits a greater idea of the representation of Jewish women in film, cinema and theatre. The former representation of Jewish women revolved heavily around notions of femininity and the Jewish body. However, through looking at Sarah Bernhardt’s role as [[Salome (opera)|Salome]], there is a relevant shift in the way Jewish women are portrayed, and viewed throughout theatrical performances and art.
[[File:Gustave_Moreau’s_Salome7.jpg|thumb|Gustave Moreau's 1870s Salome painting]]
The ways in which female Jewish body types are represented in 19th century art and theatrics provides a more in depth look into the work of Sarah Barnhardt as a modernizing force of Jewish representation. Specifically the role of Salome shapes the way the female body is admired and viewed by audiences. The famous paintings of [[Gustave Moreau]] embodies this admiration of the female jewish body, sarah bernhardt and Salome. Moreau’s paintings in the late 1870s offered origins of a new female Jewishness and especially Jewish femininity. Based on the figure of [[Salome (play)|Salome]], Moreau created three famous paintings devoted to the subject, In which they attracted enormous crowds of more than 500,000 people viewed them in an 1876 salon &lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Jonathan|date=January 1, 2013|title=“Transformations of a Jewish Princess: Salome and the Remaking of the Jewish Female Body from Sarah Bernhardt to Betty Boop.”|url=|journal=Philological Quarterly|volume=vol. 92, no. 1|pages=pg89|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Moreau’s paintings represented an eroticized Jewish body, one that made [[Salome (play)|Salomé]] into a slender adolescent in which the portraits transformed the image of the Jewish woman at large.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; The idea of Jewish femininity shifted away from the maternal and womanly features and instead led in the direction of the slender, lean, and girlish figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; As such, the effect is to foreground and frame an entirely different model of female beauty than that on offer in Orientalist representations of the Jewish woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Sarah Bernhardt, whose rise to prominence paralleled Moreau's Salomé portraits, and whose career intersected with it when she accepted the lead role in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play in as [[Salome (play)|Salome]] in 1894. Bernhardt was linked with a quality of thinness. This quality was persistently foregrounded in the multiple representations of her proliferating in art, caricature, and photography. &quot;Her thinness is really quite remarkable,&quot; wrote Henry James of Georges Clarin's 1876 Portrait of Sarah Bernhard, on display at the same salon where Moreau's Salomés made their debut.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; These arguments to her thinness, fed in with a general sense that as a Jew, Bernhardt was sickly, malnourished, diseased—perhaps syphilitic or tubercular, as Sander Gilman has powerfully argued.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

In response to these paintings and portrayals, Bernhardt made efforts to present herself as a star of fashion as well as of theater had to do with appropriating this label and resituating it, re-signifying it in her own terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; To the perception that she was emaciated, sick, skeletal, Bernhardt responded by modeling sculptures of death's heads, had herself photographed in a coffin, and marketed the pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; She made her thinness fashionable&quot;—by her flamboyant persona, in her role in dress reform, and in her writing and other public pronouncements.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

[[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] generated out of a mass of decadent, and Sarah Bernhardt used this to influences a new model of Jewish female beauty. Sarah Bernhardt herself did much to shape the image of Jewish female beauty, seizing upon the means by which she, like so many Jewish women, was represented in order to make a new look her own. As such, she helped create a new style, a new fashion, which defined the Jewish woman for the next generations— one which combined clothing, jewelry, and especially what [[Pierre Bourdieu]] provocatively calls &quot;bodily hexis&quot; to create a new model of feminine beauty.-'&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; Going forward the image of Bernhardt and Salomé intertwined, as more and more Jewish women took up the role and modeled themselves on [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Wilde's]] character, and Sarah Bernhardt.

== Legacy ==
Mexican actress [[Virginia Fábregas]] (1871–1950) was nicknamed &quot;The Mexican Sarah Bernhardt.&quot;&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Fábregas|url=http://rotonda.segob.gob.mx/work/models/Rotonda/Resource/contenidos/P34t.html|publisher=Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres|accessdate=13 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124242/http://rotonda.segob.gob.mx/work/models/Rotonda/Resource/contenidos/P34t.html |archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bernhardt's death, her theater was managed by her son Maurice until his death in 1928. It kept its name until the [[Paris in World War II|occupation of Paris]] by the Germans in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John (1995). &quot;Bernhardt, Sarah&quot; in ''The Cambridge Guide to the Theatre''. Martin Banham (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521434379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when, because of Bernhardt's Jewish ancestry, the name was changed to Théâtre de la Cité. The name was changed back to the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in 1947, then in 1957 became the Théâtre des Nations. In 1968, it was renamed the Théâtre de la Ville, which is the name it has today.

In 1876, Bernhardt constructed a large townhouse at 35 rue Fortuny in the 17th arrondissement, not far from Parc Monceau, for her family, servants, and animals. In 1885, when her debts mounted, she sold the house. Once her fortune was replenished by her tours abroad, she bought an even larger house at 56 avenue Pereire in the 17th arrondissement, where she died in 1923. The house was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a modern apartment building. A plaque on the facade commemorates Bernhardt's earlier residence.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=219}}

In 1960, Bernhardt was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 1751 [[Vine Street]]. To date, she is the earliest born person on the Walk (born in 1844), followed by Thomas Edison and Siegmund Lubin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame – Sarah Bernhardt |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=16 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116142635/http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |archivedate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara|last=Isenberg|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt|title=Sarah Bernhardt|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=4 December 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725184019/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] produced [[Theresa Rebeck]]'s play ''Bernhardt/Hamlet''. In the play, Rebeck explores the controversy surrounding Bernhardt's decision to play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]. The play opened on Broadway in September at the [[American Airlines Theater]] for a limited run. It starred [[Janet McTeer]] as Bernhardt and it was directed by [[Moritz von Stuelpnagel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/bernhardt-hamlet-518406|title=Bernhardt/Hamlet – Broadway Play – Original|website=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=18 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; McTeer received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for portraying Bernhardt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/entertainment/tony-awards-nominations-2019/index.html|title=The Tony Award nominees were revealed and there were some surprising snubs|website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=18 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarah Bernhardt and The New Women's Movement in Brazil ===
The new women's movement that took place in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century [[Brazil]], was a movement built around a woman's ability to gain access to public spaces in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-11-23|title=Sarah Bernhardt’s Knee|url=https://www.americanacademy.de/sarah-bernhardts-knee/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=American Academy|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among middle class women, new opportunities and possibilities opened up for women allowing them professional positions in the workforce. Some women also found the acting profession to afford them freedom and independence. The theater offered women an environment relatively free of social constraints.  The proffession of an actress held a controversial opinion within society. On one hand, high society embraced women who appeared in plays or opera representing a high culture. While on the other hand, female performers could suffer public scrutiny and gossip for leading unconventional lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

“The Eternal Feminine” was published January 16th 1886 by Revista Illstrada in Brazil six months prior to the first visiting of Sarah Bernhardt. “The Eternal Feminine” discussed advances of middle class and elite women in Brazil, citing expanding educational opportunities, acknowledging that women were capable of entering many new professions and industries that had previously been restricted to primarily men.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; &quot;The Eternal Feminine&quot; stated that “The bello sexo&quot;, as journalists so often called women, may move into new occupations, but their beauty, elegance, and eternal femininity needed to remain in place.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Bernhardt’s performances in Brazil had lasting effects in the sense that they encouraged new notions of possibilities for women in a patriarchal and traditional society and in theater. Bernhardt made use of an array of tropes assigned to women to create a public personality that afforded her freedom, independence, and immense popularity at home and abroad.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Even her famous cross-dressing roles such as Hamlet intervened in the tension between the traditional woman and the New Woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

To quote the article ''Sarah Barnhardt's Knee;''

“In an era of debate about gender norms, Bernhardt’s star image presented a similar fantasy scenario that fulfilled a need on the part of her public for unity, resolution, and reassurance. To her more socially conservative fans, Bernhardt appeased fears concerning the threat of the New Woman and the demise of female seduction as an everyday pleasure. She transcended the perceived conflict between the independent New Woman and the séductrice. [. . .] [S]he was a living example of Marguerite Durand’s contention that a woman need not lose her femininity to compete in a man’s world.” &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

'''David James Mattacks''' (born 13 March 1948) is an [[English people|English]] [[rock music|rock]] and [[folk music|folk]] drummer.  Best known for his work with [[Fairport Convention]], Mattacks has also worked both as a [[session musician]] and as a performance artist. Apart from playing the drums, he is also a versed keyboard player and occasionally played the bass guitar on studio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mainlynorfolk.info/fairport/records/angeldelight.html |title=Fairport Convention: Angel Delight |publisher=mainlynorfolk.info |date=2018-08-19 |accessdate=2019-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mainlynorfolk.info/fairport/songs/theladyisatramp.html |title=The Lady Is a Tramp [Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers&amp;#93; |publisher=mainlynorfolk.info |date=2016-08-27 |accessdate=2019-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began as a trainee piano-tuner before taking up the drums. He played with several [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|bands]] before joining the [[British folk rock]] band [[Fairport Convention]] in August 1969, with whom he worked on and off until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p102848/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Dave Mattacks|last=McDonald|first=Steven|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998, he moved to [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], United States, where he is a sought-after studio musician, record producer, and member of the band Super Genius, while still touring regularly with various acts in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.

==Fairport Convention==
He replaced [[Martin Lamble]], who had died on 12 May 1969 in a [[traffic collision|road accident]] on the [[M1 motorway]], as the [[drummer]] for [[Fairport Convention]]. Mattacks left Fairport Convention in early 1972 to join [[The Albion Country Band]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NME Rock 'N' Roll Years&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Village Wait]]'', [[John Martyn]]'s ''[[Solid Air]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/solid-air-mw0000190937/credits |title=Solid Air - John Martyn|website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvey Andrews]]' album ''Writer of Songs''. He returned to Fairport Convention in order to help complete the 1973 album ''[[Rosie (album)|Rosie]]'' with a revamped line up of the band.

Mattacks also played on ''[[Nine (Fairport Convention album)|Nine]]'' (1974) but left halfway through the making of the follow-up ''[[Rising for the Moon]]'', following an altercation with engineer [[Glyn Johns]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Some of Mattacks' most notable participation in studio recordings in the late 1970s are the work on [[art rock]] studio albums by [[Brian Eno]] (''[[Before and After Science]]'') and [[801 (band)|801]]'s ''[[Listen Now]]'', as well as several [[Ashley Hutchings]]-related folk rock projects (The Compleat Dancing Master, [[Son of Morris On]] etc.). He also established himself as a touring drummer for [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], playing on several of Thompson's studio albums.

When Fairport Convention re-formed in 1985 after a six-year absence, Mattacks was recruited as drummer. He had already been playing with them again during annual reunions at the fledgling [[Cropredy Festival]]. Mattacks remained with Fairport until 1997. He has rejoined them on occasion, such as at [[Cropredy]] in 2019, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of [[Liege and Lief]].

'''Brillat-Savarin''' is a [[Types of cheese|soft-ripened]] triple cream cow's milk [[cheese]] with at least 72% fat in dry matter (roughly 40% overall).&lt;ref name=&quot;EC&quot;&gt;[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016XC0908(01) European Commission publication of an application on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs, here: Brillat Savarin cheese]&lt;/ref&gt; It has a natural, [[bloomy rind]].  It was created c. 1890 as &quot;Excelsior&quot; or &quot;Délice des gourmets&quot; (&quot;Gourmets' delight&quot;) by the Dubuc family, near [[Forges-les-Eaux]] (Seine-Maritime). Cheese-maker [[Henri Androuet|Henri Androuët]] renamed it in the 1930s, as an homage to 18th-century [[French people|French]] [[Gastronomy|gourmet]] and political figure [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]].&lt;ref&gt; Jean Froc, ''Les Traditions fromagères en France'', Versailles, Quae, 2006, p. 82-83. {{ISBN|2759200175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatchancemedia.com/2007/02/brillat-savarin.html |title=Description and history of Brillat Savarin cheese |access-date=2010-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710225643/http://www.fatchancemedia.com/2007/02/brillat-savarin.html |archive-date=2011-07-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brillat-Savarin is produced all year round mainly in [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]]. It comes in {{convert|12|–|13|cm|abbr=on}} wheels and approximately 4&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and is matured for one to two weeks in dry cellar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://androuet.com/Brillat-Savarin-111.html|title=Brillat-Savarin|last=websan.net|first=Mathieu Lamson-|website=androuet.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available as a fresh cheese (''non affiné'') that resembles rich [[cream cheese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EC&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[triple cream]] soft-ripened cheese that is luscious, creamy and faintly sour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheese.com/brillat-savarin/ Brillat-Savarin cheese]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French cheesemaking company Rouzaire also produces an older Brillat Savarin under the name Pierre Robert. The extra aging time concentrates the proteins and salt in the cheese, resulting in deeper earthy flavors and more intense salty taste.{{cn|date=July 2015}} Wheels of Pierre Robert are physically smaller due to loss of moisture, yet creamier than the regular-aged Brillat Savarin.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

'''Thomas Francis Bayard'''&lt;!-- Oronunciation missing. BĀ-ərd? BĪ-ərd? bah-YAHR? --&gt; (October 29, 1828 – September 28, 1898) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat from [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he served three terms as [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Delaware and made three unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. In 1885, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].  After four years in private life, he returned to the diplomatic arena as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]].

Born in Delaware to a prominent family, Bayard learned politics from his father [[James A. Bayard Jr.]], who also served in the Senate. In 1869, the Delaware legislature elected Bayard to the Senate upon his father's retirement.  A [[Peace Democrat]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Bayard spent his early years in the Senate in opposition to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] policies, especially the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. His conservatism extended to financial matters as he became known as a staunch supporter of the [[gold standard]] and an opponent of [[United States Note|greenbacks]] and [[silver coinage]] which he believed would cause inflation. Bayard's conservative politics made him popular in the South and with Eastern financial interests, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for President which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880 and 1884.

In 1885, President Cleveland appointed Bayard Secretary of State. Bayard worked with Cleveland to promote American trade in the Pacific while avoiding the acquisition of colonies at a time when many Americans clamored for them. He sought increased cooperation with Great Britain, working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal-hunting rights in the waters around the [[Canada–United States border]]. As ambassador, Bayard continued to strive for Anglo-American friendship. This brought him into conflict with his successor at the State Department [[Richard Olney]], when Olney and Cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than Bayard wished in the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]]. His term at the American embassy ended in 1897 and he died the following year.

==Early life and family==
Bayard was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1828, the second son of [[James A. Bayard Jr.]] and Anne ''née'' Francis.{{sfn|Spencer 1880|p=13}} The [[Bayard family]] was prominent in Delaware as Bayard's father would be elected to the United States Senate in 1851. Among Bayard's ancestors were his grandfather [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James A. Bayard]], also a Senator; and great-grandfather [[Richard Bassett (Delaware politician)|Richard Bassett]], who served as Senator from and Governor of Delaware.{{sfn|Spencer 1880|pp=1–9}} Several other relatives served in high office, including Bayard's uncle [[Richard H. Bayard]], another Delaware Senator; and his great-great-uncle [[Nicholas Bayard]], who was [[Mayor of New York City]].{{sfn|Spencer 1880|pp=1–9}} On his mother's side, Bayard descended from Philadelphia lawyer and financier [[Tench Francis Jr.]]{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=4}}

Bayard was educated in private academies in Wilmington and then in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], New York, when his father moved to New York City for business reasons.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=4}} Bayard's father returned to Delaware in 1843, but he remained in New York, working as a clerk in the mercantile firm of his brother-in-law August Schermerhorn.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=4}} In 1846, his father secured him a job in a banking firm in Philadelphia and he worked there for the next two years.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=5}} Bayard was unsatisfied with his progress at the firm and returned to Wilmington to [[read law]] at his father's office.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=5}}

Bayard was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1851, the year his father was elected to the United States Senate.{{efn|Before the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1913, Senators were chosen by their states' legislatures.}} Thomas took on greater responsibilities in the family law office and rose quickly in the legal profession.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=6}} In 1853, after the election of Democratic President [[Franklin Pierce]], Bayard was appointed [[United States Attorney]] for Delaware.{{sfn|Spencer 1880|p=15}} He spent only a year in the position before moving to Philadelphia to open a practice with his friend William Shippen, a partnership that lasted until Shippen's death in 1858.{{sfn|Spencer 1880|p=15}} While in Philadelphia, Bayard met Louise Lee, whom he married in October 1856. The marriage produced twelve children.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=7}}

==Civil War and Reconstruction==
[[Image:TFBayard.jpg|thumb|left|Bayard in about 1870]]
Bayard's return to Wilmington in 1858 brought greater involvement in the political scene.  James Bayard was a delegate to the [[1860 Democratic National Convention]], and Thomas attended with him.  The elder Bayard supported [[Robert M. T. Hunter]] of Virginia for the nomination.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=8}}  When the convention deadlocked and the Southern Democrats split from the main party, James Bayard adhered to the regular Democrats, but told Thomas that he thought the nominee, [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois, was untrustworthy.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=8}}  The subsequent election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Secession in the United States|secession]] of the seven states of the [[Deep South]] led both Bayards to fear for the future of the Union, and the elder Bayard to propose a convention of all the states to resolve their differences.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=8}}  In the meantime, as four more Southern states seceded, James Bayard encouraged his son to help organize an independent militia unit, the Delaware Guard; Thomas Bayard was commissioned as its First Lieutenant.{{sfn|Tansill 1946|p=9}}

She maintained a highly theatrical lifestyle in her house on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed, while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=100}}

Bernhardt repaired her old relationships with the other members of the Comédie Française; she participated in a benefit for Madame Nathalie, the actress she had once slapped. However, she was frequently in conflict with Perrin, the director of the theater. In 1878, during the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition]], she took a flight over Paris with balloonist Pierre Giffard and painter George Clairin, in a balloon decorated with the name of her current character, ''Dona Sol''. An unexpected storm carried the balloon far outside of Paris to a small town. When she returned by train to the city, Perrin was furious; he fined Bernhardt a thousand francs, citing a theater rule which required actors to request permission before they left Paris. Bernhardt refused to pay, and threatened to resign from the Comédie. Perrin recognized that he could not afford to let her go. Perrin and the Minister of Fine Arts arranged a compromise; she withdrew her resignation, and in return was raised to a ''societaire'', the highest rank of the theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=115–117&lt;!-- 110? --&gt;}}

===Triumph in London and departure from the Comédie Française (1879–1880)===
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt 1879.jpg|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt in 1879, by [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]]]
Bernhardt was earning a substantial amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from the [[Parc Monceau]]. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater [[impresario]] named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances in the homes of wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=118}} When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of ''Phèdre'' on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, ''Le Misanthrope'' and ''Les Précieuses''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=118–20}}

On 4 June 1879, just before the opening curtain of her premiere in ''Phèdre,'' she suffered an attack of stage fright. She wrote later that she also pitched her voice too high, and was unable to lower it.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=351–353}} Nonetheless, the performance was a triumph. Though a majority of the audience could not understand Racine's classical French, she captivated them with her voice and gestures; one member of the audience, Sir George Arthur, wrote that &quot;she set every nerve and fiber in their bodies throbbing and held them spellbound.&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=128}} In addition to her performances of ''Zaire'', ''Phèdre'', ''Hernani'', and other plays with her troupe, she gave the private recitals in the homes of British aristocrats arranged by Jarrett, who also arranged an exhibition of her sculptures and paintings in [[Piccadilly]], which was attended by both the prince of Wales and Prime Minister Gladstone. While in London, she added to her personal menagerie of animals. In London, she purchased three dogs, a parrot, and a monkey, and made a side trip to Liverpool, where she purchased a cheetah, a parrot, and a wolfhound and received a gift of six chameleons, which she kept in her rented house on Chester Square, and then took back to Paris.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=130–133}}

Back in Paris, she was increasingly discontented with Perrin and the management of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in a new play, ''L'Aventurière'' by [[Emile Augier]], a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticized by the playwright. She responded, &quot;I know I'm bad, but not as bad as your lines.&quot; The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin, &quot;You forced me to play when I was not ready... what I foresaw came to pass... this is my first failure at the Comédie and my last.&quot; She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs, plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=144}} She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theater was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=142}}

===''La Dame aux camélias'' and first American tour (1880–1881)===
[[File:SarahBernhardt alsKameliendame1881.jpg|thumb|''[[La Dame aux camélias]]'' (1881)]]

In April 1880, as soon as he learned Bernhardt had resigned from the Comédie Française, the impresario Edward Jarrett hurried to Paris and proposed that she make a theatrical tour of England and then the United States. She could select her repertoire and the cast. She would receive 5,000 francs per performance, plus 15% of any earnings over 15,000 francs, plus all of her expenses, plus an account in her name for 100,000 francs, the amount she owed to the Comédie Française. She accepted immediately.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=148–149}}

Now on her own, Bernhardt first assembled and tried out her new troupe at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris. She performed for the first time ''[[La Dame aux Camélias]]'', by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils''. She did not create the role; the play had first been performed by Eugénie Dochein in 1852, but it quickly became her most performed and most famous role. She played the role more than a thousand times, and acted regularly and successfully in it until the end of her life. Audiences were often in tears during her famous death scene at the end.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=146–147}}

She could not perform ''La Dame aux Camélias'' on a London stage because of British censorship laws; instead, she put on four of her proven successes, including ''Hernani'' and ''Phèdre'', plus four new roles, including ''[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]] and the drawing-room comedy ''Frou-frou'' by Meilhac-Halévy, both of which were highly successful on the London stage.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=150}} In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that she was making far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=142–145}}

She and her troupe departed from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'' at Booth's Theater before an audience which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, but it was not necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=163}}

Bernhardt's first American tour carried her to 157 performances in 51 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|9688|Sarah Bernhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled on a special train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverthorne |first=Elizabeth |title=Sarah Bernhardt |url=https://archive.org/details/sarahbernhardt0000silv |url-access=registration |series=Women in the Arts series |year=2003 |publisher=Chelsea House |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7910-7458-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sarahbernhardt0000silv/page/77 77–78]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=159}} From New York, she made a side trip to [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], where she met [[Thomas Edison]], who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from ''Phèdre,'' which has not survived.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos on the back of a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the [[Methodist]] press, which only increased ticket sales.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She performed ''Phèdre'' six times and ''La Dame Aux Camélias'' 65 times (which Jarrett had renamed &quot;Camille&quot; to make it easier for Americans to pronounce, despite the fact that no character in the play has that name). On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of ''Camélias'' in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=188–196}} She described the result of her trip to her friends: &quot;I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which I am most proud.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=174}}

===Return to Paris, European tour, ''Fédora'' to ''Theodora'' (1881–1886)===
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt - Foedora.png|thumb|As ''Fédora'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] (1882)]]

No crowd greeted Bernhardt when she returned to Paris on 5 May 1881, and theater managers offered no new roles; the Paris press ignored her tour, and much of the Paris theater world resented her leaving the most prestigious national theater to earn a fortune abroad.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=198–99}} When no new plays or offers appeared, she went to London for a successful three-week run at the Gaiety Theater. This London tour included the first British performance of ''La Dame aux Camelias'' at the Shaftesbury Theater; her friend, the Prince of Wales, persuaded [[Queen Victoria]] to authorize the performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=176}} Many years later, she gave a private performance of the play for the Queen while she was on holiday in Nice.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=105}} When she returned to Paris, Bernhardt contrived to make a surprise performance at the annual 14 July patriotic spectacle at the Paris Opera, which was attended by the President of France, and a houseful of dignitaries and celebrities. She recited the ''Marseillaise'', dressed in a white robe with a tricolor banner, and at the end dramatically waved the French flag. The audience gave her a standing ovation, showered her with flowers, and demanded that she recite the song two more times.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=200–202}}

With her place in the French theater world restored, Bernhardt negotiated a contract to perform at the Vaudeville Theater in Paris for 1500 francs per performance, as well as 25 percent of the net profit. She also announced that she would not be available to begin until 1882. She departed on a tour of theaters in the French provinces, and then to Italy, Greece, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Austria, and Russia. In [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]], she encountered anti-Semitic crowds who threw stones at her; [[pogroms]] were being conducted, forcing the Jewish population to leave.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=186}} However, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she performed before Czar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], who broke court protocol and bowed to her. During her tour, she also gave performances for King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain, and the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]. The only European country where she refused to play was Germany, due to the German annexation of French territory after the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=206–208}} Just before the tour began, she met [[Jacques Damala]], who went with her as leading man and then, for eight months, became her first and only husband. {{See below|1=Personal life}}
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt as Theodora by Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|''Theodora'', photo by Nadar (1884)]]

When she returned to Paris, she was offered a new role in ''[[Fédora]]'', a melodrama written for her by [[Victorien Sardou]]. It opened on 12 December 1882, with her husband Damala as the male lead, and received good reviews. Critic Maurice Baring wrote, &quot;a secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction, which was at once exotic and cerebral ... She literally hypnotized her audience.&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=218}} Another journalist wrote, &quot;She is incomparable ... The extreme love, the extreme agony, the extreme suffering.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=195}} However, the abrupt end of her marriage shortly after the premiere put her back into financial distress. She had leased and refurbished a theater, the Ambigu, specifically to give her husband leading roles, and made her 18-year-old son Maurice, who had no business experience, the manager. ''Fédora'' ran for just 50 performances and lost 400,000 francs. She was forced to give up the Ambigu, and then, in February 1883, to sell her jewelry, her carriages, and her horses at an auction.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=196–197}}

When Damala left, she took on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright [[Jean Richepin]], who accompanied her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=224–226}} She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King [[Edward VII]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=200}} When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theater of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in a new play by Richepin, ''Nana-Sahib'', a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin's acting were poor, and it quickly closed.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=202}} Richepin then wrote an adaptation of ''[[MacBeth|Macbeth]]'' in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, but it was also a failure. The only person who praised the play was [[Oscar Wilde]], who was then living in Paris. He began writing a play, ''Salomé,'' in French, especially for Bernhardt, though it was quickly banned by British censors and she never performed it.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=228–229}}

Bernhardt then performed a new play by Sardou, ''Theodora'' (1884), a melodrama set in sixth-century [[Byzantium]]. Sardou wrote a nonhistoric but dramatic new death scene for Bernhardt; in his version, the empress was publicly strangled, whereas the historical empress died of cancer. Bernhardt travelled to [[Ravenna]], Italy, to study and sketch the costumes seen in Byzantine mosaic murals, and had them reproduced for her own costumes. The play opened on 26 December 1884 and ran for 300 performances in Paris, and 100 in London, and was a financial success. She was able to pay off most of her debts, and bought a lion cub, which she named Justinian, for her home menagerie.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}} She also renewed her love affair with her former lead actor, Philippe Garnier.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=232–233}}

===World tours (1886–1892)===
[[File:Alfred Stevens (1823–1906) - Maria Magdalena - 1887 - MSK Gent 17-03-2009 12-18-27.JPG|thumb|Bernhardt as [[Mary Magdalene (Stevens)|Mary Magdalene]], painting by [[Alfred Stevens (painter)|Alfred Stevens]] (1887)]]

''Theodora'' was followed by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, ''[[Marion Delorme]]'', written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not give her a chance to show her talents.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} She next put on ''Hamlet'', with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: &quot;I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance what they are going to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}}

In every city she visited, she was feted and cheered by audiences. The actors Edouard Angelo and Philippe Garnier were her leading men. Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] attended all of her performances in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and presented her with a gold bracelet with diamonds, which was almost immediately stolen from her hotel. The two leading actors both fell ill with [[yellow fever]], and her long-time manager, Edward Jarrett, died of a heart attack. Bernhardt was undaunted, however, and went crocodile hunting at [[Guayaquil]], and also bought more animals for her menagerie. Her performances in every city were sold out, and by the end of the tour, she had earned more than a million francs. The tour allowed her to purchase her final home, which she filled with her paintings, plants, souvenirs, and animals.{{Sfn| Tierchant| 2009| pages=214–216}}

From then on, whenever she ran short of money (which generally happened every three or four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in ''La Tosca''. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=248}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When Bernhardt returned from her 1886–87 tour, she received a new invitation to return to the Comédie Française. The theater management was willing to forget the conflict of her two previous periods there, and offered a payment of 150,000 francs a year. The money appealed to her, and she began negotiations. However, the senior members of the company protested the high salary offered, and conservative defenders of the more traditional theater also complained; one anti-Bernhardt critic, Albert Delpit of ''Le Gaulois'', wrote, &quot;Madame Sarah Bernhardt is forty-three; she can no longer be useful to the Comédie. Moreover, what roles could she have? I can only imagine that she could play mothers...&quot; Bernhardt was deeply offended and immediately broke off negotiations.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} She turned once again to Sardou, who had written a new play for her, ''La Tosca'', which featured a prolonged and extremely dramatic death scene at the end. The play was staged at the Porte Saint-Martin Theater, opening on 24 November 1887. It was extremely popular, and critically acclaimed. Bernhardt played the role for 29 consecutive sold-out performances. The success of the play allowed Bernhardt to buy a new pet lion for her household menagerie. She named him Scarpia, after the villain of ''La Tosca''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} The play inspired [[Giacomo Puccini]] to write one of his most famous operas, ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150707005159/http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tosca |Britannica online, ''Tosca'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this success, she acted in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she acted in a stage version of the controversial drama ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' by [[Emile Zola]]. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book's confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, &quot;My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gassner |first1=John |last2=Quinn |first2=Edward |title=Readers' Encyclopedia of World Drama |year=1969 |publisher=Dover Publications |page=935}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then performed another traditional melodrama, ''Francillon'' by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'' in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, ''L'Aveu'', disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with ''[[Jeanne d'Arc]]'' by the poet [[Jules Barbier]], in which the 45-year-old actress played [[Joan of Arc]], a 19-year-old martyr.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=145}} Barbier had previously written the librettos for some of the most famous French operas of the period, including ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]] and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]]. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou and [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Moreau]], ''Cleopatra'', which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable [[Death of Cleopatra|death scene]]. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous [[asp (reptile)|asp]] which bites [[Cleopatra]]. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. &quot;I shall see them,&quot; she explained. &quot;If I catch sight of my hand, it will be the hand of Cleopatra.&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=148}}

Bernhardt's violent portrayal of Cleopatra led to the theatrical story of a matron in the audience exclaiming to her companion &quot;How unlike, how very unlike, the home life of our own dear Queen!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Bernhardt made a two-year world tour (1891–1893) to replenish her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]], and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed every aspect of the theater, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gottlieb| first=Robert| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| url=https://archive.org/details/sarahlifeofsarah00gott| url-access=registration| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/sarahlifeofsarah00gott/page/121 121]| isbn= 978-0300192599}}&lt;/ref&gt; She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to take off their hats during performances, so the rest of the audience could see, and eliminated the prompter's box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theater the common practice of hiring ''claqueurs'' in the audience to applaud stars.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=232}} She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] to design the first of a series of posters for her play ''Gismonda''. He continued to make posters of her for six years.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}

In five years, Bernhardt produced nine plays, three of which were financially successful. The first was a revival of her performance as Phédre, which she took on tour around the world. In 1898, she had another success, in the play ''Lorenzaccio'', playing the male lead role in a Renaissance revenge drama written in 1834 by [[Alfred de Musset]], but never before actually staged. As her biographer [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]] wrote, she did not try to be overly masculine when she performed male roles: &quot;Her male impersonations had the sexless grace of the voices of choirboys, or the not quite real pathos of [[Pierrot]].&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=252}} Anatole France wrote of her performance in ''Lorenzaccio'': &quot;She formed out of her own self a young man melancholic, full of poetry and of truth.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=242}} This was followed by another successful melodrama by Sardou, ''[[Gismonda]]'', one of Bernhardt's few plays not finishing with a dramatic death scene. Her co-star was [[Lucien Guitry]], who also acted as her leading man until the end of her career. Besides Guitry, she shared the stage with Edouard de Max, her leading man in 20 productions, and [[Constant Coquelin]], who frequently toured with her.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=252–254}}

In April 1895, she played the lead role in a romantic and poetic fantasy, ''Princess Lointaine'', by little-known 27-year-old poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. It was not a monetary success and lost 200,000 francs, but it began a long theatrical relationship between Bernhardt and Rostand. Rostand went on to write ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and became one of the most popular French playwrights of the period.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=264}}

In 1898, she performed the female lead in the controversial play ''La Ville Morte'' by the Italian poet and playwright [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]; the play was fiercely attacked by critics because of its theme of incest between brother and sister. Along with Emile Zola and Victorien Sardou, Bernhardt also became an outspoken defender of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer falsely accused of betraying France. The issue divided Parisian society; a conservative newspaper ran the headline, &quot;Sarah Bernhardt has joined the Jews against the Army&quot;, and Bernhardt's own son Maurice condemned Dreyfus; he refused to speak to her for a year.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=259–260}}

At the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Bernhardt staged and performed in several modern plays, but she was not a follower of the more natural school of acting that was coming into fashion at the end of the 19th century, preferring a more dramatic expression of emotions. &quot;In the theater,&quot; she declared, &quot;the natural is good, but the sublime is even better.&quot;{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=234}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Despite her successes, her debts continued to mount, reaching two million gold francs by the end of 1898. Bernhardt was forced to give up the Renaissance, and was preparing to go on another world tour when she learned that a much larger Paris theater, the [[Théâtre des Nations]] on [[Place du Châtelet]], was for lease. The theater had 1,700 seats, twice the size of the Renaissance, enabling her to pay off the cost of performances more quickly; it had an enormous stage and backstage, allowing her to present several different plays a week; and since it was originally designed as a concert hall, it had excellent acoustics. On 1 January 1899, she signed a 25-year lease with the City of Paris, though she was already 55 years old.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=277}}

She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, and began to renovate it to suit her needs. The facade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=278}} She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her most famous roles, painted by Mucha, [[Louise Abbéma]], and Georges Clairin. Her dressing room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play ''L'Aiglon'', was decorated in [[Empire Style]], featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that was filled with the flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=262–63}}

Bernhardt opened the theater on 21 January 1899 with a revival of Sardou's ''La Tosca'', which she had first performed in 1887. This was followed by revivals of her other major successes, including ''Phédre'', ''Theodora'', ''Gismonda'', and ''La Dame aux Camélias'', plus Octave Feuillet's ''Dalila'', Gaston de Wailly's ''Patron Bénic'', and Rostand's ''La Samaritaine,'' a poetic retelling of the story of the [[Samaritan woman at the well]] from the Gospel of St. John. On 20 May, she premiered one of her most famous roles, playing the titular character of ''Hamlet'' in a prose adaptation which she had commissioned from Eugène Morand and [[Marcel Schwob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Robert| first=Gottlieb| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| page=142| isbn= 978-0300192599}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played Hamlet in a manner which was direct, natural, and very feminine.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=260}} Her performance received largely positive reviews in Paris, but mixed reviews in London. The British critic [[Max Beerbohm]] wrote, &quot;the only compliment one can conscientiously pay her is that her Hamlet was, from first to last, a truly ''grand dame''.&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=261}}

In 1900, Bernhardt presented ''L'Aiglon'', a new play by Rostand. She played the [[Napoleon I|Duc de Reichstadt]], the son of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in Vienna. ''L'Aiglon'' was a verse drama, six acts long. The 56-year-old actress studied the walk and posture of young cavalry officers and had her hair cut short to impersonate the young Duke. The Duke's stage mother, [[Marie-Louise of Austria]], was played by Maria Legault, an actress 14 years younger than Berhnardt. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died &quot;as dying angels would die if they were allowed to.&quot;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=260–261}} The play was extremely successful; it was especially popular with visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris International Exposition]], and ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling for as much as 600 gold francs. The play inspired the creation of Bernhardt souvenirs, including statuettes, medallions, fans, perfumes, postcards of her in the role, uniforms and cardboard swords for children, and pastries and cakes; the famed chef [[Escoffier]] added Peach Aiglon with Chantilly Cream to his repertoire of desserts.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=287–288}}

Bernhardt continued to employ Mucha to design her posters, and expanded his work to include theatrical sets, programs, costumes, and jewelry props. His posters became icons of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. To earn more money, Bernhardt set aside a certain number of printed posters of each play to sell to collectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=239–40}}

=== Hamlet (1899) Gender performance ===
[[File:Bernhardt_Hamlet2.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bernhardt_Hamlet2.jpg|left|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt preforming as Hamlet]]
In the greater lens of [[feminism]], Bernhardt represent the ways a female can embody more than femininity. Through cross gender casting, such as her role as [[Hamlet]] in 1899, Bernhardt has taken up a former male space and character. By playing the role of a male character, Bernhardt emphasizes the manner in which such productions destabilize the concept of a ‘universal’ Shakespeare: ‘By casting a woman in a male role, these productions work against this notion of universality, particularly through the actresses’ disruptions of the iconicity of Shakespeare’s greatest male characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schupak|first=Esther B.|date=2019-04-03|title=Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women performing gender in Julius Caesar|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569783.2018.1561255|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=155–172|doi=10.1080/13569783.2018.1561255|issn=1356-9783}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gap between the gender of the actual actor and the gender of the intended actor opens an interesting discursive space for interpretation of and highlighting the ideological and social divides across which we play texts&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;. These kinds of gendered choices and negotiating ambiguities have opened new avenues for interpretation of character and actor/actress relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After her season in Paris, Bernhardt performed ''L'Aiglon'' in London, and then made her sixth tour to the United States. On this tour, she traveled with Constant Coquelin, then the most popular leading man in France. Bernhardt played the secondary role of Roxanne to his [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], a role which he had premiered, and he co-starred with her as Flambeau in ''L'Aiglon'' and as the first grave-digger in ''Hamlet''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=265–270}}

She also changed, for the first time, her resolution not to perform in Germany or the &quot;occupied territories&quot; of Alsace and Lorraine. In 1902, at the invitation of the French ministry of culture, she took part in the first cultural exchange between Germany and France since the 1870 war. She performed ''L'Aiglon'' 14 times in Germany; [[Kaiser William II]] of Germany attended two performances and hosted a dinner in her honor in Potsdam.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=290–291}}

During her German tour, she began to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, probably connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in ''L'Aiglon''. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilization of her leg. Bernhardt promised to see a doctor when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

In 1903, she had another unsuccessful role playing another masculine character in the opera ''[[Werther]]'', a gloomy adaptation of the story by German writer [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. However, she quickly came back with another hit, ''La Sorcière'' by Sardou. She played a Moorish sorceress in love with a Christian Spaniard, leading to her persecution by the church. This story of tolerance, coming soon after the Dreyfus affair, was financially successful, with Bernhardt often giving both a matinee and evening performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

Between 1904 and 1906, she appeared in a wide range of parts, including in ''[[Francesca di Rimini]]'' by [[Francis Marion Crawford]], the role of Fanny in ''[[Sappho]]'' by [[Alphonse Daudet]], the magician [[Circe]] in a play by Charles Richet, the part of [[Marie Antoinette]] in the historic drama ''Varennes'' by Lavedan and Lenôtre, the part of the prince-poet Landry in a version of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' by Richepin and [[Henri Cain]], and a new version of the play ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' by [[symbolist]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], in which she played the male role of Pelléas with the British actress [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Melissande.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=297–298}} She also starred in a new version of ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'', which she wrote herself, different from the earlier version which had been written for her by Scribe. During this time, she wrote a drama, ''Un Coeur d'Homme'', in which she had no part, which was performed at the Théâtre des Arts, but lasted only three performances.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=294}} She also taught acting briefly at the Conservatory, but found the system there too rigid and traditional. Instead, she took aspiring actresses and actors into her company, trained them, and used them as unpaid extras and bit players.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=292}}

[[File:Mme. Sarah Bernhardt in Phédre, Hearst Greek Theatre, May 17, '06, Act 3 LCCN2007663412.tif|thumb|upright=3.0|Bernhardt performing ''Phédre'' at [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] in Berkeley, California (May 1906)]]

Bernhardt made her first American Farewell Tour in 1905–1906, the first of four farewell tours she made to the US, Canada, and Latin America, with her new managers, the Shubert brothers. She attracted controversy and press attention when, during her 1905 visit to Montreal, the Roman Catholic bishop encouraged his followers to throw eggs at Bernhardt, because she portrayed prostitutes as sympathetic characters. The US portion of the tour was complicated due to the Shuberts' competition with the powerful syndicate of theater owners which controlled nearly all the major theaters and opera houses in the United States. The syndicate did not allow outside producers to use their stages. As a result, in Texas and Kansas City, Bernhardt and her company performed under an enormous circus tent, seating 4,500 spectators, and in skating rinks in Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa, and other cities. Her private train took her to Knoxville, Dallas, Denver, Tampa, Chattanooga, and Salt Lake City, then on to the West Coast. She could not play in San Francisco because of the recent [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but she performed across the bay in the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] at the University of California at Berkeley, and gave a recital, titled ''A Christmas Night during the Terror'', for inmates at San Quentin penitentiary.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=288–289}}

Her tour continued into South America, where it was marred by a more serious event: at the conclusion of ''La Tosca'' in Rio de Janeiro, she leaped, as always, from the wall of the fortress to plunge to her death in the Tiber. This time, however, the mattress on which she was supposed to land had been positioned incorrectly. She landed on her right knee, which had already been damaged in earlier tours. She fainted and was taken from the theater on a stretcher, but refused to be treated in a local hospital. She later sailed by ship from Rio to New York. When she arrived, her leg had swollen, and she was immobilized in her hotel for 15 days before returning to France.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=305–306}}

In 1906–1907, the French government finally awarded Bernhardt the Legion of Honor, but only in her role as a theater director, not as an actress. However, the award at that time required a review of the recipients' moral standards, and Bernhardt's behavior was still considered scandalous. Bernhardt ignored the snub and continued to play both inoffensive and controversial characters. In November 1906, she starred in ''La Vierge d'Avila, ou La Courtisan de Dieu'', by [[Catulle Mendes]], playing [[Saint Teresa of Ávila|Saint Theresa]], followed on 27 January 1907 by ''Les Bouffons'', by Miguel Zamocois, in which she played a young and amorous medieval lord.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=308–309}} In 1909, she again played the 19-year-old Joan of Arc in ''Le Procès de Jeanne d'Arc'' by [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]]. French newspapers encouraged schoolchildren to view her personification of French patriotism.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=295–96}}

Despite the injury to her leg, she continued to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=310}} In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born [[Lou Tellegen]], a very handsome actor who had served as a model for the sculpture ''Eternal Springtime'' by [[Auguste Rodin]], and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in ''Phedre'', where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of [[Judas Iscariot]] in ''Judas'' by the American playwright [[John Wesley De Kay]]. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Feilitzsch |first=Heribert |year=2012 |title=In Plain Sight: Felix A.

In April 1912, Bernhardt presented a new production in her theater, ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'', a romantic costume drama by Émile Moreau about [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s romances with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] and [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]]. It was lavish and expensive, but was a monetary failure, lasting only 12 performances. Fortunately for Bernhardt, she was able to pay off her debt with the money she received from the American producer [[Adolph Zukor]] for a film version of the play.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=318–319}} {{See below|1=Motion pictures}}

She departed on her third farewell tour of the United States in 1913–1914, when she was 69. Her leg had not yet fully healed, and she was unable to perform an entire play, only selected acts. She also separated from her co-star and lover of the time, Lou Tellegen. When the tour ended, he remained in the United States, where he briefly became a silent movie star, while she returned to France in May 1913.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=320}}

===Amputation of leg and wartime performances (1914–1918)===
In December 1913, Bernhardt performed another success with the drama ''Jeanne Doré''. On 16 March, she was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]]. Despite her successes, she was still short of money. She had made her son Maurice the director of her new theater, and permitted him to use the receipts of the theater to pay his gambling debts, eventually forcing her to pawn some of her jewels to pay her bills.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=314–316}}

In 1914, she went as usual to her holiday home on [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]] with her family and close friends. There, she received the news of the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the beginning of the [[First World War]]. She hurried back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that [[gangrene]] had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV style]], with white sides and gilded trim.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=318–320}}

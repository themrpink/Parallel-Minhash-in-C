==Situation==
[[Image:Segesta, Teatro greco (2).jpg|thumb|right|The Greek theater]]
The ruins of the city are located on the top of Monte Bàrbaro at 305&amp;nbsp;m [[above sea level]]. The city was protected by steep slopes on several sides and by walls on the more gentle slope towards the temple.

The hilltop offers a view over the valley towards the Gulf of Castellamare. The city controlled several major roads between the coast to the north and the hinterland. Very little is known about the city plan. Aerial photography indicates a regular city plan, built in part on terraces to overcome the natural sloping terrain. The current remains might be from the reconstruction after the destruction of the city by Agathocles.

Current archaeological work indicates that the site was reoccupied by a Muslim community in the Norman period. Excavations have unearthed a Muslim necropolis and a mosque from the 12th century next to a Norman castle. Evidence suggests that the mosque was destroyed after the arrival of a new Christian overlord at the beginning of the 13th century. The city appears to have been finally abandoned by the second half of the 13th century.

== The temple ==
[[File:Cole Thomas The Temple of Segesta with the Artist Sketching 1843.jpg|thumb|right|Segesta Temple in [[Thomas Cole]]´s picture from 1843]]
On a hill just outside the site of the ancient city of Segesta lies an unusually well preserved [[Doric order|Doric]] temple. It is thought to have been built in the 420s BC by an Athenian architect, despite the city not having a large Greek population.&lt;ref&gt;Scully, Vincent. 1969. The earth, the temple, and the gods; Greek sacred architecture. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple has six by fourteen columns on a base measuring 21 by 56&amp;nbsp;meters, on a platform three steps high. Several elements suggest that the temple was never finished. The columns have not been fluted as they normally would have been in a Doric temple and there are still bosses present in the blocks of the base (used for lifting the blocks into place but then normally removed). The temple also lacks a [[cella]], any ornamentation, altar or deity dedication, and was never roofed over.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell, Isabel Hoopes. 1943. Greek temples.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple escaped destruction by the Carthaginians in the late 5th century.

'''''The Hollywood Revue of 1929''''', or simply '''''The Hollywood Revue''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1930|publisher=AMPAS|title=The 2nd Academy Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] [[musical comedy]] film released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was the studio's second feature-length musical, and one of their earliest [[sound film]]s. Produced by [[Harry Rapf]] and [[Irving Thalberg]] and directed by [[Charles Reisner]], it features nearly all of MGM's stars in a two-hour [[revue]] that includes three segments in [[Technicolor]]. The [[Master of ceremonies|masters of ceremonies]] are [[Conrad Nagel]] and [[Jack Benny]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation {{ISBN|0-634-00765-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Unlike M-G-M's imposing feature films, which always boasted strong story values, ''The Hollywood Revue of 1929'' was a plotless parade of variety acts. Conrad Nagel, interviewed for the book ''The Real Tinsel'', recalled, &quot;Everybody thought Harry Rapf was crazy for making it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverstein|first1=Harry|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Bernard |title=The Real Tinsel|url=https://archive.org/details/realtinsel00rose|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Macmillan|page=[https://archive.org/details/realtinsel00rose/page/189 189]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billed as an &quot;All-Star Musical Extravaganza&quot;, the film includes performances by once and future stars, including [[Joan Crawford]] singing and dancing on stage. (She later remarked, &quot;''Revue'' was one of those let's-throw-everyone-on-the-lot-into-a musical things, but I did a good song-and-dance number.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newquist|first1=Roy|last2=Crawford|first2=Joan |title=Conversations with Joan Crawford|year=1980|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-0-8065-0720-0|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other segments feature [[Gus Edwards (vaudeville)|Gus Edwards]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Bessie Love]], [[Marion Davies]], [[Anita Page]], and the comedy team of [[Karl Dane]] and [[George K. Arthur]].

Highlights of the film are a comedy routine starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]] as inept magicians, and a variety of musical performances. One of these is the debut of &quot;[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]&quot;, performed initially by [[Cliff Edwards]] as &quot;Ukulele Ike,'&quot; and later performed at the end of the film by the entire cast. This latter all-star color sequence was a last-minute addition to the film, shot late at night on June 10, 1929, just ten days before the premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]. The only major M-G-M stars missing from the revue are [[Greta Garbo]], [[Ramon Novarro]], and [[Lon Chaney]], although Chaney is referred to by name in one of the songs performed and Garbo is spoken of during one of the introductory dialogues. Only one sequence was cut from the film: three songs by [[The Brox Sisters]], which was recycled into a short subject, ''Gems of MGM''. Another sequence, a parody of the Albertina Rasch ballet's &quot;pearl dance&quot; by [[Marie Dressler]], was planned but not shot (as the film's production records reveal). Instead, the number was replaced by one featuring Buster Keaton, though Dressler did pose for stills wearing a [[Lady Godiva]] wig.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The film is sometimes cited, as on the [[DVD]] release of the 1952 ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', as the film that led to the downfall of Gilbert's career. Gilbert, a popular [[silent film]] actor best known for his work opposite Garbo, possessed a pleasant, tenor speaking voice which did not always match his heroic, dashing screen image. In ''Hollywood Revue'' he plays the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' with [[Norma Shearer]], first straight, then for laughs with contemporary slang. It is possible, though, that the negative effect of the film on Gilbert's career has been overstated, since many contemporary reviews made no criticism of his performance.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/08/15/archives/the-screen-fun-and-catchy-music.html |title=The Screen |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |author-link=Mordaunt Hall |date=August 15, 1929 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His problems really began with the next two films he made, ''[[His Glorious Night]]'' (1929) and ''Redemption'' (1930).

== Reception ==
The film, which was shot in 25 days with a budget of US$426,000, was popular with audiences and critics alike, especially in its initial big-city engagements. &quot;Brimming over with good fun and catchy music&quot;, [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/08/15/archives/the-screen-fun-and-catchy-music.html |title=The Screen |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |author-link=Mordaunt Hall |date=August 15, 1929 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it &quot;the top novelty film to be turned out to date....If the theater booths give it an even break, nothing can stop it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=June 27, 1929 |title=Hollywood Revue |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |pages=12, 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Film Daily]]'' reported, &quot;A smash and a wow. Smart revue with plenty of comedy beautifully dressed and a cast that is gilt-edged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=August 18, 1929 |title=Hollywood Revue of 1929 |magazine=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, Inc. |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it &quot;the most extravagant and extensive musical comedy so far presented by the talking pictures, and is in itself a complete evening's entertainment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mosher |first=John |author-link=John Mosher (writer) |date=August 24, 1929 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film went on to make a profit of $1.1 million&lt;ref name=&quot;Mannix&quot; /&gt; and was considered for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] (there were no official nominations at that point in [[Motion Picture Association of America]] history).&lt;ref name=&quot;bradley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Edwin M. |title=The First Hollywood Musicals: A Critical Filmography Of 171 Features, 1927 Through 1932|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2029-2|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Rapf tried to follow it up with another revue, ''The Hollywood Revue of 1930'', which was changed during production to ''[[The March of Time (MGM musical)|The March of Time]]'', and finally abandoned. Musical numbers already shot for the film were edited into M-G-M short subjects of the early 1930s.

==Alternate version==
Some sources list the original running time of &quot;Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; as 130 minutes. At least two sequences in the original roadshow version are missing from current prints: an opening recitation by the showgirls who are seen posing in the &quot;Hollywood Revue&quot; sign after the opening credits, and the appearance of [[Nils Asther]], who assisted [[Jack Benny]] in introducing the final &quot;Orange Blossom&quot; number.

== Preservation ==
The film survives intact with its original [[Technicolor]] sequences. It was released on [[laserdisc]] in the 1990s from MGM/UA Home Video, and on DVD in 2009 through the [[Warner Archive Collection]].

The capital city of Calabria is [[Catanzaro]]. The [[Regional Council of Calabria]] is based at the [[Palazzo Campanella]] in the city of [[Reggio Calabria]]. The region is bordered to the north by the [[Basilicata]] Region, to the west by the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and to the east by the [[Ionian Sea]]. The [[Strait of Messina]] separates it from the island of [[Sicily]]. The region covers {{convert|15080|km²|0|abbr=on}} and has a population of just under 2&amp;nbsp;million. The [[demonym]] of Calabria is ''calabrese'' in Italian and ''Calabrian'' in English.

In antiquity the name Calabria referred, not as in modern times to the toe, but to the heel tip of Italy, from Tarentum southwards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria Lewis and Short Latin Dictionary, entry &quot;Calabria&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904071133/http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#Calabria |date=4 September 2018 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; a region nowadays known as [[Salento]].

== Etymology ==
Starting in the third century BC, the name ''Calabria'' was originally given to the Adriatic coast of the [[Salento]] peninsula in modern [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Carpenter |editor1-first=T. H. |editor2-last=Lynch |editor2-first=K. M. |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=E. G.

The whole region of Apulia received the name ''Regio II Apulia et Calabria''. By this time modern Calabria was still known as ''Bruttium'', after the [[Bruttians]] who inhabited the region. Later in the seventh century AD, the [[Byzantine Empire]] created the Duchy of Calabria from the Salento and the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] part of Bruttium. Even though the Calabrian part of the duchy was conquered by the [[Longobards]] during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, the Byzantines continued to use the name ''Calabria'' for their remaining territory in Bruttium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Colafemmina | first=Cesare | title=The Jews in Calabria | date=2012 | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden, The Netherlands | isbn=9789004234123 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSYyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern name ''Italy'' derives from ''Italia'', which was first used as a name for the southern part of modern Calabria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | author-link=Dionysius of Halicarnassus | title=Roman Antiquities | year=1937 | publisher=Harvard University Press | chapter=1.35 | chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Strabo | author-link=Strabo | year=1924 | editor-last=Jones | editor-first=H.

After the Roman conquest of the region, the name was used for the entire Italian peninsula and eventually the Alpine region too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pallottino | first=Missimo | title=A History of Earliest Italy |year=2014 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York City, New York | isbn=9781317696827 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nk7XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is generally known as the “toe” of [[Italian Peninsula|the “boot” of Italy]] and is a long and narrow peninsula which stretches from north to south for {{convert|248|km|0|abbr=on}}, with a maximum width of {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}}. Some 42% of Calabria's area, corresponding to 15,080&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is mountainous, 49% is hilly, while plains occupy only 9% of the region's territory. It is surrounded by the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas. It is separated from [[Sicily]] by the [[Strait of Messina]], where the narrowest point between [[Capo Peloro]] in [[Sicily]] and [[Punta Pezzo]] in Calabria is only {{convert|3.2|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Three mountain ranges are present: [[Pollino]], [[La Sila]] and [[Aspromonte]], each with its own flora and fauna. The [[Pollino Mountains]] in the north of the region are rugged and form a natural barrier separating Calabria from the rest of Italy. Parts of the area are heavily wooded, while others are vast, wind-swept plateaus with little vegetation. These mountains are home to a rare [[Bosnian Pine]] variety and are included in the [[Pollino National Park]], which is the largest national park in Italy, covering 1,925.65 square kilometres.

[[La Sila]], which has been referred to as the &quot;Great Wood of Italy&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|title=Journeys|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702124802/https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/the-calabria--national-park.php|title=The Calabria National Park, sila Grande and Sila Piccola|website=www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|title=attivita_montagna – Costa Tiziana|access-date=28 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065125/http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a vast mountainous plateau about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and stretches for nearly {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=off}} along the central part of Calabria. The highest point is [[Botte Donato]], which reaches {{convert|1928|m|abbr=off}}. The area boasts numerous lakes and dense coniferous forests. La Sila also has some of the tallest trees in Italy which are called the &quot;Giants of the Sila&quot; and can reach up to {{convert|40|m|abbr=off}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discoveries-in-sicily-and-calabria.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-giants-of-sila.html|title=The giants of the sila}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igigantidellasila.it/en/actuality-culture/95-the-giants-of-the-sila-memories-and-history-of-a-biogenetic-reserve|title=The Giants of the Sila: memories and history of a biogenetic reserve – I Giganti della Sila|access-date=21 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221155346/http://www.igigantidellasila.it/en/actuality-culture/95-the-giants-of-the-sila-memories-and-history-of-a-biogenetic-reserve|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.italytraveller.com/en/e/the-forest-of-giants|title=The Forest of Giants|website=www.ItalyTraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sila National Park is also known to have the purest air in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKXrJmG5bmI|title=Water, woodland, silence: the Sila Park|last=Rai|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aspromonte]] massif forms the southernmost tip of the Italian peninsula bordered by the sea on three sides. This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Montalto, at {{convert|1,995|m|abbr=off}}, and is full of wide, man-made terraces that slope down towards the sea.

Most of the lower terrain in Calabria has been agricultural for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the [[prickly pear cactus]]. The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and orchards of citrus fruit, including the [[Diamante citron]]. Further up, olives and chestnut trees appear while in the higher regions there are often dense forests of oak, pine, beech and fir trees.

== Climate ==

Calabria's climate is influenced by the sea and mountains. The [[Mediterranean climate]] is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons, with an average low of {{convert|8|°C|0}} during the winter months and an average high of {{convert|30|°C|0}} during the summer months. Mountain areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter. The erratic behavior of the Tyrrhenian Sea can bring heavy rainfall on the western slopes of the region, while hot air from Africa makes the east coast of Calabria dry and warm. The mountains that run along the region also influence the climate and temperature of the region. The east coast is much warmer and has wider temperature ranges than the west coast. The geography of the region causes more rain to fall along the west coast than that of the east coast, which occurs mainly during winter and autumn and less during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italyaround.com/en/calabria-climate-when-to-go-to-calabria/|title=Calabria climate: when to go to Calabria – Italy: travel, recipes, family and health|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are the two extremes of climate in Calabria, the warm mediterranean subtype on the coastline and the highland climate of Monte Scuro.

Calabria is commonly considered part of the &quot;Calabrian Arc&quot;, an arc-shaped geographic domain extending from the southern part of the [[Basilicata]] Region to the northeast of [[Sicily]], and including the [[Peloritani|Peloritano Mountains]] (although some authors extend this domain from [[Naples]] in the north to [[Palermo]] in the southwest). The Calabrian area shows basement (crystalline and metamorphic rocks) of [[Paleozoic]] and younger ages, covered by (mostly Upper) [[Neogene]] sediments. Studies have revealed that these rocks comprise the upper part of a pile of thrust sheets which dominate the [[Apennines]] and the Sicilian [[Maghrebides]].&lt;ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'&gt;van Dijk, J.P., Bello, M., Brancaleoni, G.P., Cantarella, G., Costa, V., Frixa, A., Golfetto, F., Merlini, S., Riva, M., Toricelli, S., Toscano, C., and Zerilli, A. (2000, a); A new structural model for the northern sector of the Calabrian Arc. Tectonophysics, 324, 267–320.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Neogene]] evolution of the Central Mediterranean system is dominated by the migration of the Calabrian Arc to the southeast, overriding the African Plate and its promontories (Argand, 1922;&lt;ref name ='Argand_1922'&gt;Argand, E. (1922); La tectonique de l'Asie. Comptes Rendus 3rd Int. Geol. Congr., Liège (Be), 1922, 1, 171–372.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boccaletti and Guazzone, 1972&lt;ref name ='Boccaletti-and-Guazzone_1972, b'&gt;Boccaletti, M., and Guazzone, G. (1972, b); Evoluzione paleogeografica e geodinamica del Mediterraneo: i bacini marginali. Mem. Soc. geol. It., 13, 162–169.&lt;/ref&gt;). The main tectonic elements of the Calabrian Arc are the Southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, the &quot;Calabria-Peloritani&quot;, or simply Calabrian block and the Sicilian Maghrebides fold-and-thrust belt. The foreland area is formed by the [[Apulia]] Platform, which is part of the [[Adriatic]] Plate, and the [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] or [[Iblean]] Platform, which is an extension of the African Plate. These platforms are separated by the [[Ionian Basin]]. The [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] oceanized basin is regarded as the [[back-arc basin]]. This [[subduction]] system therefore shows the southern plates of African affinity subducting below the northern plates of European affinity.&lt;ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/&gt;

The geology of Calabria has been studied for more than a century. For details concerning the older literature, i.e. from before 1973, the reader is referred to the review of Ogniben (1973).&lt;ref name ='Ogniben_1973'&gt;Ogniben, Leo (1973); Schema geologico della Calabria in base ai dati odierni.

The earlier works were mainly dedicated to the evolution of the basement rocks of the area. The Neogene sedimentary successions were merely regarded as &quot;post-orogenic&quot; infill of &quot;neo-tectonic&quot; tensional features. In the course of time, however, a shift can be observed in the temporal significance of these terms, from post-[[Eocene]] to post-Early [[Miocene]] to post-middle [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/&gt;

The region is seismically active and is generally ascribed to the re-establishment of an equilibrium after the latest (mid-Pleistocene) deformation phase. Some authors believe that the subduction process is still ongoing, which is a matter of debate (van Dijk &amp; Scheepers, 1995).&lt;ref name ='van Dijk-and-Scheepers_1995'&gt;van Dijk, J.P., and Scheepers, P.J.J.

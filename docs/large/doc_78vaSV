===Bourbons of Parma===
Elisabeth Farnese's ambitions were realized at the conclusion of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748 when the [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]], already occupied by Spanish troops, were ceded by Austria to her second son, [[Philip of Parma|Philip]], and combined with the former [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] duchy of [[Guastalla]]. Elisabeth died in 1766.

Upon the fall of the French Empire, Ferdinand I was restored to the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1815, founding the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]. His subjects revolted in 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution; Austria invaded in March 1821 and revoked the constitution. He was succeeded by his son, [[Francis I of the Two Sicilies|Francis I]], in 1825 and by his grandson, [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II]], in 1830. Another revolution erupted in January 1848 and Ferdinand was also forced to grant a constitution. This constitution was revoked in 1849. Ferdinand was succeeded by his son, [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]], in May 1859.

When [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] captured Naples in 1860, Francis restored the constitution in an attempt to save his sovereignty. He fled to the fortress of [[Gaeta]], which was [[siege of Gaeta (1861)|captured by the Piedmontese troops]] in February 1861; his kingdom was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861, after the fall the fortress of [[Messina]] (surrendered on 12 March), although the Neapolitan troops in [[Civitella del Tronto]] resisted three days longer.

After the fall of Napoleon, Napoleon's wife, [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Maria Louisa]], was made Duchess of Parma. As compensation, Charles Louis, the former king of Etruria, was made the Duke of Lucca. When Maria Louisa died in 1847 he was restored to Parma as [[Charles II of Parma|Charles II]]. Lucca was incorporated into Tuscany. He was succeeded by his son, [[Charles III of Parma|Charles III]], and grandson, [[Robert I of Parma|Robert I]], in 1854. The people of Parma voted for a union with the kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. After Italian unification the next year, the Bourbon dynasty in Italy was no more.

Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne of Spain in March 1814. Like his Italian Bourbon counterpart, his subjects revolted against him in January 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution. A French army invaded in 1823 and the constitution was revoked. Ferdinand married his fourth wife, [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]], the daughter of Francis I, the Bourbon king of Sicily, in 1829. Despite his many marriages he did not have a son, so in 1833 he was influenced by his wife to abolish the [[Salic Law]] so that their daughter, Isabella, could become queen depriving his brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]], of the throne.

[[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] succeeded her father when he died in 1833. She was only three years old and Maria Cristina, her mother, served as regent. Maria knew that she needed the support of the liberals to oppose Don Carlos so she granted a constitution in 1834. Don Carlos found his [[Carlism|greatest support]] in Catalonia and the Basques country because the constitution centralized the provinces thus denying them the autonomy they sought. He was defeated and fled the country in 1839. Isabella was declared of age in 1843 and she married her cousin Francisco de Asis, the son of her father's brother, on 10 October 1846. A military revolution broke out against Isabella in 1868 and she was deposed on 29 September. She abdicated in favor of her son, Alfonso, in 1870, but Spain was proclaimed a republic for a brief time.

When the [[First Spanish Republic]] failed the crown was offered to Isabella's son who accepted on 1 January 1875 as [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]]. [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]], who returned to Spain, was again defeated and resumed his exile in February 1876. Alfonso granted a new constitution in July 1876 that was more liberal than the one granted by his grandmother. His reign was cut short when he died in 1885 at the age of twenty-eight.

[[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] was born on 17 May 1886 after the death of his father. His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Christina]], the second wife of Alfonso XII served as regent. Alfonso XIII was declared of age in 1902 and he married Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena of Battenberg, the granddaughter of the British queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], on 31 May 1906. He remained neutral during World War I, but supported the military coup of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] on 13 September 1923. A movement towards the establishment of a republic began in 1930 and Alfonso fled the country on 14 April 1931. He never formally abdicated, but lived the rest of his life in exile. He died in 1941.

The Bourbon dynasty seemed finished in Spain as in the rest of the world, but it would be resurrected. The Second Spanish Republic was overthrown in the [[Spanish Civil War]], leading to the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]]. He named [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borbón]], a grandson of Alfonso XIII, his successor in 1969. When Franco died six years later, Juan Carlos I took the throne to restore the Bourbon dynasty. The new king oversaw the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]; the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] recognized the monarchy.

Since 1964 the Bourbon-Parma line has reigned agnatically in Luxembourg through Grand Dukes [[Jean of Luxembourg|Jean]] and his son [[Henri of Luxembourg|Henri]]. In June 2011, Luxembourg adopted absolute primogeniture, replacing the old Semi-Salic law that might have guaranteed the survival of Bourbon rule for generations.

Though it is not as powerful as it once was and no longer reigns in its native country of France, the House of Bourbon is by no means extinct and has survived to the present-day world, predominantly composed of republics.

The House of Bourbon, in its surviving branches, is believed to be the oldest royal dynasty of Europe (and the oldest documented European family altogether) that is still existing in the direct male line today: The [[House of Capet]]'s male ancestors, the [[Robertians]], go back to [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (d. 807) as their first secured ancestor and he is believed to be a direct male descendant of Charibert de Haspengau (c. 555–636). Should this be true, only the [[Imperial House of Japan]] would outmatch the Bourbon's age, being reliably documented – as a ruling house already – from about 540. The [[House of Hesse]] traces its line back to 841, the [[House of Welf|House of Welf-Este]] and the [[House of Wettin]] are both emerging in the 10th century (and so do some Italian non-ruling houses like the [[Caetani]] or the [[Massimo family]]), whereas most of the other ruling families of Europe only turn up to the light of history after the year 1000.

==Surnames used==
Officially, the [[King of France]] had no family name. A prince with the rank of ''[[fils de France]]'' (Son of France) is surnamed &quot;''de France''&quot;; all the male-line descendants of each ''fils de France'', however, took his main title (whether an [[appanage]] or a [[courtesy title]]) as their family or last name. However, when [[Louis XVI]] was put on trial and later &quot;[[guillotined]]&quot; (executed) by the revolutionaries [[National Convention]] in France in 1793, they somewhat contemptuously referred to him in written documents and spoken address as &quot;Citizen Louis Capet&quot; as if a &quot;commoner&quot; (referring back to the [[Medieval]] origins of the Bourbon Dynasty's name and referring to [[Hugh Capet]], founder of the [[Capetian dynasty]]).

Members of the House of Bourbon-Condé and its cadet branches, which never ascended to the throne, used the surname &quot;de Bourbon&quot; until their extinction in 1830.

The daughters of [[Gaston, Duke of Orléans]], were the first members of the House of Bourbon since the accession of Henry IV to take their surname from the appanage of their father (d'Orléans). Gaston died without a male heir; his titles reverted to the crown. It was given to his nephew, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]], brother of Louis XIV, whose descendants still bear the surname.

When Philippe, grandson of Louis XIV, became King of Spain as [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], he gave up his French titles. As a Son of France, his actual surname was &quot;de France&quot;. However, since that surname was not heritable for descendants of rank lower than Son of France, and since Philippe had already given up his French titles, his descendants simply took the name of their royal house as their surname (&quot;de Bourbon&quot;, rendered in Spanish as &quot;de Borbón&quot;).

The children of Philippe's brother, [[Charles, Duke of Berry (1686–1714)|Charles, Duke of Berry]] (all of whom died in infancy), were given the surname &quot;d'Alencon&quot;. He was Duke of Berry only [[courtesy title|in name]], so the surname of his children was taken from his first substantial duchy.

The children of Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, brother of Louis XVI, were surnamed &quot;d'Artois&quot;. When Charles succeeded to the throne as [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], his son [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Louis Antoine]] became a Son of France, with the corresponding change in surname. His grandson, [[Henry, Count of Chambord|Henri d'Artois]], being merely a Grandson of France, would use the surname until his death.

'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed-upon conventions developed over time.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]], as set out in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Poetics]]. For Aristotle, [[poetry]] ([[ode]]s, [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had specific design features that supported appropriate content of each genre. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, for example, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. Musician, Ezra LaFleur, argues that discussion of genre should draw from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s idea of [[family resemblance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;What is Classical Music? A Family Resemblance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ezra LaFleur|url=https://www.ezralafleur.com/what-is-classical-music-a-family-resemblance/|title=What is Classical Music? A Family Resemblance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genres are helpful labels for communicating but do not necessarily have a single attribute that is the essence of the genre.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]]) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the &quot;[[hierarchy of genres]]&quot; was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:
* [[History painting]], including narrative, religious, mythological and allegorical subjects
* [[Portrait painting]]
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape (landscapists were the &quot;common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art&quot; according to the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]) and cityscape
* [[Animal painter|Animal painting]]
* [[Still life]]

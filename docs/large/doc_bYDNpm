The name of any interval is further qualified using the terms '''perfect''' ('''P'''), [[Major and minor|major]] ('''M'''), [[Major and minor|minor]] ('''m'''), [[Augmentation (music)|augmented]] ('''A'''), and [[Diminution|diminished]] ('''d'''). This is called its ''interval quality''. It is possible to have doubly diminished and doubly augmented intervals, but these are quite rare, as they occur only in [[chromatic]] contexts. The quality of a [[#Compound intevals|compound interval]] is the quality of the simple interval on which it is based.

==== Perfect ====
[[Image:Perfect intervals on C.png|thumb|Perfect intervals on C. {{audio|Unison on C.mid|PU}}, {{audio|Perfect fourth on C.mid|P4}}, {{audio|Perfect fifth on C.mid|P5}}, {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|P8}}.]]
Perfect intervals are so-called because they were traditionally considered perfectly consonant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber&quot;&gt;
[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_20oBAAAAYAAJ &lt;!-- quote=perfect concord. --&gt; Definition of ''Perfect consonance''] in Godfrey Weber's General music teacher, by Godfrey Weber, 1841.&lt;/ref&gt;
although in Western classical music the perfect fourth was sometimes regarded as a less than perfect consonance, when its function was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]].{{Vague|date=February 2013}} Conversely, minor, major, augmented or diminished intervals are typically considered less consonant, and were traditionally classified as mediocre consonances, imperfect consonances, or dissonances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber&quot;/&gt;

Within a [[diatonic scale]]{{efn|name=diatonic}} all unisons ('''P1''') and octaves ('''P8''') are perfect. Most fourths and fifths are also perfect ('''P4''' and '''P5'''), with five and seven semitones respectively. One occurrence of a fourth is augmented ('''A4''') and one fifth is diminished ('''d5'''), both spanning six semitones. For instance, in a C-major scale, the '''A4''' is between F and B, and the '''d5''' is between B and F (see table).

By definition, the [[Inversion (music)#Intervals|inversion]] of a perfect interval is also perfect. Since the inversion does not change the [[pitch class]] of the two notes, it hardly affects their level of consonance (matching of their [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonics]]). Conversely, other kinds of intervals have the opposite quality with respect to their inversion. The inversion of a major interval is a minor interval, the inversion of an augmented interval is a diminished interval.

==== Major and minor ====
[[Image:Major and minor intervals on C.png|thumb|Major and minor intervals on C. {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|m2}}, {{audio|Major second on C.mid|M2}}, {{audio|Minor third on C.mid|m3}}, {{audio|Major third on C.mid|M3}}, {{audio|Minor sixth on C.mid|m6}}, {{audio|Dim seventh on C.mid|M6}}, {{audio|Minor seventh on C.mid|m7}}, {{audio|Major seventh on C.mid|M7}}]]
As shown in the table, a [[diatonic scale]]{{efn|name=diatonic}} defines seven intervals for each interval number, each starting from a different note (seven unisons, seven seconds, etc.). The intervals formed by the notes of a diatonic scale are called diatonic. Except for unisons and octaves, the diatonic intervals with a given interval number always occur in two sizes, which differ by one semitone. For example, six of the fifths span seven semitones. The other one spans six semitones. Four of the thirds span three semitones, the others four. If one of the two versions is a perfect interval, the other is called either diminished (i.e. narrowed by one semitone) or augmented (i.e. widened by one semitone). Otherwise, the larger version is called major, the smaller one minor. For instance, since a 7-semitone fifth is a perfect interval ('''P5'''), the 6-semitone fifth is called &quot;diminished fifth&quot; ('''d5'''). Conversely, since neither kind of third is perfect, the larger one is called &quot;major third&quot; ('''M3'''), the smaller one &quot;minor third&quot; ('''m3''').

Within a diatonic scale,{{efn|name=diatonic}} unisons and octaves are always qualified as perfect, fourths as either perfect or augmented, fifths as perfect or diminished, and all the other intervals (seconds, thirds, sixths, sevenths) as major or minor.

==== Augmented and diminished ====
[[Image:Augmented and diminished intervals on C.png|thumb|300px|Augmented and diminished intervals on C. {{audio|Unison on C.mid|d2}}, {{audio|Minor third on C.mid|A2}}, {{audio|Major second on C.mid|d3}}, {{audio|Perfect fourth on C.mid|A3}}, {{audio|Major third on C.mid|d4}}, {{audio|Tritone on C.mid|A4}}, {{audio|Tritone on C.mid|d5}}, {{audio|Minor sixth on C.mid|A5}}, {{audio|Perfect fifth on C.mid|d6}}, {{audio|Minor seventh on C.mid|A6}}, {{audio|Dim seventh on C.mid|d7}}, {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|A7}}, {{audio|Major seventh on C.mid|d8}}, {{audio|Minor ninth on C.mid|A8}}]]
Augmented intervals are wider by one semitone than perfect or major intervals, while having the same interval number (i.e., encompassing the same number of staff positions). Diminished intervals, on the other hand, are narrower by one semitone than perfect or minor intervals of the same interval number. For instance, an augmented third such as C–E{{music|sharp}} spans five semitones, exceeding a major third (C–E) by one semitone, while a diminished third such as C{{music|sharp}}–E{{music|flat}} spans two semitones, falling short of a minor third (C–E{{music|flat}}) by one semitone.

The augmented fourth ('''A4''') and the diminished fifth ('''d5''') are the only augmented and diminished intervals that appear in diatonic scales{{efn|name=diatonic}} (see table).

=== Example ===
Neither the number, nor the quality of an interval can be determined by counting [[semitones]] alone. As explained above, the number of staff positions must be taken into account as well.

For example, as shown in the table below, there are four semitones between A{{music|flat}} and B{{music|sharp}}, between A and C{{music|sharp}}, between A and D{{music|flat}}, and between A{{music|sharp}} and E{{music|double flat}}, but
* A{{music|flat}}–B{{music|sharp}} is a second, as it encompasses two staff positions (A, B), and it is doubly augmented, as it exceeds a major second (such as A–B) by two semitones.
* A–C{{music|sharp}} is a third, as it encompasses three staff positions (A, B, C), and it is major, as it spans 4 semitones.
* A–D{{music|flat}} is a fourth, as it encompasses four staff positions (A, B, C, D), and it is diminished, as it falls short of a perfect fourth (such as A–D) by one semitone.
* A{{music|sharp}}-E{{music|double flat}} is a fifth, as it encompasses five staff positions  (A, B, C, D, E), and it is triply diminished, as it falls short of a perfect fifth (such as A–E) by three semitones.

== Shorthand notation ==
Intervals are often abbreviated with a '''P''' for perfect, '''m''' for [[Major and minor|minor]], '''M''' for [[Major and minor|major]], '''d''' for [[Diminution|diminished]], '''A''' for [[Augmentation (music)|augmented]], followed by the interval number. The indications M and P are often omitted. The [[octave]] is P8, and a [[unison]] is usually referred to simply as &quot;a unison&quot; but can be labeled P1. The [[tritone]], an augmented fourth or diminished fifth is often '''TT'''. The interval qualities may be also abbreviated with '''perf''', '''min''', '''maj''', '''dim''', '''aug'''. Examples:
* m2 (or min2): minor second,
* M3 (or maj3): major third,
* A4 (or aug4): augmented fourth,
* d5 (or dim5): diminished fifth,
* P5 (or perf5): perfect fifth.

== Inversion ==
{{Main|Inversion_(music)#Intervals}}
[[Image:Compound interval inversion.png|thumb|350px|Major 13th (compound Major 6th) inverts to a minor 3rd by moving the bottom note up two octaves, the top note down two octaves, or both notes one octave]]

A simple interval (i.e., an interval smaller than or equal to an octave) may be [[inversion (music)|inverted]] by raising the lower pitch an [[octave]] or lowering the upper pitch an octave. For example, the fourth from a lower C to a higher F may be inverted to make a fifth, from a lower F to a higher C.

&gt;&gt;
}
&lt;/score&gt;

There are two rules to determine the number and quality of the inversion of any simple interval:&lt;ref&gt;Kostka, Stephen; Payne, Dorothy (2008). ''Tonal Harmony'', p.&amp;nbsp;21. First Edition, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The interval number and the number of its inversion always add up to nine (4 + 5 = 9, in the example just given).
# The inversion of a major interval is a minor interval, and vice versa; the inversion of a perfect interval is also perfect; the inversion of an augmented interval is a diminished interval, and vice versa; the inversion of a doubly augmented interval is a doubly diminished interval, and vice versa.
For example, the interval from C to the E{{Music|b}} above it is a minor third. By the two rules just given, the interval from E{{Music|b}} to the C above it must be a major sixth.

Since compound intervals are larger than an octave, &quot;the inversion of any compound interval is always the same as the inversion of the simple interval from which it is compounded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Prout, Ebenezer (1903). ''Harmony: Its Theory and Practice'', 16th edition. London: Augener &amp; Co. (facsimile reprint, St. Clair Shores, Mich.: Scholarly Press, 1970), p.&amp;nbsp;10. {{ISBN|0-403-00326-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For intervals identified by their ratio, the inversion is determined by reversing the ratio and multiplying the ratio by 2 until it is greater than 1. For example, the inversion of a 5:4 ratio is an 8:5 ratio.

For intervals identified by an integer number of semitones, the inversion is obtained by subtracting that number from 12.

Since an [[interval class]] is the lower number selected among the interval integer and its inversion, interval classes cannot be inverted.

== Classification ==
Intervals can be described, classified, or compared with each other according to various criteria.

=== Melodic and harmonic ===&lt;!--[[Melodic interval]] and [[harmonic interval]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
{{Main|Harmony|Melody}}
An interval can be described as
* Vertical or [[harmony|harmonic]] if the two notes sound simultaneously
* Horizontal, linear, or [[melody|melodic]] if they sound successively.&lt;ref name=&quot;LindleyMarkCampbell&quot; /&gt;

=== Diatonic and chromatic ===
{{Main|Diatonic and chromatic}}
In general,

* A ''[[diatonic]] interval'' is an interval formed by two notes of a [[diatonic scale]].
* A ''chromatic interval'' is a non-diatonic interval formed by two notes of a [[chromatic scale]].

[[Image:Chromatic scale full octave ascending and descending on C.PNG|thumb|500px|Ascending and descending chromatic scale on C {{audio|ChromaticScaleUpDown.ogg|Play}}.]]

The table [[#Quality|above]] depicts the 56 diatonic intervals formed by the notes of the C major scale (a diatonic scale). Notice that these intervals, as well as any other diatonic interval, can be also formed by the notes of a chromatic scale.

The distinction between diatonic and chromatic intervals is controversial, as it is based on the definition of diatonic scale, which is variable in the literature. For example, the interval B–E{{music|flat}} (a [[diminished fourth]], occurring in the [[Harmonic minor scale|harmonic C-minor scale]]) is considered diatonic if the harmonic minor scales are considered diatonic as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for example William Lovelock, ''The Rudiments of Music'' (New York: St Martin's Press; London: G. Bell, 1957): {{Page needed|date=August 2015}}, reprinted 1966, 1970, and 1976 by G. Bell, 1971 by St Martins Press, 1981, 1984, and 1986 London: Bell &amp; Hyman. {{ISBN|9780713507447}} (pbk). {{ISBN|9781873497203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, it is considered chromatic. For further details, see the [[Diatonic and chromatic|main article]].

By a commonly used definition of diatonic scale{{efn|name=diatonic}} (which excludes the [[harmonic minor]] and [[melodic minor]] scales), all perfect, major and minor intervals are diatonic. Conversely, no augmented or diminished interval is diatonic, except for the augmented fourth and diminished fifth.

[[Image:Ab major scale.png|right|thumb|The [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}}-major]] scale. {{audio|Ab major scale.mid|Play}}]]

The distinction between diatonic and chromatic intervals may be also sensitive to context. The above-mentioned 56 intervals formed by the C-major scale are sometimes called ''diatonic to C major''. All other intervals are called ''chromatic to C major''. For instance, the perfect fifth A{{Music|flat}}–E{{Music|flat}} is chromatic to C major, because A{{Music|flat}} and E{{Music|flat}} are not contained in the C major scale. However, it is diatonic to others, such as the A{{Music|flat}} major scale.

=== Consonant and dissonant ===&lt;!--[[Interval strength]] redirects directly here--&gt;
{{Main|Consonance and dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are relative terms that refer to the stability, or state of repose, of particular musical effects. Dissonant intervals are those that cause tension and desire to be ''resolved'' to consonant intervals.

These terms are relative to the usage of different compositional styles.
* In [[Renaissance music|15th- and 16th-century]] usage, perfect fifths and octaves, and major and minor thirds and sixths were considered harmonically consonant, and all other intervals dissonant, including the perfect fourth, which by 1473 was described (by [[Johannes Tinctoris]]) as dissonant, except between the upper parts of a vertical sonority—for example, with a supporting third below (&quot;6-3 chords&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Drabkin, William (2001). &quot;Fourth&quot;. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[common practice period]], it makes more sense to speak of consonant and dissonant chords, and certain intervals previously considered dissonant (such as minor sevenths) became acceptable in certain contexts. However, 16th-century practice was still taught to beginning musicians throughout this period.
* [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821–1894) defined a harmonically consonant interval as one in which the two pitches have an [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|upper partial]] (an [[overtone]]) in common.&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, Hermann L. F. ''On the Sensations of Tone as a Theoretical Basis for the Theory of Music'' Second English Edition translated by Ellis, Alexander J. (1885) reprinted by Dover Publications with new introduction (1954) {{ISBN|0-486-60753-4}}, page 182d &quot;Just as the coincidences of the two first upper partial tones led us to the natural consonances of the Octave and Fifth, the coincidences of higher upper partials would lead us to a further series of natural consonances.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially defines all seconds and sevenths as dissonant, and the above thirds, fourths, fifths, and sixths as consonant.
* [[David Cope]] (1997) suggests the concept of '''interval strength''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Cope&quot;&gt;[[David Cope|Cope, David]] (1997). ''Techniques of the Contemporary Composer'', pp.&amp;nbsp;40–41. New York, New York: Schirmer Books. {{ISBN|0-02-864737-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which an interval's strength, consonance, or stability is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. See also: [[Lipps–Meyer law]] and [[#Interval root]]

All of the above analyses refer to vertical (simultaneous) intervals.

=== Simple and compound ===
[[Image:Simple and compound major third.png|thumb|Simple and compound major third. {{audio|Simple and compound major third.mid|Play}}]]

A simple interval is an interval spanning at most one octave (see [[#Main intervals|Main intervals]] above). Intervals spanning more than one octave are called compound intervals, as they can be obtained by adding one or more octaves to a simple interval (see [[#Compound intervals|below]] for details).&lt;ref name=&quot;compound&quot;&gt;{{cite book

=== Steps and skips ===
{{Main|Steps and skips}}
Linear (melodic) intervals may be described as ''steps'' or ''skips''. A ''step'', or ''conjunct motion'',&lt;ref name=Bonds&gt;
Bonds, Mark Evan (2006).
''A History of Music in Western Culture'', p.123. 2nd ed. {{ISBN|0-13-193104-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
is a linear interval between two consecutive notes of a scale. Any larger interval is called a ''skip'' (also called a ''leap''), or ''disjunct motion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonds&quot;/&gt; In the [[diatonic scale]],{{efn|name=diatonic}} a step is either a [[minor second]] (sometimes also called ''half step'') or [[major second]] (sometimes also called ''whole step''), with all intervals of a [[minor third]] or larger being skips.

For example, C to D (major second) is a step, whereas C to E ([[major third]]) is a skip.

More generally, a step is a smaller or narrower interval in a musical line, and a skip is a wider or larger interval, where the categorization of intervals into steps and skips is determined by the [[Musical tuning|tuning system]] and the [[pitch space]] used.

[[Melodic motion]] in which the interval between any two consecutive pitches is no more than a step, or, less strictly, where skips are rare, is called ''stepwise'' or ''conjunct'' melodic motion, as opposed to ''skipwise'' or ''disjunct'' melodic motions, characterized by frequent skips.

=== Enharmonic intervals ===
{{Main|Enharmonic}}
[[Image:Enharmonic tritone.png|thumb|right|Enharmonic tritones: A4 = d5 on C {{audio|Tritone on C.mid|Play}}.]]
Two intervals are considered ''[[enharmonic]]'', or ''enharmonically equivalent'', if they both contain the same [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] spelled in different ways; that is, if the notes in the two intervals are themselves enharmonically equivalent. Enharmonic intervals span the same number of [[semitone]]s.

For example, the four intervals listed in the table below are all enharmonically equivalent, because the notes F{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|b}} indicate the same pitch, and the same is true for A{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|b}}. All these intervals span four semitones.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; ; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot; | Number&lt;br&gt;of semitones || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; ; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot; | Interval name || colspan=&quot;4&quot;| [[Staff position]]s

|}

When played as isolated chords on a [[piano keyboard]], these intervals are indistinguishable to the ear, because they are all played with the same two keys.  However, in a musical context, the [[diatonic function]] of the notes these intervals incorporate is very different.

The discussion above assumes the use of the prevalent tuning system, [[12-tone equal temperament]] (&quot;12-TET&quot;).  But in other historic [[meantone temperament]]s, the pitches of pairs of notes such as F{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|b}} may not necessarily coincide.  These two notes are enharmonic in 12-TET, but may not be so in another tuning system.  In such cases, the intervals they form would also not be enharmonic.  For example, in [[quarter-comma meantone]], all four intervals shown in the example above would be different.

== Minute intervals ==
[[Image:Pythagorean comma on C.png|thumb|right|Pythagorean comma on C. {{audio|Pythagorean comma on C.mid|Play}}. The note depicted as lower on the staff (B[[semitone#Just intonation|{{music|#}}]][[syntonic comma|+++]]) is slightly higher in pitch (than C{{music|natural}}).]]
{{Main | Comma (music) | Microtone}}
There are also a number of minute intervals not found in the chromatic scale or labeled with a diatonic function, which have names of their own. They may be described as [[microtone]]s, and some of them can be also classified as [[Comma (music)|comma]]s, as they describe small discrepancies, observed in some tuning systems, between [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] notes. In the following list, the interval sizes in [[cent (music)|cents]] are approximate.
* A ''[[Pythagorean comma]]'' is the difference between twelve justly tuned perfect fifths and seven octaves. It is expressed by the [[frequency]] ratio 531441:524288 (23.5 cents).
* A ''[[syntonic comma]]'' is the difference between four justly tuned perfect fifths and two octaves plus a major third. It is expressed by the ratio 81:80 (21.5 cents).
* A ''[[septimal comma]]'' is 64:63 (27.3 cents), and is the difference between the Pythagorean or 3-limit &quot;7th&quot; and the &quot;harmonic 7th&quot;.
* A ''[[diesis]]'' is generally used to mean the difference between three justly tuned major thirds and one octave. It is expressed by the ratio 128:125 (41.1 cents). However, it has been used to mean other small intervals: see [[diesis]] for details.
* A ''[[diaschisma]]'' is the difference between three octaves and four justly tuned perfect fifths plus two justly tuned major thirds. It is expressed by the ratio 2048:2025 (19.6 cents).
* A ''[[schisma]]'' (also skhisma) is the difference between five octaves and eight justly tuned fifths plus one justly tuned major third. It is expressed by the ratio 32805:32768 (2.0 cents). It is also the difference between the Pythagorean and syntonic commas. (A schismic major third is a schisma different from a just major third, eight fifths down and five octaves up, F{{music|flat}} in C.)
* A ''[[kleisma]]'' is the difference between six [[minor third]]s and one ''tritave'' or ''perfect twelfth'' (an [[octave]] plus a [[perfect fifth]]), with a frequency ratio of 15625:15552 (8.1 cents) ({{Audio|Kleisma on C.mid|Play}}).
* A ''[[septimal kleisma]]'' is the amount that two major thirds of 5:4 and a septimal major third, or supermajor third, of 9:7 exceeds the octave. Ratio 225:224 (7.7 cents).
* A ''[[quarter tone]]'' is half the width of a [[semitone]], which is half the width of a [[major second|whole tone]]. It is equal to exactly 50 cents.

== Compound intervals ==
[[Image:Simple and compound major third.png|thumb|Simple and compound major third. {{audio|Simple and compound major third.mid|Play}}]]

A compound interval is an interval spanning more than one octave.&lt;ref name=&quot;compound&quot; /&gt; Conversely, intervals spanning at most one octave are called simple intervals (see [[#Main intervals|Main intervals]] below).

In general, a compound interval may be defined by a sequence or &quot;stack&quot; of two or more simple intervals of any kind. For instance, a major tenth (two staff positions above one octave), also called ''compound major third'', spans one octave plus one major third.

Any compound interval can be always decomposed into one or more octaves plus one simple interval. For instance, a major seventeenth can be decomposed into two octaves and one major third, and this is the reason why it is called a compound major third, even when it is built by adding up four fifths.

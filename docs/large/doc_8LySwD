====Bulgarian====
In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the patronymics are ''-ov''/''-ev'' and ''-ova''/''-eva'' for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of ''family'' names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and [[Czech language|Czech]]). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. ''Ivan Marinov Yordanov'' would be ''Ivan'', son of ''Marin Yordanov''.

====Caucasus====

=====Armenian=====
{{main|Armenian surnames}}

The use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that period, the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by the addition of &quot;i&quot; (&quot;of&quot;, pronounced as ''ee'') to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is &quot;Armen&quot;, the corresponding patronymic would be &quot;Armeni&quot; (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be &quot;Armenovich&quot; for males and &quot;Armenovna&quot; for females. After Armenia regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.

Many Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix &quot;-ian&quot; in Western Armenian, often transliterated as &quot;-yan&quot; in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardash'''ian''', Asdvadzadour'''ian''', Hagop'''ian''', Khachadour'''ian''', Mardiros'''ian''', Bedros'''ian''', Sarkiss'''ian''', etc. Note that the suffix &quot;-ian&quot; was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordz'''ian''' (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker).

Of particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.

=====Azerbaijani=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], patronymics are formed through ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' (sometimes transliterated as ''ogly'') for males and ''[[:wikt:qız|qızı]]'' (often transliterated as ''gizi'' or ''kizi'') for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu'' (&quot;Sardar, son of Ilyas&quot;) and ''Mina Nabi qızı'' (&quot;Mina, daughter of Nabi&quot;), since surnames were mostly non-existent before [[Sovietization]] (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in [[Azerbaijan]] in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev'' (&quot;Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas&quot;). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. ''Eldar Mammadoğlu'', ''Sabina Yusifqızı''). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in ''-zadeh'' (''Kazimzadeh'', ''Mehdizadeh'', etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in ''oglu'' / ''qizi''. Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with [[Turkish language|Turkish]] surnames in ''-oğlu'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames in -ογλού (''-oglou''), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.

=====Georgian=====
{{main|Georgian surname}}
In Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of ''s'' to the end of the father's name, followed by ''dze'' for a man and ''asuli'' for a woman. For example, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. ''s'' in Georgian is a possessive, and ''dze'' and ''asuli'' mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Georgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, ''dze'' and ''shvili'' mean son of, and child, respectively.

====Greek and Greek Cypriot====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Most [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote &quot;''son of''&quot;, or more generally &quot;''descendant of''&quot;, are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, ''Dēmétrios'', for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr''ópoulos'' ([[Peloponnese]]), Dēmētr''ákos'' ([[Laconia]]), Dēmētr''éas'' ([[Messenia]]n [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]), Dēmētr''átos'' ([[Cephalonia]]), Dēmētr''ákēs'' ([[Crete]]), Dēmētr''iádēs''/Dēmētr''-ídēs'' ([[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Asia Minor]]), Dēmētr''éllēs'' ([[Lesbos]]), Dēmétr''oglou'' ([[Asia Minor]]) (identical to Turkish patronym ''-oğlu''), or simply ''Dēmētríou'' (esp. common in [[Cyprus]], the first name in the [[Genitive]]) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, ''papás'', priest, one derives the surnames ''Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou'' etc., all of which signify a &quot;priest's son&quot;. The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. ''Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos'', &quot;the son of the priest Nikolaos&quot;. A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but ''always'' declined in the [[Genitive]], e.g. ''Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou'' etc.

In addition to these surnames, ''actual'' patronymics are used in official documents as &quot;middle names&quot; preceding the surname. For example, the children of a ''Ioánnis Papadópoulos'' are, say, ''María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou'' and ''Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos'' (''Ioánnou'' is the [[genitive case]] form of ''Ioánnis''). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.

====Hungarian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending ''-fi'' (sometimes spelled as ''-fy'' or ''-ffy''). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as ''Pálfi'' (son of Paul), ''Győrfi'', ''Bánfi'' or in the name of the famous poet [[Sándor Petőfi]] (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name ''Petrovics''). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see [[History of Hungarian]]), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in ''Péter fia András'' (''Peter's son Andrew''); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time. Note that, in Hungarian, the surname precedes the given name.

====Romanian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the endings ''-escu'' and ''-eanu'' were used, as in ''Petrescu'', 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the [[Genitive case|genitive]] form (using the prefix ''a-'') were used, as in ''Amariei'', '(son/daughter) of Maria'.

====Russian====
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2013}}
In [[East Slavic languages]], the endings ''-ovich'', ''-evich'' and ''-ich'' are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is ''-yevna'', ''-ovna'' or ''-ichna''. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]], a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or &quot;Ivan, son of Nikolay&quot; (''Nikolayevich'' being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or &quot;Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay&quot; (''Nikolayevna'' being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are ''-ich'' (for men) and ''-inichna'' (for women). Examples in titles  of classical Russian literature include'' [[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and &quot;[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]&quot;.

In Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends.&lt;ref name=rus1&gt;{{cite book |last=Cubberley |first=Paul |date=17 October 2002 |title=Russian: A Linguistic Introduction |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=355 |isbn=9780521796415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rus2&gt;{{cite book |last=Stakhnevich |first=Julia |date=2007 |title=The Everything Learning Russian Book |publisher=Everything Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/everythinglearni0000stak/page/74 74] |isbn=9781598693874 |url=https://archive.org/details/everythinglearni0000stak/page/74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of name with patronymic in Russian is always correct and polite way to address to any person except close friends, family members, or children - in such cases usage of patronymic adds humor intonation. When addressing to a much younger person, only the first name is commonly used. Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., &quot;Mikhail Nikolayevich&quot;) in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age.&lt;ref name=rus1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rus3&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Smorodinskaya |editor1-first=Tatiana |editor2-last=Evans-Romaine |editor2-first=Karen |editor3-last=Goscilo |editor3-first=Helena |date=2007 |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=412 |isbn=9781136787867}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work.&lt;ref name=rus3/&gt; In informal situations, if a person is called by a [[diminutive]] (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.&lt;ref name=rus2/&gt;

In [[colloquial]], informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the [[given name]] may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called &quot;Sergeich&quot; or, more rarely, &quot;Sergeyevich&quot;. In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: &quot;Ivanovna&quot; but &quot;Mar' Ivanna&quot;; &quot;Sergeyevna&quot;/&quot;Sergevna&quot; is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.

====Serbian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
[[Vuk Karadžić]] reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.

In Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and [[Grammatical gender|feminine]].  Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').

====Turkish&lt;!--Turkish not Turkic: see talk page--&gt;====
{{main|Turkish name}}
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the [[suffix]]es used to indicate paternal ancestry are ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' and ''[[:wikt:zadeh|-zade]]'', which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the [[late modern history|late modern]] [[Contemporary history|contemporary age]] many turned into surnames. After the '[[Surname Law|Surname revolution]]' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix ''-oğlu'', such as ''Elbeyioğlu'', ''Bakkaloğlu'' or ''Giritlioğlu'' and with ''-zade'' such as ''[[Begzada|Beyzade]]'', ''Mehmedzade'', ''Yusufzade''.

====Ukrainian====
{{main|Ukrainian name}}
In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the female patronymic always ends with -івна (-''ivna'') or -ївна (-''yivna'').&lt;ref name=LPUkraine/&gt; The male patronymic always ends with -ович (-''ovych'') or -йович (-''yovych'').&lt;ref name=LPUkraine&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUmCGXMhQuYC&amp;pg=PA52 Ukrainian:Lonely Planet Phrasebook] by [[Marko Pavlyshyn]], [[Lonely Planet]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-605-2}} (page 52)&lt;/ref&gt; Exception: ''Illia'' (Ілля) → ''Illich'' (Ілліч) (e.g. [[Élie Metchnikoff|Illia Illich Mechnikov]]), ''Sava'' (Сава) → ''Savych'' (Савич), ''Iakiv'' (Яків) → ''Iakovych'' (Якович).&lt;ref&gt;Потелло Н. Я. Теорія і практика ділового мовлення: Навч. посібник.— К.: МАУП, 1999.— 132 с.— Бібліогр.: с. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patronyms are part of full name and obligatory in formal messages. They're frequent in common speech, e.g. to call a person in respectful manner (in form of name followed by patronym) and to accent an informal message in formal environment, such as between colleagues who have good relationships at work (in form of patronym without name and family name).

[[File:US Navy 040615-N-6817C-030 A camera crew sets up for scenes to be taped on the flight deck for the upcoming motion picture Stealth.jpg|thumb|right|A [[camera crew]] sets up for scenes to be filmed on the flight deck for the motion picture ''[[Stealth (film)|Stealth]]'' with the crew of the [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'' (CVN-72)]].]]

A '''cinematographer''' or '''director of photography''' (sometimes shortened to '''DP''' or '''DOP''') is the chief over the camera and light [[film crew|crew]]s working on a [[film]], television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as [[cinematography]].

The cinematographer selects the camera, [[film stock]], [[photographic lens|lens]]es, [[filter (photography)|filter]]s, etc., to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the [[film director|director]]. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances, the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.

Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Reed Morano]] who lensed ''[[Frozen River]]'' and Beyonce's ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' before winning an Emmy for directing ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]''. [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the [[Coen brothers]]' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. [[Nicolas Roeg]], cinematographer on films such as ''[[The Caretaker (film)|The Caretaker]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' (1964), directed ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976). [[Ellen Kuras|Ellen Kuras, ASC]] photographed ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind]]'' as well as a number of [[Spike Lee]] films such as ''[[Summer of Sam]]'' and ''[[He Got Game]]'' before directing episodes of ''Legion'' and ''Ozark.'' In 2014, [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan|three ''Batman'' films]], made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''; whilst British cinematographers [[Jack Cardiff]] and [[Freddie Francis]] regularly moved between the two positions.

==History==
[[File:Sathish. G.jpg|thumb|right|Cameraman along with the equipment for making cinematography.]]
In the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the [[Film director|director]] and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and [[camera operator]] emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light-sensitive) [[film stock]]s, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.

Cinematography was key during the [[silent movie]] era; with no sound apart from [[background music]] and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.

In 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world,{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too. [https://theasc.com/asc/committees/asc-vision-committee The ASC Vision Committee] is known for working to encourage and support the advancement of underrepresented cinematographers, their crews and other filmmakers, and to inspire us all to enact positive changes through hiring talent that reflects society at large.

However, the [[Soviet]] filmmaker, [[Dziga Vertov]], writing in [[Kino-fot]] No.1 (August 1922) rejected the role of Cinematographer in the &quot;We: Variant of a Manifesto&quot;:

{{quote|
We call ourselves [[kinoks]] – as opposed to &quot;cinematographers&quot;, a herd of junkmen doing rather well peddling their rags. 

We see no connection between true [[kinochestvo]] and the cunning and calculation of the profiteers.

We consider the psychological Russo-German film-drama – weighed down with apparitions and childhood memories – an absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;We variant&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monoskop.org/images/6/66/Vertov_Dziga_1922_1984_We_Variant_of_a_Manifesto.pdf |website=monoskop.org |title=We: Variant of a Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Societies and trade organizations==
There are a number of national associations of cinematographers that represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography. These include:

'''George Alec Effinger''' (January 10, 1947 &amp;ndash; April 27, 2002) was an American [[list of science fiction authors|science fiction author]], born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

==Writing career==
Effinger was a part of the [[Clarion Workshop|Clarion]] class of 1970 and had three stories in the first Clarion anthology. His first published story was &quot;The Eight-Thirty to Nine Slot&quot; in ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' in 1971. During his early period, he also published under a variety of [[pseudonym]]s.

His first novel, ''What Entropy Means to Me'' (1972), was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula Award]]. He achieved his greatest success with the trilogy of [[Marîd Audran]] novels set in a 22nd-century [[Middle East]], with cybernetic implants and modules allowing individuals to change their personalities or bodies. The novels are in fact set in a thinly veiled version of the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]]. The three published novels were ''[[When Gravity Fails]]'' (1987), ''[[A Fire in the Sun]]'' (1989), and ''[[The Exile Kiss]]'' (1991); Effinger also contributed to the computer game ''[[Circuit's Edge]]'' (1990), based on ''When Gravity Fails''. He began a fourth Budayeen novel, ''Word of Night'', but completed only the first two chapters. Those two chapters were reprinted in the anthology  ''[[Budayeen Nights]]'' (2003) which has all of Effinger's short material from the Marîd Audran setting.

His novelette &quot;[[Schrödinger's Kitten]]&quot; (1988) received both the [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette|Hugo]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Nebula Award]], as well as the Japanese [[Seiun Award]]. A collection of his stories was published posthumously in 2005, entitled ''George Alec Effinger Live! From Planet Earth''; includes the complete stories Effinger wrote under the pseudonym &quot;O. Niemand&quot; and many of Effinger's best-known stories. Each O. Niemand story is a pastiche in the voice of a different major American writer ([[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Damon Runyon]], [[Mark Twain]], etc.), all set on the asteroid city of Springfield. &quot;Niemand&quot; is from the German word for &quot;nobody&quot;, and the initial O was intended by Effinger as a visual pun for Zero, and possibly also as a reference to the author O. Henry.

Other stories he wrote were the series of Maureen (Muffy) Birnbaum parodies, which placed a [[preppy]] into a variety of science fictional, fantasy, and horror scenarios.

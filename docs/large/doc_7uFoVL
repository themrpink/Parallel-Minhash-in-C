Darius's European expedition was a major event in his reign, which began with the invasion of [[Thrace]]. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], while [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] submitted voluntarily, after the demand of [[earth and water]], becoming a [[vassal]] kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;&gt;Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington.

The Greeks living in [[Asia Minor]] and some of the Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in [[Athens]]. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns amongst the Greeks over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by the Greeks in [[Ionia]] and [[Lydia]] were stepping stones towards the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.

When [[Aristagoras]] organized the [[Ionian Revolt]], [[Eretria]] and Athens supported him by sending ships and troops to Ionia and by burning [[Sardis]]. Persian military and naval operations to quell the revolt ended in the Persian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands, as well as the re-subjugation of Thrace and the conquering of Macedonia in 492 BC under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Roisman|author2=Ian Worthington|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA345|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5163-7|pages=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macedon had been [[Achaemenid Macedonia|a vassal kingdom of the Persians]] since the late 6th century BC, but retained autonomy. Mardonius' 492 campaign made it a fully subordinate part of the Persian kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;/&gt; These military actions, coming as a direct response to the revolt in Ionia, were the beginning of the First Persian invasion of (mainland) Greece. At the same time, anti-Persian parties gained more power in Athens, and pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from Athens and Sparta.

Darius responded by sending troops led by his son-in-law across the [[Hellespont]]. However, a violent storm and harassment by the [[Thracians]] forced the troops to return to Persia. Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, Darius assembled another army of 20,000 men under his Admiral, [[Datis]], and his nephew [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]], who met success when they captured Eretria and advanced to Marathon. In 490 BCE, at the [[Battle of Marathon]], the Persian army was defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army, with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 [[Plataea]]ns and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]]. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. Darius began preparations for a second force which he would command, instead of his generals; however, before the preparations were complete, Darius died, thus leaving the task to his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

==Family==
Darius was the son of Hystaspes and the grandson of [[Arschama I|Arsames]].{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=16}} Darius married [[Atossa]], daughter of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with whom he had four sons: [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], [[Achaemenes (satrap)|Achaemenes]], [[Masistes]] and Hystaspes. He also married [[Artystone]], another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two sons, Arsames and Gobryas. Darius married [[Parmys]], the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, [[Ariomardus]]. Furthermore, Darius married Phratagune, with whom he had two sons, [[Abrokomas]] and [[Hyperantes]]. He also married another woman of the nobility, Phaidyme, the daughter of [[Otanes]]. It is unknown if he had any children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier [[Gobryas]] from an early marriage, with whom he had three sons, Artobazanes, [[Ariabignes]] and Arsamenes.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=113}} Any daughters he had with her are not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of [[Atossa]]; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.

==Death==
[[File:Tomb of Darius I.jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Darius the Great|Tomb]] of Darius at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]]]]

After becoming aware of the Persian defeat at the [[Battle of Marathon]], Darius began planning another expedition against the Greek-city states; this time, he, not Datis, would command the imperial armies.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Darius had spent three years preparing men and ships for war when a revolt broke out in Egypt. This revolt in Egypt worsened his failing health and prevented the possibility of his leading another army.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Soon afterwards, Darius died. In October 486 BCE, his body was [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in the rock-cut tomb at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], which he had been preparing.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} A inscription on his tomb introduces him as &quot;Great King, King of Kings, King of countries containing all kinds of men, King in this great earth far and wide, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenian, a Persian, son of a Persian, an Aryan [Iranian], having [[Aryan]] lineage.&quot;{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} A relief under his tomb portraying an equestrian combat was later carved during the reign of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] King of Kings, [[Bahram II]] ({{reign|274|293|era=CE}}).{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514–522}}

Xerxes, the eldest son of Darius and [[Atossa]], succeeded to the throne as [[Xerxes I]]; before his accession, he had contested the succession with his elder half-brother Artobarzanes, Darius's eldest son, who was born to his first wife before Darius rose to power.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=136}} With Xerxes' accession, the empire was again ruled by a member of the house of Cyrus.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

Early in his reign, Darius wanted to reorganize the structure of the empire and reform the system of taxation he inherited from Cyrus and Cambyses. To do this, Darius created twenty provinces called [[satrapies]] (or ''archi'') which were each assigned to a [[satrap]] (''archon'') and specified fixed [[tribute]]s that the satrapies were required to pay.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} [[List of revenues of Darius I of Persia|A complete list]] is preserved in the catalogue of Herodotus, beginning with Ionia and listing the other satrapies from west to east excluding [[Persis]] which was the land of the Persians and the only province which was not a conquered land.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Tributes were paid in both silver and gold talents. Tributes in silver from each satrap were measured with the Babylonian [[Talent (measurement)|talent]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Those paid in gold were measured with the [[Euboea|Euboic]] talent.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} The total tribute from the satraps came to an amount less than 15,000 silver talents.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

The majority of the satraps were of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin and were members of the royal house or the six great noble families.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} These satraps were personally picked by Darius to monitor these provinces. Each of these provinces were divided into sub-provinces with their own governors which were chosen either by the royal court or by the satrap.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} To assess tributes, a commission evaluated the expenses and revenues of each satrap.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} To ensure that one person did not gain too much power, each satrap had a secretary who observed the affairs of the state and communicated with Darius, a treasurer who safeguarded provincial revenues and a garrison commander who was responsible for the troops.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Additionally, royal inspectors who were the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of Darius completed further checks on each satrap.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

The imperial administration was coordinated by the chancery with headquarters at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon with Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascylium and Memphis having branches.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Darius kept [[Aramaic]] as the common language, which soon spread throughout the empire.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} However, Darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for Persis and the Persians, which was called Aryan script and was only used for official inscriptions.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Before this, the accomplishments of the king were addressed in Persian solely through narration and hymns and through the &quot;masters of memory&quot;.{{sfn|Briant|2002|pp=126–127}} Indeed, oral history continued to play an important role throughout the history of Iran.{{sfn|Briant|2002|pp=126–127}}

===Economy===
{{see also|Achaemenid coinage}}
[[File:Daric coin of the Achaemenid Empire (Darius I to Xerxes II).jpg|thumb|right|Gold [[Persian daric|daric]], minted at [[Sardis]]]]

Darius introduced a new universal currency, the [[Persian daric|daric]], sometime before 500 BCE.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} Darius used the coinage system as a transnational currency to regulate trade and commerce throughout his empire. The Daric was also recognized beyond the borders of the empire, in places such as Celtic Central Europe and Eastern Europe. There were two types of darics, a gold daric and a silver daric. Only the king could mint gold darics. Important generals and satraps minted silver darics, the latter usually to recruit Greek mercenaries in [[Anatolia]]. The daric was a major boost to international trade. Trade goods such as textiles, carpets, tools and [[metalworking|metal objects]] began to travel throughout Asia, Europe and Africa. To further improve trade, Darius built the [[Royal Road]], a postal system and Phoenician-based commercial shipping.

The daric also improved government revenues as the introduction of the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the registration of land which was measured and then taxed. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund [[irrigation]] projects in dry lands. This new tax system also led to the formation of state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was [[Murashu and Sons|Murashu Sons]], based in the Babylonian city of [[Nippur]].{{sfn|Farrokh|2007|p=65}} These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.{{sfn|Farrokh|2007|p=65–66}}

In an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, underground [[Traditional water sources of Persian antiquity|waterways]] and a powerful navy.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} He further improved and expanded the network of roads and [[Angarium|way stations]] throughout the empire, so that there was a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.{{sfn|Konecky|2008|p=86}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

While there is no general consensus in scholarship whether Darius and his predecessors had been influenced by [[Zoroastrianism]],{{sfn|Malandra|2005}} it is well established that Darius was a firm believer in [[Ahura Mazda]], whom he saw as the supreme deity.{{sfn|Malandra|2005}}{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=126}} However, Ahura Mazda was also worshipped by adherents of the [[Indo-Iranians|(Indo-)Iranian]] religious tradition.{{sfn|Malandra|2005}}{{sfn|Boyce|1984|pp=684–687}} As can be seen at the [[Behistun Inscription]], Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

Darius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of [[Asha]]. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=55}} In many [[cuneiform]] inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=54–55}}

In the lands that were conquered by his empire, Darius followed the same Achaemenid tolerance that Cyrus had shown and later Achaemenid kings would show.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} He supported faiths and religions that were &quot;alien&quot; as long as the adherents were &quot;submissive and peaceable&quot;, sometimes giving them grants from his treasury for their purposes.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=56}} He had funded the restoration of the [[Second Temple|Israelite temple]] which had originally been decreed by Cyrus, was supportive towards Greek cults which can be seen in his letter to Gadatas, and supported Elamite priests.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} He had also observed Egyptian religious rites related to kingship and had built the temple for the Egyptian god, [[Amun]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

===Building projects===
[[File:History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia and Assyria (1903) (14584070300).jpg|thumb|Reconstruction drawing of the [[Palace of Darius in Susa]]]]
[[File:Persepolis - Tachara 01.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Tachara]] palace in [[Persepolis]]]]

During [[First Persian invasion of Greece|Darius's Greek expedition]], he had begun construction projects in [[Susa]], [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Persepolis]]. He had linked the [[Red Sea]] to the river [[Nile]] by building a canal ([[Darius Canal]]) which ran from modern [[Zagazig|Zaqāzīq]] to modern [[Suez]]. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the [[Red Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}{{sfn|Spielvogel|2009|p=49}} On this visit to Egypt he erected [[Darius the Great's Suez Inscriptions|monuments]] and executed [[Aryandes]] on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, he found that the codification of Egyptian law had been finished.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}}

Additionally, Darius sponsored large construction projects in Susa, [[Babylon]], Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius built [[Palace of Darius in Susa|a new palace complex]] in the north of the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of [[Artaxerxes I]], but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]. In [[Pasargadae]] Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]]. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace is believed to have been constructed by Darius.

In Egypt Darius built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a believer of Ahura Mazda, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Several temples found were dedicated to [[Ptah]] and [[Nekhbet]]. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. To construct these monuments Darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural relations.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1994|pp=41–50}} At the time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.{{sfn|Boardman|1988|p=76}}

'''Darius II''' ({{lang-peo|[[:wikt:𐎭𐎠𐎼𐎹𐎺𐎢𐏁|𐎭𐎠𐎼𐎹𐎺𐎢𐏁]]|translit=Dārayavahuš}}), also called '''Darius II Nothus''' or '''Darius II Ochus''', was [[King of Kings]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] from 423 BC to 405&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Brill's New Pauly]]'', &quot;Darius&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; or 404 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[Artaxerxes I]], who died in 424 BC, was followed by his son [[Xerxes II]]. After a month and half Xerxes II was murdered by his brother [[Sogdianus]]. His illegitimate brother, Ochus, [[satrap]] of [[Hyrcania]], rebelled against Sogdianus, and after a short fight killed him, and suppressed by treachery the attempt of his own brother Arsites to imitate his example. Ochus adopted the name Darius (Greek sources often call him Darius ''Nothos'', &quot;Bastard&quot;). Neither the names Xerxes II nor Sogdianus occur in the dates of the numerous [[Babylon]]ian tablets from [[Nippur]]; here effectively the reign of Darius II follows immediately after that of Artaxerxes I.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Darius |volume=7 |page=833  |first=Eduard |last=Meyer |authorlink=Eduard Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomb of Darius II.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Prospective tomb of Darius II in Naqsh-e Rostam]]
Historians know little about Darius II's reign. A rebellion by the [[Medes]] in 409 BC is mentioned by [[Xenophon]]. It does seem that Darius II was quite dependent on his wife [[Parysatis]]. In excerpts from [[Ctesias]] some [[harem]] intrigues are recorded, in which he played a disreputable part.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; The [[Johanan (High Priest)#Archaeology|Elephantine papyri]] mention Darius II as a contemporary of the [[Johanan (High Priest)|high priest Johanan]] of [[Ezra#Timeline|Ezra]] 10:6.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, James B. ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton University Press, third edition with supplement 1969'', p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel Porten (Author), J. J. Farber (Author), C. J. F. Martin (Author), G. Vittmann (Author), The Elephantine Papyri in English (Documenta Et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui, book 22), Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 1996, p 125-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Athens==
As long as the power of [[Athens]] remained intact he did not meddle in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] affairs. When in 413 BC, Athens supported the rebel [[Amorges]] in [[Caria]], Darius II would not have responded had not the [[Sicilian Expedition|Athenian power been broken]] in the same year at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. As a result of that event, Darius II gave orders to his satraps in [[Asia Minor]], [[Tissaphernes]] and [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], to send in the overdue tribute of the Greek towns and to begin a war with Athens. To support the war with Athens, the Persian satraps entered into an alliance with Sparta. In 408 BC he sent his son [[Cyrus the Younger|Cyrus]] to Asia Minor, to carry on the war with greater energy.

Darius II may have expelled various Greek dynasts who had been ruling cities in Ionia: [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote that the sons of [[Themistocles]], which include [[Archeptolis]], Governor of [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], &quot;appear to have returned to Athens&quot;, and that they dedicated a painting of Themistocles in the [[Parthenon]] and erected a bronze statue to [[Artemis Leucophryene]], the goddess of Magnesia, on the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DH200&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paus. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.%201.1.2&amp;lang=original 1.1.2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz72pKpgpx8C&amp;pg=PA38 26.4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Habicht |first1=Christian |title=Pausanias Guide to Ancient Greece |date=1998 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520061705 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cJYpYbScEUC&amp;pg=PA5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have returned from [[Asia Minor]] in old age, after 412 BC, when the Achaemenids took again firm control of the Greek cities of Asia, and they may have been expelled by the Achaemenid [[satrap]] [[Tissaphernes]] sometime between 412 and 399 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;DH200&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=David |last2=Wilkins |first2=John |title=The Rivals of Aristophanes: Studies in Athenian Old Comedy |date=2002 |publisher=ISD LLC |isbn=9781910589595 |page=200 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQVPDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, from 414 BC, Darius II had started to resent increasing Athenian power in the [[Aegean sea|Aegean]] and had Tissaphernes enter into an alliance with [[Sparta]] against [[Athens]], which in 412 BC led to the Persian conquest of the greater part of [[Ionia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|last=Smith|first=William|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1867|isbn=|volume=vol. 3|location=Boston|pages=1154–1156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius is said to have received the visit of Greek athlete and Olympic champion [[Polydamas of Skotoussa]], who made a demonstration of his strength by killing three Immortals in front of the Persian ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=James |title=The Ancient Olympiads: 776 BC to 393 AD |date=2015 |publisher=Warwick Press Inc. |isbn=9781987944006 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qjxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT141 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valavanēs |first1=Panos |title=Games and sanctuaries in ancient Greece: Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, Nemea, Athens |date=2004 |publisher=Kapon Editions |page=433 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njwKAQAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sculpture representing the scene is visible in the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ministry of Culture and Sports {{!}} Museum of the History of the Olympic Games of antiquity |url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/4/eh430.jsp?obj_id=11041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius II died in 404 BC, in the nineteenth year of his reign, and was followed as Persian king by [[Artaxerxes II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

==Issue==
Prior to his accession, Darius II was married to the daughter of Gobryas. With the daughter of Gobryas, Darius II had four sons, one of whom fathered [[Artabazanes]], who served as King of Media [[Atropatene]] in the second half of the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/artabazanes-autonomous-ruler-of-armenia-who-submitted-to-the-seleucid-king-antiochus-iii-in-220-b ARTABAZANES], Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García Sánchez, M (2005): &quot;[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistasBUC/portal/abrir.php?url=http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/ghi/02130181/articulos/GERI0505330223A.PDF La figura del sucer del Gran Rey en la Persia Aqueménida]&quot;, in V.

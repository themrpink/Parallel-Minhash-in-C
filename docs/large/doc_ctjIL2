For those that remained under the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (''milletler''), so the [[exonym]] &quot;Greeks&quot; (''Rumlar'' from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], regardless of their language or ethnic origin.&lt;ref name=Mazower/&gt; The [[Greek language|Greek]] speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves ''Romioi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = History of Europe, The Romans |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (''genos'') to be Hellenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mavrocordatos|first=Nicholaos|year=1800|title=Philotheou Parerga|publisher=Grēgorios Kōnstantas (Original from Harvard University Library)|quote=Γένος μεν ημίν των άγαν Ελλήνων}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman [[millet]] system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Orthodox Christian protector, the [[Russian Empire]], or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining [[crypto-Christian]]. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as [[Greek Muslims]]—excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the [[devshirme]]—were to be found in [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]), [[Greek Macedonia]] (for example among the [[Vallahades]] of western [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]), and among [[Pontic Greeks]] in the [[Pontic Alps]] and [[Armenian Highlands]]. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan [[Selim I|Selim the Grim]] ({{reign}} 1517–1520), whose mother [[Gülbahar Hatun]] was a [[Pontic Greek]].

The roots of Greek success in the Ottoman Empire can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and commerce exemplified in the [[Phanariotes]].&lt;ref name=BritB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Phanariote|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Phanariote}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821.&lt;ref name=BritMerchant/&gt; Not coincidentally, on the eve of 1821, the three most important centres of Greek learning were situated in [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Ayvalik|Aivali]], all three major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritMerchant/&gt; Greek success was also favoured by Greek domination in the leadership of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] church.

===Modern===
{{See also|Modern Greek Enlightenment|Greek War of Independence}}
The movement of the Greek enlightenment, the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], contributed not only in the promotion of education, culture and printing among the Greeks, but also in the case of independence from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]], and the restoration of the term &quot;Hellene&quot;. [[Adamantios Korais]], probably the most important intellectual of the movement, advocated the use of the term &quot;Hellene&quot; (Έλληνας) or &quot;Graikos&quot; (Γραικός) in the place of ''Romiós'', that was seen negatively by him.

The relationship between ethnic Greek identity and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion continued after the creation of the modern Greek nation-state in 1830. According to the second article of the first [[Constitution of Greece|Greek constitution]] of 1822, a Greek was defined as any native Christian resident of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]], a clause removed by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Constitution of 1822 (Epidaurus)|year=1822|language=Greek|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/syn06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, when the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in 1923, the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange, although most of the Greeks displaced (over a million of the total 1.5 million) had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed.{{efn|While Greek authorities signed the agreement legalizing the population exchange this was done on the insistence of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] and after a million Greeks had already been expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] ({{harvnb|Gilbar|1997|p=8}}).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barutciski|2003|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=xi–xv}}; {{harvnb|Hershlag|1980|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Özkırımlı|Sofos|2008|pp=116–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek genocide]], in particular the harsh removal of Pontian Greeks from the southern shore area of the Black Sea, contemporaneous with and following the failed Greek [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Asia Minor Campaign]], was part of this process of [[Turkification]] of the Ottoman Empire and the placement of its economy and trade, then largely in Greek hands under ethnic Turkish control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Üngör|2008|pp=15–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the establishment of the modern Greek nation-state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios.

''New Political Constitution of the Inhabitants of Rumeli, Asia Minor, the Islands of the Aegean, and the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of Modern Greece|modern Greek state]] was created in 1829, when the Greeks liberated a part of their historic homelands, [[Peloponnese]], from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koliopoulos|Veremis|2002|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The large [[Greek diaspora]] and merchant class were instrumental in transmitting the ideas of western [[romantic nationalism]] and [[philhellenism]],&lt;ref name=BritMerchant&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title =History of Greece, Ottoman Empire, The merchant middle class |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; which together with the conception of Hellenism, formulated during the last centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], formed the basis of the [[Diafotismos]] and the current conception of Hellenism.&lt;ref name=BritIdent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|p=98: &quot;After the Ottoman conquest in 1453, recognition by the Turks of the Greek ''millet'' under its Patriarch and Church helped to ensure the persistence of a separate ethnic identity, which, even if it did not ''produce'' a &quot;precocious nationalism&quot; among the Greeks, provided the later Greek enlighteners and nationalists with a cultural constituency fed by political dreams and apocalyptic prophecies of the recapture of Constantinople and the restoration of Greek Byzantium and its Orthodox emperor in all his glory.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Regions Mainland Greece.png|thumb|right|Map showing the major regions of mainland ancient Greece, and adjacent &quot;barbarian&quot; lands.]]

Greeks and Greek-speakers have used different names to refer to themselves collectively. The term {{em|Achaeans}} (Ἀχαιοί) is one of the [[Names of the Greeks|collective names]] for the Greeks in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' (the Homeric &quot;long-haired Achaeans&quot; would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from {{circa}} 1600 BC until 1100 BC). The other common names are {{em|Danaans}} (Δαναοί) and {{em|Argives}} (Ἀργεῖοι) while {{em|Panhellenes}} (Πανέλληνες) and {{em|Hellenes}} (Ἕλληνες) both [[hapax legomenon|appear only once]] in the ''Iliad'';&lt;ref&gt;See ''Iliad'', II.2.530 for &quot;Panhellenes&quot; and ''Iliad'' II.2.653 for &quot;Hellenes&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; all of these terms were used, synonymously, to denote a common Greek identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartledge|2011|loc=Chapter 4: Argos, p. 23: &quot;The Late Bronze Age in Greece is also called conventionally 'Mycenaean', as we saw in the last chapter.

The impulse of Panhellenism is already at work in Homeric and Hesiodic poetry. In the Iliad, the names &quot;Achaeans&quot; and &quot;Danaans&quot; and &quot;Argives&quot; are used synonymously in the sense of Panhellenes = &quot;all Hellenes&quot; = &quot;all Greeks.&quot;&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the historical period, Herodotus identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]] of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]].

[[Homer]] refers to the &quot;Hellenes&quot; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|iː|n|z}}) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic [[Phthia]], with its warriors under the command of [[Achilleus]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''[[Iliad]]'', 2.681–685&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parian Chronicle]] says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks ({{lang|grc|Γραικοί}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Parian-Chronicle&quot;&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004008.html The Parian Marble, Entry #6]: &quot;From when Hellen [son of] Deuc[alion] became king of [Phthi]otis and those previously called Graekoi were named Hellenes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hellen]], the patriarch of the Hellenes who ruled around Phthia, was the son of [[Pyrrha]] and [[Deucalion]], the only survivors after the [[flood myth|Great Deluge]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] names ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]] as an area in [[Epirus]] between [[Dodona]] and the [[Achelous]] river, the location of the Great Deluge of [[Deucalion]], a land occupied by the [[Selloi]] and the &quot;Greeks&quot; who later came to be known as &quot;Hellenes&quot;.&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;Aristotle.

===Continuity===
[[File:Byzantine Greek Alexander Manuscript Bracca (cropped).JPG|thumb|Alexander the Great in [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s clothes, by a manuscript depicting scenes from his life (between 1204–1453)]]

The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language, which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day, albeit with a break during the [[Greek Dark Ages]] (11th- 8th cent. BC, though the [[Cypriot syllabary]] was in use during this period).&lt;ref name=Adrados&gt;{{harvnb|Adrados|2005|pp=xii, 3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to [[Chinese language|Chinese]] alone.&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1983|p=vii: &quot;The Homeric poems were first written down in more or less their present form in the seventh century B.C. Since then Greek has enjoyed a continuous tradition down to the present day. Change there has certainly been. But there has been no break like that between Latin and Romance languages. Ancient Greek is not a foreign language to the Greek of today as Anglo-Saxon is to the modern Englishman. The only other language which enjoys comparable continuity of tradition is Chinese.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADS&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1991|pp=29–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaac|2004|p=504: &quot;Autochthony, being an Athenian idea and represented in many Athenian texts, is likely to have influenced a broad public of readers, wherever Greek literature was read.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire, areas such as [[Ionia]] and [[Constantinople]] experienced a Hellenic revival in language, philosophy, and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt; This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt; Throughout their history, the Greeks have retained their language and [[Greek alphabet|alphabet]], certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion (the word ''[[barbarian]]'' was used by 12th-century historian [[Anna Komnene]] to describe non-Greek speakers),&lt;ref&gt;Anna Comnena.

During and after the [[Greek War of Independence]], Greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state, raising funds and awareness abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calotychos|2003|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the Mediterranean (notably Marseilles in [[Greeks in France|France]], Livorno in [[Greeks in Italy|Italy]], Alexandria in [[Greeks in Egypt|Egypt]]), [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] ([[Odessa]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]), and [[British Greeks|Britain]] (London and Liverpool) from where they traded, typically in textiles and grain.&lt;ref name=Diaspora&gt;{{harvnb|McCabe|Harlaftis|2005|pp=147–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses frequently comprised the extended family, and with them they brought schools teaching Greek and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Diaspora/&gt;

As markets changed and they became more established, some families grew their operations to become [[Greek shipping|shippers]], financed through the local Greek community, notably with the aid of the [[Ralli Brothers|Ralli]] or [[Panayis Athanase Vagliano|Vagliano Brothers]].&lt;ref name=Kardasis&gt;{{harvnb|Kardasis|2001|pp=xvii–xxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With economic success, the Diaspora expanded further across the [[Greeks in Syria|Levant]], North Africa, India and the USA.&lt;ref name=Kardasis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clogg&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2000|loc=&quot;The Greeks in America&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many Greeks left their traditional homelands for economic reasons resulting in large migrations from Greece and Cyprus to the [[Greek American|United States]], Great Britain, Australia, Canada, [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]], and [[Greeks in South Africa|South Africa]], especially after the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945), the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949), and the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laliotou|2004|pp=85–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Greeks speak the [[Greek language]], an [[Hellenic languages|independent branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages]], with its closest relations possibly being [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (see [[Graeco-Armenian]]) or the [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (see [[Graeco-Aryan]]).&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt; It has the longest documented history of any living language and [[Greek literature]] has a continuous history of over 2,500 years.&lt;ref name=BritLit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Greek-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest inscriptions in Greek are in the [[Linear B]] script, dated as far back as 1450 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aegeanscripts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:new-linear-b-tablet-found-at-iklaina&amp;catid=80&amp;Itemid=473|title=New Linear B tablet found at Iklaina|publisher=Comité International Permanent des Études Mycéniennes, UNESCO|accessdate=29 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015044633/http://www.aegeanscripts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:new-linear-b-tablet-found-at-iklaina&amp;catid=80&amp;Itemid=473|archive-date=15 October 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Greek Dark Ages]], from which written records are absent, the [[Greek alphabet]] appears in the 9th–8th century BC. The Greek alphabet derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and in turn became the parent alphabet of the [[Latin]], [[Cyrillic]], and several other alphabets. The earliest Greek literary works are the [[Homer|Homeric epics]], variously dated from the 8th to the 6th century BC. Notable scientific and mathematical works include [[Euclid's Elements]], Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], and others. The [[New Testament]] was originally written in [[Koine Greek]].

Greek demonstrates several linguistic features that are shared with other [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkan languages]], such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Eastern Romance languages]] (see [[Balkan sprachbund]]), and has absorbed many foreign words, primarily of Western European and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winford|2003|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the movements of [[Philhellenism]] and the [[Diafotismos]] in the 19th century, which emphasized the modern Greeks' ancient heritage, these foreign influences were excluded from official use via the creation of [[Katharevousa]], a somewhat artificial form of Greek purged of all foreign influence and words, as the official language of the Greek state. In 1976, however, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] voted to make the spoken [[Dimotiki]] the official language, making Katharevousa obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|1990|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern Greek]] has, in addition to Standard Modern Greek or Dimotiki, a wide [[Varieties of Modern Greek|variety of dialects]] of varying levels of mutual intelligibility, including [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot]], [[Pontic language|Pontic]], [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]], [[Griko language|Griko]] and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] (the only surviving representative of ancient [[Doric Greek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomić|2006|p=703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]] is the language of the [[Romaniotes]], and survives in small communities in Greece, New York and Israel. In addition to Greek, many Greeks in Greece and the Diaspora are bilingual in other languages or dialects such as English, [[Arvanitika]]/[[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Slavic dialects of Greece|Macedonian Slavic]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and Turkish.&lt;ref name=Adrados/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]] and other centers of Greek learning, while Byzantine science was essentially a continuation of classical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Byzantine Medicine — Vienna Dioscurides|work=Antiqua Medicina|year=2007|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=10 May 2016|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/byzantine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in ''paideia'' (education).&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; ''Paideia'' was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the [[Fall of Constantinople|city's fall]] to the Ottomans in 1453.&lt;ref name=Bump&gt;{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Jerome|title=The Origin of Universities (University of Magnaura in Constantinople)|accessdate=19 December 2008|work=The Origin of Universities|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|url-status=dead|archivedate=20 February 2009|url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220164836/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Constantinople]] was Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatakes|Moutafakis|2003|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students, the world's first university as well.&lt;ref name=Bump/&gt;

===Symbols===

[[File:Flag of the Greek Orthodox Church.svg|thumb|upright|The flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] is based on the coat of arms of the [[Palaiologoi]], the last dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]].]]

The most widely used symbol is the [[flag of Greece]], which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto ''[[Eleftheria i Thanatos]]'' (Freedom or Death), which was the motto of the [[Greek War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papadakis|1995|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross, which represents [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]]. The Greek flag is widely used by the [[Greek Cypriots]], although [[Cyprus]] has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] minority (see [[flag of Cyprus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.gr/en/shmaia.htm |title=The Flag |accessdate=19 December 2008 |work=Law 851, Gov.

The pre-1978 (and first) flag of Greece, which features a [[Cross|Greek cross]] (''crux immissa quadrata'') on a blue background, is widely used as an alternative to the official flag, and they are often flown together. The [[national emblem of Greece]] features a blue [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] with a white cross surrounded by two laurel branches. A common design involves the current flag of Greece and the pre-1978 flag of Greece with crossed flagpoles and the national emblem placed in front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older Flags: 19 December 2008|work=Flags of the Greeks|publisher=Skafidas Zacharias|url=http://users.att.sch.gr/zskafid/simea5a.htm}} [Note: Website contains image of the 1665 original for the current Greek flag.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highly recognizable and popular Greek symbol is the [[Flag of Greece#Double-headed eagle|double-headed eagle]], the imperial emblem of the last dynasty of the Eastern Roman Empire and a common symbol in [[Asia Minor]] and, later, [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grierson|Bellinger|1999|loc=&quot;Eagles&quot;, pp. 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not part of the modern Greek flag or coat-of-arms, although it is officially the insignia of the [[Greek Army]] and the flag of the [[Church of Greece]]. It had been incorporated in the Greek coat of arms between 1925 and 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Byzantine Flags|work=Byzantine Heraldry|publisher=François Velde|year=1997|accessdate=13 May 2016|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/byzantin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics in Greece}}

[[Classical Athens]] is considered the birthplace of [[Democracy]]. The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in [[Greek city-state]]s, notably Athens, to mean &quot;rule of the people&quot;, in contrast to [[aristocracy]] ({{lang|grc|ἀριστοκρατία}}, ''{{lang|la|aristokratía}}''), meaning &quot;rule by an excellent elite&quot;, and to [[oligarchy]]. While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, N.G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Cleisthenes]], Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC,&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, A Concise History, Volume I: To 1740'' (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2007), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; which took gradually the form of a [[direct democracy]]. The democratic form of government declined during the Hellenistic and Roman eras, only to be revived as an interest in Western Europe during the [[early modern period]].

The European enlightenment and the democratic, liberal and nationalistic ideas of the [[French Revolution]] was a crucial factor to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the modern Greek state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cl48&quot;&gt;Clogg, ''A Concise History of Greece '', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paroulakis32&quot;&gt;Goldstein, ''Wars and Peace Treaties'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern Greek politicians include [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], founder of the [[First Hellenic Republic]], reformist [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who marked the shape of modern Greece, social democrats [[Georgios Papandreou]] and [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]], [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], founder of the [[Third Hellenic Republic]], and socialist [[Andreas Papandreou]].

===Surnames and personal names===
{{see also|Greek name|Ancient Greek personal names}}

Greek surnames began to appear in the 9th and 10th century, at first among ruling families, eventually supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father's name as disambiguator.&lt;ref name=Wickham&gt;{{harvnb|Wickham|2005|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics,&lt;ref name=Wickham/&gt; such those ending in the suffix ''-opoulos'' or ''-ides'', while others derive from trade professions, physical characteristics, or a location such as a town, village, or monastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon&quot;/&gt; Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine [[proper nouns]] in the [[nominative case]]. Occasionally (especially in Cyprus), some surnames end in ''-ou'', indicating the [[genitive case]] of a patronymic name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fong|2004|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many surnames end in suffixes that are associated with a particular region, such as ''-akis'' (Crete), ''-eas'' or ''-akos'' ([[Mani Peninsula]]), ''-atos'' (island of [[Cephalonia]]), ''-ellis'' (island of [[Lesbos]]) and so forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon&quot;/&gt; In addition to a Greek origin, some surnames have Turkish or Latin/Italian origin, especially among Greeks from [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Ionian Islands]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koliopoulos|1987|p=xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Female surnames end in a vowel and are usually the genitive form of the corresponding males surname, although this usage is not followed in the diaspora, where the male version of the surname is generally used.

With respect to personal names, the two main influences are Christianity and classical Hellenism; ancient Greek nomenclatures were never forgotten but have become more widely bestowed from the 18th century onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transition of Modern Greek Names|work=Lexicon of Greek Personal Names|publisher=Oxford University|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/modern.html|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in antiquity, children are customarily named after their grandparents, with the first born male child named after the paternal grandfather, the second male child after the maternal grandfather, and similarly for female children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naming practices|work=Lexicon of Greek Personal Names|publisher=Oxford University|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/practices.html|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal names are often familiarized by a diminutive suffix, such as ''-akis'' for male names and ''-itsa'' or ''-oula'' for female names.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon&quot;/&gt; Greeks generally do not use middle names, instead using the genitive of the father's first name as a middle name. This usage has been passed on to the [[Russian names|Russians]] and other [[East Slavs]] ([[otchestvo]]).

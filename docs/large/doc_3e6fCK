==Types==
[[File:Fever Patterns v1.2.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Different fever patterns observed in Plasmodium infections.]]
Various patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular [[medical diagnosis]]:
*[[Continuous fever]], where temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than {{val|1|u=°C}} in 24 hours{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} (e.g. in [[lobar pneumonia]], [[typhoid]], [[meningitis]], [[urinary tract infection]], or [[typhus]]{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Typhoid fever]] may show a specific fever pattern, a ''Wunderlich curve'', with a slow stepwise increase and a high plateau (drops due to fever-reducing drugs are excluded).{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
*[[Intermittent fever]], where the temperature elevation is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal (e.g., in [[malaria]], [[Visceral leishmaniasis|leishmaniasis]], [[pyemia]], or [[sepsis]]{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}); 
*[[Remittent fever]], where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than {{val|1|u=°C}} in 24 hours{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} (e.g., in [[infective endocarditis]], or [[brucellosis]]{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}).

Among the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens.

In addition, there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]—the [[Pel–Ebstein fever]], with patient's argued to present high temperature for one week, followed by low for the next week, and so on, where the generality of this pattern is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilson AJ | title = Pel-Ebstein fever | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 333 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–67 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7777006 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199507063330118 }}, which cites [[Richard Asher]]'s lecture, &quot;Making Sense&quot; [''Lancet'' (1959) '''2''': 359].&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2020|4|2}}

==Pathophysiology==
{{See also|Thermoregulation in humans}}
===Hypothalamus===
Temperature is regulated in the [[hypothalamus]]. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of [[prostaglandin E2]] (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a [[thermostat]].&lt;ref name=Harrisons20th/&gt; When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. [[Norepinephrine]] increases [[thermogenesis]] in [[brown adipose tissue]], and muscle contraction through shivering raises the [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25976513 &quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans SS, Repasky EA, Fisher DT | title = Fever and the thermal regulation of immunity: the immune system feels the heat | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 335–49 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25976513 | pmc = 4786079 | doi = 10.1038/nri3843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the [[autonomic nervous system]] or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;!--Citation needed to fully cover both bullet points.--&gt;
* Increased heat production by increased [[muscle tone]], [[shivering]] (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like [[epinephrine]]; and
* Prevention of heat loss, e.g., through [[vasoconstriction]].
When the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline—either spontaneously or via medication—normal functions such as sweating, and the reverse of the foregoing processes (e.g., vasodilation, end of shivering, and nonshivering heat production) are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

This contrasts with [[hyperthermia]], in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat. Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment ([[heat stroke]]) or an adverse reaction to drugs. Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to [[anti-pyretic]] medications.&lt;ref name=Harrisons20th/&gt;{{verification needed|date=April 2020}}

In infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate [[brown adipose tissue]] to produce heat (non-exercise-associated [[thermogenesis]], also known as non-shivering thermogenesis).{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased [[blood pressure]] in fever.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Pyrogens===
&lt;!--WHERE SHOULD THIS GO?   The highly toxic [[metabolism]]-boosting supplement [[2,4-Dinitrophenol|2,4-dinitrophenol]] induces [[hyperthermia|high body temperature]] via the inhibition of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by [[mitochondria]], resulting in impairment of [[cellular respiration]].

====Endogenous====
Endogenous pyrogens are [[cytokine]]s released from [[monocyte]]s (which are part of the [[immune system]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = 4 - General Systemic States|date=2017-01-01 | title = =Veterinary Medicine | edition = 11th |pages=43–112|editor-last=Constable|editor-first=Peter D.|publisher=W.B.

Whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens, they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated from molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dinarello CA | title = The history of fever, leukocytic pyrogen and interleukin-1 | journal = Temperature | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–16 | date = 2015-03-31 | pmid = 27226996 | pmc = 4843879 | doi = 10.1080/23328940.2015.1017086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever. These proteins produce a [[cyclooxygenase]] which induces the hypothalamic production of PGE2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Srinivasan|first1=Lakshmi | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = 128 - Cytokines and Inflammatory Response in the Fetus and Neonate|date=2017-01-01 | title = Fetal and Neonatal Physiology | edition = 5th |pages=1241–1254.e4|editor-last=Polin|editor-first=Richard A.|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-35214-7.00128-1|isbn=978-0-323-35214-7 |last2=Harris|first2=Mary Catherine|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Laurie E.|editor2-last=Abman|editor2-first=Steven H.|editor3-last=Rowitch|editor3-first=David H.|editor4-last=Benitz|editor4-first=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exogenous ====
Exogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin. In general, these pyrogens, including bacterial cell wall products, may act on Toll-like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson|first1=Mary E. | name-list-style = vanc  | chapter = 130 - Fever and Systemic Symptoms|date=2011-01-01 | title =Tropical Infectious Diseases: Principles, Pathogens and Practice | edition = 3rd |pages=925–938|editor-last=Guerrant|editor-first=Richard L.|publisher=W.B.

An example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]]s (LPS) present in the cell wall of [[gram-negative bacteria]]. According to one mechanism of pyrogen action, an immune system protein, [[lipopolysaccharide-binding protein]] (LBP), binds to LPS, and the LBP–LPS complex then binds to a [[CD14]] receptor on a [[macrophage]]. The LBP-LPS binding to CD14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous [[cytokine]]s, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). A further downstream event is activation of the [[arachidonic acid pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth J, Blatteis CM | title = Mechanisms of fever production and lysis: Lessons from experimental LPS fever | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 1563–604 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25428854 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c130033 | isbn = 9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PGE2 release===
PGE2 release comes from the [[arachidonic acid]] pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the [[enzyme]]s [[phospholipase|phospholipase A2]] (PLA2), [[cyclooxygenase|cyclooxygenase-2]] (COX-2), and [[prostaglandin E2 synthase]]. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.

PGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The set point temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the [[preoptic area]] (POA) through the [[prostaglandin E receptor 3]] (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]] (DMH), the rostral [[raphe]] pallidus nucleus in the [[medulla oblongata]] (rRPa), and the [[paraventricular nucleus]] (PVN) of the hypothalamus . Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving [[pituitary gland]] and various [[endocrine organs]].

==Management==
The evidence does not currently support routine antipyretic administration for patients with fever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ludwig J, McWhinnie H |title=Antipyretic drugs in patients with fever and infection: literature review |journal=Br J Nurs |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=610–618 |date=May 2019 |pmid=31116598 |doi=10.12968/bjon.2019.28.10.610 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most febrile cases recover without specific medical attention.&lt;ref name=CDC_symptoms&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/sick.htm |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=What To Do If You Get Sick: 2009 H1N1 and Seasonal Flu |date=2009-05-07 |access-date=2009-11-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103195142/http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/sick.htm |archive-date=3 November 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated. Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 42&amp;nbsp;°C (107.6&amp;nbsp;°F), and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40.6&amp;nbsp;°C (105&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=revben&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Edward James Walter and Mike Carraretto| title=The neurological and cognitive consequences of hyperthermia  |date=2016 |journal=Critical Care | volume=20 | issue=1 | page=199 | doi=10.1186/s13054-016-1376-4 |pmid=27411704| pmc=4944502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treating fever in people with [[sepsis]] does not affect outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewry AM, Ablordeppey EA, Murray ET, Stoll CR, Izadi SR, Dalton CM, Hardi AC, Fowler SA, Fuller BM, Colditz GA | title = Antipyretic Therapy in Critically Ill Septic Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 806–13 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28221185 | pmc = 5389594 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0000000000002285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Fever is one of the most common [[medical signs]].&lt;ref name=Peds2011/&gt; It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children,&lt;ref name=Peds2011/&gt; and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.&lt;ref name=Ki2013/&gt; About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.&lt;ref name=EMP2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nassisi D, Oishi ML | title = Evidence-based guidelines for evaluation and antimicrobial therapy for common emergency department infections | journal = Emergency Medicine Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28; quiz 28–29 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22292348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when [[Hippocrates]] was practicing medicine including that due to [[malaria]] (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days).&lt;ref name=Sajadi2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sajadi MM, Bonabi R, Sajadi MR, Mackowiak PA | title = Akhawayni and the first fever curve | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 55 | issue = 7 | pages = 976–80 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22820543 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cis596 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.&lt;ref name=Sajadi2012/&gt;

Fevers were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Until the late nineteenth century, approximately half of all humans died from fever before the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-pathol-031920-101429|title=Lethal Infectious Diseases as Inborn Errors of Immunity: Toward a Synthesis of the Germ and Genetic Theories|year=2021|last1=Casanova|first1=Jean-Laurent|last2=Abel|first2=Laurent|journal=Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease|volume=16|pmid=32289233|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia,&lt;ref name=Peds2011/&gt;&lt;ref name = Crocetti2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crocetti M, Moghbeli N, Serwint J | title = Fever Phobia Revisited: Have Parental Misconceptions About Fever Changed in 20 Years? | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 6 | pages = 1241–1246 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11389237 | doi = 10.1542/peds.107.6.1241 | url = https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/6/1241 | access-date = 31 March 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based in both caregiver's and parents' misconceptions about fever in children.

{{main|thermoregulation}}
Fever is an important feature for the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[veterinary medicine|disease in domestic animals]]. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a [[horse]] is said to have a fever above {{val|101|u=°F}} ({{val|38.3|u=°C}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/healthVitalSigns.shtml|title=Equusite Vital Signs|publisher=equusite.com|access-date=2010-03-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326053227/http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/healthVitalSigns.shtml|archive-date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In species that allow the body to have a wide range of &quot;normal&quot; temperatures, such as [[camel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt-Nielsen K, Schmidt-Nielsen B, Jarnum SA, Houpt TR | title = Body temperature of the camel and its relation to water economy | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 188 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–12 | date = January 1957 | pmid = 13402948 | doi = 10.1152/ajplegacy.1956.188.1.103 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes difficult to determine a febrile stage.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever.

'''Telemetry''' is the [[in situ]] [[data collection|collection of measurements]] or other data at remote points and their automatic [[data transmission|transmission]] to receiving equipment ([[telecommunication]]) for monitoring.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite report|title=Telemetry: Summary of concept and rationale|bibcode=1987STIN...8913455.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots ''tele'', &quot;remote&quot;, and ''metron'', &quot;measure&quot;. Systems that need external instructions and data to operate require the counterpart of telemetry, [[telecommand]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Bellis, &quot;Telemetry&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term commonly refers to [[wireless communications|wireless]] data transfer mechanisms (e.g., using [[radio]], ultrasonic, or [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]] systems), it also encompasses data transferred over other media such as a telephone or [[computer network]], optical link or other wired communications like power line carriers. Many modern telemetry systems take advantage of the low cost and ubiquity of [[GSM]] networks by using [[SMS]] to receive and transmit telemetry data.

A ''telemeter'' is a physical device used in telemetry. It consists of a [[sensor]], a transmission path, and a display, recording, or control device. Electronic devices are widely used in telemetry and can be wireless or hard-wired, [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]]. Other technologies are also possible, such as mechanical, hydraulic and optical.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi ''et al.'', pages 8.1–8.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemetry may be [[commutation (telemetry)|commutated]] to allow the transmission of multiple data streams in a fixed [[frame (networking)|frame]].

==History==

The beginning of industrial telemetry lies in the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|steam age]], although the sensor was not called ''telemeter'' at that time.&lt;ref name=Kopp&gt;Brian Kopp, &quot;Industrial telemetry&quot;, in ''Telemetry Systems Engineering'', pages 493-524, Artech House, 2002 {{ISBN|1580532578}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[James Watt]]'s (1736-1819) additions to his steam engines for monitoring from a (near) distance such as the [[mercury pressure gauge]] and the [[fly-ball governor]].&lt;ref name=Kopp/&gt;

Cheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The ''[[Sillon industriel]]'' (''Industrial Valley''), and in particular the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' around [[Charleroi]], were the centre of the steel industry until the Second World War.

====Railways====
[[File:Stoomloc Le Belge.jpg|thumb|right|The first Belgian-produced steam locomotive, ''&quot;The Belgian&quot;'' ([[Le Belge (locomotive)|&quot;''Le Belge''&quot;]]) built in 1835]]
{{Main|History of rail transport in Belgium}}
The nation provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the Industrial Revolution. After 1830, the new nation decided to stimulate industry. It funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was very soundly built along British lines, so that profits and wages were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. Léopold I went on to build the [[Rail transport in Belgium|first railway in continental Europe]] in 1835, between Brussels and [[Mechelen]]. The first trains were drawn by [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]] engines imported from Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O'Brien, ''Railways and the economic development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of smaller railways in Belgium, notably the [[Liège]]–[[Jemappes]] line, was launched by tendering contracts to private companies which &quot;became the model for the extension of small local railways all over the low countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ascherson231&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=231|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1900s, Belgium was a major exporter of trams and other rail components, exporting vast quantities of railway materials. In South America, 3,800 kilometers of track were owned by Belgian firms, with a further 1,500 kilometers in [[Qing dynasty|China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ascherson231&quot;/&gt; One Belgian entrepreneur, [[Édouard Empain]], known as the &quot;Tramway King,&quot; built many public transport systems across the world, including the [[Paris Métro]], as well as the tram systems in [[Cairo]], [[Boulogne]] and [[Astrakhan]]. Empain's firm also built the new Cairo suburb of [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|pages=231–232|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important businesses included [[Cockerill-Sambre]] (steel), the chemical factories of [[Ernest Solvay]], and the firearms maker [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]].

===Liberalism and Catholicism===
:''See also [[Liberalism in Belgium]] and [[First School War]]''

Politics, says Clark, &quot;was dominated by a struggle between two political groups, known as the Catholics and the Liberals. In general terms, the Catholics represented the relatively religious, conservative and rural elements in the society, while the Liberals represented the more secular, more progressive and more urban middle-class elements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Clark, &quot;Nobility, bourgeoisie and the industrial revolution in Belgium,&quot; ''Past &amp; Present'' (1984) p 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the arrival of the socialists in the 1890s, the nation was therefore polarised between the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] and the secular [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberals were anticlerical and wanted to reduce the power of the Church. The conflict came to a head during the &quot;[[First School War]]&quot; of 1879–1884 as Liberal attempts to introduce a greater level of secularism in primary education were beaten back by outraged Catholics. The School War ushered in a period of Catholic Party dominance in Belgian politics that lasted (almost unbroken) until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, ''The Low Countries,'' ch 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious conflict also extended to university education, where secular universities like the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]] competed with Catholic universities like the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].

===Linguistic conflict===
The majority of those in the north of the country spoke Dutch and other [[Low Franconian languages]] while those in the south spoke [[Langues d'oïl]] such as [[French language|French]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and [[Picard language|Picard]]. French became the official language of government after the separation from the Netherlands in 1830 and Belgian cultural life was especially dominated by the French influence,&lt;ref&gt;Rondo E. Cameron, ''France and the economic development of Europe, 1800–1914'' (2000) p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Vos, &quot;Nationalism, Democracy and the Belgian State&quot; in Richard Caplan and John Feffer, ''Europe's New Nationalism: States and Minorities in Conflict'' (Oxford, 1966) pp.89–90&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by economic domination of the industrial south. Flemish was &quot;reduced to the tongue of a second-class culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Flemish population reacted against this, agitating for the equality of their language with French. This was partly due to a sense of growing Flemish identity, made possible through greater awareness of Flemish culture and history from the 1840s. Flemish victories, like the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302 were celebrated and a Flemish cultural movement, led by figures like [[Hendrik Conscience]] was born.  About the same time a Walloon Movement emerged, led by [[Jules Destrée]] (1863–1936) and based on loyalty to the French language. Universal suffrage meant the Francophones were a political minority, so the Walloon Movement concentrated on protecting French where it had a majority, and did not contest the expanded use of Dutch in Flemish areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds. ''Nationalism in Belgium: Shifting Identities, 1780–1995'' (1998), pp 10–11, 139–52&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flemish goal of linguistic equality (especially in schools and courts) was finally achieved by a series of laws in the 1920s and 1930s. Dutch became the language of government, education, and the courts in the northern provinces of East Flanders and West Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, and eastern Brabant. French remained the official language in Wallonia; Brussels, which had seen a major [[Francization of Brussels|language shift to French]], became an officially bilingual region.  Meanwhile, a small separatist Flemish movement had emerged; the Germans had supported it during the war, and in the 1930s it turned fascist. In the Second World War it collaborated with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds. ''Nationalism in Belgium: Shifting Identities, 1780–1995'' (1998), pp 10–12, 83–95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations and military policy===
[[File:Medaille Commemorative 1870 71 Belgique AVERS.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[1870–71 Commemorative Medal|Commemorative Medal]] awarded to Belgian soldiers who had served during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].]]
:''See also [[Belgium and the Franco-Prussian War]]''
In the mid-1860s during the [[French intervention in Mexico|&quot;Mexican Adventure&quot;]], around 1,500 Belgian soldiers joined the &quot;Belgian Expeditionary Corps,&quot; better known as the [[Belgian Legion#Mexico Expedition|&quot;Belgian Legion&quot;]] to fight for [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian I]], whose wife, [[Carlota of Mexico|Charlotte]] was the daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chartrand|first=Rene|title=The Mexican Adventure 1861–67|url=https://archive.org/details/mexicanadventure00char|url-access=limited|isbn=1-85532-430X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanadventure00char/page/n36 36]–7|date=1994-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium was not a belligerent in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] 1870–71, but the proximity of the war led to the mobilisation of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|pages=78–79|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1839 international guarantee of Belgian neutrality was not violated.

After the conflict, there was talk of modernising the military. The system of ''[[Remplacement]]'' (whereby wealthy Belgians conscripted into the military could pay for a &quot;replacement&quot;) was abolished and an improved system of conscription implemented. These reforms, led by [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan]] under pressure from [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], divided Belgian politics. The Catholics united with the Liberals under [[Walthère Frère-Orban|Frère-Orban]] to oppose them, and the reforms were finally defeated when [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan's]] government fell during an unrelated scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=81|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the military was reformed. The 1909 System instituted compulsory military service of eight years on active duty and five years in the reserves.  This swelled the size of the Belgian army to over 100,000 well-trained men.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated70&quot;/&gt; Construction of a chain of forts along the border was intensified, and let to a series of very modern fortifications, including the so-called &quot;[[National redoubt of Belgium|National redoubt]]&quot; at [[Antwerp]], at [[Fortified Position of Liège|Liège]] and [[Fortified Position of Namur|Namur]], many of them designed by the great Belgian fortress architect, [[Henri Alexis Brialmont]].

===Rise of the Socialist Party and the trade unions===
:''See also [[Belgian Labour Party]] and [[Belgian general strikes]]''

The economy was stagnant during the long depression of 1873–95, as prices and wages fell and labour unrest grew.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries'' pp 316–18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgian Workers' Party]] was founded in 1885 in Brussels. It issued the [[Charter of Quaregnon]] in 1894 calling for an end to capitalism and a thorough reorganization of society. Though, the Belgian Workers' Party was not elected to government until the late 20th century, it exerted considerable pressure on the rest of the political process, both through direct participation in politics themselves, but also through general strikes.

During the late 19th century, [[Belgian general strikes|general strikes]] became an established aspect of the political process. Between 1892 and 1961, there were 20 major strikes, including 7 general strikes. Many of these had overtly political motives, like the [[Belgian general strike of 1893|1893 General Strike]] that helped achieve universal suffrage.

On several occasions, Belgian general strikes escalated into violence. In 1893, soldiers fired on the striking crowd, killing several. [[Karl Marx]] wrote, &quot;There exists but one country in the civilised world where every strike is eagerly and joyously turned into a pretext for the official massacre of the Working Class. That country of single blessedness is Belgium!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Marx and Engels on the Trade Unions.'' Edited with an introduction and notes, by Kenneth Lapides, Originally published, Praeger, New York, 1987, p. 69 {{ISBN|0-7178-0676-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Belgium created a welfare net particularly early, thanks in part to the trade unions. Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary old-age insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peter Flora &amp;|first=Arnold J. Heidenheimer|title=The Development of Welfare States in Europe and America|year=1995|publisher=Transaction|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting rights===

:''See also [[Belgian general strike of 1893]]''
In 1893 the government rejected a proposal for universal male suffrage. Outraged, the [[Belgian Labour Party]] called a General Strike; by April 17, there were more than 50,000 strikers. Violent confrontations broke out with the ''[[Garde Civique]]'' (the ''Civil Guard'' or militia) around the country, as in [[Mons]], where several strikers were killed. Violence escalated. The government soon backed down, and passed male universal suffrage but reduced its impact by creating [[Plural voting#Belgium|plural votes]] based on wealth, education and age. The Catholic conservatives, with 68% of the seats, remained in power, as the Liberals dropped to only 13% of the seats and the Socialists held their share.&lt;ref&gt;Els Witte, et al., ''Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards'' (2009), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in [[Belgian general strike of 1902|1902]] and [[Belgian general strike of 1913|1913]] there were general strikes aimed at forcing electoral reform and ending the system of plural voting.  After the 1913 strike a commission was created and was expected to remove plural voting – but implementation was delayed by the 1914 German invasion of Belgium. In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war &quot;Government of National Union&quot; and brought about one man, one vote universal male suffrage. The last restrictions on women's voting were only lifted in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier|first=Petra|title=Report from Belgium|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|publisher=European Database – Women in Decision-making|accessdate=3 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112220709/http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|archive-date=12 January 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Artistic and literary culture in Belgium began a revival towards the late 19th century. Particularly, among Walloons with the new French language literary and artistic review ''[[La Jeune Belgique]]''.

A core element of Belgian nationalism was the scientific study of its national history. The movement was led by Godefroid Kurth (1847–1916), a student of the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]]. Kurth taught modern historical methods to his students at the [[University of Liège]]. The most prominent Belgian historian was [[Henri Pirenne]] (1862–1935), who was influenced by this method during his period as a student of Kurth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Le Goff|title=History and Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxV77VaWPJkC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1992|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=198|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780231075916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture and Art Nouveau====
[[File:CinquantenaireArchInSnow.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire Arch]], built in 1905]]
:''See also [[Art Nouveau]]''

At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, monumental [[Historicism (architecture)|Historicism]] and [[Neoclassical architecture in Belgium|Neoclassicism]] dominated the urban Belgian landscape, particularly in government buildings, between the 1860s and 1890s. Championed in part by King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] (known as the &quot;Builder King&quot;), the style can be seen in the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]] (designed by [[Joseph Poelaert]]) and the [[Cinquantenaire]], both of which survive in Brussels.

Nevertheless, Brussels became one of the major European cities for the development of the [[Art Nouveau]] style in the late 1890s. The architects [[Victor Horta]], [[Paul Hankar]], and [[Henry van de Velde]] became particularly famous for their designs, many of which survive today in Brussels. Four buildings designed by Horta are listed by [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]. Horta's largest work, the ''[[Maison du Peuple]]'' was demolished in 1960.

==Empire==
{{See also|Belgian colonial empire}}
Stanard rejects the widely held notion that Belgians were &quot;reluctant imperialists.&quot;  He argues that &quot;ordinary people came to understand and support the colony. Belgians not only sustained the empire in significant ways, but many became convinced imperialists, evidenced by the widespread, enduring and eagerly embraced propaganda in favor of the Congo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew G.

:''Main articles: [[Congo Free State]] and [[Belgian Congo]]''
King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] had been the principal shareholder in the Belgian trading company which established trading stations on the lower Congo between 1879 and 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer, Alan 1979 p. 42&quot;&gt;Palmer, Alan (1979) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth Century History''. London: Allen Lane; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–1885 the future [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] was personally assigned to Leopold, who named the territory the [[Congo Free State]]. It was originally intended to be an international [[Free Trade]] zone, open to all European traders.&lt;ref name=AofE66&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|title=The age of empire : 1875–1914|year=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0297816355|pages=66|edition=Reissued.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area included in this territory was just under 1 million square miles,&lt;ref name=AofE59&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|title=The age of empire : 1875–1914|year=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0297816355|pages=59|edition=Reissued}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 80 times the size of Belgium.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The first infrastructure projects took place during the Free State period, such as a railway that ran from the [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] to the coast which took several years to complete.

The era of the [[Congo Free State]] is most infamous for the large number of atrocities committed under it. Since it was, in effect, a business venture, run by a private company headed by Leopold himself, it aimed to gain as much money as possible from primary exports from the territory. Leopold's personal fortune was greatly increased through the proceeds of selling Congolese rubber, which had never previously been mass-produced in such surplus quantities, to the growing market for tyres. During the period between 1885 and 1908, as many as eight million Congolese died of exploitation and disease while the birth rate dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlakis|first=Dean|title=Belgian Congo|url=http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/belgian_congo/index.html|work=Genocide Studies Program|accessdate=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104154116/http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/belgian_congo/index.html|archivedate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these are only rough estimates, as no figures are available for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubinstein|first=William D.|title=Genocide : a history|year=2004|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow|isbn=978-0-582-50601-5|pages=98–99|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the rubber quotas, the [[Force Publique]] (FP) was created. While the Force Publique was nominally a military force – it would later fight during both the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|First]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|Second World Wars]]) -during the Congo Free State period its primary duties involved enforcing rubber quotas in rural areas. If a village did not meet the rubber quota which had been set, soldiers were often sent to the respective village, and numerous measures could be adopted to enforce the taxes: rape, abduction, forced labor, executions. Imprisonment and [[summary execution]]s were common. Severing of limbs was sometimes used by the Force Publique as a method of enforcing the quotas.&lt;ref name=&quot;cas1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kakutani|first1=Michiko|title='King Leopold's Ghost': Genocide With Spin Control|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/daily/leopold-book-review.html|accessdate=31 December 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Belgian captain, Leon Rom, had ornamented his flowerbeds with the heads of 21 decapitated natives which had been murdered in a punitive expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Asserate, Asfa-Wossen (2016): Die neue Völkerwanderung.

Following reports from missionaries, there was growing moral outrage, particularly in Britain and the United States. The [[Congo Reform Association]], led by [[Edmund Dene Morel]], was particularly important in this campaign, and published numerous best-selling tracts and pamphlets (including ''Red Rubber'') which reached a vast public. King Leopold appointed and financed his own commission to put these accusations to rest, but it too confirmed the atrocities.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[File:Léopold II Bruxelles.JPG|thumb|upright|Equestrian statue of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in Brussels]]

The Belgian parliament long refused to take over the colony, which was considered a financial burden. In 1908, the Belgian parliament responded to the international pressure, annexing the Free State, as the campaigners had argued for. After World War II, Belgium was criticized by the [[United Nations]] for making no progress on the political front, in contrast with other contemporary colonial states. Despite propaganda campaigns within Belgium, few Belgians showed much interest in the colony; very few went there, and imperial enthusiasm was never widespread. Also, the government limited the possibility of Congolese settling inside Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Stice, &quot;Review&quot; of Matthew G.

Political rights were not granted to the Africans until 1956 when the growing middle class (the so-called ''[[Évolué]]'') received the franchise, and the economy remained relatively undeveloped despite the mineral wealth of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. At the [[Congolese Round Table Conference|Round Table Talks on independence]], Belgium requested a process of gradual independence over 4 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Belgium and the Congo, 1885-1980|last=Vanthemsche, Guy|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521194211|location=Cambridge|oclc=801193141}}&lt;/ref&gt; but following a [[Congo Crisis#1959 Leopoldville and Stanleyville Riots|series of riots]] in 1959, the decision was made to bring forward independence in matter of months.

===China 1902–31===
The [[Concessions in Tianjin#Belgian concession (1902–1931)|Belgian Tianjin Concession]] in China was established in 1902. There was little investment and no settlement. However it led to a contract to supply an electric light and trolley system. In 1906, Tianjin became the first city in China with a modern public transportation system. The supply of electricity and lighting and the trolley business were profitable ventures. All the rolling stock was supplied by Belgian industries and by 1914, the network also reached nearby Austrian, French, Italian, Japanese and Russian concessions.

===Ruanda-Urundi 1917–61===
After the defeat of Germany in World War I, Belgium inherited [[League of Nations]] mandates over [[Ruanda-Urundi]].

The colony was administered in a similar way as by the former German administrators, continuing policies such as ethnic identity cards. In 1959, moves towards independence could be seen in the territory and agitation by [[PARMEHUTU]], a Hutu political party, was evident. In 1960, the [[Rwandan Revolution]] occurred and Belgium changed the appointments of chiefs and vice-chiefs to promote Hutus into the posts.

Ruanda-Urundi gained independence in 1962 and its two regions, [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], separated.

==World War I==
[[File:Belgian machinegunner in 1918 guarding trench.jpg|thumb|250px|A Belgian machine gunner at the front lines in 1918, firing a [[Chauchat]] machine gun.]]
{{see also|Belgium in World War I}}
When World War I began, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], trying to take Paris quickly. The threat to France caused Britain to enter the war; it used the 1839 agreement as justification.  The [[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian army]] is remembered for their stubborn resistance during the early days of the war, with the army – around a tenth the size of the Germany Army – holding up the German offensive for nearly a month, giving the French and British forces time to prepare for the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne counteroffensive]] later in the year. The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and subversive, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation.

Belgium had a prosperous economy in 1914 at the start of the war but after four years of occupation, it emerged in a poor state; although Belgium itself had suffered few deaths. The Germans had &quot;brutally and efficiently stripped the country bare. Machinery, spare parts, whole factories including the roofs, had disappeared eastward. In 1919, 80 percent of its workforce was unemployed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Margaret MacMillan 2003 277&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=MacMillan|title=Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzgiYw0kegC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2003|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=277|isbn=9780307432964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Role===
:''See also [[Battle of the Yser]]''
Belgian soldiers fought delaying actions in 1914 during the initial invasion.  They succeeded in throwing the elaborate German invasion plan off schedule and helped sabotage the Schlieffen Plan that Berlin had counted on for a quick victory over France,  At the [[Battle of Liège]], the [[Fortified Position of Liège|town's fortifications]] were able to hold off the invaders for over a week, buying valuable time for the Allies. The German &quot;[[Race to the Sea]]&quot; was held off by Belgian forces at the [[Battle of the Yser]]. King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]] stayed in the [[Yser]] as commander of the military to lead the army while [[Charles de Broqueville|Broqueville's government]] withdrew to nearby [[Le Havre]] in France.
Belgian units continued to serve on the front until 1918.

[[Force Publique|Forces]] from the [[Belgian Congo]] also played a major role in the African Campaign and [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia|a small unit]] of Belgian soldiers also served on the Eastern Front.

The German army executed between 5,500&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated102&quot;/&gt; and 6,500&lt;ref&gt;John Horne and Alan Kramer, German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial (Yale U.P. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers.  Individuals suspected of partisan activities were summarily shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated101&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several important Belgian figures, including politician [[Adolphe Max]] and historian [[Henri Pirenne]] were deported to Germany.

Flemish feeling of identity and consciousness grew through the events and experiences of war. The German occupying authorities viewed the Flemish as an oppressed people and had taken several Flemish-friendly measures, known as ''[[Flamenpolitik]]''. This included introducing Dutch as the language of instruction of all state-supported schools in Flanders in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted a renewed Flemish movement in the years following the war. The Flemish ''[[Frontpartij|Frontbeweging]]'' (''Soldiers' Movement'') was formed from Flemish soldiers in the Belgian army to campaign for greater use of Dutch language in education and government, though not separatist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans left Belgium stripped and barren.  Over a 1.4 million refugees fled to France or to neutral Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann. ''The Low Countries'' (1978), p 523-35&lt;/ref&gt;  After the systematic atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe.  There was never a violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians &quot;turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation,&quot; says Kossmann.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, p 525&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1916 Germany shipped 120,000 men and boys to work in Germany; this set off a storm of protest from neutral countries and they were returned. Germany then stripped the factories of all useful machinery, and used the rest as scrap iron for its steel mills.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, p 533&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relief===
Belgium faced a food crisis and an international response was organized by the American engineer [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, ''The Life of Herbert Hoover: The Humanitarian, 1914–1917'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was unprecedented in world history. Hoover's [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] (CRB) had the permission of Germany and the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;David Burner, ''Herbert Hoover: A Public Life'' (1996) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As chairman of the CRB, Hoover worked with the leader of the Belgian ''[[Comité National de Secours et d'Alimentation]]'' (CNSA), [[Émile Francqui]], to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war. The CRB obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CN to distribute, and watched over the CN to make sure the German army didn't appropriate the food. The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads. Private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget.&lt;ref&gt;Burner, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, the American arm, the [[American Relief Administration|ARA]] fed 10.5 million people daily. Great Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; [[Winston Churchill]] led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort &quot;a positive military disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burner, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar period==

King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]] returned as a war hero, leading the victorious army and acclaimed by the population. In contrast, the government and the exiles came back discreetly.  Belgium had been devastated—not so much by combat, but rather by German seizure of valuable machinery. Only 81 operable locomotives remained, out of the 3,470 available in 1914. 46 of 51 steel mills were damaged, with 26 destroyed totally. More than 100,000 houses had been destroyed, as well as more than {{convert|300000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated113&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves of popular violence accompanied liberation in November and December 1918 and the government responded through the judicial punishment of collaboration with the enemy conducted between 1919 and 1921. Shop windows were broken and houses sacked, men were harassed, and women's heads were shaved. Manufacturers who had closed their businesses sought the severe repression of those who had pursued their activities. Journalists who had boycotted and stopped writing called for harsh treatment of the newspapers that submitted to German censorship. Many people stigmatized profiteers and demanded justice. Thus in 1918, Belgium was already confronted with the problems associated with occupation that most European countries only discovered at the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence VanYpersele, and Xavier Rousseaux, &quot;Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'Unpatriotic' Behaviour in Belgium (1918–1921).'' ''European Review of History'' (2005) 12#1 pp 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the status quo, Belgium recovered surprisingly quickly. The [[1920 Summer Olympics|first postwar Olympic Games]] were held in Antwerp in 1920. In 1921, [[Luxembourg]] formed a customs union with Belgium.

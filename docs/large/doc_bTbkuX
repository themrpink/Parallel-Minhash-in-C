In addition, human papillomavirus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases, dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and an HPV test are done at the same time (also called Pap co-testing).

===Practical aspects===
The endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. Since abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.

The endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.

In the United States, a Pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for Pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bettigole C | title = The Thousand-Dollar Pap Smear | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 16 | pages = 1486–1487 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24131176 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1307295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The test was invented by and named after the Greek doctor [[Georgios Papanikolaou]], who started his research in 1923. [[Aurel Babeș]] of [[Romania]] independently made similar discoveries in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. O'Dowd, E.E. Philipp, ''The History of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology'', London, Parthenon Publishing Group, 1994, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Babeș' method was radically different from Papanicolaou's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamantis A, Magiorkinis E, Androutsos G | date = Jul 2010 | title = What's in a name? Evidence that Papanicolaou, not Babeș, deserves credit for the Pap test | journal = Diagnostic Cytopathology | volume = 38 | issue = 7| pages = 473–6 | doi = 10.1002/dc.21226 | pmid = 19813255 | s2cid = 37757448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papanicolaou's name was repeatedly submitted to the Nobel Committee and rejected every time. The Nobel Committee delegated the in-depth investigation of Papanicolaou's merits and demerits to Professor Santesson, who was at that time the head of pathology at the Stockholm Cancer Institute ([[Radiumhemmet]]). Santesson discovered Babeș' contributions that had never been cited by Papanicolaou and duly reported this fact to the Committee, which then rejected Papanicolaou's Nobel award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koss|first=Leopold G.|date=2003-01-01|title=Aurel Babeş|journal=International Journal of Gynecological Pathology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=101–102|issn=0277-1691|pmid=12496707|doi=10.1097/00004347-200301000-00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental techniques==

In the developed world, cervical biopsy guided by colposcopy is considered the &quot;[[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]]&quot; for diagnosing cervical abnormalities after an abnormal Pap smear. Other techniques such as [[triple smear]] are also done after an abnormal Pap smear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krunger|first1=TF|last2=Botha|first2=MH|title=Clinical gynaecology|date=2007|publisher=Juta|location=South Africa|page=23|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEsPakNJWZYC&amp;q=vce+smear&amp;pg=PA21|access-date=7 December 2016|isbn=9780702173059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure requires a trained colposcopist and can be expensive to perform. However, Pap smears are very sensitive and some negative biopsy results may represent undersampling of the lesion in the biopsy, so negative biopsy with positive cytology requires careful follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bewtra|first1=Chhanda|last2=Pathan|first2=Muhammad|last3=Hashish|first3=Hisham|date=2003-10-01|title=Abnormal Pap smears with negative follow-up biopsies: Improving cytohistologic correlations|journal=Diagnostic Cytopathology|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=200–202|doi=10.1002/dc.10329|pmid=14506671|s2cid=40202036|issn=1097-0339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental visualization techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, [[speculoscopy]], [[cervicography]], visual inspection with acetic acid or with Lugol's, and colposcopy&lt;!-- confusing? --&gt;) and electronic detection methods (e.g., [[Polarprobe]] and in-vivo [[Spectroscopy]]). These techniques are less expensive and can be performed with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.

=== Australia ===
Australia has used the Pap test as part of its cervical screening program since its implementation in 1991 which required women past the age of 18 be tested every 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cervical cancer screening|url=https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/causes-and-prevention/early-detection-and-screening/cervical-cancer-screening|access-date=2020-08-13|website=www.cancer.org.au|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2017 Australia discontinued its use of the Pap test and replaced it with a new HPV test that is only required to be conducted once every 5 years from the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Health|first=Australian Government Department of|title=Cervical Screening|url=http://www.cancerscreening.gov.au/internet/screening/publishing.nsf/Content/cervical-screening-1|publisher=Australian Government Department of Health|language=en|access-date=2020-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare covers the costs of testing, however, if your doctor does not allow bulk billing you may have to pay for the appointment and then claim the Medicare rebate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cancer Institute of NSW|title=Do I need to pay for my cervical screen|url=https://www.cancer.nsw.gov.au/cervical-screening-nsw/your-cervical-screening-appointment/do-i-need-to-pay-for-my-cervical-screen|website=Cancer Institute NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
Free Pap tests were offered from 1974 - 84 before being replaced by a system in which all women over the age of 30 could have the cost of their Pap test reimbursed by the National Health Insurance in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y-Y|last2=You|first2=S-L|last3=Chen|first3=C-A|last4=Shih|first4=L-Y|last5=Koong|first5=S-L|last6=Chao|first6=K-Y|last7=Hsiao|first7=M-L|last8=Hsieh|first8=C-Y|last9=Chen|first9=C-J|date=2009-07-07|title=Effectiveness of national cervical cancer screening programme in Taiwan: 12-year experiences|journal=British Journal of Cancer|volume=101|issue=1|pages=174–177|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6605139|issn=0007-0920|pmc=2713714|pmid=19536091}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was still ongoing in 2018 and encouraged women to screen at least every 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=M.-J.|last2=Wu|first2=C.-Y.|last3=Chen|first3=R.|last4=Wang|first4=Y.-W.|date=2018-10-01|title=HPV Vaccination and Cervical Cancer Screening in Taiwan|journal=Journal of Global Oncology|language=en|volume=4|issue=Supplement 2|pages=235s|doi=10.1200/jgo.18.94300|issn=2378-9506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the number of people receiving Pap tests remain lower than countries like Australia. Some believe this is due to a lack of awareness regarding the test and its availability. It has also been found that women who have chronic diseases or other reproductive diseases are less likely to receive the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fang-Hsin Leea |author2=Chung-Yi Lic |author3=Hsiu-Hung Wanga |author4=Yung-Mei Yang |title=The utilization of Pap tests among different female medical personnel: A nationwide study in Taiwan |journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=56 |issue=6 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2013.03.001 |pmid=23524115 |pages=406–409 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iprojectmaster.com/NURSING/final-year-project-materials/knowledge-and-acceptability-of-cervical-cancer-screening-among-female-part-time-students|title=Knowledge of Cervical Cancer Screening among Women|website=iprojectmaster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=NB Peterson |author2=HJ Murff |author3=Y Cui |author4=M Hargreaves |author5=JH Fowke |title=Papanicolaou testing among women in the southern United States |journal=Journal of Women's Health |date=Jul–Aug 2008 |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=939–46 |url=http://westminster.worldcat.org/title/papanicolaou-testing-among-women-in-the-southern-united-states/oclc/264677368 |access-date=October 15, 2013 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0576|pmc=2942751 |pmid=18582173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England ===
As of 2020 the NHS maintains a cervical screening program in which women between the age of 25 - 49 are invited for a smear test every 3 years, and women past 50 every 5 years. Much like Australia, England uses a HPV test before examining cells that test positive using the Pap test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cervical screening (smear testing) {{!}} Health Information {{!}} Bupa UK|url=https://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information/womens-health/cervical-screening|access-date=2020-08-14|website=www.bupa.co.uk|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is free as part of the national cervical screening program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=admin|date=2013-08-30|title=About cervical screening|url=https://www.jostrust.org.uk/information/cervical-screening/what-is-cervical-screening|access-date=2020-08-14|website=Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coccoid bacteria==
The finding of [[coccus|coccoid]] bacteria on a Pap test is of no consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of precancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for [[streptococci]] and [[anaerobic bacteria]] (such as [[metronidazole]] and [[amoxicillin]]) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise.&lt;ref name=Hughey&gt;[http://www.ttuhsc.edu/elpaso/som/obgyn/obgyn101/my%20documents4/Text/Pap/coccoid_bacteria.htm OB-GYN 101: Introductory Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology &gt; Coccoid Bacteria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222013237/http://www.ttuhsc.edu/elpaso/som/obgyn/obgyn101/my%20documents4/Text/Pap/coccoid_bacteria.htm |date=2014-02-22 }} by Michael Hughey Hughey at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. Retrieved Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; If there are symptoms of [[vaginal discharge]], bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.&lt;ref name=Hughey/&gt;

'''Tempio Pausania''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtɛmpjo pauˈzaːnja|-|It-Tempio Pausania.ogg}}; {{lang-sdn|Tèmpiu}}) is a town of about 14,000 inhabitants in the [[Gallura]] region of northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], in the [[province of Sassari]].

== History ==
Cultural and delegated administrative centre of the Gallura sub-region, Tempio has an ancient history. Typical [[granite]]-stone architecture of the historical centre presents many similarities with southern [[Corsica]]n towns.

In 2005-2016 it was the capital of the [[province of Olbia-Tempio]] together with [[Olbia]].

== Main sights ==
* Historical centre of the town, built in grey granite blocks (mainly 18th century); particularly Corso Matteotti, via Roma (''Carrera Longa'', ''Lu Runzatu'', ''Lu Pultali''), Piazza d'Italia (''Piazza di l'Ara''), Parco delle Rimembranze, Fonte Nuova (''Funtana Noa'') and Parco di San Lorenzo, via Mannu (ex via dei Nobili or dei Cavalieri)
* Nuraghe Maiori (''Naracu Maiori'')
* Nuraghe Polcu (''Naracu Polcu'')
* Ruins of Palace of Giudice Nino Visconti di Gallura (1200)
* San Pietro (''Santu Petru'') Cathedral;
* Santa Croce Church;
* Oratorio del Rosario (13th&amp;ndash;14th century);
* Palazzo Villamarina-Pes (17th century);
* Palazzo degli Scolopi, (17th century), actually Provincial offices;
* Purgatorio (''Lu Pulgatoriu'') Church (17th century)
* Fonti di Rinagghju
* [[Monte Limbara]], elevation {{convert|1359|m|ft}}, {{convert|16|km|mi|0}} south of the town.

== Transport ==
Tempio Pausania has national roads with [[Sassari]] (SS 672), Olbia (SS127) and [[Palau (OT)|Palau]] (SS133). There is a railway station on the [[narrow gauge]] Sassari to Palau line, with occasional tourist train services run by [[Trenino Verde]].

'''Michel Eyquem de Montaigne''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|n}} {{respell|mon|TAYN}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/montaigne &quot;Montaigne&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ekɛm də mɔ̃tɛɲ|lang}}; 28 February 1533&amp;nbsp;– 13 September 1592&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;), also known as '''Lord of Montaigne''', was one of the most significant philosophers of the [[French Renaissance]], known for popularizing the [[essay]] as a [[literary genre]]. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes&lt;ref&gt;His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament...They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pléiade, Paris (ed. A. Thibaudet) 1937, Bk. 1, ch.40, p. 252 (tr. Charles Rosen)&lt;/ref&gt; and autobiography with intellectual insight. His massive volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' contains some of the most influential essays ever written.

Montaigne had a direct influence on Western writers including [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Michael J., At the Origins of Modern Atheism, Yale UP, 1990, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[William Hazlitt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinnaird p. 274&quot;&gt;Kinnaird, John, ''William Hazlitt: Critic of Power'', Columbia University Press, 1978, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[John Henry Newman]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Eric Hoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;from ''Truth Imagined'', memoir by Eric Hoffer.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]], and possibly, on the later works of [[William Shakespeare]].

During his lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, &quot;I am myself the matter of my book&quot;, was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne came to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt that began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] remark, &quot;''Que sçay-je''?&quot; (&quot;What do I know?&quot;, in [[Middle French]]; now rendered as ''Que sais-je?'' in modern French).

==Life==
Montaigne was born in the [[Aquitaine]] region of France, on the family estate [[Château de Montaigne]], in a town now called [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]], close to [[Bordeaux]]. The family was very wealthy; his great-grandfather, Ramon Felipe Eyquem, had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur of Montaigne, was a [[Catholic Church in France|French Catholic]] soldier in Italy for a time and he also had been the mayor of Bordeaux.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;

Although there were several families bearing the [[patronym]] &quot;Eyquem&quot; in [[Guyenne]], his father's family is thought to have had some degree of [[Marrano]] (Spanish and Portuguese Jewish) origins,&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Jama, ''L’Histoire Juive de Montaigne'' [''The Jewish History of Montaigne''], Paris, Flammarion, 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother, Antoinette López de Villanueva, was a convert to Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His mother was a Jewish Protestant, his father a Catholic who achieved wide culture as well as a considerable fortune.&quot; ''Civilization,'' Kenneth Clark, (Harper &amp; Row: 1969), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather, Pedro Lopez,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CObUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Honorette+DUPUY+Pierre | title = Zeitschrift für Französische Sprache und Literatur | last1 = Winkler | first1 = Emil | year = 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Zaragoza]], was from a wealthy [[Marrano]] ([[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]]) family that had converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goitein |first=Denise R |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_14134.html |title=Montaigne, Michel de |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Judaica |publisher=The Gale Group |year=2008 |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction: Montaigne's Life and Times'', in ''Apology for Raymond Sebond'', By Michel de Montaigne (Roger Ariew), (Hackett: 2003), p. iv: &quot;Michel de Montaigne was born in 1533 at the chateau de Montagine (about 30 miles east of Bordeaux), the son of Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne, and Antoinette de Louppes (or Lopez), who came from a wealthy (originally Iberian) Jewish family&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...the family of Montaigne's mother, Antoinette de Louppes (Lopez) of Toulouse, was of Spanish Jewish origin....&quot; – ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne'', translated by [[Donald M.

During a great part of Montaigne's life his mother lived near him and even survived him, but is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.

Montaigne's education began in early childhood and followed a [[pedagogy|pedagogical plan]] that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter's [[humanism|humanist]] friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, &quot;draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne. ''Essays'', III, 13&lt;/ref&gt; After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the château. Another objective was for [[Latin language|Latin]] to become his first language.

The intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who could not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he employed, and thus they acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne's Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than the more traditional books.

The atmosphere of the boy's upbringing, although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father, created in the boy's life the spirit of &quot;liberty and delight&quot; that he later would describe as making him &quot;relish... duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint&quot;; yet he would have everything to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning, playing one instrument or another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Robert Maynard|editor1-last=Hutchins |editor2-first=W.

Around the year 1539, Montaigne was sent to study at a highly regarded boarding school in Bordeaux, the [[College of Guienne]], then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era, [[George Buchanan]], where he mastered the whole curriculum by his thirteenth year. He finished the first phase of his educational studies at the College of Guienne in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Desan (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Montaigne'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; He then began his study of law (his alma mater remains unknown since there are no certainties about his activity from 1546 to 1557)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKEYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q= ''Bibliothèque d'humanisme et Renaissance: Travaux et documents'', Volume 47], Librairie Droz, 1985, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of [[Périgueux]] and, in 1557, he was appointed counselor of the [[Parlement]] in Bordeaux, a high court. From 1561 to 1563 he was [[courtier]] at the court of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and he was present with the king at the [[siege of Rouen (1562)]]. He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the [[Order of Saint Michael]], something to which he aspired from his youth.

While serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became a very close friend of the humanist poet [[Étienne de La Boétie]], whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame, in his introduction to ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne'' that because of Montaigne's &quot;imperious need to communicate&quot;, after losing Étienne he began the ''[[Essais]]'' as a new &quot;means of communication&quot; and that &quot;the reader takes the place of the dead friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, Donald (translator).

Montaigne married Françoise de la Cassaigne in 1565, probably in an arranged marriage. She was the daughter and niece of wealthy merchants of Toulouse and Bordeaux. They had six daughters, but only the second-born, Léonor, survived infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/07/me-myself-and-i|title=Me, Myself, And I|first=Jane|last=Kramer|date=31 August 2009|accessdate=16 March 2019|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about their marriage, he wrote very little about their relationship, however, he did write about of his daughter Léonor, &quot;All my children die at nurse; but Léonore, our only daughter, who has escaped this misfortune, has reached the age of six and more without having been punished, the indulgence of her mother aiding, except in words, and those very gentle ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/montaigneessayi04johngoog|title=Montaigne the essayist.

Following the petition of his father, Montaigne started to work on the first translation of the Catalan monk [[Raymond Sebond]]'s ''[[Theologia naturalis]]'', which he published a year after his father's death in 1568 (in 1595, Sebond's Prologue was put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] because of its declaration that the Bible is not the only source of revealed truth). After this, he inherited the family's estate, the Château de Montaigne, to which he moved back in 1570, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaigne's posthumous edition of the works of his friend, Boétie.

In 1571, he retired from public life to the [[Montaigne's tower|Tower of the château]], his so-called &quot;citadel&quot;, in the [[Dordogne]], where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 works, he began work on his ''Essais'' (&quot;Essays&quot;), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves of his working chamber:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Richard L. Regosin, ‘Montaigne and His Readers', in Denis Hollier (ed.) ''A New History of French Literature'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 1995, pp. 248–52, p. 249. The Latin original runs: 'An. Christi 1571 aet. 38, pridie cal. mart., die suo natali, Mich. Montanus, servitii aulici et munerum publicorum jamdudum pertaesus, dum se integer in doctarum virginum recessit sinus, ubi quietus et omnium securus (quan)tillum in tandem superabit decursi multa jam plus parte spatii: si modo fata sinunt exigat istas sedes et dulces latebras, avitasque, libertati suae, tranquillitatique, et otio consecravit.' as cited in Helmut Pfeiffer, 'Das Ich als Haushalt: Montaignes ökonomische Politik’, in Rudolf Behrens, Roland Galle (eds.)

During this time of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in France, Montaigne, a Roman Catholic, acted as a moderating force,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} respected both by the Catholic [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]] and the Protestant [[Henry of Navarre]]. Montaigne believed that a knowledge of devastating effects of vice is calculated to excite an aversion to vicious habits.

In 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful [[kidney stone disease|kidney stone]]s, a tendency he inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt; From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at [[Bagni di Lucca]], where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the [[Holy House of Loreto]], to which he presented a silver relief depicting him, his wife, and their daughter kneeling before the Madonna, considering himself fortunate that it should be hung on a wall within the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance'', 2nd ed.

During a visit to the Vatican that Montaigne described in his travel journal, the ''Essais'' were examined by [[Sisto Fabri]], who served as [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. After Fabri examined Montaigne's ''Essais'' the text was returned to him on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of &quot;fortuna&quot; as well as for writing favorably of [[Julian the Apostate]] and of heretical poets, and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;''Treccani.it, L'encicolpedia Italiana, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sisto-fabri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Dizionario Biografico''].

Two days later in Ainola, on the evening of 20 September 1957, Sibelius died of a [[brain haemorrhage]] at age 91. At the time of his death, his Fifth Symphony, conducted by Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], was broadcasting via radio from Helsinki. At the same time, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] was in session and the then-General Assembly President Sir [[Leslie Munro]] of New Zealand ordered a [[moment of silence]], saying, &quot;Sibelius belonged to the whole world. With his music, he enriched the life of the entire human race&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SibEUlius – Jean Sibelius 150 Years |url=http://www.finncult.be/sibeulius150-jean-sibelius/?lang=en |website=Finnish Cultural Institute for the Benelux |accessdate=23 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105501/http://www.finncult.be/sibeulius150-jean-sibelius/?lang=en |archive-date=23 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known Finnish composer, [[Heino Kaski]], died the same day but his death was overshadowed by that of Sibelius.

==Music==
{{See also|List of compositions by Jean Sibelius}}

Sibelius is widely known for his symphonies and his tone poems, especially ''Finlandia'' and the ''Karelia suite''. His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony ''Kullervo'', which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem ''Kalevala''. His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially ''En saga'', ''The Swan of Tuonela'' and ''Valse triste''.&lt;ref name=alexross&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=9 July 2007 |title=Sibelius: Apparition from the Woods |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2007/07/sibelius-chapte.html |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a Violin Concerto, the opera ''Jungfrun i tornet'', many shorter orchestral pieces, chamber music, works for piano and violin, choral works and numerous songs.{{sfn|Poroila|2012}}

In the mid-1920s, after his Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, he composed the symphonic poem ''Tapiola'' and incidental music for ''The Tempest''. Thereafter, although he lived until 1957, he did not publish any further works of note. For several years, he worked on an Eighth Symphony, which he later burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Gramophone |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/composers/jean-sibelius-39924 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for his musical style, hints of Tchaikovsky's music are particularly evident in early works such as his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=209}} For a period, he was nevertheless overwhelmed by Wagner, particularly while composing his opera. More lasting influences included Ferruccio Busoni and Anton Bruckner. But for his tone poems, he was above all inspired by [[Liszt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;symposion&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=102}} The similarities to Bruckner can be seen in the brass contributions to his orchestral works and the generally slow tempo of his music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vkIWs6nvRs8C&amp;pg=PA63 63]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kalamidas, Thanos |date=12 August 2009 |title=Jean Sibelius |work=Ovi Magazine |url=http://www.ovimagazine.com/art/5165 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of [[sonata form]] in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger &quot;themes&quot; effectively prove the opposite.{{sfn|Pike|1978|page=93}}

[[File:Jean Sibelius by Eero Järnefelt 1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Sibelius from 1892 by his brother-in-law [[Eero Järnefelt]]]]
This self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius's primary rival in symphonic composition.{{sfn|Botstein|2011}} While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler's style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together, leading Sibelius to comment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I said that I admired [the symphony's] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs&amp;nbsp;... Mahler's opinion was just the reverse. &quot;No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.&quot;{{sfn|James|1989|p=41}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Symphonies===
[[File:Robert Kajanus (14854805748).jpg|left|thumb|Robert Kajanus, founder and chief conductor of the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], who was a notable interpreter of Sibelius's symphonies]]

Sibelius started work on his Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, in 1898 and completed it in early 1899, when he was 33. The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original, well received version that has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revision was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 18 July 1900.&lt;ref&gt;David Ewen, ''Music for the Millions – The Encyclopedia of Musical Masterpieces'' (READ Books, 2007) p533&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony begins with a highly original, rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First symphony op. 39 (1899–1900) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_01.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Second Symphony, the most popular and most frequently recorded of his symphonies, was first performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society on 8 March 1902, with the composer conducting. The opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for the whole work. The heroic theme of the finale with the three-tone motif is interpreted by the trumpets rather than the original woodwinds. During a period of Russian oppression, it consolidated Sibelius's reputation as a national hero. After the first performance, Sibelius made some changes, leading to a revised version first performed by Armas Järnefelt on 10 November 1903 in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Second symphony op. 43 (1902)
|work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_02.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Symphony is a good-natured, triumphal, and deceptively simple-sounding piece. The symphony's first performance was given by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer, on 25 September 1907. There are themes from Finnish folk music in the work's early chords. Composed just after his move to Ainola, it contrasts sharply with the first two symphonies, with its clear mode of expression developing into the marching tones of the finale.&lt;ref name=alexross/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Third symphony op. 52 (1907) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_03.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Fourth Symphony was premiered in Helsinki on 3 April 1911 by the Philharmonia Society, with Sibelius conducting. It was written while Sibelius was undergoing a series of operations to remove a tumour from his throat. Its grimness can perhaps be explained as a reaction from his (temporary) decision to give up drinking. The opening bars, with cellos, basses and bassoons, convey a new approach to timing. It then develops into melancholic sketches based on the composer's setting of Poe's ''The Raven''. The waning finale is perhaps a premonition of the silence Sibelius would experience twenty years later. In contrast to the usual assertive finales of the times, the work ends simply with a &quot;leaden thud&quot;.&lt;ref name=alexross/&gt;

Symphony No. 5 was premiered in Helsinki to great acclaim by Sibelius himself on 8 December 1915, his 50th birthday. The version most commonly performed today is the final revision, consisting of three movements, presented in 1919. The Fifth is Sibelius's only symphony in a major key throughout. From its soft opening played by the horns, the work develops into rotational repetitions of its various themes with considerable transformations, building up to the trumpeted swan hymn in the final movement.&lt;ref name=alexross/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fifth symphony op. 82 (1915–1919) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_05.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Fifth had already started to veer away from the sonata form, the Sixth, conducted by the composer at its premiere in February 1923, is even further removed from the traditional norms. Tawaststjerna comments that &quot;the [finale's] structure follows no familiar pattern&quot;.{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=322}} Composed in the [[Dorian mode]], it draws on some of the themes developed while Sibelius was working on the Fifth as well as from material intended for a lyrical violin concerto. Now taking a purified approach, Sibelius sought to offer &quot;spring water&quot; rather than cocktails making use of lighter flutes and strings rather than the heavy brass of the Fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sixth symphony op. 104 (1923) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_06.htm |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symphony No. 7 in C major was his last published symphony. Completed in 1924, it is notable for having only one movement. It has been described as &quot;completely original in form, subtle in its handling of [[tempo|tempi]], individual in its treatment of [[key (music)|key]] and wholly organic in growth&quot;.{{sfn|Layton|2002|p=479}} It has also been called &quot;Sibelius's most remarkable compositional achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hepokoski|2001}}. Quoted by {{harvnb|Whittall|2004|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially titled ''Fantasia sinfonica'', it was first performed in Stockholm in March 1924, conducted by Sibelius. It was based on an adagio movement he had sketched almost ten years earlier. While the strings dominate, there is also a distinctive trombone theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seventh symphony op. 105 (1924) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_sinf_07.htm |accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone poems===
After the seven symphonies and the violin concerto, Sibelius's thirteen symphonic poems are his most important works for orchestra and, along with the tone poems of Richard Strauss, represent some of the most important contributions to the genre since Franz Liszt. As a group, the symphonic poems span the entirety of Sibelius's artistic career (the first was composed in 1892, while the last appeared in 1925), display the composer's fascination with nature and Finnish mythology (particularly the ''Kalevala''), and provide a comprehensive portrait of his stylistic maturation over time.{{sfn|Layton|1965|p=95}}

''[[En saga]]'' (meaning a fairy tale) was first presented in February 1893 with Sibelius conducting. The single-movement tone poem was possibly inspired by the Icelandic mythological work ''[[Prose Edda|Edda]]'' although Sibelius simply described it as &quot;an expression of [his] state of mind&quot;. Beginning with a dreamy theme from the strings, it evolves into the tones of the woodwinds, then the horns and the violas, demonstrating Sibelius's ability to handle an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=En Saga |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_satu.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer's first significant orchestral piece, it was revised in 1902 when Ferruccio Busoni invited Sibelius to conduct his work in Berlin. Its successful reception encouraged him to write to Aino: &quot;I have been acknowledged as an accomplished 'artist{{' &quot;}}.{{sfn|Wicklund|2014|p=30}}

''[[The Wood Nymph]]'', a single-movement tone poem for orchestra, was written in 1894. Premiered in April 1895 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting, it is inspired by the Swedish poet [[Viktor Rydberg]]'s work of the same name. Organizationally, it consists of four informal sections, each corresponding to one of the poem's four stanzas and evoking the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigour; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief. Despite the music's beauty, many critics have faulted Sibelius for his &quot;over-reliance&quot; on the source material's narrative structure.{{sfn|Kurki|1999}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_metsanhaltijatar.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lemminkäinen Suite]]'' was composed in the early 1890s. Originally conceived as a mythological opera, ''Veneen luominen'' (''The Building of the Boat''), on a scale matching those by [[Richard Wagner]], Sibelius later changed his musical goals and the work became an orchestral piece in four movements. The suite is based on the character Lemminkäinen from the Finnish national epic, the ''Kalevala''. It can also be considered a collection of [[symphonic poem]]s. The second/third section, ''The Swan of Tuonela'', is often heard separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lemminkäinen |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_lemminkainen.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Finlandia]]'', probably the best known of all Sibelius's works, is a highly patriotic piece first performed in November 1899 as one of the tableaux for the Finnish Press Celebrations. It had its public premiere in revised form in July 1900.&lt;ref name=incidental/&gt; The current title only emerged later, first for the piano version, then in 1901 when Kajanus conducted the orchestral version under the name ''Finlandia''. Although Sibelius insisted it was primarily an orchestral piece, it became a world favourite for choirs too, especially for the hymn episode. Finally the composer consented and in 1937 and 1940 agreed to words for the hymn, first for the Freemasons and later for more general use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finlandia |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_finlandia.htm |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Oceanides]]'' is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913–14. The piece, which refers to the [[Oceanid|nymphs]] in [[Greek mythology]] who inhabited the [[Mediterranean Sea]], premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius himself conducting. The work (in [[D major]]), praised upon its premiere as &quot;the finest evocation of the sea ever produced in music&quot;,{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=242}} consists of two subjects Sibelius gradually develops in three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.{{sfn| Kilpeläinen|2012|p=viii}}

''Tapiola'', Sibelius's last major orchestral work, was commissioned by [[Walter Damrosch]] for the [[New York Philharmonic]] Society where it was premiered on 26 December 1926. It is inspired by [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]], a forest spirit from the ''Kalevala''. To quote the American critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], it &quot;turned out to be Sibelius's most severe and concentrated musical statement.&quot;&lt;ref name=alexross/&gt; Even more emphatically, the composer and biographer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]] asserts: &quot;Even if Sibelius had written nothing else, this one work would entitle him to a place among the greatest masters of all time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tapiola |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_tapiola.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other important works===
The ''Karelia Music'', one of the composer's earlier works, written for the Vyborg Students' Association, was first performed on 13 November 1893 to a noisy audience. The &quot;Suite&quot; emerged from a concert on 23 November consisting of the overture and the three movements, which were published as Op. 11, the ''Karelia Suite''. It remains one of Sibelius's most popular pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Other orchestral works: Karelia Music, Overture and Suite |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_muita_karelia.htm |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Valse triste'' is a short orchestral work that was originally part of the incidental music Sibelius composed for his brother-in-law Arvid Järnefelt's 1903 play ''Kuolema''. It is now far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of ''Kuolema'' (meaning death). The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as ''Valse triste''. An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces.&lt;ref name=wod/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steinberg, Michael |title=Sibelius: Valse Triste, Opus 44 |publisher=San Francisco Symphony |url=https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060752/https://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/Sibelius-Valse-triste.aspx |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violin Concerto in D minor was first performed on 8 February 1904 with Victor Nováček as soloist. As Sibelius had barely completed the piece in time for the premiere, Nováček had insufficient time to prepare with the result that the performance was a disaster. After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the [[Staatskapelle Berlin|Berlin Court Orchestra]]. With [[Karel Halíř]], the orchestra's leader, as soloist it was a tremendous success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison Symphony&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Allsen, J.

''Kullervo'', one of Sibelius's early works, is sometimes referred to as a choral symphony but is better described as a suite of five symphonic movements resembling tone poems.{{sfn|Eden|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AOS74uZTasYC&amp;pg=PA149 149]}} Based on the character [[Kullervo]] from the ''Kalevala'', it was premiered on 28 April 1892 with [[Emmy Achté]] and Abraham Ojanperä as soloists and Sibelius conducting the chorus and orchestra of the recently founded Helsinki Orchestra Society. Although the work was only performed five times during the composer's lifetime, since the 1990s it has become increasingly popular both for live performances and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kullervo |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_kullervo.htm |accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freemasonry==
When [[Freemasonry]] was revived in Finland, having been forbidden under the Russian reign, Sibelius was one of the founding members of Suomi Lodge No. 1 in 1922 and later became the Grand Organist of the Grand Lodge of Finland. He composed the ritual music used in Finland (Op. 113) in 1927 and added two new pieces composed in 1946. The new revision of the ritual music of 1948 is one of his last works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music for Freemasonry |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/vapaamuurari.ht |accessdate=11 November 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Sibelius loved nature, and the Finnish landscape often served as material for his music. He once said of his Sixth Symphony, &quot;[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow.&quot; The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of Tapiola. On the subject of Sibelius's ties to nature, his biographer, Tawaststjerna, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola. He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Leevi Madetoja (circa 1930s).jpg|thumb|left|[[Leevi Madetoja]], Sibelius's most notable pupil and, as a critic, a defender of his works]]
[[File:Musik Meile Wien, Jean Sibelius (22).jpg|thumb|Star on ''Musik Meile Vienna'']]
Sibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life, at least in English-speaking and Nordic countries. The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see [[Leevi Madetoja#Relationship with Sibelius|Relationship with Sibelius]]). In Britain, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Arnold Bax]] both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Furthermore, ''Tapiola'' is prominently echoed in both Bax's [[Symphony No. 6 (Bax)|Sixth Symphony]] and Moeran's [[Symphony in G minor (Moeran)|Symphony in G Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir Arnold Bax |publisher=Chandos |url=http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202420/http://www.chandos.net/pdf/CHAN%2010122.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schaarwächter|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EIvoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494 494]}} The influence of Sibelius's compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]] of [[William Walton]].{{sfn|Freed|1995}} When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors like Beecham and [[John Barbirolli|Barbirolli]] championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton's composer friend [[Constant Lambert]] even asserted that Sibelius was &quot;the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form&quot;.{{sfn|Lambert|1934|p=318}} Earlier, [[Granville Bantock]] had championed Sibelius (the esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society). More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]. [[Malcolm Arnold]] acknowledged his influence, and [[Arthur Butterworth]] also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work.{{sfn|Walker|2008}}

New Zealand's most accomplished 20th century composer, [[Douglas Lilburn]], wrote of the inspiration he derived from Sibelius's work, particularly for his earlier compositions. &lt;ref&gt; Philip Norman, ''Douglas Lilburn: His Life and Music'', Auckland University Press, 2006, pp. 125–26. &lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Ormandy and to a lesser extent, his predecessor with the Philadelphia Orchestra [[Leopold Stokowski]], were instrumental in bringing Sibelius's music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life. Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic [[Olin Downes]], who wrote a biography of the composer.{{sfn|Goss|1995}}

In 1938 [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that &quot;If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'.&quot;{{sfn|Adorno|1938}} Adorno sent his essay to [[Virgil Thomson]], then music critic of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', who was also critical of Sibelius; Thomson, while agreeing with the essay's sentiment, declared to Adorno that &quot;the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius&quot;.{{sfn|Ross|2009}} Later, the composer, theorist and conductor [[René Leibowitz]] went so far as to describe Sibelius as &quot;the worst composer in the world&quot; in the title of a 1955 pamphlet.{{sfn|Leibowitz|1955}}

Perhaps one reason Sibelius has attracted both the praise and the ire of critics is that in each of his seven symphonies he approached the basic problems of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route.{{sfn|Mäkelä|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbZJHaL_9AC&amp;pg=PA269 269]}} Sibelius's response to criticism was dismissive: &quot;Pay no attention to what critics say. No statue has ever been put up to a critic.&quot;&lt;ref name=alexross/&gt;

[[File:Hameenlinna Sibelius House 1.jpg|thumb|Sibelius's birthplace in Hämeenlinna]]
In the latter decades of the twentieth century, Sibelius became seen more favourably: [[Milan Kundera]] said the composer's approach was that of &quot;antimodern modernism,&quot; standing outside the perpetual progression of the status quo.{{sfn|Ross|2009}} In 1990, the composer [[Thea Musgrave]] was commissioned by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra to write a piece in honour of the 125th anniversary of Sibelius's birth: ''Song of the Enchanter'' premiered on 14 February 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song of the Enchanter |publisher=Thea Musgrave |url=http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/song_of_the_enchanter.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610024749/http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/song_of_the_enchanter.html |archivedate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the American avant-garde composer [[Morton Feldman]] gave a lecture in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, wherein he stated that &quot;the people you think are radicals might really be conservatives&amp;nbsp;– the people you think are conservatives might really be radical,&quot; whereupon he began to hum Sibelius's Fifth Symphony.{{sfn|Ross|2009}}

Writing in 1996, the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] stated, &quot;There are two things to be said straightaway about Sibelius. First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon). Second, at his very best, he is often weird.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Page |first=Tim |date=29 September 1996 |title=FINN DE SIECLE |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1996/09/29/finn-de-siecle/3c8f1482-a6f8-4605-b0d1-f9e2f06bac8d/ |accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes offers a counterweight to Page's assessment of Sibelius's piano music. Acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality, Andsnes believes that the common critical dismissal is unwarranted. In performing selected piano works, Andsnes finds that audiences were &quot;astonished that there could be a major composer out there with such beautiful, accessible music that people don't know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andsnes, Leif, liner notes for &quot;Leif Ove Andsnes, Sibelius&quot; Sony Classical CD 88985408502  2017&lt;/ref&gt;

With 8 December 2015 being the 150th anniversary of Sibelius's birth, the Helsinki Music Centre has planned an illustrated and narrated &quot;Sibelius Finland Experience Show&quot; every day during the summer of 2015. The production is also planned to extend over 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibelius Finland Experience |publisher=Musiikkitalo |url=https://www.musiikkitalo.fi/en/event/sibelius-finland-experience |accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December itself, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[John Storgårds]] has planned a commemorative concert featuring ''En Saga'', ''Luonnotar'' and the Seventh Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibelius 150 |publisher=Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra |url=http://helsinginkaupunginorkesteri.fi/en/node/159 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1972, Sibelius's surviving daughters sold [[Ainola]] to the State of Finland. The [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Finland)|Ministry of Education]] and the [[Sibelius Society of Finland]] opened it as a museum in 1974. The Finnish 100 [[Finnish markka|mark]] bill featured his image until 2002 when the euro was adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setelit.com&quot;/&gt; Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a Flag Day on 8 December, the composer's birthday, also known as the &quot;Day of Finnish Music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intermin.fi&quot;/&gt; The year 2015, the 150th anniversary of the composer's birth, featured a number of special concerts and events, especially in the city of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visit-Helsinki&quot;/&gt;

The quinquennial [[International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition]], instituted in 1965, the [[Sibelius Monument (Helsinki)|Sibelius Monument]], unveiled in 1967 in Helsinki's Sibelius Park, the [[Sibelius Museum]], opened in Turku in 1968, and the [[Sibelius Hall]] concert hall in Lahti, opened in 2000, were all named in his honour, as was the asteroid [[1405 Sibelius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MPC-Sibelius&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=1405 Sibelius (1936 RE) |work=Minor Planet Center |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=1405 |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete edition of Sibelius’ œuvre has been in preparation in Finland since 1996. It is a joint venture between the [[National Library of Finland]], the [[Sibelius Society of Finland]], and [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] publishers. When finished, this critical edition will comprise 60 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/projects/jean-sibelius-works-jsw Jean Sibelius Works (JSW).] The National Library of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibelius kept a diary in 1909–1944, and his family allowed it to be published, unabridged, in 2005. The diary was edited by Fabian Dahlström and published in the Swedish language in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sibelius, Jean | editor=Fabian Dahlström | title=Dagbok 1909–1944 | publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland | location=Helsingfors | year=2005 | isbn=951-583-125-3 | language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the composer, the entire diary was also published in the Finnish language in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sibelius, Jean | editor=Fabian Dahlström | title=Päiväkirja 1909–1944 | publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland | location=Helsinki | year=2015 | isbn=978-951-583-288-7 | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several volumes of Sibelius’ correspondence have also been edited and published in Swedish, Finnish and English.

The popular scorewriter program, [[Sibelius (scorewriter)|Sibelius]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scoringnotes.com/news/an-interview-with-ben-finn-part-1/ |last=Rothman |first=Philip |title=An interview with Ben Finn, co-founder of Sibelius [Part 1 of 2] |quote=We decided to call it &quot;Sibelius&quot; for reasons we can no longer remember, but it was almost certainly because [composer Jean] Sibelius was a &quot;Finn&quot; — a play on our surname |publisher=scoringnotes.com |date=23 June 2015 |access-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109125756/https://www.scoringnotes.com/news/an-interview-with-ben-finn-part-1/ |archive-date=9 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
Parts of the literary estate of Sibelius—correspondence and manuscripts—are preserved at the [[National Archives of Finland]] and [[National Library of Finland]], but several items are in foreign private collections, even as investments, only partially accessible for scholars.

In 1970, a lot of 50 music manuscript items was acquired by the National Library with aid from the State of Finland, banks and foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sirén, Vesa | title=Kansallisaarre vaarassa | newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat | date=1 March 2020 | page=C 10 | url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000006422160.html | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibelius’ personal music archive was donated to the National Library in 1982 by the heirs of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Ollikainen, Tapio: [http://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/fi/jean-sibelius-works-suurhanke-etenee Jean Sibelius Works -suurhanke etenee.] Kansalliskirjasto (in Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another lot of 50 items was procured in 1997, with aid from the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Finland)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HBL&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Virtanen, Timo | title=Nationalskatter i farozonen | newspaper=Hufvudstadsbladet | date=26 February 2020 | page=23 | url=http://www.hbl.fi/artikel/nationalskatter-i-fara/ | language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Italian-Finnish collector and benefactor Rolando Pieraccini donated a collection of Sibelius’ letters and other materials to the [[National Museum of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sirén, Vesa | title=Kansallismuseo sai Sibelius-kokoelman | newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat | date=19 January 2018 | page=B 6 | url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005529545.html | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, in 2016 the manuscript of ''Pohjola’s Daughter'' was sold to an anonymous buyer for 290,000 euros, and it is no longer available to scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBL&quot; /&gt;

In early 2020, the current owner of the [[Robert Lienau]] collection offered for sale 1,200 pages of manuscripts, including the scores of ''Voces intimae'', ''Joutsikki'', and ''Pelléas and Mélisande'', and the material is no longer available to scholars. The price tag is said to be over one million euros for the lot as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sirén, Vesa | title=Kansallisarkisto kiinnostui käsikirjoituksista | newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat | date=4 March 2020 | page=B 6 | url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000006425569.html | language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not legally possible to export Sibelius' manuscripts from Finland without permission, and such permission would probably not be given.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBL&quot; /&gt;

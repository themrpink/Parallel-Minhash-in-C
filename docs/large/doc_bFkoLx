Arago's earliest physical researches were on the [[pressure]] of [[steam]] at different temperatures, and the [[velocity]] of sound, 1818 to 1822. His [[magnet]]ic observations mostly took place from 1823 to 1826. He discovered rotatory magnetism, what has been called [[Arago's rotations]], and the fact that most bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by [[Michael Faraday]].

Arago warmly supported [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s [[optics|optical]] theories, helping to confirm [[Fresnel]]'s [[wave theory of light]] by observing what is now known as [[Arago spot|the spot of Arago]]. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light which led to the inference that the [[oscillation|vibration]]s of the [[luminiferous ether]] were transverse to the direction of [[motion (physics)|motion]], and that polarization consisted of a resolution of [[rectilinear propagation]] into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the [[polariscope]] and discovery of [[Rotary polarization]] are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to perform a [[polarimetric]] observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the [[Great Comet of 1819]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolokolova|first1=Ludmilla|title=Polarimetry of Stars and Planetary Systems|year=2015|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1-107-04390-9|page=380|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFqtCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea of the experimental determination of the [[velocity of light]] in the manner subsequently effected by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Léon Foucault]] was suggested by Arago in 1838, but his failing eyesight prevented his arranging the details or making the experiments.

[[File:Arago Francois portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|François Arago]]

Arago's fame as an experimenter and discoverer rests mainly on his contributions to magnetism in the co-discovery with [[Léon Foucault]] of [[eddy current]]s, and still more to [[optics]]. He showed that a magnetic needle, made to oscillate over nonferrous surfaces, such as water, glass, copper, etc., falls more rapidly in the extent of its oscillations according as it is more or less approached to the surface. This discovery, which earned him the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called &quot;magnetism of rotation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Annales de chimie et de physique'' (1824), vol. 27, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r9U3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA363#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 363]:  &quot;M. Arago communique verbalement les résultats de quelques expériences qu'il a faites sur l'influence que les métaux et beaucoup d'autres substances exercent sur l'aiguille aimantée, et qui a pour effet de diminuer rapidement l'amplitude des oscillations sans altérer sensiblement leur durée. Il promet, à ce sujet, un Mémoire détaillé.&quot; (Mr. Arago orally communicates the results of some experiments that he has conducted on the influence that metals and many other substances exert on a magnetic needle, which has the effect of rapidly reducing the amplitude of the oscillations without altering significantly their duration. He promises, on this subject, a detailed memoir.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arago | year = 1826 | title = &quot;Note concernant les Phénomènes magnétiques auxquels le mouvement donne naissance&quot; (Note concerning magnetic phenomena that motion creates) | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Itg3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 | journal = Annales de chimie et de physique | volume = 32 | pages = 213–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Babbage1825&gt;{{cite journal| author=Babbage, C. and Herschel, J.W.F. |year=1825 |title=Account of the repetition of M.

Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded as having proved the long-suspected connexion between the [[aurora borealis]] and the variations of the magnetic elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt; In 1827 he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that institute became the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1851, he became foreign member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004595 |title=Dominique François Jean Arago (1786 - 1853) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=7 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In optics, Arago not only made important optical discoveries on his own, but is credited with stimulating the genius of [[Jean-Augustin Fresnel]], with whose history, as well as that of [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], this part of his life is closely interwoven.

Shortly after the beginning of the 19th century the labours of at least three philosophers were shaping the doctrine of the [[undulatory theory of light|undulatory, or wave, theory of light]]. Fresnel's arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace, Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt; This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further fundamental laws of the polarization of light known by their means. As a result of this work, Arago constructed a polariscope, which he used for some interesting observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. He also discovered the power of rotatory polarization exhibited by [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;Arago (1811) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5326746608;view=1up;seq=103 &quot;Mémoire sur une modification remarquable qu'éprouvent les rayons lumineux dans leur passage à travers certains corps diaphanes et sur quelques autres nouveaux phénomènes d'optique&quot;] (Memoir on a remarkable modification that light rays experience during their passage through certain translucent substances and on some other new optical phenomena), ''Mémoires de la classe des sciences mathématiques et physiques de l'Institut Impérial de France'', 1st part : 93–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Arago's many contributions to the support of the undulatory hypothesis, comes the ''experimentum crucis'' which he proposed to carry out for measuring directly the velocity of light in air and in water and glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory, it should be retarded. In 1838 he communicated to the Academy the details of his apparatus, which utilized the relaying mirrors employed by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1835 for measuring the velocity of the electric discharge; but owing to the great care required in the carrying out of the project, and to the interruption to his labours caused by the revolution of 1848, it was the spring of 1850 before he was ready to put his idea to the test; and then his eyesight suddenly gave way. Before his death, however, the retardation of light in denser media was demonstrated by the experiments of H. L. Fizeau and B. L. Foucault, which, with improvements in detail, were based on the plan proposed by him.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

==Politics and legacy==
[[File:Arago medallion Paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the 135 Arago medallions set along the [[Paris Meridian]] for {{convert|9.2|km|0|abbr=on}}, in memorial to Arago and his work on the meridian and his measurements of the Earth.]]

In 1830, Arago, who always professed liberal opinions of the [[Republicanism|republican]] type, was elected a member of the chamber of deputies for the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ''[[département]]'', and he employed his talents of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all questions connected with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many of the most creditable national enterprises, dating from this period, are due to his advocacy – such as the reward to [[Louis Daguerre]] for the invention of photography, the grant for the publication of the works of [[Fermat]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], the acquisition of the museum of Cluny, the development of railways and electric telegraphs, the improvement of the reneile. In 1839, Arago reported the invention of photography to stunned listeners of a joint meeting of the academies of Arts and Sciences.

In 1830, Arago also was appointed director of the Observatory, and as a member of the chamber of deputies he was able to obtain grants of money for rebuilding it in part, and for the addition of magnificent instruments. In the same year, too, he was chosen perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, the place of [[Joseph Fourier]]. Arago threw himself into its service, and by his faculty of making friends he gained at once for it and for himself a worldwide reputation. As perpetual secretary it was his duty to pronounce historical [[eulogy|eulogies]] on deceased members; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of thought, and his happy piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge peculiarly adapted him. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Arago again visited [[Scotland]], to attend the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] at [[Edinburgh]]. From this time till 1848 he led a life of comparative quiet – although he continued to work within the Academy and the Observatory to produce a multitude of contributions to all departments of physical science – but on the fall of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] he left his laboratory to join the Provisional Government (24 February 1848). He was entrusted with two important functions, that had never before been given to one person, viz. the ministry of marine and colonies (24 February 1848{{snd}}11 May 1848) and ministry of war (5 April 1848{{snd}}11 May 1848); in the former capacity he improved rations in the navy and abolished flogging. He also abolished political oaths of all kinds and, against an array of moneyed interests, succeeded in procuring the [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolition of slavery]] in the [[French colonies]].

On 10 May 1848, Arago was elected a member of the [[French Executive Commission (1848)|Executive Power Commission]], a governing body of the French Republic. He was made President of the Executive Power Commission (11 May 1848) and served in this capacity as provisional head of state until 24 June 1848, when collective resignation of the commission was submitted to the National Constituent Assembly. At the beginning of May 1852, when the government of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]] required an oath of allegiance from all its functionaries, Arago peremptorily refused, and sent in his resignation of his post as astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes. This, however, the prince president declined to accept, and made &quot;an exception in favour of a savant whose works had thrown lustre on France, and whose existence the government would regret to embitter.&quot;

Cape Gregory in [[Oregon]] was named by [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] on 12 March 1778 after [[Saint Gregory]], the saint of that day; it was renamed [[Cape Arago State Park|Cape Arago]] after François Arago.&lt;ref name=OGN&gt;{{cite ogn|7th|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last years ==

Arago remained a consistent republican to the end, and after the coup d'état of 1852, though suffering first from [[diabetes]], then from [[Bright's disease]], complicated by [[dropsy]], he resigned his post as astronomer rather than take the [[oath of allegiance]]. [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] gave directions that the old man should be in no way disturbed, and should be left free to say and do what he liked.  In the summer of 1853 Arago was advised by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he accordingly set out to the eastern [[Pyrenees]], but this was ineffective and he died in Paris.  His grave is at the famous [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris. Arago was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The same Arago who spent his time criticizing unfounded myths now peddled them. Arago the atheist now spoke of souls.&quot; Theresa Levitt, The shadow of enlightenment: optical and political transparency in France, 1789–1848, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron]] '''Siméon Denis Poisson''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] ({{IPA-fr|si.me.ɔ̃ də.ni pwa.sɔ̃|lang}}; 21 June 1781 – 25 April 1840) was a French [[mathematician]], [[engineer]], and [[physicist]] who made many scientific advances. 

==Biography==
Poisson was born in [[Pithiviers]], [[Loiret]] district in [[France]], the son of Siméon Poisson, an officer in the French army.

In 1798, he entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]] as first in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free to make his own decisions as to what he would study. In 1800, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on [[Étienne Bézout]]'s method of elimination, the other on the number of [[integral]]s of a [[finite difference]] equation. The latter was examined by [[Sylvestre Lacroix|Sylvestre-François Lacroix]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]], who recommended that it should be published in the ''Recueil des savants étrangers,'' an unprecedented honor for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend. Meanwhile, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, till his death in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] near Paris, was nearly occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Immediately after finishing his studies at the École Polytechnique, he was appointed ''répétiteur'' (teaching assistant) there, a position which he had occupied as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for his schoolmates had made a custom of visiting him in his room after an unusually difficult lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made deputy professor (''professeur suppléant'') in 1802, and, in 1806 full professor succeeding [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier]], whom [[Napoleon]] had sent to [[Grenoble]]. In 1808 he became [[astronomer]] to the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]; and when the {{Interlanguage link multi|Faculté des sciences de Paris|fr}} was instituted in 1809 he was appointed a professor of [[Classical mechanics|rational mechanics]] (''professeur de mécanique rationelle''). He went on to become a member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school (''École Militaire'') at [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1815, graduation examiner at the École Polytechnique in 1816, councillor of the university in 1820, and geometer to the Bureau des Longitudes succeeding Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1827.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1817, he married Nancy de Bardi and with her, he had four children. His father, whose early experiences had led him to hate aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the First Republic. Throughout the Revolution, the Empire, and the following restoration, Poisson was not interested in politics, concentrating instead on mathematics. He was appointed to the dignity of [[baron]] in 1821,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; but he neither took out the diploma nor used the title. In March 1818, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalogues.royalsociety.org/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=EC%2f1817%2f30|title=Poisson, Simeon Denis: certificate of election to the Royal Society|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=20 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter P|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1823 a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. The [[July Revolution|revolution of July 1830]] threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] was adroitly averted by [[François Jean Dominique Arago]], who, while his &quot;revocation&quot; was being plotted by the council of ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the [[Palais-Royal]], where he was openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who &quot;remembered&quot; him. After this, of course, his degradation was impossible, and seven years later he was made a [[peer of France]], not for political reasons, but as a representative of French [[science]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

As a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been extraordinarily successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a ''répétiteur'' at the École Polytechnique. As a scientific worker, his productivity has rarely if ever been equaled. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure mathematics,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and rational mechanics.  ([[François Arago|Arago]] attributed to him the quote, &quot;Life is good for only two things:  doing mathematics and teaching it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Arago]] (1786–1853) attributed to Poisson the quote:  &quot;La vie n'est bonne qu'à deux choses:  à faire des mathématiques et à les professer.&quot; (Life is good for only two things:  to do mathematics and to teach it.)  See:  J.-A. Barral, ed., ''Oeuvres complétes de François Arago ...'', vol. II (Paris, France:  Gide et J. Baudry, 1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MRIPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA662#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 662].&lt;/ref&gt;)

A list of Poisson's works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago's biography. All that is possible is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Next (or in the opinion of some, first) in importance stand the memoirs on [[celestial dynamics|celestial mechanics]], in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs ''Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes'', ''Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique'', both published in the ''Journal'' of the École Polytechnique (1809); ''Sur la libration de la lune'', in ''[[Connaissance des Temps|Connaissance des temps]]'' (1821), etc.; and [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001991302 ''Sur le mouvement de la terre autour de son centre de gravité''], in ''Mémoires de l'Académie'' (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary [[orbit]]s, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled ''Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites''. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Poisson's well-known generalization of Laplace's second order [[partial differential equation]] for [[potential]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \phi = - 4 \pi \rho \; &lt;/math&gt;

is known as [[Poisson's equation]] after him, was first published in the ''Bulletin de la société philomatique'' (1813).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we retrieve [[Laplace's equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \phi = 0. \;&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \rho(x, y, z) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous function]] and if for &lt;math&gt; r \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; (or if a point 'moves' to [[Extended real number line|infinity]]) a function &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; goes to 0 fast enough, a solution of Poisson's equation is the [[Newtonian potential]] of a function &lt;math&gt; \rho (x, y, z) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \phi = - {1\over 4 \pi} \iiint \frac{\rho (x, y, z)}{ r} \, dV \; &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is a distance between a volume element &lt;math&gt; dV &lt;/math&gt;and a point &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;. The integration runs over the whole space.

Poisson's two most important memoirs on the subject are ''Sur l'attraction des sphéroides'' (Connaiss. ft. temps, 1829), and ''Sur l'attraction d'un ellipsoide homogène'' (Mim. ft. l'acad., 1835).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

==== Electricity and magnetism ====
As the eighteenth century came to a close, human understanding of electrostatics approached maturity. [[Benjamin Franklin]] had already established the notion of electric charge and the [[Charge conservation|conservation of charge]]; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] had enunciated his [[Coulomb's law|inverse-square law of electrostatics]]. In 1777, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the concept of a potential function that can be used to compute the gravitational force of an extended body. In 1812, Poisson adopted this idea and obtained the appropriate expression for electricity, which relates the potential function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to the electric charge density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baigrie|first=Brian|title=Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0-313-33358-0|location=United States of America|pages=47|chapter=Chapter 5: From Effluvia to Fluids}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poisson discovered that Laplace's equation is valid only outside of a solid. A rigorous proof for masses with variable density was first given by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1839. Poisson's work on potential theory inspired [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]]'s 1828 paper, ''[[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism]]''. Poisson's equation is applicable in not just gravitation, but also electricity and magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-506136-5|location=United States of America|pages=682-4|chapter=28.4: The Potential Equation and Green's Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, [[Hans Christian Orsted]] demonstrated that it was possible to deflect a magnetic needle by closing or opening an electric circuit nearby. A deluge of papers attempting explain the phenomenon was published. [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] and the [[Biot–Savart law|Biot-Savart law]] were quickly deduced. The science of electromagnetism was born. Poisson was also investigating the phenomenon of magnetism at this time, though he insisted on treating electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. He published two memoirs on magnetism in 1826.&lt;ref name=&quot;:132&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baigrie|first=Brian|title=Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0-313-33358-0|location=United States of America|pages=72|chapter=Chapter 7: The Current and the Needle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1830s, a major research question in the study of electricity was whether or not electricity as a fluid or fluids distinct from matter, or something that simply acts on matter like gravity. Coulomb, Ampère, and Poisson thought that electricity as a fluid distinct from matter. In his experimental research, starting with electrolysis, Michael Faraday sought to show this was not the case. Electricity, Faraday believed, was a part of matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baigrie|first=Brian|title=Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=0-313-33358-0|location=United States of America|pages=88|chapter=Chapter 8: Forces and Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poisson was a member of the academic &quot;old guard&quot; at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie royale des sciences de l'Institut de France]], who were staunch believers in the [[Wave–particle duality|particle theory of light]] and were skeptical of its alternative, the wave theory. In 1818, the Académie set the topic of their prize as [[diffraction]]. One of the participants, civil engineer and opticist [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] submitted a thesis explaining diffraction derived from analysis of both the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] and [[Young's double slit experiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel1868&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Fresnel|first=A.J.|title=OEuvres Completes 1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ|year=1868|publication-place=Paris|publisher=Imprimerie impériale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrated that Fresnel's theory predicts an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a [[point source]] of light, where the particle-theory of light predicts complete darkness. Poisson argued this was absurd and Fresnel's model was wrong. (Such a spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)

The head of the committee, [[François Arago|Dominique-François-Jean Arago]], performed the experiment. He molded a 2&amp;nbsp;mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel1868_arago&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Fresnel|first=A.J.|title=OEuvres Completes 1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ|page=369|year=1868|publication-place=Paris|publisher=Imprimerie impériale}}&lt;/ref&gt; To everyone's surprise he observed the predicted bright spot, which vindicated the wave model. Fresnel won the competition.

After that, the corpuscular theory of light was dead, but was revived in the twentieth century in a different form, [[wave-particle duality]]. Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the [[Arago spot]] and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by [[Joseph-Nicolas Delisle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel1868_arago&quot; /&gt; and [[Giacomo F. Maraldi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;maraldi1723&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Maraldi|first=G.F.|title='Diverses expèriences d'optique' in Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3592w/f300.image.langFR|page=111|year=1723|publisher=Imprimerie impériale}}&lt;/ref&gt; a century earlier.

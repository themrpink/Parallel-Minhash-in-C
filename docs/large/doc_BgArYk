Without her stereotyped role of a &quot;femme fatale&quot;, María Félix filmed two sophisticated films: ''El monje blanco'' (1945), directed by [[Julio Bracho]], and ''Vertigo'' (1946), directed by Antonio Momplet. Both characters required a great dramatic intensity.

Under the direction of the famous Mexican film director [[Emilio Fernández]], María Félix made three successful films: ''[[Enamorada (film)|Enamorada]]'' (1946 ), ''[[Río Escondido (1948 film)|Río Escondido]]'' (1947), and ''[[Maclovia (1948 film)|Maclovia]]'' (1948). The relationship between Félix and Fernández was cordial and smooth, despite the strong and famous temperament of the film director. In ''Enamorada'', María Félix found her perfect film partner, the actor [[Pedro Armendáriz]]. The films of María Félix with Fernández and his team (writer Mauricio Magdaleno, photographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]], and Armendáriz) had strong presence in several international film festivals. In turn, they gave María Félix her first [[Ariel Award for Best Actress|Ariel Award]] for ''Enamorada'' and ''Río Escondido''.

Between the films with Fernández, María Félix also worked with [[Roberto Gavaldón]], another director who showcased some of her best performances. Their first collaboration was in ''La diosa arrodillada'' (1947) with [[Arturo de Córdova]]. Thanks to these films, María Félix's fame crossed the Atlantic.

In 1948 she was contracted by the Spanish film producer Cesáreo González. In this manner María Félix began her film adventure in Europe. She made only one more film in Mexico (''[[Doña Diabla]]'', 1949) until her return in 1952.

=== Europe ===
[[File:María Félix in La mujer de todos city theater 1948.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Marquee listing Félix's film, ''La mujer de todos'', at Kleine-Gartmanplantsoen in [[Amsterdam]] at the City Theater on March 1948]]
Félix debuted in the European cinema in [[Spain]], with the film ''[[Mare Nostrum (1948 film)|Mare Nostrum]]'' (1948), directed by [[Rafael Gil]]. With Gil as director, she realized another two films in 1950: ''Una mujer cualquiera'' and ''La noche del sábado''. In 1951, she filmed the French-Spanish production ''La Couronne Noire'' directed by [[Luis Saslavsky]] based on a story by [[Jean Cocteau]]. She debuted in [[Italy]] with the film ''Incantesimo Tragico'' (1951). In the same year, she filmed ''[[Messalina (1951 film)|Messalina]]'' (1951), directed by [[Carmine Gallone]] (at the time, the most expensive film of the Italian cinema).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} During the filming of this movie Félix suffered an emotional shock: her father died of a heart attack in [[Navojoa]].

In 1952, Félix traveled to [[Argentina]], where she filmed ''La pasión desnuda'' of the Argentine filmmaker [[Luis César Amadori]]. In the same year Félix returned to Mexico. She concluded her working relationship with Cesáreo González with the film ''[[Camelia (1954 film)|Camelia]]'' filmed in her native country. Her stay in Mexico was mainly based on her marriage to the actor and singer Jorge Negrete,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Una Mujer Llamada Maria Felix: Historia No Autorizada|last=Sandoval|first=Carmen Barajas|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=9684096739|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/unamujerllamadam00bara/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/unamujerllamadam00bara/page/174}}&lt;/ref&gt; her former film rival, with whom she filmed ''El rapto'', directed by Emilio Fernández, Negrete's last film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los Grandes: Maria Felix (Los Grandes Mexicanos)|last=Rutiaga|first=Luis|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=9706669817|location=|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Jorge Negrete, on 5 December 1953, Félix returned to Europe. In [[France]] she made the films ''La Belle Otero'' (1954), and ''Les Héros sont Fatigués'' (1955), alongside [[Yves Montand]]. However, the most important film of Félix in this period was ''[[French Cancan]]'' (1954) directed by [[Jean Renoir]] with the legendary French actor [[Jean Gabin]]. Her last film shot entirely in Europe was the Spanish film ''[[Faustina (1957 film)|Faustina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Cynthia|editor-last1=Tompkins|editor-first2=David William|editor-last2=Foster|date=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7TY2ElIcrUC&amp;pg=PA97 |title=Notable Twentieth-Century Latin American Women: A Biographical Dictionary|page=97|isbn=0313311129|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=2019-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last films===
Félix returned to Mexico in 1955. This period of her career was characterized by performing &lt;!--acclimated ←wrong word, I think--&gt;films inspired by the [[Mexican Revolution]]. This cycle begins with ''La Escondida'' (1955). In this film, as well as in stories like ''Canasta de cuentos mexicanos'' (1955) and ''Café Colón'' (1958), she worked again with Pedro Armendáriz. In 1956 she starred in ''[[Tizoc (film)|Tizoc]]'' with the popular Mexican actor and singer [[Pedro Infante]]. However, the film was not liked by the actress, despite her international success. Eventually she filmed ''[[Beyond All Limits]]'' (1957) with [[Jack Palance]], and the melodramas ''[[Ash Wednesday (1958 film)|Ash Wednesday]]'' and ''[[The Empty Star]]'' (both 1958). In 1959 she played the titular role in ''[[The Soldiers of Pancho Villa]]'' with top billing lead [[Dolores del Río]]. &lt;!--, where alternating with [[Dolores del Río]], another celebrated Mexican film star with a career in Hollywood ←This bit doesn't make sense. What is meant?--&gt; In 1959 she performed in the Spanish-Mexican co-production ''[[Sonatas (film)|Sonatas]]'' directed by [[Juan Antonio Bardem]] and the French-Mexican co-production ''[[La Fièvre Monte à El Pao]]'',  directed by [[Luis Buñuel]].

In the 1960s Félix's presence in the cinema was limited to only a few films. The most prominent were ''Juana Gallo'' (1960), ''[[La bandida]]'' (1963), ''[[Amor y sexo]]'' (''Sapho '63'', 1963)), and ''[[La Valentina (1966 film)|La Valentina]]'' (1966). In 1970 she filmed ''La Generala'', which would be her last film. The Mexican historical [[telenovela]] ''La Constitución'' (1971) would be her last professional acting job. Félix attempted to return to the cinema twice. First, in 1982, with the film ''Toña Machetes'', and again in 1986 with the film ''Insólito resplandor''. Neither project crystallized, and Félix never reappeared in film.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Roles declined in Hollywood===
Almost from the beginning of her career, Félix received job offers in [[Hollywood]], but Félix herself said: ''They only give me huehuenche (Indian) roles''. While she was in France, Hollywood offered her the female role of ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', but she passed and the part went to [[Jennifer Jones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Félix 1993, vol. 3, p. 48&quot;&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 3, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposal was ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' with [[Humphrey Bogart]], but she refused it, instead making ''La Belle Otero'' in France. [[Ava Gardner]] ended up with the part. Later, the director [[Robert Aldrich]] sent her the script of ''[[The Legend of Lylah Clare]]'', but she did not reach an agreement with the director and [[Kim Novak]] got the role.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Personal life==
Félix was married four times. Her first marriage (1931–1938) was with the cosmetics sales agent Enrique Álvarez Alatorre.&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 1, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; He fathered her only child, actor [[Enrique Álvarez Félix]]. According to journalist Sergio Almázon, once she found her son wearing a white dress and necklace. Infuriated, she beat him unconscious.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDPnoticias.com 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Yazmín |title=El horrible castigo de María Félix a su hijo tras descubrirlo vestido de mujer |website=SDPnoticias.com |date=2018-05-31 |url=https://www.sdpnoticias.com/gay/2018/05/31/el-horrible-castigo-de-maria-felix-a-su-hijo-tras-descubrirlo-vestido-de-mujer |language=es |access-date=2018-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Álvarez retaliated by taking their son to Guadalajara. Years later Félix was able to get her son back with the help of her second husband, Agustín Lara.&lt;ref name=&quot;debayle&quot;/&gt;

Félix's relationship with her son was distant in his early years because she sent him to schools abroad &quot;to discipline&quot; him. Years later, Enrique returned to Mexico and started a career as an actor in film and television. Regarding her son, Félix said: &quot;Enrique is a very gifted man, with admirable common sense. He's my best friend. I have so much fun with him. He's not a 'mama's boy' as many believe. Self-employed, fight like being independent. He has his own career, his audience, his poster and assumes his responsibilities without relying on me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 4, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected death of Enrique from a heart attack in 1996 affected Félix greatly.

There are conflicting rumors that, in between her marriages to Enrique Álvarez and Agustín Lara, Félix had a brief marriage to Raúl Prado, member of the [[Trío Calaveras]], but no concrete evidence has emerged that the marriage ever took place. Most of the rumors agree in claiming that Prado and Félix allegedly got married in 1943 after meeting on the set of ''[[The Rock of Souls]]'' and separated two months after the wedding. Mexican writer [[Enrique Serna]] interviewed the last survivor of the trio, Miguel Bermego, who told him he was a witness to the wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serna&quot;/&gt; Prado's niece María Escalera also corroborated the marriage, saying that the marriage ended when Agustín Lara sent Félix a white piano as a gift, and &quot;Raúl threw her out — with the piano. They later divorced. So, it appears, María Félix was my ''tía política'' [aunt-in-law].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delgado |first1=Manuel Ruben |title=The Last Chicano: A Mexican American Experience |date=2009 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4490-1415-5 |page=292 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SxQEE17m80C&amp;pg=PA292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book about Félix ''María Félix: 47 pasos por el cine'', [[Paco Ignacio Taibo I]] wrote about the marriage as factual, saying &quot;While filming this movie, María would meet Raúl Prado, a member of the Los Calaveras trio.

Serna, who also interviewed Félix, said &quot;On our first meeting I asked her about her marriage to Raúl Prado (which she denied until the end), the member of the Calaveras trio who sang in Jorge Negrete's films, and she told me that if I was going to go on with those lies, we were not going to be able to work on the book.&quot; Serna added, &quot;At one point she told me: 'Write what you want about me, because they believe anything about me.

Her second marriage (1945–1947) was to the famous Mexican composer [[Agustín Lara]]. Félix was a fan of Lara since her adolescence. They were formally introduced by a mutual friend, the actor Tito Novaro. The couple began a highly publicized relationship, which culminated in marriage in 1945. Lara immortalized Félix in a number of songs, such as ''&quot;Humo en los ojos''&quot; (&quot;Smoke in the eyes&quot;), &quot;''Cuando vuelvas''&quot; (&quot;When you come back&quot;),  &quot;''Dos puñales''&quot; (&quot;Two daggers&quot;), &quot;''Madrid''&quot; and especially the famous theme &quot;''[[María Bonita (song)|María Bonita]]''&quot;, composed in [[Acapulco]] during their honeymoon. &quot;''María Bonita''&quot; would become one of Lara's most popular Lara songs. However, the relationship ended in 1947 due to Lara's jealousy. Félix said that Lara even tried to kill her in a fit of violent jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 2, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Felix-Messalina.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Félix in ''[[Messalina (1951 film)|Messalina]]'' (1951)]]
After her second divorce, Félix had romances with some well-known men, such as Mexican aviation entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, Spanish bullfighter [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]], and Argentine actor [[Carlos Thompson]]. Félix met Thompson in Argentina in 1952 during the filming of [[Luis César Amadori]]'s ''[[La pasión desnuda]]'', and the relationship was reportedly serious to the point that they became engaged to be married, and Félix even called for her son Enrique Álvarez Félix to meet his potential stepfather. However, during filming, Félix received a call from director [[Emilio Fernández]] to offer her the leading role in ''[[The Rapture (1954 film)|The Rapture]]'', which Félix accepted, telling Thompson that after filming of ''La pasión desnuda'' ended she would return to Mexico to promote the film and announce their future marriage. However, once in Mexico, Felix canceled the wedding days before it would take place, stating that she concluded that the only thing that united her to Thompson was a mere physical attraction and not true love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=María Félix y la historia de cómo le rompió el corazón al argentino Carlos Thompson |trans-title=María Félix and the story of how she broke the heart of Argentine Carlos Thompson |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/mexico/2019/04/07/el-dia-que-maria-felix-le-rompio-el-corazon-a-carlos-thompson-el-argentino-que-sufrio-en-carne-propia-los-caprichos-de-la-dona/ |website=[[Infobae]] |accessdate=9 September 2020 |language=es |date=7 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pasión, orgullo y un corazón roto: la fallida boda entre María Félix y Carlos Thompson |trans-title=Passion, pride and a broken heart: the failed wedding between María Félix and Carlos Thompson |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/entretenimiento/2020/04/08/pasion-orgullo-y-un-corazon-roto-la-fallida-boda-entre-maria-felix-y-carlos-thompson/ |website=[[Infobae]] |accessdate=9 September 2020 |language=es |date=8 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her stay in France, Félix was introduced by the painter [[Leonor Fini]] to French writer [[Jean Cau (writer)|Jean Cau]], assistant of the writer [[Jean Paul Sartre]]. Félix had a brief romance with Cau.&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 3, p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of 1950 to the spring of 1954, Félix also had a passionate same-sex affair with Suzanne Baulé, better-known as [[Frede (cabaret manager)|Frede]], who at the time ran the cabaret ''Le Carroll's'' on Rue de Ponthieu in Paris, and the two women lived together at the Hotel George-V. The relationship was captured in a painting made by Fini of a plant with two flowers; one had the face of Félix and the other Frede's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot; /&gt; Frede followed Félix on her filming trips to Buenos Aires and São Paulo upon learning of Félix's relationship with Carlos Thompson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beccacece&quot;/&gt; Félix and Frede's relationship was interrupted by Félix's marriage to Jorge Negrete, but upon Negrete's death in 1953, Félix returned to Paris to briefly rekindle her relationship with Frede. However, they would violently break-up for good in 1954, leading to a trial in which Félix wanted to take back jewellery she had given to Frede and accused her of theft. Félix lost her lawsuit, and Frede was acquitted and kept the jewellery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manzi |first1=Italo |title=María Félix, el último mito |trans-title=María Félix, the last myth |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/descargaPdf/maria-felix-el-ultimo-mito/ |publisher=[[Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library]] |format=PDF |accessdate=10 September 2020 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beccacece&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beccacece |first1=Hugo |title=Un mito secreto del siglo XX |trans-title=A secret myth of the 20th century |url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/un-mito-secreto-del-siglo-xx-nid2152652 |accessdate=10 September 2020 |work=[[La Nación]] |date=15 July 2018 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cosnard|first1=Denis|title=Frede : belle de nuit|year=2017|isbn=978-2-84990-499-2|location=Paris|oclc=989824609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parrado&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parrado |first1=Diego |title=Frede, la amante de Marlene Dietrich y reina de las lesbianas de París |trans-title=Frede, Marlene Dietrich's lover and queen of the lesbians of Paris |url=https://www.revistavanityfair.es/sociedad/celebrities/articulos/frede-marlene-dietrich-lesbianas-paris/25781 |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=10 September 2020 |language=es |date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Félix held ownership of the painting Fini made of the two women, and afterwards Félix asked Fini to modify it to erase Frede's face, changing Frede's face to hers, resulting in the painting's two flowers both having Felix's face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parrado&quot;/&gt;

In 1953, when Félix returned to Mexico after her stay in Europe and Argentina, she was reunited with an &quot;old enemy&quot;: the actor and singer [[Jorge Negrete]]. Unlike their difficult first meeting ten years ago on the set of ''El peñón de las ánimas'', Félix found Negrete, in her own words: ''&quot;surrendered to my feet&quot;''. After a brief romance, the couple married in 1953, transmitted by radio to all [[Latin America]], held at the House of Catipoato in [[Tlalpan]]. Negrete was already ill when the marriage took place, and died eleven months later at a hospital in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], while Félix was in Europe shooting ''La Belle Otero''. Félix's appearance at his funeral, dressed in trousers, caused a huge scandal, which led Félix to take refuge in Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Her fourth marriage (1956–1974), was with the Romanian-born French banker Alexander Berger. Félix met Berger in the 1940s, when they were both married. Years later they met again. Félix was married to Berger for 18 years. She tried becoming a mother again, but an accident during a filming in 1957 caused Félix to lose the child.&lt;ref&gt;Felix (1993), vol. 3, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that she built her famous home, ''La Casa de las Tortugas'' (The House of Turtles), designed by [[Pepe Mendoza (architect)|Pepe Mendoza]] and resembling an Italian villa, in [[Cuernavaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacasadelastortugas.com/about-the-house.html|title=La Case de las Tortugas|language=en|accessdate=June 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger died in 1974 of lung cancer months after the death of María's mother, which plunged her into a deep depression. To overcome this depression, she developed a new passion: horses. Some of her horses won major international equestrian awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biondo 2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Biondo |first=Noelia |title=Conociendo a... María Félix.

Her last romantic relationship was the Russian-French painter Antoine Tzapoff. About him, Félix said: ''I don't know if he's the man who has most loved me, but he's who has loved me better.''&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 4, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The press speculated about a strong rivalry between Félix and [[Dolores del Río]], the other leading female figure of Mexican cinema and a successful Hollywood star. Regarding this &quot;rivalry&quot;, Félix said: &quot;With Dolores I had no rivalry. On the contrary, we were friends and always treated each other with great respect, each with our own personality. We were completely different. She was refined, interesting, gentle on the deal, and I'm energetic, arrogant and bossy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Félix (1993), vol. 3, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

During her life, Félix was a model for many renowned painters. In her adolescence she was painted in Guadalajara by [[José Clemente Orozco]], but Félix said: ''He paint me like a make-up skull''.&lt;ref&gt;Felix (1993), vol. 3, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Félix met the famous Mexican artist [[Diego Rivera]] during the filming of ''Río Escondido'' (1947). Félix developed a friendship with him and his wife, [[Frida Kahlo]]. In 1949, Rivera painted a portrait of her, which Félix classified as &quot;muy malo&quot; (&quot;very bad&quot;). Later years Diego Rivera asked to borrow the painting to be displayed as part of a retrospective on Rivera's work, but Félix refused.  Maria Félix did not like the painting and she sold it to Juan Gabriel for 15 Million Pesos. In a later interview said “Nunca me ha gustado la pintura de Rivera, yo se lo decía a él. Yo quería que me pintara de Tehuana, pero él dijo que era muy vulgar, entonces me pintó como él quería… desnuda, porque él estaba muy enamorado de mí. Después, Diego quería ese retrato para una exposición en Bellas Artes, pero como no se lo presté, me dejó de hablar más de un año. Un día estaba un albañil arreglando mi casa, y le mandé a poner blanco para tapar un poco todo aquello y así quedó. Lo vendí, muy mal vendido por cierto”. Translated- “I've never liked Rivera's painting, I told him. I wanted him to paint me Tehuana, but he said it was very vulgar, so he painted me as he wanted ... naked, because he was very much in love with me. Later, Diego wanted that portrait for an exhibition in Fine Arts, but since I did not lend it to him, he stopped talking to me for more than a year. One day there was a bricklayer fixing my house, and I sent him to put white to cover a bit of everything and that's how it was. I sold it, very badly sold by the way &quot;.

Other renowned artists who recorded Félix in their canvases were the Surrealists [[Leonor Fini]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Remedios Varo]] and [[Bridget Bate Tichenor|Bridget Tichenor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;María Félix la Doña totals 7.3 million&quot;&gt;[http://www.artquid.com/home/4-art-market-news/175/maria-felix-la-dona-totals-7-3-million.html Estate of María Félix: La Doña totals $7.3 million]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In the 1980s, the Russian-French artist Antoine Tzapoff (Félix's last partner), captured her in numerous portraits.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Félix also had dealings with numerous Mexican and foreign writers and playwrights some of whom have dedicated several novels. Among them they are [[Renato Leduc]], [[Xavier Villaurrutia]], [[Salvador Novo]], Pita Amor, [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Octavio Paz]]. [[Luis Spota]] was inspired by her life for his novel ''The Empty Star'', and Félix even starred in the film version in 1958. [[Carlos Fuentes]] did the same in the novel ''Zona sagrada''. Her relationship with Fuentes was terminated when the author made the play ''Orchids in the Moonlight'', in which he parodies the figures of Félix and Dolores del Río. Félix, angry, called him &quot;''mujerujo''&quot; (&quot;womanish&quot;).

Songs were composed for Félix, including ''María de Todas las Marías'' by [[Juan Gabriel]] and [[Je l'aime à mourir]] by [[Francis Cabrel]].

In fashion, Félix was dressed by designers like ''[[Christian Dior]]'', ''[[Givenchy]]'', Yves Saint Laurent, ''[[Chanel]]'', and ''[[Balenciaga]]''. The ''House of [[Hermès]]'' (Couture Department) designed extravagant creations just for her. She was a noted collector of fine antiques, favoring pieces like her famous collection of [[Second French Empire]] furniture. She was also a jewelry connoisseur and had an extensive jewelry collection, including the 41.37 carat (8.274 g), D-flawless ''Ashoka'' diamond. In 1968, she commissioned a serpent diamond necklace from [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier Paris]]. The result was a completely articulated serpent made out of [[platinum]] and [[white gold]] and encrusted with 178.21 carats (35.642 g) of diamonds. In 1975, she again asked Cartier to create a necklace for her, this time in the shape of two crocodiles. The two crocodile bodies were made of 524.9&amp;nbsp;grams of gold, one covered with 1,023 yellow diamonds, while the other was adorned with 1,060 circular cut emeralds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewelleryeditor.com/images/cartier-maria-felix-crocodile-necklace-1975/|title=Maria Felix's Cartier crocodile necklace 1975|accessdate=January 28, 2018|work=The Jewellery Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she sold most of her jewelry back to Cartier's. She also left a [[Rolls Royce]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacasadelastortugas.com/maria-felix.html |title=Maria Felix, The Unforgettable|publisher=La Casa de las Tortugas|accessdate=June 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Félix's death, these jewelry pieces have been displayed as part of ''The Art of Cartier Collection'' in several museums around the world. To pay tribute to the actress, in 2006 Cartier debuted its ''La Doña de Cartier collection''. ''The La Doña de Cartier watch'' with reptilian links was created to impress by its wild look. The case of the ''La Doña de Cartier'' features a trapezoid shape with an asymmetrical profile reminiscent of a crocodile's head. The wristband of the watch resembles the contours of a crocodile in large, bold and gold scales. The ''La Doña de Cartier Collection'' also includes jewelry, accessories, and handbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=articles&amp;catid=1&amp;id=14|title=La Dona de Cartier Watch - Fiery Reptile Created to Seduce Watches Channel|website=watches.infoniac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Polish|Franz Krienbühl|date=March 2014}}

'''Franz Krienbühl''' (24 March 1929 &amp;ndash; 16 April 2002) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[speed skating|speed skater]] who is mostly known for his inventions that changed the sport.

Starting his international sporting career only in his late thirties at the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] of [[Grenoble]], Krienbühl mostly skated at the back of the field. However, in 1974, he introduced the one-piece skin suit into speed skating. In spite of the fact that he improved his times dramatically, he was initially laughed at. However, when other skaters also showed improvement, the top skaters quickly switched to the suits as well. Krienbühl also introduced minor improvements for skates.

Krienbühl's best performance was the eighth position on the 10,000&amp;nbsp;m at the [[1976 Winter Olympics]]. He stopped speed skating internationally at age 48 the next season, though he continued to skate competitively until 1986. During his career, he won at least 14 Swiss Allround Championships. In 1989, Krienbühl was severely injured in a cycling accident. He died in April 2002, aged 73.

'''Jean Sibelius''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|b|eɪ|l|i|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Sibelius |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sibelius |accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Sv-Jean_Sibelius.ogg|Swedish pronunciation}}), born '''Johan Julius Christian Sibelius'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tawaststjerna|1997|p=15}}: only in the 1990s was it discovered that Sibelius's original first names (at christening) were '''Johan Christian Julius'''; he himself used the order '''Johan Julius Christian''', and that is present in most sources.&lt;/ref&gt; (8 December 1865{{spaced ndash}}20 September 1957), was a Finnish composer and violinist of the late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|early-modern]] periods. He is widely recognized as his country's greatest composer and, through his music, is often credited with having helped [[Finland]] to develop a [[national identity]] during its struggle for independence from Russia.

The core of his oeuvre is his set of [[List of compositions by Jean Sibelius#Symphonies|seven symphonies]], which, like his other major works, are regularly performed and recorded in his home country and internationally. His other best-known compositions are ''[[Finlandia]]'', the ''[[Karelia Suite]]'', ''[[Valse triste (Sibelius)|Valse triste]]'', the [[Violin Concerto (Sibelius)|Violin Concerto]], the choral symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]'', and ''[[The Swan of Tuonela]]'' (from the ''[[Lemminkäinen Suite]]''). Other works include pieces inspired by nature, Nordic mythology, and the Finnish [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', over a hundred songs for voice and piano, [[incidental music]] for numerous plays, the opera ''[[Jungfrun i tornet]]'' (''The Maiden in the Tower''), [[chamber music]], [[piano music]], [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ritual music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brother Sibelius |work=The Music of Freemasonry |url=http://www.masonmusic.org/sibelius.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620012910/http://www.masonmusic.org/sibelius.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 June 2003 |accessdate=16 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 21 publications of [[choral music]].

Sibelius composed prolifically until the mid-1920s, but after completing his [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Seventh Symphony]] (1924), the [[The Tempest (Sibelius)|incidental music for ''The Tempest'']] (1926) and the [[tone poem]] ''[[Tapiola (Sibelius)|Tapiola]]'' (1926), he stopped producing major works in his last thirty years, a stunning and perplexing decline commonly referred to as &quot;The Silence of [[Järvenpää]]&quot;, the location of his home. Although he is reputed to have stopped composing, he attempted to continue writing, including abortive efforts on an [[Symphony No. 8 (Sibelius)|eighth symphony]]. In later life, he wrote [[Masonic music]] and re-edited some earlier works while retaining an active but not always favourable interest in new developments in music.

The Finnish 100 [[Finnish mark|mark]] note featured his image until 2002, when the [[euro]] was adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setelit.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=100 markkaa 1986 |publisher=Setelit.com |url=http://www.setelit.com/raha/201 |accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a [[Flag days in Finland|Flag Day]] on 8 December, the composer's birthday, also known as the &quot;Day of Finnish Music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intermin.fi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The days the Finnish flag is flown |publisher=Ministry of the Interior |url=http://www.intermin.fi/en/ministry/the_flag_and_arms_of_finland/flying_the_flag |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111200553/http://www.intermin.fi/en/ministry/the_flag_and_arms_of_finland/flying_the_flag |archivedate=11 November 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the 150th anniversary of the composer's birth, a number of special concerts and events were held, especially in the city of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visit-Helsinki&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Join the Sibelius 150 Celebration in 2015 |website=Visit Helsinki |url=http://www.visithelsinki.fi/en/whats-on/events-in-helsinki/celebrating-sibelius-in-2015 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531123915/http://www.visithelsinki.fi/en/whats-on/events-in-helsinki/celebrating-sibelius-in-2015 |archivedate=31 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Sibélius as a schoolboy.jpg|thumb|upright|11-year-old Sibelius in 1876]]

===Early years===
Sibelius was born on 8 December 1865 in [[Hämeenlinna]] ({{lang-sv|Tavastehus}}) in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], an autonomous part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the son of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking]] medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius (née Borg). The family name stems from the Sibbe estate in [[Eastern Uusimaa]], which his paternal great-grandfather owned.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=8}} Sibelius's father died of [[typhoid]] in July 1868, leaving substantial debts. As a result, his mother—who was again pregnant—had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in Hämeenlinna.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=19}} Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin. It was he who gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=905}} For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but acted as a musical adviser.{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}}

From an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to [[Loviisa]] on the coast for the summer months. In his own words: &quot;For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness. Hämeenlinna was where I went to school; Loviisa was freedom.&quot; It was in Hämeenlinna, when he was seven, that his aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family's upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note. He progressed by improvising on his own, but still learned to read music.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=4}} He later turned to the violin, which he preferred. He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda on piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello. ([[Christian Sibelius]] was to become an eminent [[psychiatrist]], still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibelius |language=Swedish |year=1926 |publisher=Nordisk Familjebok |url=http://runeberg.org/nfcr/0165.html |accessdate=11 June 2015 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Sibelius often played in quartets with neighboring families, adding to his experience in chamber music. Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a ''Suite in D Minor'' for violin and piano.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|pp=10–13}} Around 1881, he recorded on paper his short [[pizzicato]] piece ''Vattendroppar'' (Water Drops) for violin and cello, although it might just have been a musical exercise.{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music becomes a serious pursuit 1881–1885 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_musiikkiharrastus.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference he made to himself composing is in a letter from August 1883 in which he writes that he composed a trio and was working on another: &quot;They are rather poor, but it is nice to have something to do on rainy days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;childhood&quot;/&gt; In 1881, he started to take violin lessons from the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=6}} Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon succeeded in becoming quite an accomplished player, performing [[Ferdinand David (musician)|David]]'s Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto]] in Helsinki. Despite such success as an instrumentalist, he ultimately chose to become a composer.{{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=67}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sih&quot;/&gt;

Although his mother tongue was Swedish, in 1874 Sibelius attended Lucina Hagman's Finnish-speaking preparatory school. In 1876, he was then able to continue his education at the Finnish-language [[Hämeenlinna Normal-Lycée|Hämeenlinna Normal Lyceum]] where he was a rather absent-minded pupil, although he did quite well in mathematics and botany.&lt;ref name=&quot;childhood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Childhood 1865–1881 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/ |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having to repeat a year, he passed the school's final examination in 1885, which allowed him to enter a university.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=14}} As a boy he was known as [[Janne]], a colloquial form of Johan. However, during his student years, he adopted the French form [[Jean (male given name)|Jean]], inspired by the business card of his deceased seafaring uncle. Thereafter he became known as Jean Sibelius.{{sfn|Ekman|1972|p=11}}

While these works and others like them that would follow were accepted by the listening public at large, detractors accused Copland of pandering to the masses.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308, 336}} Music critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]], for one, warned in 1939 that Copland was &quot;standing in the fork in the highroad, the two branches of which lead respectively to popular and artistic success.&quot;{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}  Even some of the composer's friends, such as composer [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]], were confused about Copland's simpler style.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=336}} One, composer [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], went so far as to lecture Copland: &quot;By having sold out to the mongrel commercialists half-way already, the danger is going to be wider for you, and I beg you dear Aaron, don't sell out [entirely] yet.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=190}} Copland's response was that his writing as he did and in as many genres was his response to how the Depression had affected society, as well as to new media and the audiences made available by these new media.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308–09}} As he himself phrased it, &quot;The composer who is frightened of losing his artistic integrity through contact with a mass audience is no longer aware of the meaning of the word art.&quot;{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}

The 1940s were arguably Copland's most productive years, and some of his works from this period would cement his worldwide fame. His ballet scores for ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'' (1942) and ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' (1944) were huge successes. His pieces ''[[Lincoln Portrait]]'' and ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' became patriotic standards. Also important was the [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. Composed in a two-year period from 1944 to 1946, it became Copland's best-known symphony.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=410, 418}} The [[Clarinet Concerto (Copland)|Clarinet Concerto]] (1948), scored for solo clarinet, strings, harp, and piano, was a commission piece for bandleader and clarinetist Benny Goodman and a complement to Copland's earlier jazz-influenced work, the [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] (1926).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=424}} His ''Four Piano Blues'' is an introspective composition with a jazz influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=427}} Copland finished the 1940s with two film scores, one for [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Heiress]]'' and one for the [[The Red Pony (1949 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Red Pony]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=202}}

In 1949, Copland returned to Europe, where he found French composer Pierre Boulez dominating the group of post-war avant-garde composers there.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=460}} He also met with proponents of twelve-tone technique, based on the works of Arnold Schoenberg, and found himself interested in adapting serial methods to his own musical voice.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
In 1950, Copland received a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission]] scholarship to study in Rome, which he did the following year. Around this time, he also composed his Piano Quartet, adopting Schoenberg's twelve-tone method of composition, and ''[[Old American Songs]]'' (1950), the first set of which was premiered by Peter Pears and [[Benjamin Britten]], the second by [[William Warfield]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=467}} During the 1951–52 academic year, Copland gave a series of lectures under the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]]. These lectures were published as the book ''Music and Imagination''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=170}}

[[File:Aaron Copland 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Aaron Copland in 1962 from a television special]]
Because of his [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] views, which had included his support of the [[Communist Party USA]] ticket during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]] and his strong support of [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] during the 1948 presidential election, Copland was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] during the [[McCarthyism|Red scare]] of the 1950s.  He was included on an FBI list of 151 artists thought to have Communist associations and found himself [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], with ''A Lincoln Portrait'' withdrawn from the 1953 inaugural concert for President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=452}} Called later that year to a private hearing at the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Copland was questioned by [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[Roy Cohn]] about his lecturing abroad and his affiliations with various organizations and events.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=455–77}} In the process, McCarthy and Cohn neglected completely Copland's works, which made a virtue of American values.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=452, 456}} Outraged by the accusations, many members of the musical community held up Copland's music as a banner of his patriotism. The investigations ceased in 1955 and were closed in 1975.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}}

The McCarthy probes did not seriously affect Copland's career and international artistic reputation, taxing of his time, energy, and emotional state as they might have been.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}} Nevertheless, beginning in 1950, Copland—who had been appalled at Stalin's persecution of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and other artists—began resigning from participation in leftist groups.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}} Copland, Pollack states, &quot;stayed particularly concerned about the role of the artist in society&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=286}} He decried the lack of artistic freedom in the Soviet Union, and in his 1954 Norton lecture he asserted that loss of freedom under Soviet Communism deprived artists of &quot;the immemorial right of the artist to be wrong&quot;. He began to vote Democratic, first for Stevenson and then for Kennedy.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}}

Potentially more damaging for Copland was a sea-change in artistic tastes, away from the Populist mores that infused his work of the 1930s and 40s.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} Beginning in the 1940s, intellectuals assailed Popular Front culture, to which Copland's music was linked, and labeled it, in Dickstein's words, as &quot;hopelessly middlebrow, a [[dumbing down]] of art into toothless entertainment&quot;.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} They often linked their disdain for Populist art with technology, new media and mass audiences—in other words, the areas of radio, television and motion pictures, for which Copland either had or soon would write music, as well as his popular ballets.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} While these attacks actually began at the end of the 1930s with the writings of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Dwight Macdonald]] for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', they were based in anti-Stalinist politics and would accelerate in the decades following World War II.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}}

Despite any difficulties that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s to observe the [[avant-garde]] styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not well known in the West and experience the new school of Polish music.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=462–64}} While in Japan, he was taken with the work of [[Toru Takemitsu]] and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=464–65}} Copland revised his text &quot;The New Music&quot; with comments on the styles that he encountered.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=465–66}} He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=466}} [[Electronic music]] seemed to have &quot;a depressing sameness of sound,&quot; while [[aleatoric music]] was for those &quot;who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}} As he summarized, &quot;I've spent most of my life trying to get the right note in the right place. Just throwing it open to chance seems to go against my natural instincts.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}}

In 1952, Copland received a commission from the [[League of Composers]], funded by a grant from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], to write an opera for television.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} While Copland was aware of the potential pitfalls of that genre, which included weak libretti and demanding production values, he had also been thinking about writing an opera since the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} Among the subjects he had considered were [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' and [[Frank Norris]]'s ''[[McTeague]]''{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} He finally settled on [[James Agee]]'s ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'', which seemed appropriate for the more intimate setting of television and could also be used in the &quot;college trade&quot;, with more schools mounting operas than they had before World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} The resulting opera, ''[[The Tender Land]]'', was written in two acts but later expanded to three. As Copland feared, when the opera premiered in 1954 critics found the libretto to be weak.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}} In spite of its flaws, the opera became one of the few American operas to enter the standard repertory.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}}

In 1957, 1958, and 1976, Copland was the Music Director of the [[Ojai Music Festival]], a classical and contemporary music festival in [[Ojai, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ Music Directors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701064355/http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ |date=July 1, 2013 }}, Ojai Music Festival.&lt;/ref&gt; For the occasion of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]], Copland composed ''Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble'' to accompany the exhibition &quot;Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries&quot;. [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Walter Piston]], [[William Schuman]], and [[Virgil Thomson]] also composed pieces for the Museum's Centennial exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960–1971 (bulk 1967–1970)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412110104/http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf |date=April 12, 2019 }}.

=== Later years ===
From the 1960s, Copland turned increasingly to conducting. Though not enamored with the prospect, he found himself without new ideas for composition, saying, &quot;It was exactly as if someone had simply turned off a faucet.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=516}} He became a frequent guest conductor in the United States and the United Kingdom and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]]. In 1960, [[RCA Victor]] released Copland's recordings with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] of the orchestral suites from ''Appalachian Spring'' and ''The Tender Land''; these recordings were later reissued on CD, as were most of Copland's Columbia recordings (by Sony).
[[File:Aaron Copland House, Cortlandt Manor, NY.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|[[Aaron Copland House|Rock Hill]], Copland's home in [[Cortlandt Manor, New York]], now a [[National Historic Landmark]]|alt=A green wooden house with stone chimney and foundation walls, seen through trees on a sunny winter day.]]
From 1960 to his death, Copland resided at [[Cortlandt Manor, New York]]. Known as [[Aaron Copland House|Rock Hill]], his home was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003 and further designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copland's health deteriorated through the 1980s, and he died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[respiratory failure]] on December 2, 1990, in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|North Tarrytown, New York]] (now Sleepy Hollow). Following his death, his ashes were scattered over the Tanglewood Music Center near Lenox, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

=== Personal life ===
Copland never enrolled as a member of any political party. Nevertheless, he inherited a considerable interest in civic and world events from his father.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=270–71}} His views were generally progressive and he had strong ties with numerous colleagues and friends in the Popular Front, including Odets.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=60}} Early in his life, Copland  developed, in [[Howard Pollack|Pollack]]'s words, &quot;a deep admiration for the works of Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser and [[Upton Sinclair]], all socialists whose novels passionately excoriated capitalism's physical and emotional toll on the average man&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=272}} Even after the McCarthy hearings, he remained a committed opponent of militarism and the Cold War, which he regarded as having been instigated by the United States.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=280, 283–84}} He condemned it as &quot;almost worse for art than the real thing&quot;. Throw the artist &quot;into a mood of suspicion, ill-will, and dread that typifies the cold war attitude and he'll create nothing&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=284–85}}

While Copland had various encounters with organized religious thought, which influenced some of his early compositions, he remained [[agnostic]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=28, 328}} He was close with the Zionism during the Popular Front movement, when it was endorsed by the left. Pollack writes,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=27–28}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Like many contemporaries, Copland regarded Judaism alternately in terms of religion, culture, and race; but he showed relatively little involvement in any aspect of his Jewish heritage.... At the same time, he had ties to Christianity, identifying with such profoundly Christian writers as [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and often spending Christmas Day at home with a special dinner with close friends.... In general, his music seemed to evoke Protestant hymns as often as it did Jewish chant....Copland characteristically found connections among various religious traditions.... But if Copland was discreet about his Jewish background, he never hid it, either.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Victor Kraft, 1935.jpg|thumb|Victor Kraft, 1935]]

Pollack states that Copland was gay and that the composer came to an early acceptance and understanding of his sexuality.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=234}} Like many at that time, Copland guarded his privacy, especially in regard to his homosexuality. He provided few written details about his private life and even after the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, showed no inclination to &quot;come out&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} However, he was one of the few composers of his stature to live openly and travel with his intimates.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=238}} They tended to be talented, younger men involved in the arts, and the age-gap between them and the composer widened as he grew older.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=235}} Most became enduring friends after a few years and, in Pollack's words, &quot;remained a primary source of companionship&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} Among Copland's love affairs were ones with photographer [[Victor Kraft (photographer)|Victor Kraft]], artist [[Alvin Ross]], pianist [[Paul Moor (pianist)|Paul Moor]], dancer [[Erik Johns]], composer [[John Brodbin Kennedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich and Wotherspoon, ''Who's who in gay and lesbian history'', London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and painter [[Prentiss Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/archives-of-american-arts-new-show-reveals-stories-of-gay-america-1951430/?no-ist |title=Archives of American Art's New Show Reveals Stories of Gay America }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Copland, The Selected Correspondence of Aaron Copland By Aaron Copland, pp. 69–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Kraft became a constant in Copland's life, though their romance might have ended by 1944.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=241}} Originally a violin prodigy when the composer met him in 1932, Kraft gave up music to pursue a career in photography, in part due to Copland's urging.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=239–40}} Kraft would leave and re-enter Copland's life, often bringing much stress with him as his behavior became increasingly erratic, sometimes confrontational.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=243–44}} Kraft fathered a child to whom Copland later provided financial security, through a bequest from his estate.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=244}}

{{See also|List of compositions by Aaron Copland}}

Vivian Perlis, who collaborated with Copland on his autobiography, writes: &quot;Copland's method of composing was to write down fragments of musical ideas as they came to him. When he needed a piece, he would turn to these ideas (his 'gold nuggets').&quot;{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} if one or more of these nuggets looked promising, he would then write a piano sketch and eventually work on them at the keyboard.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} The piano, Perlis writes, &quot;was so integral to his composing that it permeated his compositional style, not only in the frequent use in the instrument but in more subtle and complex ways&quot;.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} His habit of turning to the keyboard tended to embarrass Copland until he learned that Stravinsky also did so.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}}

Copland would not consider the specific instrumentation for a piece until it was complete and notated.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} Nor, according to Pollack, did he generally work in linear fashion, from beginning to end of a composition. Instead, he tended to compose whole sections in no particular order and surmise their eventual sequence after all those parts were complete, much like assembling a collage.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=10–11}} Copland himself admitted, &quot;I don't compose. I assemble materials.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Many times, he included material he had written years earlier.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} If the situation dictated, as it did with his film scores, Copland could work quickly. Otherwise, he tended to write slowly whenever possible.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Even with this deliberation, Copland considered composition, in his words, &quot;the product of the emotions&quot;, which included  &quot;self-expression&quot; and &quot;self-discovery&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}}

=== Influences ===
While Copland's earliest musical inclinations as a teenager ran toward [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and the Russian composers, Copland's teacher and mentor Nadia Boulanger became his most important influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}} Copland especially admired Boulanger's total grasp of all classical music, and he was encouraged to experiment and develop a &quot;clarity of conception and elegance in proportion&quot;. Following her model, he studied all periods of classical music and all forms—from madrigals to symphonies. This breadth of vision led Copland to compose music for numerous settings—orchestra, opera, solo piano, small ensemble, art song, ballet, theater and film. Boulanger particularly emphasized &quot;la grande ligne&quot; (the long line), &quot;a sense of forward motion&amp;nbsp;... the feeling for inevitability, for the creating of an entire piece that could be thought of as a functioning entity&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}}

During his studies with Boulanger in Paris, Copland was excited to be so close to the new post-Impressionistic French music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], and [[Erik Satie|Satie]], as well as [[Les six]], a group that included [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], and [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]]. [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] also impressed him. Copland was &quot;insatiable&quot; in seeking out the newest European music, whether in concerts, score reading or heated debate. These &quot;moderns&quot; were discarding the old laws of composition and experimenting with new forms, harmonies and rhythms, and including the use of jazz and quarter-tone music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=39}} Milhaud was Copland's inspiration for some of his earlier &quot;jazzy&quot; works. He was also exposed to Schoenberg and admired his earlier atonal pieces, thinking Schoenberg's ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Above all others, Copland named Igor Stravinsky as his &quot;hero&quot; and his favorite 20th-century composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Copland especially admired Stravinsky's &quot;jagged and uncouth rhythmic effects&quot;, &quot;bold use of dissonance&quot;, and &quot;hard, dry, crackling sonority&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}}

Another inspiration for much of Copland's music was [[jazz]]. Although familiar with jazz back in America—having listened to it and also played it in bands—he fully realized its potential while traveling in Austria: &quot;The impression of jazz one receives in a foreign country is totally unlike the impression of such music heard in one's own country&amp;nbsp;... when I heard jazz played in Vienna, it was like hearing it for the first time.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=60}} He also found that the distance from his native country helped him see the United States more clearly. Beginning in 1923, he employed &quot;jazzy elements&quot; in his classical music, but by the late 1930s, he moved on to Latin and American folk tunes in his more successful pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}} Although his early focus of jazz gave way to other influences, Copland continued to make use of jazz in more subtle ways in later works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}}
Copland's work from the late 1940s onward included experimentation with Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone]] system, resulting in two major works, the Piano Quartet (1950) and the Piano Fantasy (1957).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}}

=== Early works ===
Copland's compositions before leaving for Paris were mainly short works for piano and [[art song]]s, inspired by Liszt and Debussy. In them, he experimented with ambiguous beginnings and endings, rapid key changes, and the frequent use of tritones.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}} His first published work, ''[[The Old Cat and the Young Mouse|The Cat and the Mouse]]''&amp;nbsp;(1920), was a piece for piano solo based on the [[Jean de la Fontaine]] fable.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=51}} In ''Three Moods'' (1921), Copland's final movement is entitled &quot;Jazzy&quot;, which he noted &quot;is based on two jazz melodies and ought to make the old professors sit up and take notice&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=44}}

The [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] established Copland as a serious modern composer. Musicologist Gayle Murchison cites Copland's use melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements endemic in jazz, which he would also use in his ''Music for the Theater'' and [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] to evoke an essentially &quot;American&quot; sound.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48–54}} he fuses these qualities with modernist elements such as octatonic and whole-tone scales, polyrhythmic ostinato figures, and dissonant counterpoint.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48–54}} Murchinson points out the influence of Igor Stravinsky in the work's nervous, driving rhythms and some of its harmonic language.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48–54}} Copland in hindsight found the work too &quot;European&quot; as he consciously sought a more consciously American idiom to evoke in his future work.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=128}}

Visits to Europe in 1926 and 1927 brought him into contact with the most recent developments there, including Webern's Five Pieces for Orchestra, which greatly impressed him. In August 1927, while staying in Königstein, Copland wrote ''Poet's Song'', a setting of a text by [[E.E. Cummings]] and his first composition using Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. This was followed by the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and the [[Piano Variations (Copland)|Piano Variations]] (1930), both of which rely on the exhaustive development of a single short motif. This procedure, which provided Copland with more formal flexibility and a greater emotional range than in his earlier music, is similar to Schoenberg's idea of &quot;continuous variation&quot; and, according to Copland's own admission, was influenced by the twelve-tone method, though neither work actually uses a twelve-tone row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=68, 138, 147}}

The other major work of Copland's first period is the ''Short Symphony'' (1933). In it, music critic and musicologist [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] writes, the &quot;jazz-influenced dislocations of meter that are so characteristic of Copland's music of the 1920s are more prevalent than ever&quot;.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} Compared to the ''Symphonic Ode'', the orchestration is much leaner and the composition itself more concentrated.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} In its combination and refinement of modernist and jazz elements, Steinberg calls the ''Short Symphony'' &quot;a remarkable synthesis of the learned and the vernacular, and thus, in all its brevity [the work last just 15 minutes], a singularly 'complete' representation of its composer&quot;.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=133}} However, Copland moved from this work toward more accessible works and folk sources.

=== Populist works ===
Copland wrote ''El Salón México'' between 1932 and 1936, which met with a popular acclaim that contrasted the relative obscurity of most of his previous works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=302}} Inspiration for this work came from Copland's vivid recollection of visiting the &quot;Salon Mexico&quot; dancehall where he witnessed a more intimate view of Mexico's nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;The Story Behind my El Salon Mexico https://www.jstor.org/stable/943608&lt;/ref&gt; Copland derived his melodic material for this piece freely from two collections of Mexican folk tunes, changing pitches and varying rhythms.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=299}} The use of a folk tune with variations set in a symphonic context started a pattern he repeated in many of his most successful works right on through the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=300}} It also marked a shift in emphasis from a unified musical structure to the rhetorical effect the music might have on an audience and showed Copland refining a simplified, more accessible musical language.{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=43}}

''El Salón'' prepared Copland to write the ballet score ''Billy the Kid'', which became, in Pollack's words, an &quot;archetypical depiction of the legendary American West&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=318–19, 325}} Based on a Walter Noble Burns novel, with choreography by Eugene Loring, ''Billy'' was among the first to display an American music and dance vocabulary.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=315}} Copland used six cowboy folk songs to provide period atmosphere and employed [[polyrhythm]] and [[polyharmony]] when not quoting these tunes literally to maintain the work's overall tone.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=317, 320}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p= 189}} In this way, Copland's music worked much in the same way as the murals of [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], in that it employed elements that could be grasped easily by a mass audience.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} The ballet premiered in New York in 1939, with Copland recalling: &quot;I cannot remember another work of mine that was so unanimously received.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Along with the ballet ''Rodeo'', ''Billy the Kid'' became, in the words of musicologist Elizabeth Crist, &quot;the basis for Copland's reputation as a composer of Americana&quot; and defines &quot;an uncomplicated form of American nationalism&quot;.{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=111}}

Copland's brand of nationalism in his ballets differed from that of European composers such as Béla Bartók, who tried to preserve the folk tones they used as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=255–57}} Copland enhanced the tunes he used with contemporary rhythms, textures and structures. In what could seem contradictory, he used complex harmonies and rhythms to simplify folk melodies and make them more accessible and familiar to his listeners.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=255}} Except for the Shaker tune in ''Appalachian Spring'', Copland often [[syncopation|syncopates]] traditional melodies, changes their [[metre (music)|metric patterns]] and note values.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}} In ''Billy the Kid'', he derives many of the work's sparse harmonies from the implied harmonic constructions of the cowboy tunes themselves.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}}

Like Stravinsky, Copland mastered the ability to create a coherent, integrated composition from what was essentially a mosaic of divergent folk-based and original elements.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=257}} In that sense, Copland's Populist works such as ''Billy the Kid'', ''Rodeo'', ''Appalachian Spring'' are not far removed from Stravinsky's ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=257–29}} Within that framework, however, Copland preserved the American atmosphere of these ballets through what musicologist Elliott Antokoletz calls &quot;the conservative handling of open diatonic sonorities&quot;, which fosters &quot;a pastoral quality&quot; in the music.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} This is especially true in the opening of ''Appalachian Spring'', where the harmonizations remain &quot;transparent and bare, suggested by the melodic disposition of the Shaker tune&quot;.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} Variations which contrast to this tune in rhythm, key, texture and dynamics, fit within Copland's compositional practice of juxtaposing structural blocks.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}}

=== Film scores ===
When Hollywood beckoned concert hall composers in the 1930s with promises of better films and higher pay, Copland saw both a challenge for his abilities as a composer as well as an opportunity to expand his reputation and audience for his more serious works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=336}} In a departure from other film scores of the time, Copland's work largely reflected his own style, instead of the usual borrowing from the late-Romantic period.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}} He often avoided the full orchestra, and he rejected the common practice of using a [[leitmotiv]] to identify characters with their own personal themes. He instead matched a theme to the action, while avoiding the underlining of every action with exaggerated emphasis. Another technique Copland employed was to keep silent during intimate screen moments and only begin the music as a confirming motive toward the end of a scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=342}} Virgil Thomson wrote that the score for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' established &quot;the most distinguished populist musical style yet created in America&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=343}} Many composers who scored for western movies, particularly between 1940 and 1960, were influenced by Copland's style, though some also followed the late Romantic &quot;Max Steiner&quot; approach, which was considered more conventional and desirable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}}{{sfn|Lerner|2001|p=491-99}}

=== Later works ===
Copland's work in the late 1940s and 1950s included use of Schoenberg's twelve-tone system, a development that he had recognized but not fully embraced. He had also believed the atonality of serialized music to run counter to his desire to reach a wide audience. Copland therefore approached dodecaphony with some initial skepticism.  While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because &quot;so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method&quot;.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=151}} The music of French composer Pierre Boulez showed Copland that the technique could be separated from the &quot;old Wagnerian&quot; aesthetic with which he had associated it previously. Subsequent exposure to the late music of Austrian composer Anton Webern and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] and Italian composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] strengthened this opinion.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=461}}

Copland came to the conclusion that composing along serial lines was &quot;nothing more than an angle of vision. Like fugal treatment, it is a stimulus that enlivens musical thinking, especially when applied to a series of tones that lend themselves to that treatment.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=445–46}} He began his first serial work, the &quot;Piano Fantasy&quot;, in 1951 to fulfill a commission from the young virtuoso pianist [[William Kapell]]. The piece became one of his most challenging works, over which he labored until 1957.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=445}} During the work's development, in 1953, Kapell died in an aircraft crash.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}} Critics lauded the &quot;Fantasy&quot; when it was finally premiered, calling the piece &quot;an outstanding addition to his own oeuvre and to contemporary piano literature&quot; and &quot;a tremendous achievement&quot;. Jay Rosenfield stated: &quot;This is a new Copland to us, an artist advancing with strength and not building on the past alone.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=484–85}}

Serialism allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices. Before he did this, according to musicologist Joseph Straus, the philosophical and compositional difference between non-tonal composers such as Schoenberg and tonal composers like Stravinsky had been considered too wide a gulf to bridge.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=61}} Copland wrote that, to him, serialism pointed in two opposite directions, one &quot;toward the extreme of total organization with electronic applications&quot; and the other &quot;a gradual absorption into what had become a very ''freely interpreted tonalism'' [italics Copland]&quot;.{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61–62}} The path he said he chose was the latter one, which he said, when he described his ''Piano Fantasy'', allowed him to incorporate &quot;elements able to be associated with the twelve-tone method and also with music tonally conceived&quot;.{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61–62}} This practice differed markedly from Schoenberg, who used his tone rows as complete statements around which to structure his compositions.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}} Copland used his rows not much different than how he fashioned the material in his tonal pieces. He saw his rows as sources for melodies and harmonies, not as complete and independent entities, except at points in the musical structure that dictated the complete statement of a row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}}

Even after Copland started using 12-tone techniques, he did not stick to them exclusively but went back and forth between tonal and non-tonal compositions.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=60}} Other late works include: ''[[Dance Panels]]'' (1959, ballet music), ''[[Something Wild (1961 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1961, his last film score, much of which would be later incorporated into his ''Music for a Great City''), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' (1962, for the new Lincoln Center Philharmonic hall), ''Emblems'' (1964, for wind band), ''[[Night-Thoughts (piano piece)|Night Thoughts]]'' (1972, for the [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]]), and ''Proclamation'' (1982, his last work, started in 1973).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=487–515}}

== Critic, writer, teacher ==
Copland did not consider himself a professional writer. He called his writing &quot;a byproduct of my trade&quot; as &quot;a kind of salesman for contemporary music&quot;.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=175}} As such, he wrote prolifically about music, including pieces on music criticism analysis, on musical trends, and on his own compositions.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=265}} An avid lecturer and lecturer-performer, Copland eventually collected his presentation notes into three books, ''What to Listen for in Music'' (1939), ''Our New Music'' (1941), and ''Music and Imagination'' (1952).{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=264}} In the 1980s, he collaborated with Vivian Perlis on a two-volume autobiography, ''Copland: 1900 Through 1942'' (1984) and ''Copland Since 1943'' (1989). Along with the composer's first-person narrative, these two books incorporate 11 &quot;interludes&quot; by Perlis and other sections from friends and peers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} Some controversy arose over the second volume's increased reliance over the first on old documents for source material. Due to the then-advanced stage of Copland's Alzheimer's and the resulting memory loss, however, this fallback to previous material was inevitable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} The use in both books of letters and other unpublished sources, expertly researched and organized, made them what Pollack terms &quot;invaluable&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}}

During his career, Copland met and helped hundreds of young composers, whom he met and who were drawn to him by his continual interest and acuity into the contemporary musical scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178–79}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=285}} This assistance came mainly outside an institutional framework—other than his summers at the [[Berkshire Music Center]] at Tanglewood and a few semesters at Harvard and the State University of New York at Buffalo, Copland operated outside an academic setting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} Pollack writes: &quot;Those composers who actually studied with him were small in number and did so for only brief periods; rather, Copland helped younger composers more informally, with intermittent advice and aid.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} This advice included focusing on expressive content rather than on purely technical points and on developing a personal style.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=290}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=194}}

Copland's willingness to foster talent extended to critiquing scores in progress that were presented to him by his peers. Composer [[William Schuman]] writes: &quot;As a teacher, Aaron was extraordinary.... Copland would look at your music and try to understand what ''you'' were after [italics Schuman]. He didn't want to turn you into another Aaron Copland.... When he questioned something, it was in a manner that might make you want to question it yourself. Everything he said was helpful in making a younger composer realize the potential of a particular work. On the other hand, Aaron could be strongly critical.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=191–92}}

== Conductor ==
Although Copland studied conducting in Paris in 1921, he remained essentially a self-taught conductor with a very personal style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=532}} Encouraged by Igor Stravinsky to master conducting and perhaps emboldened by Carlos Chavez's efforts in Mexico, he began to direct his own works on his international travels in the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=533}} By the 1950s, he was also conducting the works of other composers, and after a televised appearance where he directed the New York Philharmonic, Copland became in high demand.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=534}} He placed a strong emphasis in his programs on [[20th-century music]] and lesser-known composers, and until the 1970s rarely planned concerts to feature his music exclusively.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=535–36}} Performers and audiences generally greeted his conducting appearances as positive opportunities to hear his music as the composer intended. His efforts on behalf of other composers could be penetrating but also uneven.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=538–39}}

Understated on the podium, Copland modeled his style after other composer/conductors such as Stravinsky and [[Paul Hindemith]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Critics wrote of his precision and clarity before an orchestra.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Observers noted that he had &quot;none of the typical conductorial vanities&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=537}} Copland's unpretentious charm was appreciated by professional musicians but some criticized his &quot;unsteady&quot; beat and &quot;unexciting&quot; interpretations.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=537–38}} Koussevitzky advised him to &quot;stay home and compose&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533–34}} Copland at times asked for conducting advice from Bernstein, who occasionally joked that Copland could conduct his works &quot;a little better.&quot; Bernstein also noted that Copland improved over time, and he considered him a more natural conductor than Stravinsky or Hindemith.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533, 538}}{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=172}} Eventually, Copland recorded nearly all his orchestral works with himself conducting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=535}}

== Legacy ==

Copland wrote a total of about 100 works which covered a diverse range of genres. Many of these compositions, especially orchestral pieces, have remained part of the standard American repertoire.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}} According to Pollack, Copland &quot;had perhaps the most distinctive and identifiable musical voice produced by this country so far, an individuality ... that helped define for many what American concert music sounds like at its most characteristic and that exerted enormous influence on multitudes of contemporaries and successors.&quot;{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}}  His synthesis of influences and inclinations helped create the &quot;Americanism&quot; of his music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=292–94}} The composer himself pointed out, in summarizing the American character of his music, &quot;the optimistic tone&quot;, &quot;his love of rather large canvases&quot;, &quot;a certain directness in expression of sentiment&quot;, and &quot;a certain songfulness&quot;.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=530}}

While &quot;Copland's musical rhetoric has become iconic&quot; and &quot;has functioned as a mirror of America,&quot; conductor [[Leon Botstein]] suggests that the composer &quot;helped define the modern consciousness of America's ideals, character and sense of place. The notion that his music played not a subsidiary but a central role in the shaping of the national consciousness makes Copland uniquely interesting, for the historian as well as the musician.&quot;{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=442}} Composer [[Ned Rorem]] states, &quot;Aaron stressed simplicity: Remove, remove, remove what isn't needed.... Aaron brought leanness to America, which set the tone for our musical language throughout [World War II]. Thanks to Aaron, American music came into its own.&quot;{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=124}}

In 2014, the documentary ''[[Life Itself (2014 film)|Life Itself]]'' was released. Director [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]], whose films had been widely advocated by Ebert, started making it while the critic was still alive. [[Martin Scorsese]] served as an executive producer. The film studies Ebert's life and career, while also filming Ebert during his final months, and includes interviews with his family and friends. It was universally praised by critics. It has a 97% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rottentomatoes|life_itself|Life Itself}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebert was inducted as a laureate of [[The Lincoln Academy of Illinois]]. In 2001, he was awarded the highest honor in Illinois, the Order of Lincoln, by the governor of Illinois in the area of performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/4632-2/#toggle-id-15|title=Laureates by Year - The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|website=The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Ebert was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/roger-ebert |title=Roger Ebert |year=2016 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame  |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website [[RogerEbert.com]] contains an archive of every review Ebert wrote, as well as many essays and opinion pieces.

In [[mathematics]],  a '''basis function''' is an element of a particular [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for a [[function space]]. Every continuous function in the function space can be represented as a [[linear combination]] of basis functions, just as every vector in a [[vector space]] can be represented as a linear combination of [[basis vectors]].

In [[numerical analysis]] and [[approximation theory]], basis functions are also called '''blending functions,''' because of their use in [[interpolation]]: In this application, a mixture of the basis functions provides an interpolating function (with the &quot;blend&quot; depending on the evaluation of the basis functions at the data points).

==Examples==

===Polynomial basis===
The base of a [[polynomial]] is the factored polynomial equation into a linear function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-08-01|title=Solutions of differential equations in a Bernstein polynomial basis|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=205|issue=1|pages=272–280|doi=10.1016/j.cam.2006.05.002|issn=0377-0427|last1=Idrees Bhatti|first1=M.|last2=Bracken|first2=P.|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier basis===
Sines and cosines form an ([[orthonormality|orthonormal]]) [[Schauder basis]] for [[square-integrable function]]s. As a particular example, the collection:
:&lt;math&gt;\{\sqrt{2}\sin(2\pi n x) \; | \; n\in\mathbb{N} \} \cup \{\sqrt{2} \cos(2\pi n x) \; | \; n\in\mathbb{N} \} \cup\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;
forms a basis for [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,1)]].

{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}
'''Transform coding''' is a type of [[data compression]] for &quot;natural&quot; data like [[Sound recording|audio]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] or photographic [[image]]s. The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input ([[lossy compression]]).

In transform coding, knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application.

==Colour television==
{{Details|YIQ}}

=== NTSC ===
One of the most successful transform encoding system is typically not referred to as such—the example being [[NTSC]] color [[television]]. After an extensive series of studies in the 1950s, [[Alda Bedford]] showed that the human eye has high resolution only for black and white, somewhat less for &quot;mid-range&quot; colors like yellows and greens, and much less for colors on the end of the spectrum, reds and blues.

Using this knowledge allowed [[RCA]] to develop a system in which they discarded most of the blue signal after it comes from the camera, keeping most of the green and only some of the red; this is [[chroma subsampling]] in the [[YIQ]] [[color space]].

The result is a signal with considerably less content, one that would fit within existing 6&amp;nbsp;MHz black-and-white signals as a phase modulated differential signal. The average TV displays the equivalent of 350 pixels on a line, but the TV signal contains enough information for only about 50 pixels of blue and perhaps 150 of red. This is not apparent to the viewer in most cases, as the eye makes little use of the &quot;missing&quot; information anyway.

=== PAL and SECAM ===
The PAL and SECAM systems use nearly identical or very similar methods to transmit colour. In any case both systems are subsampled.

==Digital==
The term is much more commonly used in [[digital media]] and [[digital signal processing]]. The most widely used transform coding technique in this regard is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT),&lt;ref name=&quot;Muchahary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muchahary |first1=D. |last2=Mondal |first2=A.

It is the basis for the common [[JPEG]] [[image compression]] standard,&lt;ref name=&quot;t81&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=T.81 – Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images – Requirements and guidelines |url=https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf |publisher=[[CCITT]] |date=September 1992 |accessdate=12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines small blocks of the image and transforms them to the [[frequency domain]] for more efficient quantization (lossy) and [[data compression]]. In [[video coding]], the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] standards modify this DCT image compression technique across frames in a motion image using [[motion compensation]], further reducing the size compared to a series of JPEGs.

In [[audio coding]], MPEG audio compression analyzes the transformed data according to a [[psychoacoustic model]] that describes the human ear's sensitivity to parts of the signal, similar to the TV model. [[MP3]] uses a hybrid coding algorithm, combining the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) and [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Guckert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guckert |first1=John |title=The Use of FFT and MDCT in MP3 Audio Compression |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~gustafso/s2012/2270/web-projects/Guckert-audio-compression-svd-mdct-MP3.pdf |website=[[University of Utah]] |date=Spring 2012 |accessdate=14 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was succeeded by [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), which uses a pure MDCT algorithm to significantly improve compression efficiency.&lt;ref name=brandenburg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/mmcom12/slides/mp3_and_aac_brandenburg.pdf|title=MP3 and AAC Explained|last=Brandenburg|first=Karlheinz|year=1999|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213191747/https://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/mmcom12/slides/mp3_and_aac_brandenburg.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic process of [[digitizing]] an analog signal is a kind of transform coding that uses [[Sample (signal)|sampling]] in one or more domains as its transform.

'''William Carlos Williams''' (September 17, 1883 – March 4, 1963) was a Puerto Rican-American&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herlihy-Mera |first1=Jeffrey |date=2019 |title=Latinx Multilingualism and American Modernism: Concealed Transcultural Depths in William Carlos Williams's English |url=https://www.academia.edu/44149834 |journal=Voces del Caribe |volume=11 |issue=Fall 2019 |pages=1059–1095 |doi= |access-date=September 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet, writer, and physician closely associated with [[Modernist poetry|modernism]] and [[imagism]].

In addition to his writing, Williams had a long career as a physician practicing both [[pediatrics]] and general medicine. He was affiliated with Passaic General Hospital, where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death. The hospital, which is now known as [[St. Mary's General Hospital (Passaic, New Jersey)|St. Mary's General Hospital]], paid tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states &quot;We walk the wards that Williams walked&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Carlos Williams Fund For Maternal-Child Health Established At St. Mary's Hospital, Passaic|website=Rutherfordlibrary.typepad.com|url=http://rutherfordlibrary.typepad.com/williamcarloswilliams/st-marys-hospital-wcw-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Williams was born in [[Rutherford, New Jersey]] in 1883. His father was born in England but raised (ages 5-31) in the [[Dominican Republic]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herlihy-Mera |first1=Jeffrey |date=2019 |title=Latinx Multilingualism and American Modernism: Concealed Transcultural Depths in William Carlos Williams's English |url=https://www.academia.edu/44149834 |journal=Voces del Caribe |volume=11 |issue=Fall 2019 |pages=1068 |doi= |access-date=September 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; his mother was from [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]] and had French extraction. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Colón, David|title=Here's to You, Meestair Robangson: The Inter-American William Carlos Williams|journal=Label Me Latina/o|volume=5|pages=9|date=Spring 2015|language=English|url=http://labelmelatin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/David-A.-Col%C3%B3n-The-Inter-American-WCW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholars note that the Caribbean culture of the family home had an important influence on Williams. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes, &quot;English was not his primary means of communication until he was a teenager. At home his mother and father—who were raised in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, respectively—spoke Spanish with each other and to young William Carlos.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herlihy-Mera |first1=Jeffrey |date=2019 |title=Latinx Multilingualism and American Modernism: Concealed Transcultural Depths in William Carlos Williams's English |url=https://www.academia.edu/44149834 |journal=Voces del Caribe |volume=11 |issue=Fall 2019 |pages=1060 |doi= |access-date=September 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he wrote in English, “the poet’s first language” was Spanish and his “consciousness and social orientation” were shaped by Caribbean customs; his life was influenced “to a very important degree by a plural cultural foundation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herlihy-Mera |first1=Jeffrey |date=2019 |title=Latinx Multilingualism and American Modernism: Concealed Transcultural Depths in William Carlos Williams's English |url=https://www.academia.edu/44149834 |journal=Voces del Caribe |volume=11 |issue=Fall 2019 |pages=1061 |doi= |access-date=September 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams received his primary and secondary education in Rutherford until 1897 when he was sent for two years to a school near Geneva and to the [[Lycée Condorcet]] in Paris. He attended the [[Horace Mann School]] upon his return to New York City and, having passed a special examination, was admitted in 1902 to the [[Perelman School of Medicine|medical school of the University of Pennsylvania]], from which he graduated in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner-Martin|first=Linda|title=Williams' Life and Career|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/williams/bio.htm|work=Modern American Poetry|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Heather|title=William Carlos Williams|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/4009|publisher=Penn Current|accessdate=2011-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112050914/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/4009|archive-date=2012-11-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving Penn, Williams did internships at both [[French Hospital (Manhattan, New York)|French Hospital]] and Child's Hospital in New York, then went to [[Leipzig]] for advanced study of pediatrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois&quot; /&gt; He published his first book, ''Poems'', in 1909.

Williams married Florence Herman (1891–1976) in 1912 after he returned from Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois&quot; /&gt; They moved into a house in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was their home for many years. Shortly afterward, his second book of poems, ''The Tempers'', was published by a London press through the help of his friend [[Ezra Pound]], whom he had met while studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Around 1914, Williams and his wife had their first son, William E. Williams, followed by their second son, Paul H. Williams, in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William C. Williams|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/M4P5-Z6D|work=U.S. Census 1920|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first son would grow up to follow Williams in becoming a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. William Carlos Williams|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/05/20/75600398.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 May 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his primary occupation was as a family doctor, Williams had a successful literary career as a poet. His work has a great affinity with painting, in which he had a lifelong interest. In addition to poetry (his main literary focus), he occasionally wrote short stories, plays, novels, essays, and translations. He practiced medicine by day and wrote at night. Early in his career, he briefly became involved in the [[Imagism|Imagist]] movement through his friendships with Pound and [[H.D.]] (whom he had befriended during his medical studies at Penn), but soon he began to develop opinions that differed from theirs and his style changed to express his commitment to a modernist expression of his immediate environment.

In 1920, Williams was sharply criticized by many of his peers (such as H.D., Pound and Wallace Stevens) when he published one of his more experimental books ''Kora in Hell: Improvisations''. Pound called the work &quot;incoherent&quot; and H.D. thought the book was &quot;flippant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burt |first=Stephen |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-carlos-williams |title=Poetry Foundation bio on Williams |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dada]] artist and poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa]] critiicized Williams's sexual and artistic politics in her experimental prose poem review titled &quot;Thee I call 'Hamlet of Wedding Ring'&quot;, published in ''[[The Little Review]]'' in March 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]], ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, Williams published ''Spring and All'', one of his seminal books of poetry, which contained the classic poems &quot;By the road to the contagious hospital&quot;, &quot;[[The Red Wheelbarrow]]&quot; and &quot;To Elsie&quot;. However, in 1922, the year it was published, the appearance of [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' became a literary sensation and overshadowed Williams's very different brand of poetic [[Modernism]]. In his ''Autobiography'', Williams later wrote &quot;I felt at once that ''The Waste Land'' had set me back twenty years and I'm sure it did. Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself—rooted in the locality which should give it fruit&quot;. Although he respected the work of Eliot, Williams became openly critical of Eliot's highly intellectual style with its frequent use of foreign languages and allusions to classical and European literature.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William Carlos.

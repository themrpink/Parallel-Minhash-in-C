=== Training base for the Olympics ===
Before [[London 2012]], the region had been chosen by the [[London 2012 Organising Committee|Organising Committee]] as a training base for the participating delegations. During the months ahead of the Olympics, several countries sent their athletes to the region in order to prepare for the competitions. Among the teams training in Nord-Pas de Calais were the UK [[Gymnastics]] team in [[Arques, Pas-de-Calais|Arques]], the [[New Zealand]] [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] team in [[Gravelines]] and [[France national basketball team|France's national basketball]] and [[France national handball team|handball]] teams.

=== Sports in Nord-Pas de Calais ===
[[Soccer|Football]] is the most developed sport of the region. More than 145,000 players are members of a football club. Four clubs have professional status and play at the highest levels: [[Lille OSC]] and [[RC Lens]] in [[Ligue 1]] and [[Valenciennes FC]] in [[Ligue 2]] and [[US Boulogne|USBCO]] in the [[Championnat National]]. [[Arras Football]]'s ladies play in [[Division 1 Féminine|Division 1]].

'''Beefalo''', are 3/8 bison and 5/8 bovine, a [[fertility|fertile]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of domestic [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), usually a male in managed breeding programs, and the [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), usually a female in managed breeding programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Valerie|title=The Field Guide to Cattle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6CSqgpIC0YC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3192-7|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drew et al 1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drew|first1=K.

Beefalo are primarily cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full Beefalo as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called &quot;bison hybrids&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Breeds - Beefalo|url=https://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/97/beefalo/|access-date=2020-10-29|website=The Cattle Site|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Accidental crosses were noticed as long ago as 1749 in the Southern states of North America, during British colonization. Cattle and bison were first intentionally [[Crossbreed|crossbred]] during the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dafoe|first1=John W.|title=Domestication of the Buffalo|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=April 1889|volume=34|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_34/April_1889/Domestication_of_the_Buffalo|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first deliberate attempts to cross breed bison with cattle was made by Colonel Samuel Bedson, warden of [[Stony Mountain Institution|Stoney Mountain Penitentiary]], [[Winnipeg]], in 1880. Bedson bought eight bison from a captive herd of James McKay and inter-bred them with [[shorthorn|Durham cattle]]. The hybrids raised by Bedson were described by naturalist [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Brower2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Jennifer|title=Lost Tracks: National Buffalo Park, 1909-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGA2K51m_YQC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=978-1-897425-10-7|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''The hybrid animal is [claimed] to be a great improvement on both of its progenitors, as it is more docile and a better milker than the Buffalo, but retains its hardihood, while the robe is finer, darker and more even, and the general shape of the animal is improved by the reduction of the hump and increased proportion of the hind-quarters.''}}

After seeing thousands of cattle die in a Kansas blizzard in 1886, [[Charles &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones]], a co-founder of [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], [[Kansas]], also worked to cross bison and cattle at a ranch near the future [[Grand Canyon National Park]], with the hope the animals could survive the harsh winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/portraits/jones_charles.htm |title=Charles Jesse &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones |publisher=Kshs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the result &quot;cattalo&quot; in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |title=The Story of Cattalo |publisher=canadiangeographic.ca |date=May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901164141/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |archivedate=2005-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mossom Martin Boyd]] of [[Bobcaygeon]], [[Ontario]] first started the practice in Canada, publishing about some of his outcomes in the Journal of Heredity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M. M.|date=1914|title=Crossing bison and cattle|url=|journal=J Hered|volume=5|issue=5: 189–197|pages=189–197|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a107838|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 1914, the Canadian government continued experiments in crossbreeding up to 1964, with little success. For example, in 1936 the Canadian government had successfully cross-bred only 30 cattalos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magazines1934&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|title=Popular Mechanics|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA863|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=December 1934|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=863|chapter=Cattle Developed for North are Part Buffalo|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found early on that crossing a male bison with a domestic cow would produce few offspring, but that crossing a domestic bull with a bison cow apparently solved the problem. The female offspring proved fertile, but rarely so for the males. Although the cattalo performed well, the mating problems meant the breeder had to maintain a herd of wild and difficult-to-handle bison cows.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana produced a hybrid bull that was fertile.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World Beefalo Association and began marketing the hybrids as a new breed. The new name, Beefalo, was meant to separate this hybrid from the problems associated with the old cattalo hybrids.  The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths ''Bos taurus'' and at most three-eighths ''Bison bison''.

== Nutrition characteristics==
A [[United States Department of Agriculture]] study found Beefalo meat, like bison meat, to be lower in [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]] than standard beef cattle.&lt;ref name =aba&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/beefalo-facts-zmaz81mazraw.aspx Beefalo Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registration ==
In 1983, the three main Beefalo registration groups reorganized under the American Beefalo World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two Beefalo associations, the American Beefalo World Registry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abwr.org |title=ABWR |publisher=ABWR |accessdate=2009-10-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012195541/http://www.abwr.org/| archivedate= 12 October 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Beefalo International. These organizations jointly formed the American Beefalo Association, Inc., which currently operates as the registering body for Beefalo in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerBeefAssoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbeefalo.org/|title=American Beefalo Association |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on bison conservation ==
Most current bison herds are [[Genetic pollution|genetically polluted]] or partly crossbred with cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildcattleconservation.org/WildCattleNews/WildCattleNews.htm#news20070109 |title=Strands of undesirable DNA roam with Buffalo, By Jim Robbins, 9th January 2007, The New York Times |publisher=Wildcattleconservation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2387208 |author=Polzhiehn, R.O. |author2=C.

Dr. Dirk Van Vuren, formerly of the University of Kansas, however, points out that &quot;The bison today that carry cattle DNA look exactly like bison, function exactly like bison and in fact are bison. For conservation groups, the interest is that they are not totally pure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American icons aren't the animals they used to be | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14951-american-icons-arent-the-animals-they-used-to-be.html | work=[[New Scientist]] | author=Catherine Brahic | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cattalo ==
The term &quot;cattalo&quot; is defined by United States law as a cross of bison and cattle which have a bison appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |title=Code of Federal Regulations (9CFR352.1) rev 2004.&amp;nbsp;— &quot;Catalo or Cattalo means any hybrid animal with American bison appearance resulting from direct crossbreeding of American bison and cattle.&quot; |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |accessdate=2009-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826093000/http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], however, the term is used for hybrids of all degrees and appearance.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

In some U.S. states, cattalo are regulated as &quot;exotic animals&quot;, along with pure bison and [[deer]]. However, in most states, bison and hybrids which are raised solely for livestock (meat and sale) purposes similar to cattle, are considered domestic animals like cattle, and do not require special permits.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

'''Takoma Park''' is a city in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]], United States. It is a [[suburb]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and part of the [[Washington metropolitan area]]. Founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1890, Takoma Park, informally called &quot;[[Azalea]] City&quot;, is a [[Tree City USA]] and a nuclear-free zone.

==History==

===19th century===
Takoma Park was founded by [[Benjamin Franklin Gilbert]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;proctor331&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Proctor |first=John Claggett |title=Proctor's Washington and Environs |publisher=John Clagett Proctor, LL.D. |year=1949 |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first planned [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[commuter]] [[suburb]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anne. |first=O'Boyle, Mary |title=Takoma Park : portrait of a Victorian suburb, 1883-1983 |date=1984-01-01 |publisher=Historic Takoma |isbn=978-0961352707 |oclc=11274182}}&lt;/ref&gt; centered on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]] railroad station in [[Takoma, Washington, D.C.|Takoma, D.C.]], and bore aspects of a [[thermal bath|spa]] and [[trolley park]].

''Takoma'' was originally the name of [[Mount Rainier]], from [[Lushootseed language|Lushootseed]] {{IPA-sal|təqʷúbəʔ|}} (earlier {{IPA|*təqʷúməʔ}}), 'snow-covered mountain'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bright |first=William |title=Native American Placenames of the United States |date=2004 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0806135762 |location=Norman |page=469 |author-link=William Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a wish of Gilbert, the name ''Takoma'' was chosen in 1883 by DC resident Ida Summy, who believed it to mean 'high up' or 'near heaven'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kohn |first=Diana |date=November 2008 |title=Takoma Park at 125 |pages=14–15 |work=Takoma Voice |url=http://www.historictakoma.org/voice/TakomaParkAt1251108.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=May 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802143743/http://www.historictakoma.org/voice/TakomaParkAt1251108.pdf |archive-date=August 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] is also named after Mount Takhoma ([[Mount Rainier]]).

===Mid 20th century===
In 1964, an inside-the-Capital-Beltway extension of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 70S]], also known as the [[North Central Freeway]], was proposed via a route known as &quot;Option #11 Railroad Sligo East,&quot; up to {{frac|1|4}} mile parallel to the B&amp;O railroad upon a swath of land displacing 471 houses, that would have cut the city in two. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the future Mayor and [[civil rights]] activist [[Sammie Abbott]] led a campaign to halt freeway construction and replace it with a [[Takoma (Washington Metro)|Metrorail line]] to the site of the former train station, and worked with other neighborhood groups to halt plans for a wider system of freeways going into and out of DC.&lt;ref name=&quot;weta&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Jordan |first=Jamila |date=2015-12-17 |title=The Roads Not Traveled: D.C.

This controversy also raised the profile of Takoma Park at a time in the late 1960s and 1970s when it was becoming noted regionally and nationally for political activism outside the Nation's capital, with newspaper commentators describing it as &quot;The People's Republic of Takoma Park&quot; or &quot;The Berkeley of the East&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;common knowledge needs a better cite&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=DCist.com |title=Takoma Park Votes to Impeach President Bush |url=http://dcist.com/2007/07/24/takoma_park_vot.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320053853/http://dcist.com/2007/07/24/takoma_park_vot.php |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |quote=Commonly referred to as 'The People's Republic of Takoma Park' or 'The Berkeley of the East' |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of activism extended into the 1980s, when Takoma Park declared itself a [[Nuclear-free zone]] and a sanctuary for Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=November 5, 1985 |title=Takoma Park and Democracy |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/05/us/takoma-park-and-democracy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the old town Takoma Park was incorporated into the [[Takoma Park Historic District (Takoma Park, Maryland)|Takoma Park Historic District]]; listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lefrak&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lefrak |first=Mikaela |date=2019-04-24 |title=How Takoma Park Became 'The Berkeley Of The East' |work=WHAT’S WITH WASHINGTON |publisher=WAMU - FM |url=https://wamu.org/story/19/04/24/how-takoma-park-became-the-berkeley-of-the-east |access-date=2019-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
Before 1995, the eastern boundary of the city of Takoma Park was in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], Maryland, causing the community to be divided across two counties and the [[Takoma, Washington, D.C.|Maryland/D.C. line]] (where the original downtown area is located). For several years, Takoma Park lobbied the State of Maryland for legislation allowing county boundaries to be adjusted. The State finally agreed to this change, with the stipulation that cross-county municipalities would no longer be allowed; the new municipal boundary would forever remain within the county of its choosing. In August 1995, after passage of the law, the city held a public referendum asking registered voters living in three Prince George's County neighborhoods north of [[Maryland Route 650|New Hampshire Avenue]] whether they wanted to be annexed to the city of Takoma Park. There was a majority of votes, 211 out of 304, in favor of annexation to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Montgomery |first=David |date=August 23, 1995 |title=Casting Their Lots With Takoma Park: Three P.G.

In November 1995, the state-sponsored referendum was held asking whether the portions of the city in Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County, or vice versa. The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of the entire city in Montgomery County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Montgomery |first=David |date=November 8, 1995 |title=In a Montgomery State of Mind, Takoma Park Votes to Unify |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/11/08/in-a-montgomery-state-of-mind-takoma-park-votes-to-unify/bd270af4-661b-43ef-b0d5-6b4c51dfe4ae/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following subsequent approval by both counties' councils and the [[Maryland General Assembly]], the county line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 1, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Substantial Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970-Present |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506234535/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |access-date=August 8, 2009 |publisher=Census Bureau |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process became known as Unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=10-year retrospective on Unification |url=http://www.historictakoma.org/voice/Unification0707.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803070919/http://www.historictakoma.org/voice/Unification0707.pdf |archive-date=August 3, 2014 |access-date=February 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has experienced substantial [[gentrification]] in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), with many group houses containing accessory apartments being converted back into single-family homes. This process was encouraged by an [[M-NCPPC]] &quot;phase back&quot;, effectively eliminating scattered-site multifamily housing and implementing [[single-use zoning]] citywide, which prompted calls by some residents&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dan Robinson, City councilmember, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; for the city to have its own planning authority. The majority of the city's population remain tenants, many of whom live in a cluster of high-rise and mid-rise apartment buildings surrounding [[Sligo Creek]], which cuts a deep valley through the community.

In 2018, the City of Takoma Park proposed renaming streets that were named after [[general officer|general]]s who fought on either side in the [[United States Civil War]], namely [[Ulysses S.

{{see also|List of parks in Takoma Park}}
Takoma Park sits on the edge of the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Mid-Atlantic fall line]] and is thus quite hilly, with many narrow, gridded streets. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|2.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=January 25, 2013 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sligo Creek]] and Long Branch (both [[tributaries]] of the Northwest Branch of the [[Anacostia River]]) flow through the area. [[Sligo Creek Park]] and the {{convert|9|mi|adj=on|0}} [[Sligo Creek Trail]] bisect the area. The main street, Carroll Avenue, and the main [[state highway]], Route 410/East West Highway, narrow to two lanes within city limits. Takoma Park has an extensive hardwood tree canopy which is protected by local ordinance.

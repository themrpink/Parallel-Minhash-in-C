In the end, to appease the citizens who wanted war and to avoid angering those who oppose it, Laurier sent 1,000 volunteers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [[William Dillon Otter|William Otter]] to aid the confederation in its war to 'liberate' the peoples of the Boer controlled states in South Africa. The volunteers were provided to the British if the latter paid costs of the battalion after it arrived in South Africa.{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

The supporters of the war claimed that it &quot;pitted British Freedom, justice and civilization against Boer backwardness&quot;.{{sfn|Berger|1970|pp=233–34}} The French Canadians' opposition to the Canadian involvement in a British 'colonial venture' eventually led to a three-day riot in various areas of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boer War Remembered&quot; /&gt;

Commonwealth involvement in the Boer War can be summarised into three parts. The first part (October 1899 – December 1899) was characterised by questionable decisions and blunders from the Commonwealth leadership which affected its soldiers greatly. The soldiers of the Commonwealth were shocked at the number of Afrikaner soldiers who were willing to oppose the British. The Afrikaner troops were very willing to fight for their country, and were armed with modern weaponry and were highly mobile soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;South African War&quot; /&gt; This was one of the best examples of [[Guerrilla]] style warfare, which would be employed throughout the twentieth century after [[Set piece battle|set piece fighting]] was seen as a hindrance by certain groups.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}} The Boer soldiers would evade capture and secure provisions from their enemies therefore they were able to exist as a fighting entity for an indeterminate period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guerrilla War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guerrilla War|url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/intro/the-guerrilla-war.php|work=Anglo-Boer War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the First part was the period in mid-December, referred to as the &quot;Black Week&quot;. During the week of 10–17 December 1899, the British suffered three major defeats at the hands of the Boers at the battlefields of Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso. Afterwards, the British called upon more volunteers to take part in the war from the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Week&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickard|first=J.|title=The Black Week|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/concepts_black_week.html|work=History of War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the war (February–April 1900) was the opposite of the first. After the British reorganised and reinforced under new leadership, they began to experience success against the Boer soldiers. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] soldiers resorted to using blockhouses, farm burning and concentration camps to 'persuade' the resisting Boers into submission.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Boer War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada &amp; The South African War, 1899–1902|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/boerwarhistory_e.shtml|work=Canadian War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final phase of the war was the guerrilla phase in which many Boer soldiers turned to guerrilla tactics such as raiding infrastructure or communications lines. Many Canadian soldiers did not actually see combat after they had been shipped over to South Africa since many arrived around the time of the signing of the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Peace of Vereeniging&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|title=The Peace of Vereeniging|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/peace-vereeniging|work=History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Battle of Paardeberg|Paardeberg]]
|A British-led attack trapped a Boer Army in Central South Africa on the banks of the Modder River from 18–27 February 1900. Over 800 Canadian soldiers from Otter's 2nd Special Service Battalion were attached to the British attack force. This was the first major attack involving the Canadians in the Boer War, as well as the first major victory for Commonwealth soldiers. The Canadian soldiers perched on a hill above the Boer camp and were credited with being the main reason that the Boers under General Cronjé surrendered.{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}

|Zand River
|On 6 May 1900, the Commonwealth's northwards advance to the capital of Pretoria was well on its way. However, the British soldiers encountered a position of Boer soldiers on the Zand River. The British commander felt that the best course of action was to use cavalry to envelop the Boers on their left flank and infantry would therefore march on the Boer right flank to secure a crossing. The Canadian 2nd Battalion was the lead unit advancing on the right flank. However, due to disease and casualties from earlier encounters, the 2nd battalion was reduced to approximately half of its initial strength. The Canadian battalion came under fire from the Boers who were occupying protected positions. The battle continued for several hours until the British cavalry was able to flank the Boers and force a retreat. Canadian casualties were two killed and two wounded. The skirmishes around the Zand River would continue and more soldiers from various Commonwealth countries would become involved.{{sfn|O'Leary|1999}}
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Doornkop]]
|On the days of 28–29 May 1900, both the Canadian 2nd battalion and the 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade fought together on the same battlefield for the first, and only, time. The Mounted Brigade, which encompassed units such as the Canadian Mounted Rifles and the Royal Canadian Dragoons were given the task to establish a beachhead across a river which the Boers had fortified in an attempt to halt the advancing Commonwealth before they could reach the city of Johannesburg.{{sfn|Wessels|2009}}
Since the Boers were mounting a heavy resistance to the advancing mounted units, the Commonwealth infantry units were tasked with holding the Boer units while the mounted units found another route across the river with less resistance.{{sfn|Wessels|2009}} Even after the cavalry made it across to the other side of the river further down the line, the infantry had to advance onto the town of Doornkop as they were the ones who were tasked with its capture. The Canadians suffered very minimal casualties and achieved their objective after the Boer soldiers retreated from their positions.{{sfn|Wessels|2009}} Although the Canadians suffered minimal casualties, the lead British unit in the infantry advance, the Gordon Highlanders, did sustain heavy casualties in their march from the riflemen of the Boer force.{{sfn|Stirling|2009}}
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Battle of Leliefontein|Leliefontein]]
|On 7 November 1900, a British-Canadian force was searching for a unit of Boer commandos which were known to be operating around the town of Belfast, South Africa. After the British Commander reached the farm of Leliefontein, he began to fear that his line had expanded too far and ordered a withdrawal of the front line troops. The rear guard, consisting of the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]] and two [[Ordnance BL 12 pounder 7 cwt|12 pound guns]] from D section of the Canadian [[artillery]], were tasked with covering the retreat.{{sfn|Chase|2012}} The Boers mounted a heavy assault against the Canadians with the intention of capturing the two 12 pound artillery pieces. During this battle, the Afrikaners outnumbered the Canadians almost three to one.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}} A small group of the Dragoons interposed themselves between the Boers and the artillery in order to allow the guns and their crews time to escape. The Dragoons won three [[Victoria Crosses]]{{sfn|Chase|2012}} for their actions during the battle of Leliefontein, the most in any battle with the exception of the Battle of Vimy Ridge in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}}

As McLean and Phillips said, the New Zealand Boer War Memorials are &quot;tributes to the Empire and outpourings of pride about New Zealand’s place” in the Empire.]]When the Second Boer War seemed imminent, New Zealand offered its support. On 28 September 1899, Prime Minister [[Richard Seddon]] asked [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] to approve the offer to the imperial government of a contingent of mounted rifles, thus becoming the first British Colony to send troops to the Boer War. The British position in the dispute with the Transvaal was &quot;moderate and righteous,&quot; he maintained. He stressed the &quot;crimson tie&quot; of Empire that bound New Zealand to the mother-country and the importance of a strong British Empire for the colony's security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Zealand History Online|year=2008|title=Brief history – New Zealand in the South African ('Boer') War|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/909|publisher=New Zealand History|access-date=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time peace was concluded two and a half years later, 10 contingents of volunteers, totalling nearly 6,500 men from New Zealand, with 8,000 horses had fought in the conflict, along with doctors, nurses, veterinary surgeons and a small number of school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=New Zealand History Online|year=2008|title=New Zealand in the South African ('Boer') War|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/the-south-African-boer-war/introduction|publisher=New Zealand History|access-date=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 70 New Zealanders died from enemy action, with another 158 killed accidentally or by disease.&lt;ref&gt;D.O.W.

=== Rhodesia ===
Rhodesian military units such as the [[British South Africa Police]], [[Rhodesia Regiment]] and Southern Rhodesian Volunteers served in the Second Boer War.

=== South Africa ===
During the war, the British army also included substantial contingents from South Africa itself. There were large communities of English-speaking immigrants and settlers in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and [[Cape Colony]] (especially around [[Cape Town]] and [[Grahamstown]]), which formed volunteer units that took the field, or local &quot;town guards.&quot; At one stage of the war, a &quot;Colonial Division,&quot; consisting of five light horse and infantry units under Brigadier General [[Edward Brabant]], took part in the invasion of the [[Orange Free State]]. Part of it withstood a siege by Christiaan de Wet at [[Wepener]] on the borders of [[Lesotho|Basutoland]]. Another large source of volunteers was the ''[[uitlander]]'' community, many of whom hastily left [[Johannesburg]] in the days immediately preceding the war.

[[File:Rhodesians leaving Salisbury for Boer War.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesian]] volunteers leaving [[Harare|Salisbury]] for service in the Second Boer War, 1899]]
Later during the war, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] attempted to form a Boer Police Force, as part of his efforts to pacify the occupied areas and effect a reconciliation with the Boer community. The members of this force were despised as traitors by the Boers still in the field. Those Boers who attempted to remain neutral after giving their parole to British forces were derided as ''&quot;hensoppers&quot;'' (hands-uppers) and were often coerced into giving support to the Boer guerrillas. (This was one of the reasons for the British ruthlessly scouring the countryside of people, livestock and anything else the Boer commandos might find useful.)

Like the Canadian and particularly the Australian and New Zealand contingents, many of the volunteer units formed by South Africans were &quot;[[light cavalry|light horse]]&quot; or [[mounted infantry]], well suited to the countryside and manner of warfare. Some regular British officers scorned their comparative lack of formal discipline, but the light horse units were hardier and more suited to the demands of campaigning than the overloaded British cavalry, who were still obsessed with the charge by lance or sabre.{{efn| British cavalry travelled light compared with earlier campaigns, but were still expected to carry all kit with them on campaign owing to distances covered on the Veldt.}} At their peak, 24,000 South Africans (including volunteers from the Empire) served in the field in various &quot;colonial&quot; units. Notable units (in addition to the Imperial Light Horse) were the [[South African Light Horse]], [[Rimington's Guides]], [[Kitchener's Horse]] and the Imperial Light Infantry.

== Notable people involved in the Boer War ==
'''[[Harold Lothrop Borden]]''' was the only son of Canada's [[Minister of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Defence and Militia]], [[Frederick William Borden]]. Serving in the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], he became the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War.&lt;ref name=&quot;biographi.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5980&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=ychzfqkvzape|title=Borden, Harold Lothrop  |publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Volume XII (1891–1900)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] asked F. W. Borden for a photograph of his son, [[Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]] praised his services, tributes arrived from across Canada, and in his home town [[Canning, Nova Scotia]], there is a monument (by [[Hamilton MacCarthy]]) erected to his memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;biographi.ca&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Boer War Memorial, Plymouth.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial at [[Plymouth]], by [[Emil Fuchs (artist)|Emil Fuchs]]]]
'''[[Sam Hughes]]''' – Senior Militia officer and later a Federally elected [[cabinet minister]]. As a very patriotic individual, Hughes became involved in the Boer war as a member of Brigadier-General Herbert Settle's expedition after Hughes unsuccessfully tried to raise his own brigade of soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Boer War&quot; /&gt; Hughes was noted by his colleagues for having a dislike of professional soldiers and he was noted for being an exceptional leader of irregular soldiers, whom he preferred to lead in combat.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}}  However, Hughes was dismissed and was sent home in the summer of 1900 for; sending letters back home which were published outlining British command incompetence, his impatience and boastfulness and his providing surrendering enemies favourable conditions. When he arrived back in Canada, Hughes became very active politically, and he would eventually start his political career with the [[Conservatives]]. When he became a [[member of parliament]], Hughes would be in the position to become the [[Minister of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Defence and Militia]] in 1911, just prior the outbreak of World War I. This was a position that Hughes would be dismissed from in 1916, due once again to his impatience, among other reasons.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}}

'''[[John McCrae]]''' – Best known as the author of the World War I poem [[In Flanders Fields]], McCrae started his active military service in the Boer War as an artillery officer. After completing several major campaigns, McCrae's artillery unit was sent home to Canada in 1901 with what would be referred to today as an 'honourable discharge'. McCrae ended up becoming a special professor in the [[University of Vermont]] for [[pathology]] and he would later serve in World War I as a Medical officer until his death from [[pneumonia]] while on active duty in 1918.{{sfn|Peddie|2009}}

'''[[Breaker Morant|Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant]]''' – Australian poet who participated in the [[summary execution]] of several Boer prisoners and the killing of a German missionary who had been a witness to the shootings. Morant was court-martialed and executed for murder.{{sfn|Witton|2003|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }}
[[File:The Second Anglo - Boer War, South Africa 1899 - 1902 ZZZ7150D.jpg|thumb|A group of British prisoners, with [[Winston Churchill]] on the right]]
'''[[Winston Churchill]]''' – Best known as the prime minister of Britain during the main part of the [[Second World War]], Churchill worked as a war correspondent for ''[[The Morning Post]]''. At the age of twenty-six,{{sfn|Pakenham|1991a|p=568}} he was captured and held prisoner in a camp in Pretoria from which he escaped and rejoined the British army. He received a commission in the [[South African Light Horse]] (still working as a correspondent) and witnessed the capture of Ladysmith and Pretoria.{{sfn|Powell|2015|p={{page needed |date=February 2017}} }}

'''[[Mahatma Gandhi]]''' – Best known as the leader of the independence movement in India,  he lived in South Africa 1893–1915 where he worked on behalf of Indians. He volunteered in 1900 to help the British by forming teams of ambulance drivers and raising 1100 Indian volunteer medics. At Spioenkop Gandhi and his bearers had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. General Redvers Buller mentioned the courage of the Indians in his dispatch. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the War Medal.{{sfn|Desai|Vahed|2015|p={{page needed |date=February 2017}} }}

=== Victoria Cross recipients ===
Four Canadian soldiers in the Second Boer War received a [[Victoria Cross]], which is the highest military medal available to soldiers of the Commonwealth and former British Territories. It is awarded based on exemplary bravery and valour in the presence of danger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Cross|url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/pdf/Victoria_Cross_e.pdf|work=Government of Canada|access-date=6 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071050/http://www.gg.ca/honours/pdf/Victoria_Cross_e.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant [[Arthur Herbert Lindsay Richardson]] – Soldier of [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]], Richardson rode a wounded horse, while wounded himself, back into enemy fire to retrieve a wounded comrade whose horse had been killed at Wolve Spruit on 5 July 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria Cross&quot; /&gt;

Lieutenant [[Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn]] – Soldier of the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], Cockburn received his Victoria Cross on 7 November 1900 when his unit was the rear guard at Leliefontein. Cockburn, along with fellow Victoria Cross recipient Lieutenant R.E.W. Turner, held off an advancing group of Boer soldiers in order to allow two Canadian Field guns to escape along with their crews. Cockburn was wounded and captured by the Boer soldiers.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}}

Lieutenant [[Richard Ernest William Turner]] – Soldier of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, Turner received his Victoria Cross during the same portion of the conflict as Cockburn.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}} Turner was wounded in the conflict, however unlike Cockburn, Turner escaped. Turner would later become a high-ranking officer in the Canadian army in World War I.

Sergeant [[Edward James Gibson Holland]] – Soldier of the Royal Canadian Dragoons. Holland received his Victoria Cross from the same rear-guard conflict at Leliefontein on 7 November 1900 as Cockburn and Turner. However, Holland received his medal for a different reason than the two aforementioned [[Lieutenants]]. During the Boer advance, Holland kept the Boer soldiers at bay with his carriage-mounted Colt machine gun, despite the position becoming increasingly dangerous due to the proximity of the enemy. With his gun jammed and in danger of falling into enemy hands, Holland removed the Colt from its carriage and rode away on his horse with the gun in hand.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}}

== Final overview ==
The Second Boer War was the harbinger of a new type of combat which would persevere throughout the twentieth century, [[guerrilla warfare]].{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}} After the war was over, the entire British army underwent a period of reform which was focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units in combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Spencer|title=Scouting for Soldiers:Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899–1914|journal=War in History|volume=18|issue=4|pages=495–513|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0968344511417348|s2cid=110398601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that the traditional role of [[cavalry]] was antiquated and improperly used on the battlefield in the modern warfare of the Boer War, and that the First World War was the final proof that mounted attacks had no place in twentieth century combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914&quot; /&gt; Cavalry was put to better use after the reforms in the theatres of the Middle East and World War I, and that the idea of [[mounted infantry]] was useful in the times where the war was more mobile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reconnaissance and the British Cavalry 1899-1914&quot; /&gt; An example was during the First World War during the [[Battle of Mons]] in which the British cavalry held the Belgian town against an initial German assault. Another was the use of mounted infantry at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)]] in which Allenby's force routed the enemy owing to speed and dexterity of arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle of Mons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|title=Battle of Mons|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/bat1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian units of the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Rifles]] fought in the First World War in the same role as the Boer War.  However, during, and after, the Second World War the regiments swapped their horses for mechanised vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Royal Canadian Dragoons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Royal Canadian Dragoons|url=http://www.dragoons.ca/regimentalhistory.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122025630/http://www.dragoons.ca/regimentalhistory.html|archive-date=22 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the beginning of types of conflict involving machine guns, shrapnel and observation balloons which were all used extensively in the First World War.{{sfn|Webb|2010|pp=75–90}} To the Canadians however, [[attrition warfare|attrition]] was the leading cause of death in the second Boer war, with disease being the cause of approximately half of the Canadian deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian casualties in the Boer War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian casualties in the Boer War|url=http://angloboerwarmuseum.com/Boer83b_lest_we2.html|publisher=Goldi Productions Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians ended the war with four [[Victoria Cross]]es to its soldiers and two more Victoria Crosses were given to Canadian doctors attached to British Medical Corps units, Lieutenant H.E.M. Douglas (1899, Magersfontein) and Lieutenant W.H.S. Nickerson (1900, Wakkerstroom).&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Boer War&quot; /&gt; Not all soldiers saw action since many landed in South Africa after the hostilities ended while others (including the 3rd Special Service Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment) performed garrison duty in Halifax, Nova Scotia so that their British counterparts could join at the front lines. Later on, contingents of Canadians served with the paramilitary South Africa Constabulary. Both sides used a [[scorched Earth]] policy to deprive the marching enemy of food.  And both had to corral civilians into makeshift huts by 'concentrating them camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;South African War&quot; /&gt; For example, at [[Buffelspoort]], British soldiers were held in captivity in Boer encampments after surrendering their arms, and civilians were often mixed in with service personnel because the Boer did not have the resources to do otherwise.  A total of 116,000 women, children and Boer soldiers were confined to the Commonwealth concentration camps, of which at least 28,000, mainly women and children, would die.{{sfn|Pulsifer|2017}} The lack of food, water, and sanitary provisions was a feature of 20th-century warfare for both civilians and armed services personnel, yet one consequence of the Boer War and investigative commissions was the implementation of The Hague Convention (1899) and Geneva Convention (1904); of which there were many further agreements thereafter.

=== Views on British tactics ===
The British saw their tactics of [[scorched earth]] and [[concentration camp]]s as ways of controlling the Boers by &quot;eliminating the decay and deterioration of the national character&quot; and as a way of reinforcing the values, through subjugation of citizens and the destruction of the means for the Boer soldiers to continue fighting, of British society that the Boers were rejecting by engaging in a war against the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Berger|1970|pp=233–34}} The Boers saw them as a British ploy designed to coerce the Boer soldiers into a surrender. With approximately 10%&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bitter Legacy of the Boer War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Grundlingh|first=Albert|title=The Bitter Legacy of the Boer War|url=http://www.historytoday.com/albert-grundlingh/bitter-legacy-boer-war|work=History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their population confined, many of whom were women and children, the Boers suggested that the British were forcing the Afrikaners to return to their homes and protect their families who were in danger of internment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concentration Camps 1899-1902&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnard|first=Hennie|title=The Concentration Camps 1899–1902|url=http://www.boer.co.za/boerwar/hellkamp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 2019, the controversy around the British tactics continued to make headlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boer War: British MP sparks outrage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gous|first=Nico|title=Boer War women, children put in concentration camps 'for own good': British MP sparks outrage|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-02-15-boer-war-women-children-put-in-concentration-camps-for-own-good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==
The Australian National Boer War Memorial Committee organises events to mark the war on 31 May each year. In [[Canberra]], a commemorative service is usually held at the Saint John the Baptist Anglican Church in Reid.

'''Mary Elizabeth Braddon''' (4 October 1835 – 4 February 1915) was an English popular [[Novelists|novelist]] of the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Braddon, Mary Elizabeth (Maxwell) |magazine=Who's Who |year=1907 |volume= 59 |pages=201–202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA201}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for her 1862 [[sensation novel]] ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'', which has also been dramatised and filmed several times.

==Biography==
Born in London, Mary Elizabeth Braddon was privately educated. Her mother Fanny separated from her father Henry in 1840, when Mary was five. When Mary was ten years old, her brother [[Edward Braddon]] left for [[Company rule in India|India]] and later Australia, where he became [[Premier of Tasmania]]. Mary worked as an actress for three years, when she was befriended by Clara and [[Adelaide Calvert|Adelaide Biddle]]. They were only playing minor roles, but Braddon was able to support herself and her mother. Adelaide noted that Braddon's interest in acting waned as she took up writing novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoardmanJones2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Kay Boardman |author2=Shirley Jones |title=Popular Victorian Women Writers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rt2YCL0HABAC&amp;pg=PA189 |year=2004 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-6450-0 |pages=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, Mary met [[John Maxwell (1824–1895)]], a publisher of periodicals, and moved in with him in 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;ven&quot;&gt;Victor E. Neuburg, ''The Popular Press Companion to Popular Literature'', Popular Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0879722339}}, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maxwell was already married with five children, and a wife living in an [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in Ireland. Mary acted as stepmother to his children until 1874, when Maxwell's wife died and they were able to get married. She had six children by him.

Her eldest daughter, Fanny Margaret Maxwell (1863–1955), married the naturalist [[Edmund Selous]] on 13 January 1886. In the 1920s they lived in [[Wyke Castle]], where Fanny founded a local branch of the Woman's Institute in 1923, of which she became the first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sensationpress.com/fannymargaretmaxwell.htm |title=Fanny Margaret Maxwell |publisher=Sensationpress.com |accessdate=2013-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512041438/http://www.sensationpress.com/fannymargaretmaxwell.htm |archive-date=12 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second eldest son was the novelist [[William Babington Maxwell]] (1866–1939).

Mary Elizabeth Braddon died on 4 February 1915 in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] (then in Surrey) and is interred in [[Richmond Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Meller |first1=Hugh |last2=Parsons |first2=Brian |title=London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer |edition=fifth |year=2011 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |location=[[Stroud]], Gloucestershire |isbn=9780752461830 |pages=290–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her home had been Lichfield House in the centre of the town, which was replaced by a block of flats in 1936, [[Lichfield Court]], now listed. She has a plaque in [[St Mary Magdalene, Richmond|Richmond parish church]], which calls her simply &quot;Miss Braddon&quot;. A number of nearby streets are named after characters in her novels – her husband was a property developer in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond Local History Society (3rd ed., 2019).

==Work==
Braddon was a prolific writer, producing more than 80 novels with inventive plots. The most famous is ''[[Lady Audley's Secret]]'' (1862), which won her recognition and a fortune as a bestseller.&lt;ref name=&quot;ven&quot; /&gt; It has remained in print since its publication and been dramatised and filmed several times. [[R. D. Blackmore]]'s anonymous sensation novel ''[[Clara Vaughan]]'' (1864) was wrongly attributed to her by some critics.

Braddon wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including the [[Deals with the Devil in popular culture|pact with the devil]] story ''Gerard or The World, the Flesh, and the Devil'' (1891), and the ghost stories &quot;The Cold Embrace&quot;, &quot;Eveline's Visitant&quot; and &quot;At Chrighton Abbey&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] &quot;BRADDON, M(ary) E(lizabeth)&quot; In ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost, &amp; Gothic Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]]. Detroit: St. James Press/Gale, 1998, {{ISBN|1558622063}} pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Bleiler (1983), ''The Guide to Supernatural Fiction''. Kent, Ohio: Kent State UP. {{ISBN|0873382889}} pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s onwards, these stories were often anthologised in collections such as [[Montague Summers]]'s ''The Supernatural Omnibus'' (1931) and ''Fifty Years of Ghost Stories'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] and William Contento, ''The Supernatural Index: A Listing of Fantasy, Supernatural, Occult, Weird, and Horror Anthologies''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. {{ISBN|0313240302}} p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Braddon also wrote historical fiction. ''In High Places'' depicts the youth of [[Cultural depictions of Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jn&quot; &gt;Jonathan Nield (1925), ''A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales.'' G. P. Putnam's Sons, pp. 60, 68, 82 and 108.&lt;/ref&gt; ''London Pride'' focuses on [[Cultural depictions of Charles II of England|Charles II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jn&quot; /&gt; ''Mohawks'' is set during the reign of [[Cultural depictions of Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jn&quot; /&gt; ''Ishmael'' is set at the time of [[Napoleon III|Napoleon III's]] rise to power.&lt;ref name=&quot;jn&quot; /&gt;

Braddon founded ''[[Belgravia (magazine)|Belgravia]]'' magazine (1866), which presented readers with serialised sensation novels, poems, travel narratives and biographies, along with essays on fashion, history and science. It was accompanied by lavish illustrations and offered a source of literature at an affordable cost. She also edited ''[[Temple Bar (magazine)|Temple Bar]]'' magazine.

There is a critical essay on Braddon's work in [[Michael Sadleir]]'s book ''Things Past'' (1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;ven&quot; /&gt; In 2014 the Mary Elizabeth Braddon Association was founded to pay tribute to Braddon's life and work.&lt;ref&gt;Feminist &amp; Women's Studies Association (UK &amp; Ireland).

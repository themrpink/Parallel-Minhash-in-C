===UK football sexual abuse scandal===

{{main|United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal}}

In mid-November 2016, allegations of widespread historical sexual abuse at football clubs dating back to the 1970s began to emerge. On 21 November, the [[Football Association]] said it would set up a helpline;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor-21Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Six come forward after Andy Woodward's allegations of abuse at Crewe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/21/crewe-alexandra-andy-woodward|access-date=21 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was established with the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] and opened on 24 November,&lt;ref name=&quot;PA-24Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Press Association|title=NSPCC launches hotline for sexually abused footballers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/24/nspcc-launches-hotline-for-sexually-abused-footballers|access-date=25 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly receiving over 50 calls within the first two hours,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cacciottolo-25Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cacciottolo|first1=Mario|title=Football sex abuse claims: Two more ex-players speak out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38093421|access-date=25 November 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 100 by 27 November,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCSexAbuse-27Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex abuse: Football Association to investigate allegations|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38121724|access-date=27 November 2016|work=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 860 (&quot;more than three times as many referrals as in the first three days of the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile scandal]]&quot;) by 1 December&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotline-1Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Football abuse hotline receives 'staggering surge' in calls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38161301|access-date=1 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 350 individuals alleging abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodd-350-1Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dodd|first1=Vikram|title=Police say 350 people have come forward to report child sex abuse in football|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/01/fa-punish-clubs-cover-up-martin-glenn|access-date=1 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FA and NSPCC also collaborated to produce a film about how to keep children safe in the sport, featuring the captains of England's men's, women's and cerebral palsy football teams ([[Wayne Rooney]], [[Steph Houghton]] and Jack Rutter).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCfilm-03Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Football sex abuse: England captains make child safety film|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38185414|access-date=3 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November, the FA announced it was to set up an internal review, led by independent counsel Kate Gallafent QC, into what [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] knew about convicted child sex offender Barry Bennell and allegations of child sexual abuse in football, and investigate what information it was aware of at the time of the alleged offences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-27Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=FA sets up review into child sex abuse in football after Barry Bennell claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/27/fa-review-child-sex-abuse-football-barry-bennell-claims|access-date=27 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA was criticised by Conservative MP [[Damian Collins]], chair of the House of Commons' [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]], for being too slow in reacting and not instigating a wider review.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-28Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Association child sex abuse review 'not enough'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38128570|access-date=28 November 2016|work=BBC|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former sport minister [[Gerry Sutcliffe]] talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted &quot;dismissively&quot; to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reed-08Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=Jim|last2=Ray|first2=Louis Lee|title=Football abuse: FA reacted 'dismissively' to protection calls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38242317|access-date=8 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reed-30Nov2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=Jim|title=FA 'pulled all funding' from child protection project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38145061|access-date=3 December 2016|work=BBC|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being &quot;prevented/bullied&quot; from talking).&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor-1Apr2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Police receive reports that child abuse is still happening in football|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/01/police-reports-child-abuse-football-operation-hydrant|access-date=2 April 2017|work=The Observer|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: &quot;What I've seen in football over the years is that they're very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Soton-03Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 'abuser' still working in football|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38191644|access-date=3 December 2016|work=BBC News|agency=BBC|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2016, the FA announced that, due to &quot;the increased scope of the review since it was announced&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FA-TOR-06Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Terms of reference for review into alleged non-recent child sexual abuse in football|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/dec/05/fa-statement-terms-of-reference-061216#U2v6Wmb00hyAKYda.99|website=Football Association|publisher=FA|access-date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gallafent's other professional commitments, the review would be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-06Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Redknapp criticises FA over coach claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38218377|access-date=6 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 2017, the Sheldon review had made its first call for evidence, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information by 15 March about allegations of child sexual abuse between 1970 and 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;PA-11Jan2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Review into child abuse in football makes first call for evidence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/11/review-into-allegations-child-abuse-in-football-first-call-for-evidence|access-date=12 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, it was reported that the scale of evidence provided, plus the &quot;chaotic nature of the archiving&quot;, had delayed the inquiry team's sift through the FA's legal files; around 500,000 pages of material from 6,000 files were uploaded to a digital platform, and 353 documents were identified as highly relevant. Sheldon expected to start writing his final report in August 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg-28Mar2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Jacob |title=FA sexual abuse inquiry head ready to investigate any clubs who fail to cooperate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/28/fa-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-investigate-clubs-clive-sheldon-qc |access-date=18 July 2018 |work=Guardian |date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, it was reported that the FA's independent inquiry had found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football. Sheldon's report, likely to be highly critical of several clubs, was initially expected to be delivered to the FA in September 2018,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor-26Jul2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |title= FA sexual abuse inquiry finds no evidence of institutional cover-up |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/26/fa-sexual-abuse-inquiry-clive-sheldon |access-date=30 July 2018 |work=Guardian |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its publication was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Bob Higgins and possible further charges against Barry Bennell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor-26Sep2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |title=Football sexual abuse scandal review may be delayed for more than a year |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/26/football-sexual-abuse-scandal-review-may-be-delayed-over-a-year |access-date=26 September 2018 |work=Guardian |date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FA 2017 reform===
Also in December 2016, five former FA executives - [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]], [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]], [[Greg Dyke]], Alex Horne and [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|David Triesman]] - called on Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee to propose legislation to reform the FA, saying it was outdated, held back by &quot;elderly white men&quot;, and unable to counter the power of the Premier League or &quot;to reform and modernise in a fast-changing world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAreform-12Dec2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=FA reform: Former chiefs say 'elderly white men' block change|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38274152|access-date=12 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, it was announced that some reforms, including reducing the size of the FA's board and increasing the number of women, would be submitted for approval to the FA's annual general meeting on 18 May. However, the proposed changes were criticised by some for not going far enough, particularly to improve minority representation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-03Apr2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=FA council votes unanimously to accept reforms|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39481801|access-date=5 April 2017|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals were approved at the AGM and include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39962886 |title=Diving bans: Football Association approves retrospective action |publisher=BBC |date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Establishing three positions on the FA board for female members by 2018
* Reducing the size of the board to 10 members
* Adding 11 new members to the FA Council to &quot;better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football&quot;
* Limiting board membership to three terms of three years
* Introducing term limits for FA Council members

However, pressure for FA reform continued fuelled by allegations of racism and bullying in relation to the [[Mark Sampson]] and [[Eniola Aluko]] cases, and the historical sexual abuse scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor-16Oct2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Revealed: the 14-word email that puts FA's Greg Clarke under fresh scrutiny|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/16/fa-greg-clarke-mark-sampson-pfa-eni-aluko|access-date=30 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, FA chairman [[Greg Clarke]] announced a &quot;fundamental&quot; review of the FA after admitting it had &quot;lost the trust of the public&quot; following the Sampson controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rumsby-26Oct2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumsby|first1=Ben|title=Greg Clarke admits out-of-touch FA has 'lost the trust of the public'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/26/greg-clarke-admits-out-of-touch-fa-has-lost-trust-public/|access-date=30 October 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Clarke was criticised by sexual abuse victim [[Andy Woodward]] and the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]'s chief executive [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]] for remarks Clarke made to a [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] (DCMS) hearing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rumsby-25Oct2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumbsy|first1=Ben|title=Greg Clarke under fire again as abuse survivor Andy Woodward accuses FA chairman of 'humiliating' him|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/25/greg-clarke-fire-abuse-survivor-andy-woodward-accuses-fa-chairman/|access-date=30 October 2017|work=Telegraph|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-26Oct2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Woodward 'devastated &amp; deeply upset'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41768651|access-date=30 October 2017|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelner-26Oct2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelner|first1=Martha|title=PFA's Gordon Taylor considering legal action against FA chairman Greg Clarke|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/fa-chairman-greg-clarke-admits-organisation-has-lost-trust-of-the-public|access-date=30 October 2017|work=Guardian|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racist remarks===
In November 2020, Clarke resigned as FA chairman over &quot;unacceptable&quot; language he used when referring to black players in comments to the DCMS committee via video link.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-10Nov2020&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Greg Clarke resigns as Football Association chairman after remark about black players |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/54894864 |access-date=11 November 2020 |work=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown dependencies==

The football associations within the [[Crown dependencies]] of Jersey ([[Jersey Football Association]]), Guernsey ([[Guernsey Football Association]]) and the Isle of Man ([[Isle of Man Football Association]]) are affiliated to the FA despite having a separate identity from that of the [[United Kingdom]] and by extension [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FA Handbook 2013-14|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2013-14/fa-handbook-2013-14.ashx|publisher=TheFA.com|access-date=2 February 2014|page=621|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered [[county football association]]s by the FA. [[Matt Le Tissier]] and [[Graeme Le Saux]] have represented the FA's full national representative team and were born in Guernsey and Jersey respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islands lack competition&amp;nbsp;— Pitman|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7961895.stm|work=BBC News|access-date=2 February 2014|date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guernsey Football Association, Isle of Man Football Association and Jersey Football Association have been affiliated with the FA since 1903, 1908 and 1905 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;outcasts&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Menary|first=Steve|title=Outcasts! : the lands that FIFA forgot|date=2007|publisher=Know the Score!|location=Studley|isbn=978-1905449316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-discrimination policy|url=http://www.guernseyfa.com/~/media/countysites/guernseyfa/documents/anti-discrimnation-policy.ashx|publisher=GuernseyFA.com|access-date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Junttila|first1=Jukka|title=Jersey|url=http://junttila.net/postimerkit/FutisAlbumiJersey.PDF|publisher=junttila.net|access-date=21 February 2015|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Overseas Territory of [[Gibraltar]]'s [[Gibraltar Football Association]] was affiliated to the FA from 1911 until it opted to become a fully recognised member of [[UEFA]], a feat achieved after a 14-year legal battle. Joseph Nunez, the Gibraltar FA President claimed they were &quot;unilaterally thrown out&quot; of the FA following an intervention from [[Geoff Thompson (football)|Geoff Thompson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;outcasts&quot;/&gt;

A loophole was closed in May 2008 by FIFA which allowed players born in the Channel Islands to choose which home nation within the United Kingdom they will represent at international level. During the 1990s, [[Trevor Wood]] (Jersey) and [[Chris Tardif]] (Guernsey) represented Northern Ireland.

Some of the other [[British Overseas Territories]] have local football associations or leagues (including the [[Anguilla Football Association]], the [[Ascension Island Football League]], the [[Bermuda Football Association]], the [[British Virgin Islands Football Association]], the [[Cayman Islands Football Association]], the [[Falkland Islands Football League]], the [[Montserrat Football Association]], the [[Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association]]), but these are not considered subsidiary to the Football Association. Although the British Overseas Territories are too small to support professional teams,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} they have produced players such as [[Clyde Best]] who have gone on to play professionally in the Football Association, and referees such as [[Carlyle Crockwell]], who have refereed FIFA matches.

==Relationship with FIFA==

The Football Association first joined FIFA in 1905. The ''British Associations'' (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) opted to leave FIFA after [[World War I]] when FIFA chose not to exclude those who were part of the [[Central Powers]] from the organisation. The British Associations' stance had changed by 1922 and in 1924 they had rejoined FIFA.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Ireland had since been partitioned. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish Free State]] was independent of Britain. The latter is now the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Olympic Association]] had fought against 'broken time' – monetary compensation for athletes' earnings when competing in the Olympic games. At the 1925 Olympic Congress in Prague, the British had made an amendment that concluded governing federations should define amateur status for their sports but only in accordance with the definition of amateurism accepted by the Olympic Congress. In 1928, Switzerland proposed to FIFA that in certain circumstances, 'broken time' payments should be allowed and FIFA accepted. The FA resigned from FIFA in protest against the proposal. As a result of the FA's resignation, England did not participate in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]], [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] or [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] FIFA World Cup.

At the 1930 Olympic Congress in Berlin, Belgian delegates proposed that for each sport the definition of amateur status be left to its international federation. The BOA argued for a common definition of amateurism and argued that 'broken time' payments were against the Olympic ideal.

The FA rejoined FIFA in 1946 and participated in their first World Cup in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]. One of the first actions of the Football Association was to request the expulsion of the [[German Football Association|German]] and [[Japan Football Association|Japanese]] national football associations for their countries' role in [[World War II]]. Germany and Japan were prevented from qualifying for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a consequence. They were re-acquainted with FIFA in 1950 following a second request from Switzerland who had had a previous request rejected in 1948.

==Finances==
The FA's main commercial asset is its ownership of the rights to [[England national football team|England internationals]] and the [[FA Cup]]. Broadcasting income remains the FA's largest revenue stream with both domestic and international broadcasting rights for England fixtures and the FA Cup tied up until at least 2021.

For the four seasons from 2008 to 2012, the FA secured £425&amp;nbsp;million from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Setanta Sports|Setanta]] for England and FA Cup games domestic television rights, a 42% increase over the previous contract, and £145&amp;nbsp;million for overseas television rights, up 272% on the £39&amp;nbsp;million received for the previous four-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_2838917,00.html New Deals Sweet for FA], ''football365.com'', 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, during 2008–09 Setanta UK went into administration, which weakened the FA's cashflow position.

Turnover for the year ending 31 July 2016 was £370&amp;nbsp;million on which it made a profit after tax of £7&amp;nbsp;million. It has also made an investment of £125&amp;nbsp;million back into every level of Football in 2016. In July 2015 the FA announced plans to carry out a significant organisational restructure, in order to deliver considerable cost savings to invest in elite England teams, facilities and grassroots coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/-/media/thefacom-new/files/about-the-fa/2017/press-release-2015-16-financial-results-160217.ashx|title=The Football Association 2015/16 Financial Results|website=The FA|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA's income does not include the turnover of English football clubs, which are independent businesses. As well as running its own operations the FA chooses five charities each year to which it gives financial support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/FACampaigns/ TheFA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/six-villages.htm &quot;6 villages for 2006&quot;&amp;nbsp;– Official Charity Campaign of the 2006 FIFA World Cup] SOS Children's Villages, 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last three years, the FA received £350,000 in fines from players over comments made on [[Twitter]], the most recent fine being a £25,000 to [[Rio Ferdinand]]. The highest fine given during the last three years was a £90,000 fine to [[Ashley Cole]] in 2012 after calling the FA &quot;a bunch of twats.&quot; The FA has been more and more strict on comments made by players on Twitter, as the FA has disciplined 121 players overall in the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/early-doors/fa-made-%C2%A3350-000-from-twitter-fines-in-just-three-years-101858229.html|title=FA made £350,000 from Twitter fines in just three years|access-date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prince William of Wales RAF.jpg|thumb|[[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] is the current President of the FA.]]
The FA has a figurehead President, who since 1939 has always been a member of the [[British Royal Family]]. The Chairman of the FA has overall responsibility for policy. Traditionally this person rose through the ranks of the FA's committee structure (e.g. by holding posts such as the chairmanship of a county football association). In 2008 politician [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|David Triesman]] was appointed as the FA's first &quot;independent chairman&quot;, the first from outside the football hierarchy. The day-to-day head of the FA was known as the Secretary until 1989, when the job title was changed to Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Association|first=The Football|title=The FA Board|url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/who-we-are/structure|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.thefa.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Association|first=The Football|title=The FA Council|url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/who-we-are/the-fa-council|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.thefa.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Association|first=The Football|title=The FA Management team|url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/who-we-are/the-fa-management|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.thefa.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|de|Sicherheitsdienst}}''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzɪçɐhaɪtsˌdiːnst|lang}}, ''Security Service''), full title '''''{{lang|de|Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS}}''''' (Security Service of the ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]''), or '''SD''', was the [[intelligence agency]] of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. Originating in 1931, the organization was the first Nazi intelligence organization to be established and was considered a [[sister organization]] with the [[Gestapo]] (formed in 1933) through integration of SS members and operational procedures. The SD was administered as an independent SS office between 1933 and 1939, after which it was transferred to the authority of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt''; RSHA), as one of its seven departments/offices.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=140–144}} Its first director, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], intended for the SD to bring every single individual within the Third Reich's reach under &quot;continuous supervision&quot;.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp= 166–167}}

Following Germany's defeat in [[World War II]], the tribunal at the [[Nuremberg trials]] officially declared the SD a criminal organisation, along with the rest of Heydrich's RSHA (including the Gestapo) both individually and as branches of the SS in the collective.{{sfn|&quot;Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression&quot; (1946)}} Heydrich's successor, [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], was convicted of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] at the Nuremberg trials, sentenced to death and hanged in 1946.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp= 410–411}}

==History==
=== Origins ===
The SD, one of the oldest security organizations of the SS, first formed in 1931 as the ''Ic-Dienst'' (Intelligence Service{{efn|The &quot;Ic&quot; abbreviation in German military staff structures designated &quot;military intelligence&quot;}}) operating out of a single apartment and reporting directly to [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Himmler appointed a former junior naval officer, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], to organise the small agency.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=56, 57}} The office was renamed ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (SD) in the summer of 1932.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=125}} The SD became more powerful after the [[Nazi Party]] took control of Germany in 1933 and the SS started infiltrating all leading positions of the security apparatus of the Reich.  Even before Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, the SD was a veritable &quot;watchdog&quot; over the SS and over members of the Nazi Party and played a critical role in consolidating political-police powers into the hands of Himmler and Heydrich.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=65}}

===Growth of SD and SS power===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98683, Reinhard Heydrich.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]] in 1940]]
Once Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], he quickly made efforts to manipulate the aging president. On 28 February 1933, Hitler convinced Hindenburg to [[Reichstag Fire Decree|declare a state of emergency]] which suspended all civil liberties throughout Germany, due at least in part to the [[Reichstag fire]] on the previous night. Hitler assured Hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in Germany by taking a &quot;defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state&quot;.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=191–194}} Wasting no time, Himmler set the SD in motion as they began creating an extensive card-index of the Nazi regime's political opponents, arresting labor organizers, socialists, Jewish leaders, journalists, and communists in the process, sending them to the newly-established prison facility near Munich, [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].{{sfn|Distel|Jakusch|1978|p=46}} Himmler's SS and SD made their presence felt at once by helping rid the regime of its known political enemies and its perceived ones, as well. As far as Heydrich and Himmler were concerned, the SD left their mission somewhat vaguely defined so as to &quot;remain an instrument for all eventualities&quot;.{{sfn|Browder|1996|p=127}} One such eventuality would soon arise.

For a while, the SS competed with the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) for influence within Germany. Himmler distrusted the SA and came to deplore the &quot;rabble-rousing&quot; brownshirts (despite once having been a member) and what he saw as indecent sexual deviants amid its leadership.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|pp=47–51}} At least one pretext to secure additional influence for Himmler's SS and Heydrich's SD in &quot;protecting&quot; Hitler and securing his absolute trust in their intelligence collection abilities, involved thwarting a plot from [[Ernst Roehm]]'s SA using subversive means.{{sfn|Höhne|2001|pp=93–131}}

On 20 April 1934 [[Hermann Göring]] handed over control of the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' ([[Gestapo]]) to Himmler. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}} These events further extended Himmler's control of the security mechanism of the Reich, which by proxy also strengthened the surveillance power of Heydrich's SD, as both entities methodically infiltrated every police agency in Germany.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|pp=60–63}} Subsequently, the SD was made the sole &quot;party information service&quot; on 9 June 1934.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=129}}

The [[Victorian era]] and the early 20th century idealised the Elizabethan era. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' maintains that &quot;[T]he long reign of Elizabeth I, 1558–1603, was England's Golden Age... '[[Merry England]]', in love with life, expressed itself in music and literature, in architecture and in adventurous seafaring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061112031836/http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-200261 Elizabeth I and England's Golden Age]. Britannica Student Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; This idealising tendency was shared by Britain and an Anglophilic America. In popular culture, the image of those adventurous Elizabethan seafarers was embodied in the films of [[Errol Flynn]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and reaction to this hyperbole, modern historians and biographers have tended to take a more dispassionate view of the Tudor period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Patrick Collinson|title=Elizabeth I and the verdicts of history|journal=Historical Research|year=2003|volume=76 |issue =194|pages=469–91|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.00186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabethan England was not particularly successful in a military sense during the period, but it avoided major defeats and built up a powerful navy. On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with low defenses, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her frugal policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of £300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics'' (2005), p. 25. In the later decades of the reign, the costs of warfare — defeating the [[English Armada]] of 1589 and funding the campaigns in the Netherlands — obliterated the surplus; England had a debt of £350,000 at Elizabeth's death in 1603.&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, [[Sir Thomas Gresham]]'s founding of the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; though the wealth was distributed with wild unevenness, there was clearly more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth's reign than at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576–1642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 49–96 {{ISBN|0691064547}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments that &quot;Golden Age&quot; advocates have stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert (1991) ''The Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I, Genius of the Golden Age,'' Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0201608170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plots, intrigues and conspiracies===
The Elizabethan Age was also an age of plots and conspiracies, frequently political in nature, and often involving the highest levels of Elizabethan society. High officials in Madrid, Paris and Rome sought to kill Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replace her with [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a Catholic. That would be a prelude to the religious recovery of England for Catholicism. In 1570, the [[Ridolfi plot]] was thwarted. In 1584, the [[Francis Throckmorton|Throckmorton Plot]] was discovered, after Francis Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. Another major [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] was the [[Babington Plot]] — the event which most directly led to Mary's execution, the discovery of which involved a [[double agent]], [[Gilbert Gifford]], acting under the direction of [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's highly effective spy master.

The [[Essex Rebellion]] of 1601 has a dramatic element, as just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]), paid for a performance of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] at the [[Globe Theatre]], apparently with the goal of stirring public ill will towards the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bate256&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Bate|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Penguin|location=London|year=2008|pages=256–286|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the trial of Essex by [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Chamberlain's Men]] actor [[Augustine Phillips]], that the conspirators paid the company forty [[shilling]]s &quot;above the ordinary&quot; (i. e., above their usual rate) to stage the play, which the players felt was too old and &quot;out of use&quot; to attract a large audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;bate256&quot; /&gt;

In the [[Bye Plot]] of 1603, two Catholic priests planned to kidnap King James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Most dramatic was the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]] to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. It was discovered in time with eight conspirators executed, including [[Guy Fawkes]], who became the iconic evil traitor in English lore.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Sharpe (2005) ''Remember, Remember: A Cultural History of Guy Fawkes Day'', Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0674019350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy and defeat of the Armada===
[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Spanish Armada fighting the English navy at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]] in 1588.]]
While Henry VIII had launched the [[Royal Navy]], Edward and Mary had ignored it and it was little more than a system of coastal defense. Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority.&lt;ref&gt;Julian S. Corbett (1898) [https://archive.org/details/drakeandtudorna01corbgoog ''Drake and the Tudor Navy, With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power''] 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt; She risked war with Spain by supporting the &quot;[[Sea Dogs]]&quot;, such as [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the &quot;Dreadnaught&quot;, that allowed the ships to sail faster and maneuver better and permitted heavier guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England|journal=Mariner's Mirror|year=1996|volume=82 |issue =3|pages=269–300|doi=10.1080/00253359.1996.10656603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel. When Spain finally decided to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco. Superior English ships and seamanship foiled the invasion and led to the destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, marking the high point of Elizabeth's reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain's over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. Moreover, the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=Why the Armada Failed|journal=History Today|year=1888|volume=38 |issue =5|pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker has speculated on the dire consequences if the Spanish had landed their invasion army in 1588. He argues that the Spanish army was larger, more experienced, better-equipped, more confident, and had better financing. The English defenses, on the other hand, were thin and outdated; England had too few soldiers and they were at best only partially trained. Spain had chosen England's weakest link and probably could have captured London in a week. Parker adds that a Catholic uprising in the north and in Ireland could have brought total defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=If the Armada Had Landed|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1976.tb01347.x|journal=History|year=1976|volume=61|issue =203|pages=358–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonising the New World===
{{main|English colonial empire}}
The discoveries of Christopher Columbus electrified all of western Europe, especially maritime powers like England. King Henry VII commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to find a northern route to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of Asia; this began the search for the [[North West Passage]]. Cabot sailed in 1497 and reached [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Andrews (1984) ''Trade, Plunder and Settlement: Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480–1630'' (Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-27698-5}}) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He led another voyage to the Americas the following year, but nothing was heard of him or his ships again.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]] (2004) ''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire'', Penguin Books, p. 4 {{ISBN|0143034790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1562 Elizabeth sent [[privateer]]s [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake|Drake]] to seize booty from Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas (1997) ''The Slave Trade: the History of the Atlantic Slave Trade'', Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 155–158 {{ISBN|0684810638}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]] intensified after 1585, Elizabeth approved further raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and against shipping returning to Europe with treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson (2004) ''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire'', Penguin Books, p. 7 {{ISBN|0143034790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the influential writers [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own overseas empire. Spain was well established in the Americas, while Portugal, in union with Spain from 1580, had an ambitious global empire in Africa, Asia and South America. France was exploring North America.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Owen Lloyd (1994) ''The British Empire 1558–1995'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-873134-5}}, pp. 4–8.&lt;/ref&gt; England was stimulated to create its own colonies, with an emphasis on the [[West Indies]] rather than in North America.

[[Martin Frobisher]] landed at [[Frobisher Bay]] on [[Baffin Island]] in August 1576; He returned in 1577, claiming it in Queen Elizabeth's name, and in a third voyage tried but failed to found a settlement in Frobisher Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Alan |last=Cooke |title=Frobisher, Sir Martin |volume=1|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/frobisher_martin_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James McDermott (2001) ''Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan privateer'' (Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08380-7}}) [https://archive.org/details/martinfrobishere0000mcde/page/190 p. 190]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1577 to 1580, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] [[Francis Drake's Circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe. Combined with his daring raids against the Spanish and his great victory over them at [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard|Cádiz in 1587]], he became a famous hero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Cummins|title='That golden knight': Drake and his reputation|journal=History Today|year=1996|volume=46|issue =1 |pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wathen (2009) ''Sir Francis Drake: The Construction of a Hero'', D.S.Brewer {{ISBN|184384186X}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his exploits are still celebrated—but England did not follow up on his claims.&lt;ref&gt;John Sugden (1990) ''Sir Francis Drake'', Random House, p. 118 {{ISBN|1448129508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583, [[Humphrey Gilbert]] sailed to Newfoundland, taking possession of the harbour of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] together with all land within two hundred [[League (unit)|leagues]] to the north and south of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Gilbert, Sir Humphrey |first=David B. |last=Quinn |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gilbert_humphrey_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1584, the queen granted [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] a charter for the colonisation of [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]]; it was named in her honour. Raleigh and Elizabeth sought both immediate riches and a base for privateers to raid the Spanish treasure fleets. Raleigh sent others to found the [[Roanoke Colony]]; it remains a mystery why the settlers all disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Quinn (1985) ''Set fair for Roanoke: voyages and colonies, 1584–1606'', UNC Press Books, {{ISBN|0807841234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, the queen chartered the [[East India Company]]. It established trading posts, which in later centuries evolved into [[British India]], on the coasts of what is now India and [[Bangladesh]]. Larger scale colonisation began shortly after Elizabeth's death.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Andrews (1985) ''Trade, Plunder, and Settlement: Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480–1630'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521276985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
England in this era had some positive aspects that set it apart from contemporaneous continental European societies. Torture was rare, since the English legal system reserved torture only for capital crimes like treason&lt;ref&gt;George Macaulay Trevelyan (1949) ''England Under the Stuarts,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;—though forms of corporal punishment, some of them extreme, were practised. The persecution of witches began in 1563, and hundreds were executed, although there was nothing like the frenzy on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;With over 5% of Europe's population in 1600, England executed only 1% of the 40,000 witches killed in the period 1400–1800. {{cite journal|author= William Monter|title=Re-contextualizing British Witchcraft|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=35 |issue=1 |year=2004|pages=105–111 (106)|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v035/35.1monter.html|doi= 10.1162/002219504323091252 |s2cid=143951415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary had tried her hand at an aggressive anti-Protestant Inquisition and was hated for it; it was not to be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= John Edwards|title=A Spanish Inquisition?

B. Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth: 1558–1603'' (2nd ed. 1959) pp. 166–88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Tudor period#English Reformation}}
[[File:Copperplate map St Pauls.jpg|thumb|190px|Detail from the [[Copperplate map of London]] showing [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]]]]
Elizabeth managed to moderate and quell the intense religious passions of the time. This was in significant contrast to previous and succeeding eras of marked religious violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Collinson|authorlink=Patrick Collinson|title=Elizabethans|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethans00coll|url-access=limited|publisher=Hambledon|location=London|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/elizabethans00coll/page/n57 43]|chapter=The Monarchical Republic of Queen Elizabeth I|isbn=978-1-85285-400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth said &quot;I have no desire to make windows into mens' souls&quot;. Her desire to moderate the religious persecutions of previous Tudor reigns — the persecution of Catholics under Edward VI, and of Protestants under Mary I — appears to have had a moderating effect on English society. Elizabeth, Protestant, but undogmatic one,&lt;ref&gt; Christopher Haigh, English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993 p.&amp;nbsp;237 {{ISBN|978-0-19-822162-3}}, &lt;/ref&gt; reinstated the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with modifications which made clear that the Church of England believed in the (spiritual) Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion but without a definition how in favor of leaving this a mystery, and she had the Black Rubric removed from the Articles of Faith: this had allowed kneeling to receive communion without implying that by doing so it meant the real and essential presence of Christ in the bread and wine: she believed it so. She was not able to get an unmarried clergy or the Protestant Holy Communion celebrated to look like a Mass,.&lt;ref&gt; Haigh, op. cit. p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt; The Apostolic Succession was maintained, the institution of the church continued without a break (with 98% of the clergy remaining at their posts) and the attempt to ban music in church was defeated. The Injunctions of 1571 forbade any doctrines that did not conform to the teaching of the Church Fathers and the Catholic Bishops. The Queen's hostility to strict Calvinistic doctrines blocked the Radicals.

Almost no original theological thought came out of the English Reformation: instead the Church relied on the Catholic Consensus of the first Four Ecumenical Councils. The preservation of many Catholic doctrines and practices was the cuckoos nest that eventually resulted in the formation of the Via Media during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt; Diarmaid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–29 {{ISBN|0-333-69331-0}}, 'The cuckoo in the nest,' p.&amp;nbsp;64, 78-86; English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;240–242, 29-295.  &lt;/ref&gt; She spent the rest of her reign ferociously fending off radical reformers and Roman Catholics who wanted to modify the Settlement of Church affairs: The Church of England was Protestant, &quot;with its peculiar arrested development in Protestant terms, and the ghost which it harboured of an older world of Catholic traditions and devotional practice,&quot;&lt;ref&gt; MacCullough, p.&amp;nbsp;85. &lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years refrained from persecuting Catholics because she was against Catholicism, not her Catholic subjects if they made no trouble. In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] declared Elizabeth a heretic who was not the legitimate queen and that her subjects no longer owed her obedience. The pope sent Jesuits and seminarians to secretly evangelize and support Catholics. After several plots to overthrow her, Catholic clergy were mostly considered to be traitors, and were pursued aggressively in England. Often priests were tortured or executed after capture unless they cooperated with the English authorities. People who publicly supported Catholicism were excluded from the professions; sometimes fined or imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth: 1558–1603'' (2nd ed. 1959) pp. 166–88&lt;/ref&gt; This was justified on the grounds that Catholics were not persecuted for their religion but punished for being traitors who supported the Queen's Spanish foe; in practice, however, Catholics perceived it as religious persecution and regarded those executed as martyrs.

==Science, technology and exploration==
[[File:British - Francis Bacon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francis Bacon]], pioneer of modern scientific thought.]]
Lacking a dominant genius or a formal structure for research (the following century had both Sir [[Isaac Newton]] and the [[Royal Society]]), the Elizabethan era nonetheless saw significant scientific progress. The astronomers [[Thomas Digges]] and [[Thomas Harriot]] made important contributions; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his seminal study of magnetism, ''De Magnete,'' in 1600. Substantial advancements were made in the fields of cartography and surveying. The eccentric but influential [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] also merits mention.

Much of this scientific and technological progress related to the practical skill of navigation. English achievements in exploration were noteworthy in the Elizabethan era. Sir [[Francis Drake]] circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1581, and [[Martin Frobisher]] explored the [[Arctic]]. The first attempt at English settlement of the eastern seaboard of North America occurred in this era—the abortive colony at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1587.

While Elizabethan England is not thought of as an age of technological innovation, some progress did occur. In 1564 Guilliam Boonen came from the [[Netherlands]] to be Queen Elizabeth's first [[coach-builder]] —thus introducing the new European invention of the spring-suspension coach to England, as a replacement for the litters and carts of an earlier transportation mode. Coaches quickly became as fashionable as sports cars in a later century; social critics, especially [[Puritan]] commentators, noted the &quot;diverse great ladies&quot; who rode &quot;up and down the countryside&quot; in their new coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576–1642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 81–82 {{ISBN|0691064547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history==
Historians since the 1960s have explored many facets of the social history, covering every class of the population.&lt;ref&gt;On the social and demographic history see D. M. Palliser (1992) ''The Age of Elizabeth: England Under the Later Tudors, 1547–1603'' (2nd ed.), pp 35-110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{See also|Health and diet in Elizabethan England}}

Although home to only a small part of the population the Tudor [[municipalities]] were overcrowded and unhygienic. Most towns were unpaved with poor public sanitation.  There were no [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] or drains,  and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street. Animals such as [[rat]]s thrived in these conditions. In larger towns and cities, such as London, common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[malaria]], [[typhus]], [[diphtheria]], [[Scarlet fever]], and [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Life In Tudor Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/tudor.html |title=Life In Tudor Times |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] occurred in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589 and 1603. The reason for the speedy spread of the disease was the increase of rats infected by fleas carrying the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_salisbury.shtml |title=Spread of the Plague |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homes and dwelling===
[[File:Ivy House, Witchampton - geograph.org.uk - 934182.jpg|thumb|Parts of the Ivy House in [[Witchampton]] date from c. 1580]]
The great majority were tenant farmers who lived in small villages. Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, [[thatched]] huts with one or two rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life In Tudor Times&quot;/&gt; The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and [[wattle and daub]], or brick; stone and [[tiles]] were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with [[limewash]], making it white, and the wood was painted with black [[tar]] to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or [[jettying|jetty]]). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in [[casement windows]]. People who could not afford glass often used polished horn, cloth or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.

[[Mansions]] had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. Wealthy Tudor homes needed many rooms, where a large number of guests and [[servants]] could be accommodated, fed and entertained. Wealth was demonstrated by the extensive use of glass. Windows became the main feature of Tudor mansions, and were often a fashion statement. Mansions were often designed to a symmetrical plan; &quot;E&quot; and &quot;H&quot; shapes were popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tudor Houses&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |title=Tudor Houses |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510202040/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |archivedate=10 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===

[[File:Vagrant being punished in the streets (Tudor England).jpg|thumb|240px|A woodcut from circa 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England.]]

About one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give [[alms]] to assist the [[impotent poor]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Pound, ''Poverty and vagrancy in Tudor England'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor law was harsh on the [[able-bodied poor]], i.e., those unable to find work. Those who left their [[parishes]] in order to locate work were termed [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] and could be subjected to punishments, including whipping and putting at the stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/TUDpoverty.htm |title=Poverty in Tudor Times |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |accessdate=2019-02-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122075943/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUDpoverty.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Slack, ''Poverty and policy in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the [[workhouse]] for the able-bodied poor was first suggested in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (1999), ''Britain since 1789: A Concise History''. La Nuova Italia Scientifica, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

There was an unprecedented expansion of education in the Tudor period. Until then, few children went to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Simon|title=Education and Society in Tudor England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yymAz-8W77gC&amp;pg=PAvii|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521296793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that did go were mainly the sons of wealthy or ambitious fathers who could afford to pay the attendance fee. Boys were allowed to go to school and began at the age of 4, they then moved to [[grammar school]] when they were 7 years old. Girls were either kept at home by their parents to help with housework or sent out to work to bring money in for the family. They were not sent to school. Boys were educated for work and the girls for marriage and running a household so when they married they could look after the house and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alison Sim|title=The Tudor Housewife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3qYAiZVJHoC&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|pages=29–43|isbn=9780773522336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealthy families hired a tutor to teach the boys at home. Many Tudor towns and villages had a parish school where the local vicar taught boys to read and write. Brothers could teach their sisters these skills. At school, pupils were taught English, Latin, Greek, catechism and arithmetic. The pupils practised writing in ink by copying the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. There were few books, so pupils read from [[hornbooks]] instead. These wooden boards had the alphabet, prayers or other writings pinned to them and were covered with a thin layer of transparent cow's horn. There were two types of school in Tudor times: petty school was where young boys were taught to read and write; grammar school was where abler boys were taught English and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 4173010|title = The Teaching of English in Tudor Grammar Schools|journal = Studies in Philology|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 119–143|last1 = Nelson|first1 = William|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usual for students to attend six days a week. The school day started at 7:00 am in winter and 6:00 am in summer and finished about 5:00 pm. Petty schools had shorter hours, mostly to allow poorer boys the opportunity to work as well. Schools were harsh and teachers were very strict, often beating pupils who misbehaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 368112|title = Educational Opportunity in Tudor and Stuart England|journal = History of Education Quarterly|volume = 16|issue = 3|pages = 301–320|last1 = Cressy|first1 = David|year = 1976|doi = 10.2307/368112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education would begin at home, where children were taught the basic etiquette of proper manners and respecting others.&lt;ref name =Pearson&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee E. Pearson|title=Elizabethans at home|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethansatho0000pear|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1957|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0494-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elizabethansatho0000pear/page/140 140–41]|chapter=Education of children}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was necessary for boys to attend [[Grammar school (United Kingdom)|grammar school]], but girls were rarely allowed in any place of education other than petty schools, and then only with a restricted curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson&quot; /&gt; Petty schools were for all children aged from 5 to 7 years of age. Only the most wealthy people allowed their daughters to be taught, and only at home. During this time, endowed schooling became available. This meant that even boys of very poor families were able to attend school if they were not needed to work at home, but only in a few localities were funds available to provide support as well as the necessary education scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Simon|title=Education and Society in Tudor England|year=1966|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-521-22854-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/educationsociety0000simo/page/373 373]|url=https://archive.org/details/educationsociety0000simo/page/373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boys from wealthy families were taught at home by a private tutor. When Henry VIII shut the monasteries he closed their schools. He refounded many former monastic schools—they are known as &quot;King's schools&quot; and are found all over England. During the reign of Edward VI many free grammar schools were set up to take in non-fee paying students. There were two universities in Tudor England: [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Some boys went to university at the age of about 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/schools.htm |title=Tudor Schools |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618131251/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/schools.htm |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
England's food supply was plentiful throughout most of the reign; there were no famines. Bad harvests caused distress, but they were usually localized. The most widespread came in 1555–57 and 1596–98.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, pp. 30–31 {{ISBN|0192852132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the towns the price of staples was fixed by law; in hard times the size of the loaf of bread sold by the baker was smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. H. Britnell |title=Price-setting in English borough markets, 1349–1500 |journal=Canadian Journal of History |year=1996 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.3138/cjh.31.1.1 |url=https://www.usask.ca/history/cjh/e/iss/text/96/brit_496.shtml |issn=0008-4107 |access-date=18 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112095605/http://www.usask.ca/history/cjh/e/iss/text/96/brit_496.shtml |archive-date=12 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor consumed a diet largely of bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. G. Emmison|Emmison, F. G.]] (1976) ''Elizabethan Life: Home, Work and Land'', Essex Record Office, v. 3, pp. 29–31 {{ISBN|090036047X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens, and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Singman (1995) ''Daily Life in Elizabethan England'', Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 133–36 {{ISBN|031329335X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England was exposed to new foods (such as the [[potato]] imported from South America), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Thirsk (2006) ''Food in Early Modern England: Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500–1760'', Continuum, {{ISBN|0826442331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of the king or queen. Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the &quot;procession&quot; of the crowned heads of state in the summer months, when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles' lands both to avoid the plague season of London, and alleviate the royal coffers, often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court. This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble's home, who depending on his or her production and display of fashion, generosity and entertainment, could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years.

Special courses after a feast or dinner which often involved a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes known as a folly) with a central table set with dainties of &quot;medicinal&quot; value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, jellies and marmalades (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though it could be as everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.

===Gender===
[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait..jpg|thumb|250px|''The Procession Picture'', c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]
While the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility—especially royal wives and queens—historians have recovered scant documentation about the average lives of women. There has, however, been extensive statistical analysis of demographic and population data which includes women, especially in their childbearing roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minna F. Weinstein|title=Reconstructing Our Past: Reflections on Tudor Women|journal=International Journal of Women's Studies|year= 1978|volume=1 |issue =2|pages=133–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The role of women in society was, for the historical era, relatively unconstrained; Spanish and Italian visitors to England commented regularly, and sometimes caustically, on the freedom that women enjoyed in England, in contrast to their home cultures. England had more well-educated upper-class women than was common anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan C.

The Queen's [[Elizabeth I of England#Marriage question|marital status]] was a major political and diplomatic topic. It also entered into the popular culture. Elizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John N. King |s2cid=164188105 |title=Queen Elizabeth I: Representations of the Virgin Queen |journal=[[Renaissance Quarterly]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=30–74 |jstor=2861792 |doi=10.2307/2861792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, &quot;And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Haigh (2000) ''Elizabeth I'' (2nd ed.), Longman, p. 23 {{ISBN|0582472784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duc d'Alençon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan Doran|s2cid=55555610|title=Juno Versus Diana: The Treatment of Elizabeth I's Marriage in Plays and Entertainments, 1561–1581|journal=Historical Journal|volume=38 |issue=2|year=1995|pages=257–274|jstor=2639984|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00019427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to her father's emphasis on masculinity and physical prowess, Elizabeth emphasized the maternalism theme, saying often that she was married to her kingdom and subjects. She explained &quot;I keep the good will of all my husbands — my good people — for if they did not rest assured of some special love towards them, they would not readily yield me such good obedience,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Strickland, ''The life of Queen Elizabeth'' (1910) [https://archive.org/details/lifequeenelizab00strigoog/page/n444 p. 424]&lt;/ref&gt; and promised in 1563 they would never have a more natural mother than she.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Levin and Patricia Ann Sullivan (1995) ''Political rhetoric, power, and Renaissance women'', State Univ of New York p. 90 {{ISBN|0791425452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coch (1996) argues that her figurative motherhood played a central role in her complex self-representation, shaping and legitimating the personal rule of a divinely appointed female prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christine Coch|title='Mother of my Contreye': Elizabeth I and Tudor construction of Motherhood|journal=English Literary Renaissance|year=1996|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6757.1996.tb01506.x|volume=26 |issue =3|pages=423–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Over ninety percent of English women (and adults, in general) entered [[marriage]] at the end of the 1500s and beginning of the 1600s, at an average age of about [[Western European marriage pattern|25–26 years for the bride]] and 27–28 years for the groom, with the most common ages being 25-26 for grooms and 23 for brides.&lt;ref&gt;David Cressy.

{{main|English Renaissance theatre}}
With [[William Shakespeare]] at his peak, as well as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and many other playwrights, actors and theatres constantly busy, the high culture of the Elizabethan Renaissance was best expressed in its theatre. Historical topics were especially popular, not to mention the usual comedies and tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;M. C.

===Music===
{{main|Music in the Elizabethan era}}
Travelling musicians were in great demand at Court, in churches, at country houses, and at local festivals. Important composers included [[William Byrd]] (1543–1623), [[John Dowland]] (1563–1626) [[Thomas Campion]] (1567–1620), and [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]] (c. 1583–c. 1634). The composers were commissioned by church and Court, and deployed two main styles, [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] and [[Air (music)|ayre]].&lt;ref&gt;Comegys Boyd (1973) ''Elizabethan music and musical criticism'', Greenwood Press {{ISBN|0837168058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular culture showed a strong interest in folk songs and ballads (folk songs that tell a story).

===Fine arts===
{{Main|Portraiture of Elizabeth I|Artists of the Tudor court}}

It has often been said that the Renaissance came late to England, in contrast to Italy and the other states of continental Europe; the fine arts in England during the Tudor and Stuart eras were dominated by foreign and imported talent—from [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] under Henry VIII to [[Anthony van Dyck]] under Charles I. Yet within this general trend, a native school of painting was developing. In Elizabeth's reign, [[Nicholas Hilliard]], the Queen's &quot;limner and goldsmith,&quot; is the most widely recognized figure in this native development; but [[George Gower]] has begun to attract greater notice and appreciation as knowledge of him and his art and career has improved.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Waterhouse (1978) ''Painting in Britain: 1530–1790,'' 4th ed., New York, Viking Penguin, pp. 34–39 {{ISBN|0300058322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

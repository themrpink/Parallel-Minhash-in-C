In 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE's main competitors, synthesized [[Freon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=44|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use. Freon led to the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=45|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered at the time to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1987.

==Impact on settlement patterns==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}

In the last century refrigeration allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made “Galactic Cities” such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.

===Refrigerated rail cars===
The refrigerated rail car ([[refrigerated van]] or [[refrigerator car]]), along with the dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before the invention of the refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for a good portion of the year while making no revenue for the car's owner. The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of kilometres or miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stover|first=J.|title=American Railroads|url=https://archive.org/details/lifedeclineoft00stov|url-access=registration|journal=The Chicago History of the Railroad Refrigerator Car|year=1970|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifedeclineoft00stov/page/214 214]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion west and into rural areas===
The widespread use of refrigeration allowed for a vast amount of new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west. Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the [[tomato industry]]. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip}}. Dairy products were not as easily transported great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater perishability. Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schimd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Schimd|first=A.|title=The Economics of Population Settlement: Cost of Alternative Growth Patterns|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/Extension/ncrcrd/NCRCRD-rrd172-print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the galactic city===
&quot;Edge city&quot; was a term coined by [[Joel Garreau]], whereas the term &quot;galactic city&quot; was coined by [[Lewis Mumford]]. These terms refer to a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area. There were several factors contributing to the growth of these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley. These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food from great distances these large cities would have never developed. The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural productivity increase, allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schimd&quot;/&gt;

==Impact on agriculture and food production==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
Agriculture's role in developed countries has drastically changed in the last century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from a small portion of the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration's use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.

===Demographics===
The introduction of refrigeration and evolution of additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During the beginning of the 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. Yet, while the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, less than one percent of a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved if agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society's demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demographics|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/demographics.html|date=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meat packing and trade===
Prior to 1882, the [[South Island]] of New Zealand had been experimenting with sowing grass and crossbreeding sheep, which immediately gave their farmers economic potential in the exportation of meat. In 1882, the first successful shipment of sheep carcasses was sent from [[Port Chalmers]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, to [[London]]. By the 1890s, the frozen meat trade became increasingly more profitable in New Zealand, especially in [[Canterbury]], where 50% of exported sheep carcasses came from in 1900. It wasn't long before Canterbury meat was known for the highest quality, creating a demand for New Zealand meat around the world. In order to meet this new demand, the farmers improved their feed so sheep could be ready for the slaughter in only seven months. This new method of shipping led to an economic boom in New Zealand by the mid 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peden|first=R.|title=Farming in the Economy-Refrigeration and Sheep Farming|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/farming-in-the-economy/page-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Meat Inspection Act of 1891 was put in place in the United States because local butchers felt the refrigerated railcar system was unwholesome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libecap|title=The Rise of the Chicago Meat Packers and the Origins of Meat Inspection and Antitrust|journal=Economic Inquiry |volume=30|pages=242–262|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1992.tb01656.x|s2cid=154055122|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/h0029.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous about the quality of the meat for consumption. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Federal Meat Inspection Act|the 1906 Meat Inspection Act]] was put into place as an amendment to the Meat Inspection Act of 1891. This new act focused on the quality of the meat and environment it is processed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Gary M. Walton, Hugh|title=History of the American Economy|url=https://archive.org/details/historyamericane00walt_332|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=South-Western/Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=978-0-324-78661-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyamericane00walt_332/page/n360 336]–368|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity in rural areas===
In the early 1930s, 90 percent of the urban population of the United States [[electrification|had electric power]], in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies did not feel that extending power to rural areas ([[rural electrification]]) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.

While electricity dramatically improved working conditions on farms, it also had a large impact on the safety of food production. Refrigeration systems were introduced to the farming and [[food distribution]] processes, which helped in [[food preservation]] and [[food safety|kept food supplies safe]]. Refrigeration also allowed for production of perishable commodities, which could then be shipped throughout the United States. As a result, the United States farmers quickly became the most productive in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|periodical=Rural Cooperatives|last=Campbell|first=D.|title=When the Lights Came On|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424031515/http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-24|date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entire new [[food systems]] arose.

===Farm use===
In order to reduce humidity levels and spoiling due to bacterial growth, refrigeration is used for meat, produce, and dairy processing in farming today. Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled as soon as possible in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life. Meanwhile, dairy farms refrigerate milk year round to avoid spoiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beard|first=R.|title=Energy-Efficient Refrigeration for Farms|url=https://farm-energy.extension.org/energy-efficient-refrigeration-for-farms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on lifestyle and diet==
In the late 19th Century and into the very early 20th Century, except for staple foods (sugar, rice, and beans) that needed no refrigeration, the available foods were affected heavily by the seasons and what could be grown locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelpflug|first=E|title=The Food Industry and the Part That Refrigeration Plays in It|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=6|issue=4|pages=37–39|doi=10.2469/faj.v6.n4.37|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration has removed these limitations. Refrigeration played a large part in the feasibility and then popularity of the modern supermarket. Fruits and vegetables out of season, or grown in distant locations, are now available at relatively low prices. Refrigerators have led to a huge increase in meat and dairy products as a portion of overall supermarket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelpflug|first=E.|title=Effect of Modern Refrigeration on the Modern Supermarket|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=10|issue=5|pages=63–64|doi=10.2469/faj.v10.n5.63|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as changing the goods purchased at the market, the ability to store these foods for extended periods of time has led to an increase in leisure time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Prior to the advent of the household refrigerator, people would have to shop on a daily basis for the supplies needed for their meals.

===Impact on nutrition===
The introduction of refrigeration allowed for the hygienic handling and storage of perishables, and as such, promoted output growth, consumption, and the availability of nutrition. The change in our method of food preservation moved us away from salts to a more manageable sodium level. The ability to move and store perishables such as meat and dairy led to a 1.7% increase in dairy consumption and overall protein intake by 1.25% annually in the US after the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=L. |author2=Goodwin B. |author3=Grennes T.|title=The Effect of Mechanical Refrigeration on Nutrition in the United States|journal=Social Science History|volume=28|issue=2|pages=325–336|doi=10.1215/01455532-28-2-325|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were not only consuming these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% of the increase in adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of gastric cancer mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=B. |author2=Shin A. |author3=Yoo, K.|title=Ecological Study for Refrigerator Use, Salt, Vegetable, and Fruit Intakes, and Gastric Cancer|journal=Cancer Causes &amp; Control|volume=22|issue=11|pages=1497–1502|doi=10.1007/s10552-011-9823-7|pmid=21805052 |display-authors=etal|year=2011|s2cid=24595562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current applications of refrigeration==
Probably the most widely used current applications of refrigeration are for [[air conditioning]] of private homes and public buildings, and refrigerating foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and large storage warehouses. The use of [[refrigerator]]s and walk-in coolers and freezers in kitchens, factories and warehouses &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heatcraftrpd.com/productcatalog/familydetail.aspx?&amp;FilterCol=&amp;FilterVal=&amp;LPNO=5&amp;catID=HC113&amp;pageNo=4&amp;sort=Capacity+(BTUH)&amp;cID=2|title=Heatcraft Refrigeration Products &amp;#124; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration|website=www.heatcraftrpd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heatcraftrpd.com/productcatalog/familydetail.aspx?&amp;FilterCol=&amp;FilterVal=&amp;LPNO=5&amp;catID=HC058&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sort=Capacity+(BTUH)&amp;cID=2|title=Heatcraft Refrigeration Products &amp;#124; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration|website=www.heatcraftrpd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://russell.htpg.com/unit-coolers/walk-in/|title=Russell - Walk-In|website=russell.htpg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coldzone.htpg.com/unit-coolers/|title=Coldzone - Unit Coolers|website=coldzone.htpg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heatcraftrpd.com/productcatalog/categorylist.aspx?catID=HC007&amp;cID=4|title=Heatcraft Refrigeration Products &amp;#124; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration|website=www.heatcraftrpd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for storing and processing fruits and vegetables has allowed adding fresh salads to the modern diet year round, and storing fish and meats safely for long periods.
The optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is {{convert|3|to|5|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090213114520/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bloom/actions/fridgefreezertips.shtml Keep your fridge-freezer clean and ice-free]. ''BBC''. 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In commerce and manufacturing, there are many uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquefy gases – [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[propane]], and [[methane]], for example. In compressed air purification, it is used to [[condensation|condense]] water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[petrochemical]] plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in [[alkylation]] of [[butene]]s and [[butane]] to produce a high-[[octane rating|octane]] gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.

Dairy products are constantly in need of refrigeration, and it was only discovered in the past few decades that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.

One of the most influential uses of refrigeration was in the development of the [[sushi]]/[[sashimi]] industry in Japan. Before the discovery of refrigeration, many sushi connoisseurs were at risk of contracting diseases. The dangers of unrefrigerated sashimi were not brought to light for decades due to the lack of research and healthcare distribution across rural Japan. Around mid-century, the [[Zojirushi]] corporation, based in Kyoto, made breakthroughs in refrigerator designs, making refrigerators cheaper and more accessible for restaurant proprietors and the general public.

==Methods of refrigeration==
Methods of refrigeration can be classified as ''non-cyclic'', ''cyclic'', ''thermoelectric'' and ''magnetic''.

===Non-cyclic refrigeration===
{{Main|Ice trade}}
This refrigeration method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating [[dry ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= https://www.brighthubengineering.com/hvac/20353-methods-of-refrigeration-ice-refrigeration-and-dry-ice-refrigeration/

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the simplest example of this is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a [[ice cream maker#Hand Cranked machines|traditional ice-cream maker]]). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below water freezing point.

===Cyclic refrigeration===
{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
This consists of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink with the help of external work, and its inverse, the [[thermodynamic power cycle]]. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

A ''refrigeration cycle'' describes the changes that take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a [[refrigerator]]. It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [[HVACR]] work, when describing the &quot;process&quot; of refrigerant flow through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.

Heat naturally flows from hot to cold. [[Mechanical work|Work]] is applied to cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. [[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and [[energy]] needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 as a [[Carnot heat engine|heat engine]].

The most common types of refrigeration systems use the reverse-Rankine [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, although [[absorption heat pump]]s are used in a minority of applications.

Cyclic refrigeration can be classified as:
#Vapor cycle, and
#Gas cycle

Vapor cycle refrigeration can further be classified as:
#[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]
#Sorption Refrigeration
##[[Absorption refrigerator|Vapor-absorption refrigeration]]
##[[Adsorption refrigeration]]

====Vapor-compression cycle====
{{See also|Vapor-compression refrigeration}}
[[File:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor compression refrigeration]]
[[File:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Temperature–Entropy diagram]]
The vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and [[Industrial refrigerator|industrial refrigeration]] systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system.

The [[thermodynamics]] of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf The Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113352/http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf |date=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[Freon]] enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant [[entropy]] and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the [[vapor pressure]] at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the [[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing [[flash evaporation]] and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid.

That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.

The above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight [[thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamic irreversibility]] during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or [[ideal gas|non-ideal gas]] behavior, if any. Vapor compression refrigerators can be arranged in two stages in [[cascade refrigeration]] systems, with the second stage cooling the condenser of the first stage. This can be used for achieving very low temperatures. 

More information about the design and performance of vapor-compression refrigeration systems is available in the classic ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H. |author2=Green, D.W. |name-list-style=amp |title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}} (see pp. 12-27 through 12-38)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sorption cycle====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
=====Absorption cycle=====
{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems or [[lithium bromide|LiBr]]-water was popular and widely used. After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in [[recreational vehicles]] that carry [[liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]]. It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.

The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).

=====Adsorption cycle=====
{{Main|Adsorption refrigeration}}
The main difference with absorption cycle, is that in adsorption cycle, the refrigerant (adsorbate) could be ammonia, water, [[methanol]], etc, while the adsorbent is a solid, such as [[silicone gel]], [[activated carbon]], or [[zeolite]], unlike in the absorption cycle where absorbent is liquid.

The reason adsorption refrigeration technology has been extensively researched in recent 30 years lies in that the operation of an adsorption refrigeration system is often noiseless, non-corrosive and environment friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Goyal|first1=Parash|last2=Baredar|first2=Prashant|last3=Mittal|first3=Arvind|last4=Siddiqui|first4=Ameenur.

====Gas cycle====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
When the [[working fluid]] is a gas that is compressed and expanded but doesn't change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a ''gas cycle''. [[Air]] is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas [[heat exchanger]]s in gas cycles.

The gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse [[Brayton cycle]] instead of the reverse [[Rankine cycle]]. As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.

Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, ''air cycle'' coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the [[air cycle machine]] is very common on [[gas turbine]]-powered jet [[aircraft]] as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.

===Thermoelectric refrigeration===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
[[Thermoelectric cooling]] uses the [[Peltier effect]] to create a heat [[flux]] between the junction of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments. Peltier coolers are often used where a traditional vapor-compression cycle refrigerator would be impractical or take up too much space, and in cooled image sensors as an easy, compact and lightweight, if inefficient, way to achieve very low temperatures, using 2 or more stage peltier coolers arranged in a [[cascade refrigeration]] configuration, meaning that 2 or more peltier elements are stacked on top of each other, with each stage being larger than the one before it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kryothermtec.com/four-stage-thermoelectric-coolers.html|title=4-stage thermoelectric coolers|website=kryothermtec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to extract more heat and waste heat generated by the previous stages. Peltier cooling only has 1/4 the efficiency of the vapor-compression cycle so it doesn't extract as much heat, emits more waste heat (heat generated by the peltier element or cooling mechanism) and consumes more power for a given cooling capacity.

===Magnetic refrigeration===
{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
Magnetic refrigeration, or [[adiabatic]] [[demagnetization]], is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect, an [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic property]] of magnetic solids. The refrigerant is often a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]]. The active [[magnetic field|magnetic]] [[dipole]]s in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.

A strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered [[entropy]]. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.

Because few materials exhibit the needed properties at room temperature, applications have so far been limited to [[cryogenics]] and research.

===Other methods===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
Other methods of refrigeration include the [[air cycle machine]] used in aircraft; the [[vortex tube]] used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and [[thermoacoustic refrigeration]] using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; [[steam jet cooling]] popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many [[Stirling cycle]] heat engines can be run backwards to act as a refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in [[cryogenics]]. In addition there are other types of [[cryocoolers]] such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse-tube refrigerators]] and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, [[dilution refrigerator]]s.

===Elastocaloric refrigeration===
Another potential solid-state refrigeration technique and a relatively new area of study comes from a special property of [[pseudoelasticity|super elastic]] materials. These materials undergo a temperature change when experiencing an applied mechanical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (called the elastocaloric effect). Since super elastic materials deform reversibly at high [[strain (mechanics)|strains]], the material experiences a flattened [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] region in its [[stress-strain curve]] caused by a resulting phase transformation from an [[austenite|austenitic]] to a [[martensite|martensitic]] crystal phase.

When a super elastic material experiences a stress in the austenitic phase, it undergoes an [[exothermic]] [[phase transition|phase transformation]] to the martensitic phase, which causes the material to heat up. Removing the stress reverses the process, restores the material to its austenitic phase, and [[endothermic process|absorbs heat]] from the surroundings cooling down the material.

The most appealing part of this research is how potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly this cooling technology is. The different materials used, commonly [[shape-memory alloy]]s, provide a non-toxic source of emission free refrigeration. The most commonly studied materials studied are shape-memory alloys, like [[nitinol]] and Cu-Zn-Al. Nitinol is of the more promising alloys with output heat at about 66 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a temperature change of about 16–20 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tušek|first1=J.|last2=Engelbrecht|first2=K.|last3=Mikkelsen|first3=L.P.|last4=Pryds|first4=N.|title=Elastocaloric effect of Ni-Ti wire for application in a cooling device|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=February 2015|volume=117|issue=12|pages=124901|doi=10.1063/1.4913878|bibcode=2015JAP...117l4901T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulty in manufacturing some of the shape memory alloys, alternative materials like [[natural rubber]] have been studied. Even though rubber may not give off as much heat per volume (12 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ) as the shape memory alloys, it still generates a comparable temperature change of about 12 K and operates at a suitable temperature range, low stresses, and low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Zhongjian|last2=Sebald|first2=Gael|last3=Guyomar|first3=Daniel|title=Temperature dependence of the elastocaloric effect in natural rubber|journal=Physics Letters A|date=21 February 2017|volume=381|issue=25–26|pages=2112–2116|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.02.014|arxiv=1604.02686|bibcode=2017PhLA..381.2112X|s2cid=119218238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenge however comes from potential energy losses in the form of [[hysteresis]], often associated with this process. Since most of these losses comes from incompatibilities between the two phases, proper alloy tuning is necessary to reduce losses and increase reversibility and [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]]. Balancing the transformation strain of the material with the energy losses enables a large elastocaloric effect to occur and potentially a new alternative for refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Benfeng|last2=Liu|first2=Jian|title=Elastocaloric effect and superelastic stability in Ni–Mn–In–Co polycrystalline Heusler alloys: hysteresis and strain-rate effects|journal=Scientific Reports|date=18 May 2017|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2084|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-02300-3|pmid=28522819|pmc=5437036|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.2084L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fridge Gate===
The Fridge Gate method is a theoretical application of using a single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates on the fact that there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

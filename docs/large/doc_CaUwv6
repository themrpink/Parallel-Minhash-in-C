'''Melisende''' (1105 – 11 September 1161) was [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Queen of Jerusalem]] from 1131 to 1153, and regent for her son between 1153 and 1161 while he was on campaign. She was the eldest daughter of King [[Baldwin&amp;nbsp;II of Jerusalem]], and the [[Armenia]]n princess [[Morphia of Melitene]].

==Heir presumptive==
[[Jerusalem]] had recently been conquered by [[Christians|Christian]] [[Franks]] in 1099 during the [[First Crusade]], and Melisende's paternal family originally came from the County of [[Rethel]] in France. Her father Baldwin was a crusader knight who carved out the Crusader State of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] and married Morphia, daughter of the Armenian prince [[Gabriel of Melitene]], in a diplomatic marriage to fortify alliances in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;&gt;Hamilton, Bernard, ''Queens of Jerusalem'', Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978, ''Frankish women in the Outremer'', pg 143, ''Melisende's youth'' pgs 147, 148, ''Recognized as successor'' pg 148, 149, ''Offers patronage and issues diplomas, Marriage with Fulk, Birth of {{nowrap|Baldwin III,}} Second Crowing with father, husband, and son,'' pg 149,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;&gt;Oldenbourg, Zoe, ''The Crusades'', Pantheon Books, 1966, ''{{nowrap|Baldwin II}} searches for a husband for Melisende'', ''feudal relationship between France and Jerusalem'', ''{{nowrap|Fulk V}} of Anjou'', pg 264,&lt;/ref&gt;  Melisende, named after her paternal grandmother, Melisende of [[Montlhéry]], grew up in Edessa until she was 13, when her father was elected as the [[King of Jerusalem]] as successor of his cousin [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin&amp;nbsp;I]]. By the time of his election as king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} and Morphia already had three daughters:&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Melisende, [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], and [[Hodierna of Tripoli|Hodierna]].  As the new king, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had been encouraged to put away Morphia in favor of a new younger wife with better political connections, one that could yet bear him a male heir. Armenian historian [[Matthew of Edessa]] wrote that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was thoroughly devoted to his wife,&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; and refused to consider divorcing her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; As a mark of his love for his wife, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had postponed his [[coronation]] until [[Christmas Day]] 1119 so that Morphia and his daughters could travel to Jerusalem and so that the queen could be crowned alongside him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; For her part, Morphia did not interfere in the day to day politics of Jerusalem, but demonstrated her ability to take charge of affairs when events warranted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; When Melisende's father was captured during a campaign in 1123, Morphia hired a band of Armenian mercenaries to discover where her husband was being held prisoner,&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; and in 1124 Morphia took a leading part in the negotiations with Baldwin's captors to have him released, including traveling to Syria and handing over her youngest daughter Yveta as hostage and as surety for the payment of the king's ransom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Both of her parents stood as role models for the young Melisende, half [[Franks|Frankish]] and half Armenian, growing up in the [[Crusader states|Frankish East]] in a state of constant warfare.

As the eldest child, Melisende was raised as [[heir presumptive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;/&gt; Frankish women in the [[Outremer]] had a higher [[life expectancy]] than men, in part due to the constant state of war in the region, and as a result Frankish women exerted a wide degree of influence in the region and provided a strong sense of continuity to Eastern Frankish society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Women who inherited territory usually did so because war and violence brought many men to premature death, and women who were recognized as [[queen regnant]] rarely exercised their authority directly, with their spouse exercising authority ''[[jure uxoris]]'', through the medium of their wives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Contemporaries of Melisende who did rule, however, included [[Urraca of Castile]] (1080–1129), and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] (1122–1204). During her father's reign Melisende was styled  as ''daughter of the king and heir of the kingdom of Jerusalem'', and took precedence above other nobles and Christian clergy in ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''''filia regis et regni Jerosolimitani haeres''&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly she was associated with her father on official documents, including in the minting of money, granting of fiefdoms and other forms of patronage, and in diplomatic correspondence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Baldwin raised his daughter as a capable successor to himself and Melisende enjoyed the support of the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'', a kind of royal council composed of the nobility and clergy of the realm.

However, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} also thought that he would have to marry Melisende to a powerful ally, one who would protect and safeguard Melisende's inheritance and her future heirs. Baldwin deferred to King [[Louis&amp;nbsp;VI of France]] to recommend a Frankish [[vassal]] for his daughter's hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} embassy to France was headed by his constable, [[William I of Bures]] and with [[Hugues de Payens]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Frankish connection remained an important consideration for Crusader Jerusalem, as the nascent kingdom depended heavily on manpower and connections from France, Germany, and Italy. By deferring to France, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} was not submitting Jerusalem to the [[suzerainty]] of France; rather, he was placing the moral guardianship of the Outremer with the West for its survival, reminding {{nowrap|Louis VI}} that the Outremer was, to some extent, Frankish lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;/&gt;

{{nowrap|Louis VI}} chose [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk&amp;nbsp;V, Count of Anjou and Main]], a renownedly rich crusader and military commander, and to some extent a growing threat to {{nowrap|Louis VI}} himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt; Fulk's son from a previous marriage, [[Geoffrey of Anjou|Geoffrey]],  was married to [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry&amp;nbsp;I of England]]'s designated heir as England's next [[queen regnant]]. {{nowrap|Fulk V}} could be a potential grandfather to a future ruler of England, a relationship that would outflank {{nowrap|Louis VI}}. Fulk's wealth, connections, and influence made him as powerful as the King of France, according to historian Zoe Oldenbourg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;/&gt; Throughout the negotiations Fulk insisted on being sole ruler of Jerusalem. Hesitant, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} initially acquiesced to these demands though he would come to reconsider.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Hans E. Mayer]] argued that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} had promised sole rulership of Jerusalem after his death to Fulk, however historian Bernard Hamilton points out that there is no evidence to support Mayer's conclusion that Baldwin ever intended to prevent Melisende from ruling, rather the opposite, that {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} purposefully associated Melisende, and then Fulk, with his rule up until the time of his death. ''Medieval Women; Queens of Jerusalem, page 151''&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} perceived that Fulk, an ambitious man with grown sons to spare, was also a threat to {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} family and interest, and specifically a threat to his daughter Melisende. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} suspected that once he had died, Fulk would repudiate Melisende, set her and her children aside in favor of Elias, Fulk's younger but full grown son from his first marriage as an heir to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;

When Melisende bore a son and heir in 1130, the future [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin&amp;nbsp;III]], her father took steps to ensure Melisende would rule after him as reigning Queen of Jerusalem. {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} held a coronation ceremony investing the kingship of Jerusalem jointly between his daughter, his grandson {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, and Fulk. Strengthening her position, {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} designated Melisende as sole guardian for the young Baldwin, excluding Fulk. When {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} died the next year in 1131, Melisende and Fulk ascended to the throne as joint rulers. Later, [[William of Tyre]] wrote of Melisende's right to rule following the death of her father that ''the rule of the kingdom remained in the power of the lady queen Melisende, a queen beloved by God, to whom it passed by hereditary right''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende's youth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat''&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the aid of his knights, Fulk excluded Melisende from granting titles, offering patronage, and of issuing grants, diplomas, and charters. Fulk openly and publicly dismissed her hereditary authority. The fears of {{nowrap|Baldwin II}} seemed to be justified, and the continued mistreatment of their queen irritated the members of the ''Haute Cour'', whose own positions would be eroded if Fulk continued to dominate the realm. Fulk's behavior was in keeping with his ruling philosophy, as in Anjou Fulk had squashed any attempts by local towns to administer themselves and strong-armed his vassals into submission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenbourg's Melisende&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldenbourg wrote that Fulk had &quot;broken the resistance of his principal vassals on his own domains and paralyzed all attempts at emancipation by the townspeople. Page 264&lt;/ref&gt; Fulk's autocratic style contrasted with the somewhat collegial association with their monarch that native Eastern Franks had come to enjoy.

==Palace intrigue==
[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states, with Muslim states (in shades of green) in 1135 during the reign of Melisende]]
[[Image:Melisende-Psalter f12v.jpg|frame|An illustration from the [[Melisende Psalter]], commissioned during the Queen's reign]]
The estrangement between husband and wife was a convenient political tool that Fulk used in 1134 when he accused [[Hugh&amp;nbsp;II of Le Puiset]], [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon|Count of Jaffa]], of having an affair with Melisende. Hugh was the most powerful baron in the kingdom, and devotedly loyal to the memory of his cousin {{nowrap|Baldwin II}}. This loyalty now extended to Melisende. Contemporary sources, such as [[William of Tyre]], discount the alleged infidelity of Melisende and instead point out that Fulk overly favoured newly arrived Frankish crusaders from Anjou over the native nobility of the kingdom. Had Melisende been guilty, the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Church]] and nobility likely would not have later rallied to her cause.

Hugh allied himself with the Muslim city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], and was able to hold off the army set against him. He could not maintain his position indefinitely, however. His alliance with Ascalon cost him support at court. The [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] negotiated lenient terms for peace, and Hugh was exiled for three years. Soon thereafter an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Hugh was attributed to Fulk or his supporters. This was reason enough for the queen's party to openly challenge Fulk, as Fulk's unfounded assertions of infidelity were a public affront that would damage Melisende's position entirely.

Through what amounted to a palace coup, the queen's supporters overcame Fulk, and from 1135 onwards Fulk's influence rapidly deteriorated. One historian wrote that Fulk's supporters &quot;went in terror of their lives&quot; in the palace. William of Tyre wrote that Fulk &quot;did not attempt to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without [Melisende's] knowledge&quot;. Husband and wife reconciled by 1136 and a second son, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], was born. When Fulk was killed in a hunting accident in 1143, Melisende publicly and privately mourned for him.

Melisende's victory was complete. Again she is seen in the historical record granting titles of nobility, fiefdoms, appointments and offices, granting royal favours and pardons and holding court. Of Melisende, William of Tyre wrote &quot;reseditque reginam regni potestas penes dominam Melisendem, Deo amabilem reginam, cui jure hereditario competebat.&quot; Melisende was no mere regent-queen for her son {{nowrap|Baldwin III}}, but a queen regnant, reigning by right of hereditary and civil law.

==Patroness of the church and arts==

Melisende enjoyed the support of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] throughout her lifetime; from her appointment as {{nowrap|Baldwin II's}} successor, throughout the conflict with Fulk, and later when {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} would come of age. In 1138 she founded the large convent of [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)#Roman Catholic Church of St. Lazarus|St. Lazarus]] in Bethany where her younger sister [[Ioveta of Bethany|Ioveta]] would rule as abbess. In keeping with a royal abbey, Melisende granted the convent the fertile plains of [[Jericho]]. Additionally, the queen supplied rich furnishings and liturgical vessels, so that it would not be in any way inferior to religious houses for men. According to author and historian [[Bernard Hamilton]], Melisende also gave large

:&quot;endowments to the Holy Sepulchre, our Lady of Josaphat, the [[Templum Domini]], the Catholic Order of the Hospital (Knights of Malta), the leper hospital of Saint Lazarus, and the Praemonstratensians of Saint Samuel's.&quot;

Queen Melisende also appreciated a variety of literary and visual arts - her passion and assortment due to the different artistic exposures she received as a result of her parents' mixed Frankish-Armenian union. She created both a school of book makers and a school of miniature painters - a painting style most used in medieval illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vintage Books&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also commissioned the construction of &quot;a vaulted complex of shops in Jerusalem, including the legendary (and still surviving) Street of Bad Cooking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vintage Books&quot;/&gt; The Street of Bad Cooking (Malquisinat) was the central and most famous market of Crusader Jerusalem, presenting specialized merchants and cooks to supply the numerous pilgrims who visited the city with food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Food|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eating-in-historical-jerusalem|website=The Jewish Mosaic|publisher=Hebrew School of Jerusalem|accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melisende's love for books and her religious piety were very well known. She was recognized as a patroness of books,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact her husband knew how to exploit following the incident that greatly injured their relationship and the monarchy's stability. King Fulk was jealous of the friendship Melisende shared with Hugh, Count of Jafa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed under scrutiny for supposed adultery with the Queen, Hugh was attacked by an assassin who was most likely sent by the King himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly angered the queen. Melisende was extremely hostile after the accusations about her alleged infidelity with Hugh and refused to speak to or allow in court those who sided with her husband - deeming them &quot;under the displeasure of the queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Sharan|title=Defending the City of God: a Medieval Queen, the First Crusades, and the Quest for Peace in Jerusalem|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is apparent that Fulk set to appease his wife by commissioning her the special book as a peace offering. &quot;The Melisende Psalter is an extraordinarily beautiful little book that survives today in the British Museum&quot; - a gloriously decorated gift carefully and thoughtfully chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; While only 21.6 centimeters tall and 14 centimeters wide, the [[Melisende Psalter]] was ornately and expensively adorned - originally having the entire front cover gilded in gold and with six roundels made of ivory and exquisitely carved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tranovich|first1=Margaret|title=Melisende of Jerusalem: the World of a Forgotten Crusader Queen|date=2011|publisher=Melisende|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a &quot;multicolored silk spine&quot; and the ivory roundels/medallions have studded &quot;turquoise, ruby, and emerald stones&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; around scenes of King David from the Old Testament, a calendar with all the saints' days/observances marked, and also prayers of worship and adoration - all with extremely ornate illuminated initial letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melisende&quot;/&gt; The fact that it is written in Latin suggests that Melisende was literate in Latin. An important fact which shows that it was acceptable for noble women in the Middle East to be educated in this way. 
While there is no identification placing this book as Melisende's or made with her in mind, there is plenty of evidence that is highly suggestive of her as the sole recipient. The use of Latin text appropriate for a secular woman (as opposed to an abbess or such), the particular venerations of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalen (suggestive of the nearby abbey Melisende patronized and was later buried at), and the only two royal mentions/inclusions being of Melisende's parents all indicate that this book was for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; One final indicator that this was from Fulk to Melisende (other than the fact that only a king would be able to afford creating such a piece so pricey) is that there is a carving of a bird on the back cover labeled &quot;Herodius&quot; which is also known as &quot;fulica&quot; or falcon - making this a stamp pun/play on words to King Fulk's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philips|first1=Jonathan|title=Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though influenced by Byzantine and Italian traditions in the illuminations, the artists who contributed to the Melisende Psalter had a unique and decidedly 'Jerusalem style'. The historian [[Hugo Buchtal]] wrote that

:&quot;Jerusalem during the second quarter of the twelfth century possessed a flourishing and well-established scriptorium which could, without difficulty, undertake a commission for a royal manuscript ''de grand luxe''&quot;.

There is no account of how Melisende received this gift but shortly after its creation, the royal union appeared stronger than ever. Two things prove the couple's reconciliation: 1) almost every single charter after this was issued by Fulk but labeled &quot;with the consent and the approval of Queen Melisende&quot;, and 2) the birth of the royal pair's second son, Amalric, in 1136.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; It is also reported that Queen Melisende mourned greatly after her husband fell off a horse and died in 1143.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vintage Books&quot;/&gt;

==Second Crusade==
In 1144 the [[Crusader states|Crusader state]] of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was besieged in a border war that threatened its survival. Queen Melisende responded by sending an army led by [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable]] [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]], and Elinand of Bures. [[Raymond of Antioch]] ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Despite Melisende's army, [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa fell]].

Melisende sent word to the Pope in Rome, and the west called for a [[Second Crusade]]. The crusader expedition was led by French [[Louis&amp;nbsp;VII of France]] and the German Emperor [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad&amp;nbsp;III]]. Accompanying Louis was his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], with her own vassal lords in tow. Eleanor had herself been designated by her father, [[William X of Aquitaine|William&amp;nbsp;X]], to succeed him in her own right, just as Melisende had been designated to succeed her father.

During the Crusader [[Council of Acre|meeting in Acre]] in 1148, the battle strategy was planned. Conrad and Louis advised 18-year-old {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} to attack the Muslim city-state of [[Damascus]], though Melisende, Manasses, and Eleanor wanted to take [[Aleppo]], which would aid them in retaking Edessa. The meeting ended with Damascus as their target. Damascus and Jerusalem were on very good diplomatic terms and there was a peace treaty between them. The result of this breach of treaty was that Damascus would never trust the Crusader states again, and the loss of a sympathetic Muslim state was a blow from which later monarchs of Jerusalem could not recover. After 11 months, Eleanor and Louis departed for France, ending the Second Crusade.

==Mother and son==
Melisende's relationship with her son was complex. As a mother she would know her son and his capabilities, and she is known to have been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision-making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or social pressure to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.

Baldwin grew up to be a capable, if not brilliant, military commander. By age 22 however, Baldwin felt he could take some responsibility in governance. Melisende had hitherto only partially associated Baldwin in her rule. Tension between mother and son mounted between 1150 and 1152, with Baldwin blaming Manasses for alienating his mother from him. The crisis reached a boiling point early 1152 when Baldwin demanded that the [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|patriarch Fulcher]] crown him in the Holy Sepulchre, without Melisende present. The Patriarch refused. Baldwin, in protest, staged a procession in the city streets wearing laurel wreaths, a kind of self-crowning.

Baldwin and Melisende agreed to put the decision to the ''Haute Cour''. The ''Haute Cour'' decided that Baldwin would rule the north of the kingdom and Melisende the richer [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], and Jerusalem itself. Melisende acquiesced, though with misgivings. This decision would prevent a civil war but also divide the kingdom's resources. Though later historians criticized Melisende for not abdicating in favor of her son, there was little impetus for her to do so. She was universally recognized as an exceptional steward for her kingdom, and her rule had been characterized as a wise one by church leaders and other contemporaries. Baldwin had not shown any interest in governance prior to 1152, and had resisted responsibility in this arena. The Church clearly supported Melisende, as did the barons of Judea and Samaria.

Despite putting the matter before the ''Haute Cour'', Baldwin was not happy with the partition any more than Melisende. But instead of reaching further compromise, within weeks of the decision he launched an invasion of his mother's realms. Baldwin showed that he was Fulk's son by quickly taking the field; [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem fell swiftly. Melisende with her younger son Amalric and others sought refuge in the [[Tower of David]]. Church mediation between mother and son resulted in the grant of the city of Nablus and adjacent lands to Melisende to rule for life, and a solemn oath by {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} not to disturb her peace. This peace settlement demonstrated that though Melisende lost the &quot;civil war&quot; to her son, she still maintained great influence and avoided total obscurity in a convent.

==Retirement==
By 1153, mother and son had been reconciled. Since the civil war, Baldwin had shown his mother great respect. Melisende's connections, especially to her sister Hodierna, and to her niece [[Constance of Antioch]], meant that she had direct influence in northern Syria, a priceless connection since Baldwin had himself broken the treaty with Damascus in 1147.

As {{nowrap|Baldwin III}} was often on military campaigns, he realized he had few reliable advisers. From 1154 onwards, Melisende is again associated with her son in many of his official public acts. In 1156, she concluded a treaty with the merchants of [[Pisa]]. In 1157, with Baldwin on campaign in Antioch, Melisende saw an opportunity to take el-Hablis,{{dubious|Maybe al-Habis Jaldak, the Cave Castle? No al-Hablis to be found...|date=January 2016}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which controlled the lands of [[Gilead]] beyond the Jordan. Also in 1157, on the death of patriarch Fulcher, Melisende, her sister Ioveta the Abbess of Bethany, and [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla of Flanders]] had Amalric of Nesle appointed as patriarch of Jerusalem. Additionally, Melisende was witness to her son Amalric's marriage to [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. In 1160, she gave her assent to a grant made by her son Amalric to the Holy Sepulchre, perhaps on the occasion of the birth of her granddaughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]] to Agnes and Amalric.

[[File:Mary's tomb,Melisende IMG 0251c.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Saints Joachim and Anne, originally the tomb of Queen Melisende of Jerusalem]]
In 1161, Melisende had what appears to have been a stroke. Her memory was severely impaired and she could no longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on 11 September 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the [[Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat|shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat]]. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox [[Mar Saba|monastery of Saint Sabbas]].

William of Tyre, writing on Melisende's 30-year reign, wrote that &quot;she was a very wise woman, fully experienced in almost all affairs of state business, who completely triumphed over the handicap of her sex so that she could take charge of important affairs&quot;, and that, &quot;striving to emulate the glory of the best princes, Melisende ruled the kingdom with such ability that she was rightly considered to have equalled her predecessors in that regard&quot;. Professor Bernard Hamilton of the University of Nottingham has written that, while William of Tyre's comments may seem rather patronizing to modern readers, they amount to a great show of respect from a society and culture in which women were regarded as having fewer rights and less authority than their brothers, their fathers or even their sons.

'''Brave Combo''' is a [[polka]]/[[rock music|rock]]/[[worldbeat]] band based in [[Denton, Texas]].  Founded in 1979 by [[guitarist]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]ist/[[accordion]]ist [[Carl Finch]], they have been a prominent fixture in the [[Texas]] music scene for more than thirty-five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfw140618&quot;/&gt; Their music, both originals and covers, incorporates a number of [[dance (music)|dance style]]s, mostly polka, but also some [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] styles like [[Norteño (music)|norteño]], [[salsa (music)|salsa]], [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]], [[choro]], [[samba (music)|samba]], [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]], [[cumbia]], [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]], [[merengue (music)|merengue]], [[ska]], etc.

As part of their perceived artistic mission to expand the musical tastes of their listeners, they have often played and recorded covers of well-known songs in a style radically different from the original versions.  Examples include polka versions of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s &quot;[[Purple Haze]]&quot; and [[The Doors]]' &quot;People are Strange&quot;, [[The Rolling Stones]]' &quot;[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]&quot; as a cha-cha, and &quot;[[Sixteen Tons]]&quot; as a cumbia.  While their records may have a sense of humor, they are played straight and not usually considered joke or [[novelty record]]s.

==History and influences==
In a 1995 feature in ''[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]'', band cofounder [[Carl Finch]] described Brave Combo's influence as a polka band with rock styles as an earnest way to escape an increasingly corporate cultural landscape, lamenting-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/583928886/|url-access=subscription|date=September 8, 1995|location=Santa Fe, N.M.|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|title=Brave Combo's polkas are 90 percent serious; It's 'a beat, a dancing drug'|last=Prince|first=David|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Rock had been removed from the common people' he said 'and musically I wanted what I do to have depth, I started listening to polka and ethnic records I'd find at Target six for $5 — nothing could beat that. At first I’d just buy whatever covers looked strangest but after a while I’d do research and find out what was good.' Among the best he soon discovered were names like [[Larry Chesky]] and his big band polka sound, Norwegian accordian virtuoso Andrew Walter (“exciting intense” is Finch’s assessment), and [[Eddie Blazonczyk]], the “Godfather” of Chicago’s Polish community. 'All this came out of a sense of desperation'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Awards and honors==
They won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1999 in the [[Grammy Award for Best Polka Album|Best Polka Album]] category for their album ''[[Polkasonic]]'', and again in 2004 for their album ''[[Let's Kiss: 25th Anniversary Album|Let's Kiss]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;drc2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grammy&quot;/&gt;

In naming Denton, Texas, the &quot;Best Music Scene&quot; for 2008, [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]] cited Brave Combo as the &quot;Grand Pooh-Bah of Denton bands&quot; and said that &quot;Brave Combo, is in many ways the template from which all the rest are cut: eclectic and artistically ambitious, with a high degree of musicianship and a strong DIY ethic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Paste |title=Signs of Life 2008: Best Music Scene - Denton, Texas |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/11/signs-of-life-2008-best-music-scene---denton-texas.html |date=November 21, 2008 |first=Dave |last=Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it incorporated, the colonial governor assigned the town the name &quot;Amherst&quot; after [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]]. Many a colonial governor at the time scattered his name during the influx of new town applications, which is why several towns in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] bear the name. Amherst was Commander-in-Chief of the forces of North America during the [[French and Indian War]] who, according to popular legend, singlehandedly won Canada for the British and banished France from North America. Popular belief has it that he supported the American side in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and resigned his commission rather than fight for the British. Baron Amherst actually remained in the service of the Crown during the war—albeit in Great Britain rather than North America—where he organized the defense against the proposed Franco-Spanish [[Armada of 1779]]. Nonetheless, his previous service in the French and Indian War meant he remained popular in New England. Amherst is also infamous for recommending, in a letter to a subordinate, the use of [[smallpox]]-covered blankets in warfare against the Native Americans along with any &quot;other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Peter |last=d'Errico |title=Jeffrey Amherst and Smallpox Blankets |publisher=Peter d'Errico's Law Page |url=http://people.umass.edu/derrico/amherst/lord_jeff.html |access-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there have been occasional ad hoc movements to rename the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Merzbach |title=Belchertown man wants Amherst's town name banished|url=https://www.gazettenet.com/Belchertown-man-suggests-Amherst-change-its-offensive-name-11947746 |newspaper=[[Daily Hampshire Gazette]] |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested new names have included &quot;Emily&quot;, after Emily Dickinson.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Geography and climate==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Amherst has a total area of {{convert|71.8|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|71.5|sqkm|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 0.48%, are water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt; The town is bordered by [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] to the west, [[Sunderland, Massachusetts|Sunderland]] and [[Leverett, Massachusetts|Leverett]] to the north, [[Shutesbury, Massachusetts|Shutesbury]], [[Pelham, Massachusetts|Pelham]], and [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]] to the east, and [[Granby, Massachusetts|Granby]] and [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]] to the south. The highest point in the town is on the northern shoulder of [[Mount Norwottuck]] at the southern border of the town; the peak is in Granby but the town's high point is a few yards away and is about {{convert|1100|ft}}. The town is nearly equidistant from both the northern and southern state lines.

Amherst's [[ZIP Code]] of 01002 is the second-lowest number in the continental United States after [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] (not counting codes used for specific government buildings such as the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]).

Amherst has a [[humid continental climate]] that under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] marginally falls into the warm-summer category (''dfb''). It is interchangeable with the hot-summer subtype ''dfa'' with July means hovering around {{convert|71.4|F|C}}. Winters are cold and snowy, albeit daytime temperatures often remain above freezing. Under the 2012 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone system, Amherst (ZIP Code 01002) is in zone 5b;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map]&lt;/ref&gt; however, Amherst closely borders zone 6a, which penetrates into Massachusetts in the Connecticut River Valley, and climate change may be shifting those zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/72DPI/ma.jpg Massachusetts Plant Hardiness Zone Map], USDA.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 37,819 people, 9,259 households, and 4,484 families residing in the town. There were 9,711 housing units. The racial makeup of the town was 76.9% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.4% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.2% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 10.9% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.4% [[Race (United States Census)|some other race]], and 4.1% from two or more races. 7.3% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010 DP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/0600000US2501501325| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (DP-1): Amherst town, Hampshire County, Massachusetts| work=American Factfinder| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=August 7, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213235006/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/SF1DP1/0600000US2501501325| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 9,259 households in the town, 23.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.6% were headed by [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 16.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 51.6% were non-families. Of all households, 27.3% were made up of individuals, and 9.7% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 2.88.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010 DP&quot;/&gt;

In the town, 10.0% of the population were under the age of 18, 55.7% were from 18 to 24, 13.3% were from 25 to 44, 13.6% were from 45 to 64, and 7.4% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.7 males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010 DP&quot;/&gt;

For the period 2011–2015, the estimated median annual income for a household in the town was $48,059, and the median income for a family was $96,005. Male full-time workers had a median income of $64,750 versus $39,278 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $18,905. About 8.7% of families and 34.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 18.2% of those under age 18 and 4.5% of those age 65 or over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP03/0600000US2501501325| title=Selected Economic Characteristics: 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (DP03): Amherst town, Hampshire County, Massachusetts| work=American Factfinder| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=August 7, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213160404/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP03/0600000US2501501325| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the large population living below the poverty line is the large number of students that live in Amherst.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} According to the 2010 5-year American Community Survey estimates, occupied housing units had a median household income of $50,063, which includes both renter and owner-occupied units. More specifically, owner-occupied units had a median income of $100,208, while renter-occupied housing units had a median income of $23,925. Large disparities in income between the two groups could explain the high poverty rate and lower median income, as students are the primary tenants of renter-occupied units within Amherst.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Of residents 25 years old or older, 41.7% have a graduate or professional degree, and only 4.9% did not graduate from high school. The largest industry is education, health, and social services, in which 51.9% of employed persons work.

These statistics given above include some but not all of the large [[student]] population, roughly 30,000 in 2010, many of whom only reside in the town part of the year. Amherst is home to thousands of part-time and full-time residents associated with the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Amherst College]], and [[Hampshire College]].

===History of town government ===
The Town converted from an [[open town meeting]] to a [[representative town meeting]] form in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWV-YAG&quot;&gt;Amherst League of Women Voters, [http://www.lwvamherst.org/sites/default/files/YourAmherstGovernment-reduced.pdf &quot;Your Amherst Government&quot;] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Amherst voters passed the &quot;Town Manager Act&quot;, which established the office of a town manager and reduced a number of elected positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWV-YAG&quot; /&gt; In 1995, a charter commission was approved to study Amherst's government; the charter majority recommended a seven-person Council and a mayor, while also maintaining a reduced size representative Town Meeting (150).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votenooncharter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1996-Charter-Commission-Report.pdf 1996 Charter Commission Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802200348/http://www.votenooncharter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1996-Charter-Commission-Report.pdf |date=2018-08-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal failed in two successive votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWV-YAG&quot; /&gt;

In 2001, the [[League of Women Voters]] Amherst made a number of recommendations that were adopted in 2001 in the form of a revised &quot;Amherst Town Government Act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwvamherst.org/sites/default/files/75thProgramBook.pdf League of Women Voters of Amherst 75th Anniversary Program&quot;], p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; An effort shortly thereafter to amend the charter to eliminate the town meeting, and establish an elected mayor and a nine-member Town Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votenooncharter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2002-Charter-Commission-Report.pdf|title=2002 Charter Commission Report|publisher=votenooncharter.org|access-date=2018-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802200356/http://www.votenooncharter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2002-Charter-Commission-Report.pdf|archive-date=2018-08-02|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected by voters twice, first in spring 2003 by fourteen votes and again on March 29, 2005 by 252 votes.

In 2016, a charter commission was approved to study Amherst's government. A majority of commissioners proposed a charter that would establish a 13-member council with no mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Amherst League of Women Voters, [http://www.lwvamherst.org/sites/default/files/LWV_final_version.pdf &quot;League of Women Voters Offers Evaluative Criteria&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amherst Charter Commission, [https://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/41986 &quot;Final Report and Home Rule Charter&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was voted on the March 27, 2018 local ballot,&lt;ref&gt;Amherst, Massachusetts, town website, [https://www.amherstma.gov/2248/Charter-Commission &quot;Charter Commission&quot;] (last visited March 4, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed by over 1,000 votes, a 58% majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gazettenet.com/Amherst-residents-decide-fate-of-charter-proposal-16453548 &quot;Amherst voters approve charter change in historic election&quot;], ''[[Daily Hampshire Gazette]]'' (last visited August 18, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The new town council was sworn in on December 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amherstma.gov/Calendar.aspx?EID=15612 |title=Amherst Town Council Inauguration Celebration |access-date=April 25, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

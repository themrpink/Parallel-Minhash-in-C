The portion of the printer that contains the pin is called the print head.&lt;ref name=Flash.336&gt;{{cite web |title=A+ Chapter 11 Flashcards |url=https://quizlet.com/158354336/a-chapter-11-flash-cards }}&lt;/ref&gt; When running the printer, it generally prints one line of text at a time. The printer head is attached to a metal bar that ensures correct alignment, but horizontal positioning is controlled by a band that attaches to [[sprocket]]s on two wheels at each side which is then driven with an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MX-70 - User Manual |website=epson.com |url=https://files.support.epson.com/pdf/mx70__/mx70__u1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This band may be made of stainless steel, phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloys, nylon or various synthetic materials with a twisted nylon core to prevent stretching.  Actual position can be found out either by dead count using a [[stepper motor]], [[Incremental encoder|rotary encoder]] attached to one wheel or a transparent plastic band with markings that is read by an optical sensor on the printer head (common on [[Inkjet printing|inkjet]]s).

Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, dot matrix printers can create [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-impact-printer-4946840-1.html | title = impact printer |website=AllBusiness.com (Barrons) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nearly all [[inkjet printer|inkjet]], [[thermal printer|thermal]], and [[laser printer]]s also print closely spaced dots rather than continuous lines or characters, it is not customary to call them [[dot matrix printers]].&lt;ref name=Ink.NotDot&gt;{{cite web|title=Dot Matrix vs. Inkjet |website=YourBusiness.AZcentral.com|url=https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/dot-matrix-vs-inkjet-2827.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dot matrix printers have one of the lowest printing costs per page.

They are able to use fanfold [[continuous paper]] with tractor holes.

Dot matrix printers create noise when the pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoX6-5&quot;/&gt; and sound-damping enclosures may have to be used in quiet environments.

They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers.

The common ''serial dot matrix printers'' use a horizontally moving print head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Rules You Should Know To Keep Your Dot Matrix Printer Operational | url = http://www.midcomdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10_Rules_You_Should_Know_To_Keep_Your_Dot_Matrix_Printer_Operational.pdf |website=MicomData.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The print head can be thought of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dot Matrix printers  |website=MindMachine.co.uk |url=https://mindmachine.co.uk/book/print_06_dotmatrix.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally. The printing speed of serial dot matrix printers with moving heads varies from 30&lt;ref&gt;DEC LA30&lt;/ref&gt; to 1550 [[Printing speed|cps]].&lt;ref&gt;Epson DFX-9000 https://www.epson.de/products/printers/dot-matrix-printers/epson-dfx-9000#specifications {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505034554/http://www.epson.de/products/printers/dot-matrix-printers/epson-dfx-9000#specifications |date=2016-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a considerably different configuration, so called ''line dot matrix printers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dot Matrix Printing is defined here as a labelling term |url=https://www.labelplanet.co.uk/glossary-of-label-terms/dot-matrix-printing.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; use a fixed print head almost as wide as the paper path utilizing a horizontal line of thousands of pins for printing. Sometimes two horizontally slightly displaced rows are used to improve the effective dot density through interleaving. While still line-oriented, these printers for the professional heavy-duty market effectively print a whole line at once while the paper moves forward below the print head. Line matrix printers are capable of printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour.

A variation on the dot matrix printer was the ''cross hammer dot printer'', patented by Seikosha in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US4462705 ''Patent US4462705 Cross hammer dot printer''], Google Patents, accessed 2013-10-01&lt;/ref&gt; The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer was replaced by a spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.

A '''funicular''' ({{IPAc-en|f|juː|ˈ|n|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|f|(|j|)|ᵿ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|f|ə|-}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/75566 |title=funicular, adj. and n. |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url-access=subscription |accessdate=30 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a transportation system that uses cable-driven cars to connect points along a steep [[grade (slope)|incline]]. By definition, a funicular uses two counterbalanced passenger cars attached to opposite ends of the same cable, which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of a track.&lt;ref name=Giessbach&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Who%20We%20Are/Engineering%20History/Landmarks/259-Bro-Standseilbahn.pdf |title=The Giessbach Funicular with the World's First Abt Switch |edition= |date=2015 |publisher=The [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]|place=|isbn= |page=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TCQSM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24766/chapter/1 |title=Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A funicular's two cars move in concert: as one ascends, the other descends simultaneously, an arrangement that distinguishes a funicular from other cable-guided transportation systems—e.g., a single-car [[inclined elevator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giessbach&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TCQSM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyrgidis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=e5ymCwAAQBAJ}} |title=Railway Transportation Systems: Design, Construction and Operation |last=Pyrgidis |first=Christos N. |date=2016-01-04 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4822-6215-5 |pages=251–260 |chapter=Cable railway systems for steep gradients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''funicular'' derives from the [[Latin]] word {{wikt-lang|la|funiculus}}, the diminutive of {{wikt-lang|la|funis}}, meaning 'rope'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/funicular |title=funicular |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=3 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
[[File:Entrainement.jpg|thumb|left|Engine-room of a funicular]]

In a funicular both cars (or trains)  are permanently connected to the opposite ends of the same cable, known as a ''haul rope''. 
At the engine room at the upper end of the track, the haul rope runs through a system of [[pulley]]s. 
Sheaves—unpowered pulleys allowing the cable to change direction—guide the cable along the track and to and from the drive pulley. The rope pulls one car upwards while the other car descends the slope at the other end of the rope. Except for the weight of passengers, the weight of the two cars is counterbalanced, so the engine only has to lift the excess passengers and supply the energy lost to friction.&lt;ref name=Giessbach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofmann /&gt;

Typically in a modern funicular the propulsion is provided by an electric motor which is linked
via a speed-reducing gearbox to a large pulley – a ''drive [[bullwheel]]''. 
The bullwheel in its turn transfers its torque to the haul rope by friction. 
The bullwheel has two grooves: after the first half turn around it
the cable returns back via an auxiliary pulley. This arrangement has the advantage of having twice the contact area between the cable and the groove, and returning the downward-moving cable in the same plane as the upward-moving one.  Modern installations also use high friction liners to enhance the friction between the bullwheel grooves and the cable.&lt;ref name=Hofmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stoos /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neumann &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Edward S.  |title=Cable-Propelled People Movers in Urban Environments |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/trr/1992/1349/1349-017.pdf |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=1349 |pages=125–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For emergency and service purposes two sets of brakes are used at the engine room: the emergency brake grips directly the bullwheel, the service brake is mounted at the high speed shaft of the gear. In a case of emergency the cars are also equipped with spring-applied, hydraulically opened rail brakes.&lt;ref name=Neumann /&gt; 

First funicular's caliper brakes which clamp each side of the crown of the rail were invented by the Swiss entrepreneurs [[Franz Josef Bucher]] and Josef Durrer and implemented at the {{ill|Stanserhorn funicular|de|Stanserhorn-Bahn}}, opened in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Christoph |title=Das kleine Buch vom Stanserhorn |date=2005 |publisher=Christoph Berger, Stans |location=Erstausgabe |isbn=3-907164-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cuonz |first1=Romano |title=Franz Josef Bucher und Josef Durrer – Hotelkönig / Bergbahnpionier |date=2015 |publisher=Brunner Medien AG |isbn=978-3037270639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abt [[Rack and pinion railway#Abt_(1882)|rack and pinion system]] was also used at some funiculars for speed control or emergency braking.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofmann &gt;{{cite web |last1=Hofmann |first1=Gottfried |title=Advanced funicular technology |url=https://mountainscholar.org/handle/11124/70549 |publisher=International Organization for the Study of Transportation by Rope; Internationaler Seilbahnkongress |location=San Francisco, Calif. |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Track layout ===
[[File:Funicular layouts.svg|thumb|left|Track layouts used in funiculars]]
[[File:Muzeum MHD, dvoukolí vozu petřínské lanovky 1891.jpg|thumb|Funicular wheelset with Abt rack and pinion brake]]
Early funiculars used two parallel straight tracks, four rails, with separate station platforms at both ends for each vehicle. The tracks are laid with sufficient space between them for the two cars to pass at the midpoint. In any funicular design, the cars always pass at the same location every trip. A three-rail arrangement also has two platforms at each end, but allows lower track cost while allowing the cars to pass at the half-way point.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;
Examples of this type of track layout are the [[Duquesne Incline]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and most cliff railways in the UK.

In layouts using three rails, the middle rail is shared by both cars, like in the early version of the [[Petřín funicular#History|Petřín funicular]] in [[Prague]]. A two-rail layout is the narrowest of all and needs only a single platform at each end, but the required passing section is more complex and costly to build. If a rack for braking is used, that rack can be mounted higher in a three-rail layout, making it less sensitive to choking in snowy conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hefti&quot; /&gt;

Some four-rail funiculars have the upper and lower sections interlaced, with a single platform at each station. The Hill Train at [[Legoland, Windsor]], is an example of this configuration.

The track layout can also be changed during the renovation of a funicular, and often four-rail layouts have been rebuilt as two- or three-rail layouts; e.g., the [[Wellington Cable Car]] in New Zealand was rebuilt with two rails.

[[File:Heidelberg funicular wheelset.jpg|thumb|Wheelset of a two-rail funicular]]
The Swiss engineer [[Carl Roman Abt]] invented the method that allows cars to be used with a two-rail configuration.
The cars, in this case, have their [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]] of a rather unconventional design:
the outboard wheel has [[flange]]s on both sides whereas the inboard wheel is unflanged.

One car has its dual-flanged wheels on the left side, so it follows the leftmost rail; the other car has it on the right side, and it follows the rightmost rail. Thus the ''left'' car always goes through the left branch of the [[passing loop]] and the ''right'' car through its right branch.
The car's unflanged wheels are considerably wider than their opposites, allowing them to roll over the turnouts easily from one rail to another and above the cables.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;

This system has no moving parts for switches and crossings, and compared with the other options it has proven to be quite reliable and cost-effective.
It was first implemented by Abt in 1886 on the [[Lugano Città–Stazione funicular]] ([[Switzerland]]).&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;
Since then the two-rail system with the Abt turnout have increased in popularity, so as to become a standard for modern funiculars.&lt;ref name=Stoos &gt;{{cite web |title=Ceremonial inauguration of the new Stoos funicular |url=https://newsroom.doppelmayr.com/download/file/5051/ |publisher=Garaventa AG |date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water counterbalancing ===
[[File:Fribourg funicular.jpg|thumb|Fribourg funicular featuring the Abt switch runs on waste water]]
{{for|a list of water-powered funiculars|Category:Water-powered funicular railways}}

A few funiculars have been built using water tanks under the floor of each car that are filled or emptied until just sufficient imbalance is achieved to allow movement. The car at the top of the hill is loaded with water until it is heavier than the car at the bottom, causing it to descend the hill and pull up the other car. The water is drained at the bottom, and the process repeats with the cars exchanging roles. The movement is controlled by a [[brakeman]] using the brake handle of the rack and pinion system engaged with the rack mounted between the rails.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofmann /&gt;

The [[Bom Jesus funicular]] built in 1882 near [[Braga]], [[Portugal]] is one of the extant systems of this type. Another example, the {{ill|funicular Neuveville - St-Pierre|fr|Funiculaire de Fribourg}} in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tpf.ch/funiculaire |title=Funiculaire Neuveville - St-Pierre |publisher=Transports publics fribourgeois Holding (TPF) SA}}&lt;/ref&gt; is of particular interest as it utilizes waste water, coming from a sewage plant at the upper part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Mimi|title=A Lasting Stink: Fribourg's Sewage-Powered Funicular|url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/06/a-lasting-stink-fribourgs-sewage-powered-funicular/487346/|accessdate=19 June 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some funiculars of this type were later converted to electrical power. For example, the [[Giessbachbahn]] in the Swiss [[canton of Berne]], opened in 1879, was originally powered by water ballast. In 1912 its energy provision was replaced by a hydraulic engine powered by a [[Pelton turbine]]. In 1948 this in turn was replaced by an electric motor.&lt;ref name=Giessbach /&gt;

=== Bottom towrope ===
[[File:Cable lest.jpg|thumb|left|Bottom towrope]]
The cars can be attached to a second cable running through a pulley at the bottom of the incline in case the gravity force acting on the vehicles is too low to operate them on the slope. One of the pulleys must be designed as a tensioning wheel to avoid slack in the ropes. In this case, the winching can also be done at the lower end of the incline. This practice is used for funiculars with slopes below 6%, funiculars using sledges instead of cars, or any other case where it is not ensured that the descending car is always able to pull out the cable from the pulley in the station on the top of the incline.&lt;ref name=&quot;hefti&quot;&gt;Walter Hefti: ''Schienenseilbahnen in aller Welt. Schiefe Seilebenen, Standseilbahnen, Kabelbahnen.'' Birkhäuser, Basel 1975, {{ISBN|3-7643-0726-9}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reason for a bottom cable is that the cable supporting the lower car at the extent of its travel will potentially weigh several tons, whereas that supporting the upper car weighs virtually nothing.  The lower cable adds an equal amount of cable weight to the upper car while deducting the same weight from the lower, thereby keeping the cars in equilibrium.

== History ==
[[File:Tünel Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Tünel in Istanbul, launched in 1875, Karaköy station as of 2006]]

A number of [[cable railway]] systems which pull their cars on inclined slopes were built since the 1820s. 
In the second half of the 19th century the design of a funicular as a transit system emerged. 
It was especially attractive in comparison with the other systems of the time as counterbalancing of the cars was deemed to be a cost-cutting solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giessbach&quot; /&gt;

The first line of the [[Funiculars of Lyon]] ({{lang|fr|Funiculaires de Lyon}}) opened in 1862, followed by other lines in 1878, 1891 and 1900. The [[Budapest Castle Hill Funicular]] was built in 1868–69, with the first test run on 23 October 1869. 
The oldest funicular railway operating in Britain dates from 1875 and is in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/8017535.stm |work=BBC News | title=Blunder traps eight on cliff lift | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Istanbul, Turkey, the [[Tünel]] has been in continuous operation since 1875 and is both the first underground funicular and the second-oldest underground railway. 
It remained powered by a steam engine up until it was taken for renovation in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tunel.iett.istanbul/tr/tunel/pages/tunel-kronolojisi/566 |title=Tünel Kronolojisi |trans-title=Tünel Chronology  |publisher=İETT - Tunnel |language=Turkish |access-date=2017-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until the end of the 1870s, the four-rail parallel-track funicular was the normal configuration. [[Carl Roman Abt]] developed the Abt Switch allowing the two-rail layout, which was used for the first time in 1879 when the [[Giessbach Funicular]] opened in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hefti&quot; /&gt;

In the United States, the first funicular to use a two-rail layout was the [[Telegraph Hill Railroad]] in San Francisco, which was in operation from 1884 until 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telegraph Hill Railroad|url=http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccsf.html#thrr|date=1 July 2009|work=The Cable Car Home Page – Cable Car Lines in San Francisco|publisher=Joe Thompson|accessdate=20 September 2009|quote=The Telegraph Hill Railroad was not a cable car line ...; it was a funicular railway}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mount Lowe Railway]] in Altadena, California, was the first [[mountain railway]] in the United States to use the three-rail layout. Three- and two-rail layouts considerably reduced the space required for building a funicular, reducing grading costs on mountain slopes and property costs for urban funiculars. These layouts enabled a funicular boom in the latter half of the 19th century.

In 1880 the funicular of [[Mount Vesuvius]] inspired the Italian popular song ''[[Funiculì, Funiculà]]''. This funicular was destroyed repeatedly by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Paul |title=Thomas Cook &amp; Son's Vesuvius Railway |journal=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review |date=March 1998 |url=http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr15/pdf/f10_smi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclined elevator ==
[[File:Одесский фуникулёр (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Odessa Funicular]] in Ukraine is not a funicular proper]]
{{main|Inclined elevator}}
An inclined elevator is not a funicular, since its cars operate independently on the slope, not in interconnected pairs.&lt;ref name=TCQSM /&gt;

Notably, [[Paris]]' [[Montmartre Funicular]] is today a funicular in name only. Its formal title is a relic of its earlier configuration, namely when its two cars originally operated in a counterbalanced, interconnected pair, always moving in opposite directions in concert, thus meeting the definition of a funicular. The system now uses two independently operating cars that can each ascend or descend on demand, qualifying as a double [[inclined elevator]], but retaining the term &quot;funicular&quot; in its title as a historical, albeit misleading, reference.&lt;ref name=MiniMetro&gt;{{cite web |title=MiniMetro |url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pages/MiniMetro-en.pdf |publisher=LEITNER ropeways}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7Line&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/7Line-Inclined-Elevators.pdf|title=7 Line Extension Inclined Elevators|date=April 28, 2014 |website=[[MTA Capital Construction]] |accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyrgidis&quot;/&gt;

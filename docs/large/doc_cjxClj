A postwar review of inadequate housing led to the clearance and redevelopment of areas of the city in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of [[Combe Down]], [[Twerton]] and [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it [[council house|council housing]]. In 1965 town planner [[Colin Buchanan (town planner)|Professor Colin Buchanan]] published ''Bath: A Planning and Transport Study'', which to a large degree sought to better accommodate the motor car, including the idea of a traffic tunnel underneath the centre of Bath. Though criticised by conservationists, some parts of the plan were implemented.

In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;BANES-history&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bath City-Wide Character Appraisal |chapter=Cultural and historical development of Bath |date=31 August 2005 |publisher=Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council |chapter-url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spds/bath-ci |accessdate=2 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427084454/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spds/bath-ci |archive-date=27 April 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brutalbath&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumofbatharchitecture.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brutal-Bath-trail-leaflet.pdf |title=Brutal Bath |publisher=Museum of Bath Architecture |year=2014 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130202159/http://museumofbatharchitecture.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brutal-Bath-trail-leaflet.pdf |archive-date=30 November 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the city was selected by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]], recognising its international cultural significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;BANES-whs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is Bath a World Heritage Site?|url=http://www.bathworldheritage.org.uk/why-bath-world-heritage-site|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609225133/http://www.bathworldheritage.org.uk/why-bath-world-heritage-site|archive-date=9 June 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Since 1996, the city has a [[unitary authorities in England|single tier of local government]] — [[Bath and North East Somerset Council]].

===Historical development===
Bath had long been an [[ancient borough]], having that status since 878 when it became a royal borough ([[Burghal Hidage|burh]]) of [[Alfred the Great]], and was reformed into a [[municipal borough]] in 1835. It has formed part of the [[Historic counties of England|county]] of Somerset since 878, when ceded to [[Wessex]], having previously been in [[Mercia]] (the River Avon had acted as the border between the two kingdoms since 628).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayorofbath.co.uk/saxon-bath Mayor of Bath] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101202023/http://www.mayorofbath.co.uk/saxon-bath |date=1 November 2015 }} Saxon Bath&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bath was made a [[county borough]] in 1889, independent of the newly created [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] and [[Somerset County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keane |first=Patrick |title=An English County and Education: Somerset, 1889–1902 |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=88 |issue=347 |pages=286–311 |doi=10.1093/ehr/LXXXVIII.CCCXLVII.286 |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bath became part of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] when the [[non-metropolitan county]] was created in 1974, resulting in its abolition as a county borough, and instead became a non-metropolitan district with [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]].

With the abolition of Avon in 1996, the non-metropolitan district and borough were abolished too, and Bath has since been part of the [[unitary authority]] district of [[Bath and North East Somerset]] (B&amp;NES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/493/contents/made |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |accessdate=3 May 2015 |work=HMSO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113203448/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/493/contents/made |archive-date=13 November 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unitary district included also the [[Wansdyke (district)|Wansdyke]] district and therefore includes a wider area than the city (the 'North East Somerset' element) including [[Keynsham]] which is home to many of the council's offices, though the council meets at the [[Guildhall, Bath|Guildhall]] in Bath.

Bath was returned to the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Somerset in 1996, though as B&amp;NES is a unitary authority, it is not part of the area covered by Somerset County Council.

The 793rd mayor, who began her office on 6 June 2020, is Manda Rigby.

===Coat of Arms===
The coat of arms includes a depiction of the [[Bath city walls|city wall]], and two silver strips representing the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and the hot springs. The sword of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and a bear, stand on a bed of [[acorn]]s, a link to [[Bladud]], the subject of the Legend of Bath. The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Arms of The City of Bath | work=The City of Bath | url=http://www.mayorofbath.co.uk/city-arms | accessdate=15 November 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114044117/http://www.mayorofbath.co.uk/city-arms | archive-date=14 January 2012 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mural crown]], indicating a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]], is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bath_Guildhall,_Council_chamber,_toward_chair.jpg |title=File:Bath Guildhall, Council chamber, toward chair.jpg - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2019-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013144206/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bath_Guildhall,_Council_chamber,_toward_chair.jpg |archive-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arms bear the motto &quot;Aqvae Svlis&quot;, the Roman name for Bath in [[Latin]] script; although not on the Arms, the motto &quot;Floreat Bathon&quot; is sometimes used (&quot;may Bath flourish&quot; in Latin).

===Bath City Forum===
Bath and North East Somerset Council has established the Bath City Forum, comprising B&amp;NES councillors representing wards in Bath and up to 13 co-opted members drawn from the communities of the city. The first meeting of the Forum was held on 13 October 2015, at the Guildhall, where the first Chair and vice-chair were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/neighbourhoods-and-community-safety/connecting-communities/bath-city-forum Bath and North East Somerset Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404155403/https://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/neighbourhoods-and-community-safety/connecting-communities/bath-city-forum |date=4 April 2019 }} Bath City Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary elections===
{{See also|Bath (UK Parliament constituency)}}
Bath is one of the oldest extant [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary constituencies]] in the United Kingdom, being in continuous existence since the [[Model Parliament]] of 1295. Before the [[Reform Act 1832]], Bath elected two members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], as an ancient parliamentary borough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html |title=Parliamentary Constituencies in the unreformed House |work=United Kingdom Election Results |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105102205/http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html |archivedate= 5 November 2007 |url-status = dead|accessdate=2 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1832 until 1918 it elected two MPs and then was reduced to one.

Historically the constituency covered only the city of Bath, however it was enlarged into some outlying areas between 1997 and 2010. The constituency since 2010 once again covers exactly the city of Bath (it is co-extensive with the unparished area), and is currently represented by [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Wera Hobhouse]] who beat [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Ben Howlett (politician)|Ben Howlett]] at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] and retained her seat at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election.]] Howlett had replaced the retiring [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Don Foster (politician)|Don Foster]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. Foster's election was a notable result of the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], as [[Chris Patten]], the previous Member (and [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet Minister]]) played a major part, as [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]], in re-electing the government of [[John Major]], but failed to defend his marginal seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bath MP Don Foster says he will not stand at 2015 electionk|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Bath-MP-Don-Foster-says-stand-2015-election/story-20414942-detail/story.html|accessdate=3 May 2015|work=Bath Chronicle|date=9 January 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105830/http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Bath-MP-Don-Foster-says-stand-2015-election/story-20414942-detail/story.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral wards===
The fifteen [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]] of Bath are: [[Bathwick]], [[Combe Down]], [[Kingsmead, Bath|Kingsmead]], Lambridge, [[Lansdown, Bath|Lansdown]], Moorlands, [[Newbridge, Bath|Newbridge]], [[Odd Down]], Oldfield Park, Southdown, [[Twerton]], [[Walcot, Bath|Walcot]], [[Westmoreland, Bath|Westmoreland]], [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] and [[Widcombe, Bath|Widcombe]] &amp; [[Lyncombe, Bath|Lyncombe]]. These wards are co-extensive with the city, except that Newbridge includes also two parishes beyond the city boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ | publisher=Ordnance Survey | title=Election maps&amp;nbsp;– Great Britain | accessdate=2 June 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220103943/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ | archive-date=20 February 2016 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These wards return a total of 28 councillors to [[Bath and North East Somerset Council]]; all except two wards return two councillors (Moorlands and Oldfield Park return one each). The most recent [[2019 Bath and North East Somerset Council election|elections were held on 2 May 2019]] and all wards returned [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] except for Westmoreland which returned [[Independent politician|independents]].

Boundary changes enacted from 2 May 2019 included the abolition of [[Abbey, Bath|Abbey]] ward, the merger of Lyncombe and Widcombe wards, the creation of Moorlands ward, and the replacement of Oldfield with Oldfield Park, as well as considerable changes to boundaries affecting all wards.

The rain percolates through limestone aquifers to a depth of between {{convert|9000|to|14000|ft|-2|abbr=on}} where geothermal energy raises the water's temperature to between 64 and 96&amp;nbsp;°C (approximately 147–205&amp;nbsp;°F). Under pressure, the heated water rises to the surface along fissures and faults in the limestone. Hot water at a temperature of {{convert|46|°C|°F|0}} rises here at the rate of {{convert|1170000|l|impgal|0}} daily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseAction=SM.nav&amp;UUID=F9F320C4-1A95-4C04-AC609094E5B5DFD3 |title=Sacred Spring |accessdate=31 October 2007 |publisher=Roman Baths Museum Web Site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102122621/http://romanbaths.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseAction=SM.nav&amp;UUID=F9F320C4-1A95-4C04-AC609094E5B5DFD3 |archivedate= 2 November 2007 |url-status = dead|df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Pennyquick [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]].

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of south-west England}}
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Bath has a [[temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office | url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/sw | accessdate=3 May 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225164404/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html | archive-date=25 February 2006 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}. Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C|°F|1}}. In winter, mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|or|2|°C|°F|1}} are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In the summer the [[Azores]] high pressure affects the southwest of England bringing fair weather; however, [[Convection|convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt;

In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground, leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt;

=== Green belt ===
{{further|Avon Green Belt}}
Bath is fully enclosed by [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] as a part of a wider environmental and planning policy first designated in the late 1950s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Avon-Green-Belt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath &amp; North East Somerset Green Belt Review – Stage 1 Report April 2013 – Green Belt history and policy origins|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/sitedocuments/Planning-and-Building-Control/Planning-Policy/Evidence-Base/Environment/gbr_stage1_report.pdf|website=bathnes.gov.uk|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918163736/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/sitedocuments/Planning-and-Building-Control/Planning-Policy/Evidence-Base/Environment/gbr_stage1_report.pdf|archive-date=18 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this extends into much of the surrounding district and beyond, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned expansion towards Bristol and [[Bradford-on-Avon]], as well as protecting smaller villages in between.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avon-Green-Belt&quot;/&gt; Suburbs of the city bordering the green belt include [[Batheaston]], [[Bathford]], [[Bathampton]], the University of Bath campus, Ensleigh, [[Twerton]], [[Upper Weston]], [[Odd Down]], and [[Combe Down]].

Parts of the Cotswolds [[AONB]] southern extent overlap the green belt north of the city, with other nearby landscape features and facilities within the green belt including the River Avon, Kennet and Avon Canal, [[Bath Racecourse]], Bath Golf Club, [[Bathampton Down]], Bathampton Meadow Nature Reserve, Bristol and Bath Railway Path, the [[Cotswold Way]], [[Limestone Link]] route, Pennyquick Park, [[Little Solsbury Hill]], and Primrose Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avon-Green-Belt&quot;/&gt;

==Demography==
===District===
[[File:Christadelphian Hall (Bath).JPG|thumb|alt=Rectangular yellow stone building with flat roof and arched doorway.|upright|right|[[Christadelphians|Christadelphian]] Hall, New King Street]]
According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], Bath, together with North East Somerset, which includes areas around Bath as far as the [[Chew Valley]], had a population of 176,015. [[Demography]] shows according to the same statistics, the district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a white background at 94.6%&amp;nbsp;– significantly higher than the national average of 87.17%. Other ethnic groups in the district, in order of population size, are [[multiracial]] at 1.6%, Asian at 2.6% and black at 0.8% (the national averages are 1.98%, 6.92% and 3.01%, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/census_2011_theme_summary_-_equalities_0.pdf |title=Bath and North East Somerset UA 2011 Census |work=National Statistics |access-date=1 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721105952/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/census_2011_theme_summary_-_equalities_0.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is largely [[Christians|Christian]] at 56.5%, with no other religion reaching more than 0.7%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the [[irreligion|non-religious]], at 32.7%, are significantly more prevalent than the national 25.67%. 83.9% of residents rated their health as good or very good, higher than the national level (81.40%). Nationally, 18% of people describe themselves as having a long-term illness; in Bath it is 16.10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;/&gt;

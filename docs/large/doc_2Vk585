In this passage, Pliny the Younger conveys to Tacitus that his uncle was ever the academic, always working. The word ''ibat'' (imperfect, &quot;he used to go&quot;) gives a sense of repeated or customary action. In the subsequent text, he mentions again how most of his uncle's day was spent working, reading, and writing. He notes that Pliny &quot;was indeed a very ready sleeper, sometimes dropping off in the middle of his studies and then waking up again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Epistles, III v&lt;/ref&gt;

A definitive study of the procuratorships of Pliny was compiled by the classical scholar [[Friedrich Münzer]], which was reasserted by [[Ronald Syme]] and became a standard reference point. Münzer hypothesized four procuratorships, of which two are certainly attested and two are probable but not certain. However, two does not satisfy Suetonius' description of a continuous succession.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (1992), p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Plinian scholars present two to four procuratorships, the four comprising (i) Gallia Narbonensis in 70, (ii) Africa in 70–72, (iii) Hispania Tarraconensis in 72–74, and (iv) Gallia Belgica in 74–76.

According to Syme, Pliny may have been &quot;successor to Valerius Paulinus&quot;, procurator of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (southeastern France), early in AD 70. He seems to have a &quot;familiarity with the ''provincia''&quot;, which, however, might otherwise be explained.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1969), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he says&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=III.5 (.4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;In the cultivation of the soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than as a province.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
denoting a general popular familiarity with the region.

[[File:Palmeraie gabès2.jpg|thumb|left|Oasis at [[Gabès]]]]

Pliny certainly  spent some time in [[Africa Province]], most likely as a procurator.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1969), pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other events or features that he saw are the provoking of ''rubetae'', poisonous toads ([[Bufonidae]]), by the [[Psylli]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XXV.76
|quote= I myself have seen the Psylli, in their exhibitions,&lt;!--
--&gt; irritate them by placing them upon flat vessels made red hot,&lt;!--
--&gt; their bite being fatal more instantaneously than the sting even of the asp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt; the buildings made with molded earthen walls, &quot;superior in solidity to any cement;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter=XXXV.48 (14.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the unusual, fertile seaside oasis of [[Gabès]] (then Tacape), Tunisia, currently a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= XVIII.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syme assigns the African procuratorship to AD&amp;nbsp;70-72.

The procuratorship of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] was next. A statement by Pliny the Younger that his uncle was offered 400,000 ''[[sesterce]]s'' for his manuscripts by Larcius Licinius while he (Pliny the Elder) was procurator of Hispania makes it the most certain of the three.&lt;ref name=PYIII.5/&gt; Pliny lists the peoples of &quot;Hither Hispania&quot;, including population statistics and civic rights (modern [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]]). He stops short of mentioning them all for fear of &quot;wearying the reader&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Natural History |chapter= III.4 (.3) Of Nearer Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this is the only geographic region for which he gives this information, Syme hypothesizes that Pliny contributed to the census of Hither Hispania conducted in 73/74 by Vibius Crispus, legate from the Emperor, thus dating Pliny's procuratorship there.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1969), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panorámica de Las Médulas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Las Médulas]], Spain, site of a large Roman mine]]

During his stay in Hispania, he became familiar with the agriculture and especially the gold mines of the north and west of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History | chapter=XXXIII.21 | quote=Asturia, Gallæcia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, yearly, according to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds' weight of gold, the produce of Asturia forming the major part. Indeed, there is no part of the world that for centuries has maintained such a continuous fertility in gold.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; His descriptions of the various methods of mining appear to be [[wikt:eyewitness|eyewitness]] judging by the discussion of [[gold mining]] methods in his ''Natural History.'' He might have visited the mine excavated at [[Las Médulas]].

[[File:Trier Porta Nigra BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Porta Nigra]] Roman gate, [[Trier]], Germany]]

The last position of procurator, an uncertain one, was of [[Gallia Belgica]], based on Pliny's familiarity with it. The capital of the province was Augusta Treverorum ([[History of Trier|Trier]]), named for the [[Treveri]] surrounding it. Pliny says that in &quot;the year but one before this&quot; a severe winter killed the first crops planted by the Treviri; they sowed again in March and had &quot;a most abundant harvest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History|chapter=XVIII.49 (.19)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is to identify &quot;this&quot;, the year in which the passage was written. Using 77 as the date of composition Syme&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1969), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; arrives at AD 74-75 as the date of the procuratorship, when Pliny is presumed to have witnessed these events. The argument is based entirely on presumptions; nevertheless, this date is required to achieve Suetonius' continuity of procuratorships, if the one in Gallia Belgica occurred.

Pliny was allowed home (Rome) at some time in AD 75–76. He was presumably at home for the first official release of ''Natural History'' in 77. Whether he was in Rome for the dedication of Vespasian's Temple of Peace in the Forum in 75, which was in essence a museum for display of art works plundered by Nero and formerly adorning the Domus Aurea, is uncertain, as is his possible command of the ''vigiles'' (night watchmen), a lesser post. No actual post is discernible for this period. On the bare circumstances, he was an official agent of the emperor in a quasiprivate capacity. Perhaps he was between posts. In any case, his appointment as prefect of the fleet at Misenum took him there, where he resided with his sister and nephew. Vespasian died of disease on June 23, 79. Pliny outlived him by two months.

===Noted author===
During Nero's reign of terror, Pliny avoided working on any writing that would attract attention to himself. His works on oratory in the last years of Nero's reign (67, 68) focused on form rather than on content. He began working on content again probably after Vespasian's rule began in AD 69, when  the terror clearly was over and would not be resumed. It was to some degree reinstituted (and later cancelled by his son Titus) when Vespasian suppressed the philosophers at Rome, but not Pliny, who was not among them, representing, as he says, something new in Rome, an encyclopedist (certainly, a venerable tradition outside Italy).

In his next work, he &quot;completed the history which [[Aufidius Bassus]] left unfinished, and... added to it thirty books.&quot;&lt;ref name=PYIII.5/&gt; Aufidius Bassus was a ''cause célèbre'' according to [[Seneca the Younger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Moral Letters|chapter=30|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=179 |title=Ambitiosa mors: suicide and self in Roman thought and literature|first=Timothy |last=Hill|publisher= Routledge|year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-415-97097-6 |series=Studies in Classics Volume 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a man much admired at Rome. He had begun his history with some unknown date, certainly before the death of Cicero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seneca the Elder|title=Suasoriae|chapter=6.18.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; so probably the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] or the death of [[Julius Caesar]], ending with the reign of [[Tiberius]]. It was cut short when Bassus died slowly of a lingering disease, with such spirit and objectivity that Seneca remarked that Bassus seemed to treat it as someone else's dying.

Pliny's continuation of Bassus's ''History'' was one of the authorities followed by [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Tacitus also cites Pliny as a source. He is mentioned concerning the loyalty of [[Burrus]], commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], whom [[Nero]] removed for disloyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=13.20|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&amp;layout=&amp;loc=13.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus portrays parts of Pliny's view of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to kill Nero and make Piso emperor as &quot;absurd&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=The Annals|chapter=15.53|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions that he could not decide whether Pliny's account or that of [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus (consul 58)|Messalla]] was more accurate concerning some of the details of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tacitus |title=The Histories|chapter=3.29 |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/tacitus/TacitusHistory03.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently Pliny's extension of Bassus extended at least from the reign of Nero to that of Vespasian. Pliny seems to have known it was going to be controversial, as he deliberately reserved it for publication after his death:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It has been long completed and its accuracy confirmed; but I have determined to commit the charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected, during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by ambition. By this means I confer an obligation on those who occupy the same ground with myself; and also on posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I have done with my predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pliny | title=Natural History | url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistory08plinuoft | chapter=Preface, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Natural History''==
{{Main|Natural History (Pliny)}}
Pliny's last work, according to his nephew, was the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' (literally &quot;Natural History&quot;), an [[encyclopedia]] into which he collected much of the knowledge of his time.&lt;ref name=PYIII.5/&gt; It comprised 37 books. His sources were personal experience, his own prior works (such as the work on [[Germania]]), and extracts from other works. These extracts were collected in the following manner: One servant would read aloud, and another would write the extract as dictated by Pliny. He is said to have dictated extracts while taking a bath. In winter, he furnished the copier with gloves and long sleeves so his writing hand would not stiffen with cold (Pliny the Younger in ''avunculus meus''). His extract collection finally reached about 160 volumes, which Larcius Licinius, the [[legatus|Praetorian legate]] of Hispania Tarraconensis, vainly offered to purchase for 400,000 ''sesterces.''&lt;ref name=PYIII.5/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; That would have been in 73/74 (see above). Pliny bequeathed the extracts to his nephew.

When composition of the'' Natural History'' began is unknown. Since he was preoccupied with his other works under Nero and then had to finish the history of his times, he  is unlikely to have begun before 70. The procuratorships offered the ideal opportunity for an encyclopedic frame of mind. The date of an overall composition cannot be assigned to any one year. The dates of different parts must be determined, if they can, by [[Philology|philological]] analysis (the ''post mortem'' of the scholars).

[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Laocoon and his Sons]]'', a sculpture admired by Pliny]]

The closest known event to a single publication date, that is, when the manuscript was probably released to the public for borrowing and copying, and was probably sent to the Flavians, is the date of the Dedication in the first of the 37 books. It is to the ''[[imperator]]'' Titus. As Titus and Vespasian had the same name, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, earlier writers hypothesized a dedication to Vespasian. Pliny's mention of a brother ([[Domitian]]) and joint offices with a father, calling that father &quot;great&quot;, points certainly to Titus.&lt;ref name=B7&gt;Beagon (2005), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny also says that Titus had been [[Roman consul|consul]] six times. The first six consulships of Titus are in 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, and 77, all conjointly with Vespasian, and the seventh was in 79. This brings the date of the Dedication probably to 77. In that year, Vespasian was 68. He had been ruling conjointly with Titus for some years.&lt;ref name=B7/&gt; The title ''imperator'' does not indicate that Titus was sole emperor, but was awarded for a military victory, in this case that in Jerusalem in 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/roman-emperors/titus.htm|title=Roman Emperors - DIR Titus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from minor finishing touches, the work in 37 books was completed in AD 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=15|year=1977|volume=14|page=572a}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it was written entirely in 77 or that Pliny was finished with it then cannot be proved. Moreover, the dedication could have been written before publication, and it could have been published either privately or publicly earlier without the dedication. The only certain fact is that Pliny did no further work on it after AD 79.

The ''Naturalis Historia'' is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge, based on the best authorities available to Pliny. He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work. It encompasses the fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[mineralogy]], as well as the exploitation of those resources. It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time. His discussions of some technical advances are the only sources for those inventions, such as [[hushing]] in mining technology or the use of [[water mill]]s for crushing or grinding grain. Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by [[archaeology]]. It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time, and is a reference work for the [[history of art]]. As such, Pliny's approach to describing the work of artists was to inform [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] in writing his commentaries and [[Giorgio Vasari]] who wrote the celebrated ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''.

The work became a model for all later encyclopedias in terms of the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published, lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.

==Death==
[[File:Pompeii Garden of the Fugitives 02.jpg|thumb|right|Plaster casts of the casualties from pyroclastic surges, whose remains vanished, leaving cavities in the pumice at [[Pompeii]]]]
Pliny had received from Emperor Vespasian, who had died two months earlier, the appointment of ''[[praefectus]] classis'' ([[Roman navy#High Command|fleet commander]]) in the [[Roman Navy]]. He was stationed at [[Misenum]], at the time of the great [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which destroyed and  buried [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. He was preparing to cross the [[Bay of Naples]] to observe the phenomenon directly when a message  arrived from  his friend [[Rectina]] asking to rescue [[Pomponianus]] and her. Launching the galleys under his command to the evacuation of the opposite shore, he himself took &quot;a fast-sailing cutter&quot;, a decision that may have cost him his life. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, provided an account of his death, obtained from the survivors. The nephew and his mother had decided not to go on the voyage across the bay.

As the light vessel approached the shore near Herculaneum, cinders and pumice began to fall on it. Pliny's helmsman advised turning back, to which Pliny replied, &quot;[[Fortune favours the brave]]; steer to where Pomponianus is.&quot; ([[Stabiae]], near the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]].) They landed and found Pomponianus &quot;in the greatest consternation.&quot; Pliny hugged and comforted him. They could not find Rectina. They loaded the cutter, but the same winds that brought it to Stabiae prevented it from leaving. Pliny reassured his party by feasting, bathing, and sleeping while waiting for the wind to abate, but finally they had to leave the buildings for fear of collapse and try their luck in the pumice fall. Pliny sat down and could not get up even with assistance, and was left behind. His companions theorized that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano. On their return two days later after the plume had dispersed, his body was found under the pumice with no apparent external injuries. The problem with the toxicity theory is that his companions were unaffected by the same fumes, and they had no mobility problems, whereas Pliny had to sit and could not rise. As he is described as a corpulent man,&lt;ref name=PYVI.16&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also suffered from [[asthma]],  his friends are thought to have left him because he was already dead.&lt;ref name=littell&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death of Pliny the Elder|first=Jacob, MD|last=Bigelow|page=123|journal=Littell's Living Age|editor-first=E.|editor-last=Littell|series=Third|volume=V|date=1859|location=Boston|publisher=Littell, Son, and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of his last hours is told in a letter addressed 27 years afterwards to Tacitus by  Pliny the Younger,&lt;ref name=PYVI.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; who also sent to another correspondent, [[Baebius Macer]], an account of his uncle's writings and his manner of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;PYIII.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|last=Sands |first=John Edwin |wstitle=Pliny the Elder|volume=21 |pages=841–844 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragment from Suetonius (see under &quot;External links&quot; below) states a somewhat less flattering view, that Pliny approached the shore only from scientific interest and then asked a slave to kill him to avoid heat from the volcano. It is not as credible a source, as it is clear from the nephew's letter that the persons Pliny came to rescue escaped to tell the tale in detail. Moreover, Suetonius hypothesizes that a party witnessing events so agonizing as to destroy Pliny or cause him to order his own death are suspect as they apparently were subject to none of these fatal events themselves.

In 1859, Jacob Bigelow, M.D., after summarizing the widespread misinformation about Pliny's death, examined the evidence and concluded that Pliny was overweight, in poor health, and died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;Bigelow, Jacob. (1859). ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25057949|On the Death of Pliny the Elder]'', ''Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (1859), pp. 223-227.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] similarly stated that &quot;there is widespread and persisting misinformation&quot; about Pliny's death. He suggested that despite his rescue attempt, Pliny never came within miles of Vesuvius and no evidence has been found that shows he died from breathing in fumes, and like Bigelow, concluded that he died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Zirkle, Conway. (1967). ''The Death of Gaius Plinius Secundus (23-79 A.D.)''. ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' 58: 553-559.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selinunte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|n|uː|n|t|eɪ}}; {{lang-grc|Σελινοῦς}}, ''Selinoūs''; {{lang-la|Selinus}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city on the south-western coast of [[Sicily]] in [[Italy]]. It was situated between the valleys of the Cottone and Modione rivers. It now lies in the ''[[comune]]'' [[Castelvetrano]], between the ''[[frazioni]]'' of Triscina di Selinunte in the west and [[Marinella di Selinunte]] in the east. The archaeological site contains five temples centered on an [[acropolis]]. Of the five temples, only the [[Temple E (Selinus)|Temple of Hera]], also known as &quot;Temple E&quot;, has been re-erected. At its peak before 409&amp;nbsp;BC the city may have contained up to 30,000 people, excluding slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Urban Form Before the Industrial Revolution|author=Morris, A.E.J.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317885146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whBEAgAAQBAJ|page=53|accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Selinos didrachm ANS 685 670331.jpg|thumb|[[Didrachm]] coin from Selinunte bearing a ''selinon'' (celery) leaf, circa 515–470&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

Selinunte was one of the most important of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies in Sicily, situated on the southwest coast of that island, at the mouth of the small river of the same name, and 6.5&amp;nbsp;km west of the Hypsas river (the modern [[Belice River|Belice]]). It was founded, according to the historian [[Thucydides]], by a colony from the Sicilian city of [[Megara Hyblaea]], under the leadership of a man called [[Pammilus]], about 100 years after the foundation of Megara Hyblaea, with the help of colonists from [[Megara]] in Greece, which was Megara Hyblaea's mother city.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4, vii. 57; [[Scymnus]] 292; [[Strabo]] vi. p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of its foundation cannot be precisely fixed, as Thucydides indicates it only by reference to the foundation of Megara Hyblaea, which is itself not accurately known, but it may be placed about 628&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Diodorus]] places it 22 years earlier, or 650&amp;nbsp;BCE, and [[Hieronymus]] still further back in 654&amp;nbsp;BCE. The date from Thucydides, which is probably the most likely, is incompatible with this earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59; Hieronymus ''Chron.'' ad ann. 1362; Clinton, ''Fast. Hell.'' vol. i. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is supposed to have been derived from quantities of wild [[celery]] ({{lang-grc|σέλινον|(selinon)}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon σέλινον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; that grew on the spot. For the same reason, they adopted the celery leaf as the symbol on their coins.

Selinunte was the most westerly of the Greek colonies in Sicily, and for this reason they soon came into contact with the [[Phoenicians]] of western Sicily and the native Sicilians in the west and northwest of the island. The Phoenicians do not at first seem to have conflicted with them; but as early as 580&amp;nbsp;BCE the Selinuntines were engaged in hostilities with the non-Greek [[Elymian]] people of [[Segesta]], whose territory bordered their own.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus v. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A body of emigrants from [[Rhodes]] and [[Cnidus]] who subsequently founded [[Lipara]], supported the Segestans on this occasion, leading to their victory; but disputes and hostilities between the Segestans and Selinuntines seem to have occurred frequently, and it is possible that when Diodorus speaks of the Segestans being at war with the [[Marsala|Lilybaeans]] (modern Marsala) in 454&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;xi. 86. Lilybaeum was only founded in 396 BCE&lt;/ref&gt; that the Selinuntines are the people really meant.

The river [[Mazarus]], which at that time appears to have formed the boundary with Segesta, was only about 25&amp;nbsp;km west of Selinunte; and it is certain that at a somewhat later period the territory of Selinunte extended to its banks, and that that city had a fort and emporium at its mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side Selinunte's territory certainly extended as far as the [[Halycus]] (modern [[Platani (river)|Platani]]), at the mouth of which it founded the colony of [[Heraclea Minoa|Minoa]], or Heracleia, as it was afterward called.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear, therefore, that Selinunte had already achieved great power and prosperity; but very little information survives about its history. Like most of the Sicilian cities, it passed from an [[oligarchy]] to a [[tyranny]], and about 510&amp;nbsp;BCE was subject to a despot named Peithagoras, who was overthrown with the assistance of the [[Sparta]]n Euryleon, one of the companions of [[Dorieus]]. Euryleon himself ruled the city, for a little while, but was speedily overthrown and put to death by the Selinuntines.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Selinuntines supported the Carthaginians during the great expedition of [[Hamilcar]] (480&amp;nbsp;BCE); they even promised to send a contingent to the Carthaginian army, but this did not arrive until after Hamilcar's defeat at the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xi. 21, xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Selinuntines are next mentioned in 466&amp;nbsp;BCE, co-operating with the other cities of Sicily to help the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]] to expel [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xi. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides speaks of Selinunte just before the [[Athens|Athenian]] expedition in 416 BCE as a powerful and wealthy city, possessing great resources for war both by land and sea, and having large stores of wealth accumulated in its temples.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus also represents it at the time of the Carthaginian invasion, as having enjoyed a long period of tranquility, and possessing a numerous population.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls of Selinunte enclosed an area of approximately {{convert|100|ha}}.&lt;ref name=danner /&gt; The population of the city has been estimated at 14,000 to 19,000 people during the fifth century BC.&lt;ref name=zucht /&gt;

===The Sicilian Expedition===
{{main|Sicilian Expedition}}
In 416&amp;nbsp;BCE, a renewal of the earlier disputes between Selinunte and Segesta led to the great Athenian expedition to Sicily. The Selinuntines called on Syracuse for assistance, and were able to blockade the Segestans; but the Segestans appealed to Athens for help.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 6; Diodorus Siculus xii. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians do not appear to have taken any immediate action to save Segesta, but no further conflict around Segesta is recorded. When the Athenian expedition first arrived in Sicily (415&amp;nbsp;BCE), Thucydides presents the general [[Nicias]] as proposing that the Athenians should proceed to Selinunte at once and compel the Selinuntines to surrender on moderate terms;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but this advice was overruled and the expedition sailed against Syracuse instead. As a result, the Selinuntines played only a minor part in the subsequent operations. They are, however, mentioned on several occasions providing troops to the Syracusans; and it was at Selinunte that the large [[Peloponnesia]]n force sent to support [[Gylippus]] landed in the spring of 413&amp;nbsp;BCE, having been driven over to the coast of Africa by a tempest.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vii. 50, 58; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captured by Carthage===
The defeat of the Athenian armament apparently left the Segestans at the mercy of their rivals. They surrendered the frontier district that was the original subject of dispute to Selinunte. The Selinuntines, however, were not satisfied with this concession, and continued their hostility against them, leading the Segestans to seek assistance from Carthage. After some hesitation, Carthage sent a small force, with the assistance of which the Segestans defeated the Selinuntines in a battle.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians in the following spring (409&amp;nbsp;BCE) sent over a vast army containing 100,000 men, according to the lowest ancient estimate, led by [[Hannibal Mago]] (the grandson of Hamilcar that was killed at [[Himera]]). The army landed at Lilybaeum, and directly marched from there to Selinunte. The city's inhabitants had not expected such a force and were wholly unprepared to resist it. The city fortifications were, in many places, in disrepair, and the armed forces promised by Syracuse, Acragas (modern [[Agrigento]]) and [[Gela]], were not ready and did not arrive in time. The Selinuntines fought the Carthaginians on their own and continued to defend their individual houses even after the walls were breached. However, the enemy's overwhelming numbers made resistance hopeless, and after a ten-day siege the city was taken and most of the defenders put to death. According to sources,  16,000 of the citizens of Selinunte were killed, 5,000 were taken prisoner, and 2,600 under the command of [[Empedion]] escaped to Acragas.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59, 114&quot;&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a considerable number of the survivors and fugitives were gathered together by [[Hermocrates]] of Syracuse, and established within the walls of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Hannibal destroyed the city walls, but gave permission to the surviving inhabitants to return and occupy it as tributaries of Carthage. A considerable part of the citizens of Selinunte took up this offer, which was confirmed by the treaty subsequently concluded between [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], tyrant of Syracuse, and the Carthaginians, in 405&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59, 114&quot;/&gt;

===Destruction===
The Selinuntines are again mentioned in 397&amp;nbsp;BCE when they supported Dionysius during his war with Carthage;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiv. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but both the city and territory were again given up to the Carthaginians by the peace of 383&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xv. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dionysius reconquered it shortly before his death,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xv. 73&lt;/ref&gt; it soon returned to Carthaginian control. The Halycus River, which was established as the eastern boundary of the Carthaginian dominion in Sicily by the treaty of 383&amp;nbsp;BCE, seems to have generally continued to have been the border, despite temporary interruptions; and was again fixed as the border by the treaty with [[Agathocles]] in 314&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xix. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This last treaty expressly stipulated that Selinunte, as well as Heracleia and Himera, were subjects of Carthage, as before. In 276&amp;nbsp;BCE, however, during the expedition of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] to Sicily, the Selinuntines voluntarily joined Pyrrhus, after the capture of Heracleia.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xxii. 10. Exc. H. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[First Punic War]], Selinunte was again under Carthaginian control, and its territory was repeatedly the theater of military operations between the Romans and the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xxiii. 1, 21; [[Polybius]] i. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; But before the close of the war (about 250&amp;nbsp;BCE), when the Carthaginians were beginning to pull back, and confine themselves to the defense of as few places as possible, they removed all the inhabitants of Selinunte to Lilybaeum and destroyed the city.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xxiv. 1. Exc. H. p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems certain that it was never rebuilt. [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions its name (''Selinus oppidum''&lt;ref&gt;iii. 8. s. 14&lt;/ref&gt;), as if it still existed as a town in his time, but [[Strabo]] distinctly classes it with extinct cities. [[Ptolemy]], though he mentions the river Selinus, does not mention a town of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Ptolemy iii. 4. § 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thermae Selinuntiae (at modern [[Sciacca]]), which derived their name from the ancient city, and seem to have been much frequented in the time of the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], were situated at a considerable distance, 30&amp;nbsp;km, from Selinunte: they are sulfurous springs, still much valued for their medical properties, and dedicated, like most thermal waters in Sicily, to [[San Calogero]]. At a later period they were called the Aquae Labodes or Larodes, under which name they appear in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonine Itinerary p. 89; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological remains ==
[[File:Selinunte (1).jpg|thumb|right|370px|View of the Acropolis of Selinus from the eastern hill]]
The city is beside the sea, between the Modione River (the ancient Selinus) in the west and the [[Belice|Cottone River]] in the east, on two high areas connected by a saddle. The part of the city to the south, next to the sea, contains the acropolis which is based around two intersecting streets and contains many temples (A, B, [[Temple C (Selinus)|C]], D, O). The part of the city to the north, further inland, contained housing on the [[Hippodamus|Hippodamian plan]] contemporary with the acropolis and two necropoleis (Galera-Bagliazzo and Manuzza). 

Other important remains are found on the high places across the rivers to the east and west of the city. In the east there are three temples ([[Temple E (Selinus)|E]], [[Temple F (Selinus)|F]], [[Temple G (Selinus)|G]]) and a necropolis (Buffa) north of the modern village of Marinella. In the west are the most ancient remains of Selinus: the Sanctuary of the Malophoros and the archaic necropolis (Pipio, Manicalunga, Timpone Nero). The two ports of the city were in the mouths of the city's two rivers.

The modern Archaeological park, which covers about 40 hectares can therefore be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref name= Nota2 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selinunte.net/|title=www.selinunte.net|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Acropolis]] at the centre with temples and fortifications
* Gaggera Hill in the West, with the sanctuary of Malophoros
* Mannuzza Hill in the north with ancient housing
* The East Hill in the east, with other temples
* The [[necropoleis]]

===The Acropolis===
[[File:Selinunte-Akropolis-bjs-2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Acropolis of Selinus: Rear of Temples A and O in the foreground and row of columns of Temple C in the background]]
The acropolis is a chalk massif with a cliff face falling into the sea in the south, while the north end narrows to 140 metres wide. The settlement in the form of a massive trapezoid, extended to the north with a large retaining wall in terraces (about eleven metres high) and was surrounded by a wall (repeatedly restored and modified) with an exterior of squared stone blocks and an interior of rough stone (''[[emplecton]]''). It had five towers and four gates. To the north, the acropolis was fortified by a counter wall and towers from the beginning of the fourth century BC.
At the entrance to the acropolis is the so-called Tower of Pollux, constructed in the sixteenth century to deter the [[Barbary pirates]], atop the remains of an ancient tower or lighthouse.
[[File:Selionte Acropole.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Street on the acropolis]]
The urban plan is divided in quarters by two main streets (9 metres wide), which cross at right angles (the North-South road is 425 metres long, the East-West is 338 metres long). Every 32 metres they are intersected by other minor roads (5 metres wide). This urban systemisation, which followed a more ancient model, dates to the fourth century BC (i.e. to the period of Punic rule).
Multiple altars and little sanctuaries may be attributed to the first years of the colony, which were replaced around fifty years later by large, more permanent temples. The first of these is the so-called ''Megaron'' near Temples B &amp; C.
In front of Temple O there is a Punic sacrificial area from after the conquest of 409&amp;nbsp;BC, consisting of rooms built of dry masonry within which vases containing ashes were deposited along with amphorae of the Carthaginian “torpedo” type.
On the hill of the acropolis are the remains of numerous [[Doric temple]]s.&lt;ref name= Nota2 /&gt;

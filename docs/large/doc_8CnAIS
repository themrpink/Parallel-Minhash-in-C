[[Stax Records]] created a classic 1960s [[soul music]] sound, much grittier and horn-based than [[Motown]]. Booker T. and the M.G.s were the label's backing band for most of the classic hits that came out of Stax, by Sam and Dave, [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and many more. The sound still lives on in the [[The Blues Brothers|''Blues Brothers'' movie]], in which many of the musicians starred as themselves.

Memphis is noted for its influence on the [[power pop]] musical genre in the 1970s. Notable bands and musicians include [[Big Star]], [[Chris Bell (American musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Alex Chilton]], [[Tommy Hoehn]], [[The Scruffs]], and [[Prix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=J.D. |last=Reager |title=''Kill!

===Visual art===
In addition to the [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art|Brooks Museum]] and [[Dixon Gallery and Gardens]], Memphis plays host to two burgeoning visual art areas, one city-sanctioned, and the other organically formed.

The South Main Arts District is an arts neighborhood in south downtown. Over the past 20 years, the area has morphed from a derelict brothel and [[juke joint]] neighborhood to a [[gentrification|gentrified]], well-lit area sponsoring &quot;Trolley Night&quot;, when arts patrons stroll down the street to see fire spinners, DJs playing in front of clubs, specialty shops and galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Kelsey |url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/33410509/boutique-hotel-restaurant-slated-for-south-main |title=Boutique hotel, restaurant slated for South Main - WMC Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee |publisher=WMC Action News 5 |access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/exploring-our-town/south-main-artspace-lofts |title=South Main Artspace Lofts &amp;#124; Exploring Our Town |website=Arts.gov |date=2011-12-13 |access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another developing arts district in Memphis is Broad Avenue. This east–west avenue is undergoing neighborhood revitalization from the influx of craft and visual artists taking up residence and studios in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadavearts.com/ |title=Broad Avenue Arts District |website=Broadavearts.com |access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kontji Anthony |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/the-901/2016/10/11/the-901-the-memphis-renaissance-the-new-generation-your901-our901/91884778/ |title=The 9:01: The Memphis renaissance, the new generation |website=Commercialappeal.com |date=2016-10-11 |access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An art professor from [[Rhodes College]] holds small openings on the first floor of his home for local students and professional artists.

Memphis also has non-commercial visual arts organizations and spaces, including local painter Pinkney Herbert's Marshall Arts gallery, on Marshall Avenue near [[Sun Studios]], another arts neighborhood characterized by affordable rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highgroundnews.com/features/edgearts.100114.aspx|title=The space to create brings art to the Edge|website=Highgroundnews.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Well-known writers from Memphis include [[Shelby Foote]], the noted [[American Civil War|Civil War]] historian. Novelist [[John Grisham]] grew up in nearby [[DeSoto County, Mississippi]], and sets many of his books in Memphis.

Many works of fiction and literature are set in Memphis. These include ''[[The Reivers]]'' by [[William Faulkner]] (1962), ''September, September'' by Shelby Foote (1977); [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]]'s ''The Old Forest and Other Stories'' (1985), and his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Summons to Memphis]]'' (1986); ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Client (novel)|The Client]]'' (1993), both by [[John Grisham]]; ''Memphis Afternoons: a Memoir'' by James Conaway (1993), ''Plague of Dreamers'' by Steve Stern (1997); ''[[Cassina Gambrel Was Missing]]'' by William Watkins (1999); ''The Guardian'' by Beecher Smith (1999), &quot;We are Billion-Year-Old Carbon&quot; by Corey Mesler (2005), ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], and ''The Architect'' by James Williamson (2007).

[[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|The University of Memphis]] [[college basketball]] team, the [[Memphis Tigers]], has a strong following in the city due to a history of competitive success.

==Law and government==
{{Main|Government of Memphis, Tennessee}}
Beginning in 1963, Memphis adopted a mayor-council form of government, with 13 [[City Council]] members, six elected [[at-large]] from throughout the city and seven elected from geographic districts. Following passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], civil rights activists challenged the at-large is electoral system in court because it made it more difficult for the minority to elect candidates of their choice; at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city. In 1995, the city adopted a new plan. The 13 Council positions are elected from nine geographic districts: seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each.

[[Jim Strickland (politician)|Jim Strickland]] is the city's current mayor, elected on October 8, 2015. He is a former Memphis city councilman. The previous mayor of the city of Memphis was [[A C Wharton]].

Since the late 20th century, regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and Memphis into a [[metropolitan government]], as Nashville-Davidson County did in 1963. Consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of Memphis and Shelby County, under the state law for dual-voting on such measures. The referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions. Black leaders, including then-Shelby County Commissioner [[Joe Ford (politician)|Joe Ford]] and national civil rights leader [[Al Sharpton]], opposed the consolidation. According to the plaintiffs' expert, Marcus Pohlmann, these leaders &quot;tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue, suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard-won civil rights victories of the past&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;consvote&quot;/&gt;

In October 2010 before the vote, eight Shelby County citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the Shelby County Elections Commission against the dual-voting requirement. Plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together, rather than as separate elections. City voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor; county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against.&lt;ref name=&quot;dismiss&quot;&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/appellate-court-dismisses-challenge-of-dual-vote-requirement-for-consolidated-government_82638081 Clay Bailey, &quot;Appellate court dismisses challenge of dual vote requirement for consolidated government&quot;], ''Commercial Appeal'', December 31, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The state argued that with the election decided, the lawsuit should be dismissed, but the federal court disagreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;consvote&quot;&gt;[http://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2014/jan/6/consolidation-voting-case-still-complex-in-3rd-year/ Bill Dries, &quot;Consolidation Voting Case Still Complex in 3rd Year&quot;], ''Memphis Daily News'', January 6, 2014, accessed February 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2013, in pre-trial actions, both sides were trying to disqualify the other's experts, in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization, and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting. &quot;The experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;consvote&quot;/&gt;

The defendants' expert, Todd Donovan, did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that &quot;African-American voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration, taxation, service provision and other policy questions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;consvote&quot;/&gt; He noted, &quot;In the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race, there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;consvote&quot;/&gt;

In 2014, the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit, on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions' votes were counted together. (In total voting, 64% of voters opposed the consolidation.) In the last week of December 2014, the U.S. Sixth District Court of Appeals upheld that decision, ruling that, &quot;&quot;In this election, the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual-majority vote requirement (with the vote counts combined).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dismiss&quot;/&gt;

Before the referendum, the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation. As noted below, in 2011 the Memphis city council voted to dissolve its city school board and consolidate with the Shelby County School System, without the collaboration or agreement of Shelby County.&lt;ref name=&quot;school&quot;&gt;[http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf &quot;MAKING A  REGIONAL DISTRICT: MEMPHIS CITY SCHOOLS DISSOLVES INTO ITS SUBURBS&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221194549/http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/47_Anderson.pdf |date=February 21, 2015 }}, ''Columbia Law Review'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The city had authority for this action under Tennessee state laws that differentiate between city and county powers.

[[File:Nurses.gif|thumb|Early nursing class in Memphis]]
The city is served by [[Shelby County Schools (Tennessee)|Shelby County Schools]]. On March 8, 2011, residents voted to dissolve the charter for [[Memphis City Schools]], effectively merging it with the Shelby County School District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillin|first=Zack|title=Memphis voters OK school charter surrender|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/mar/08/memphis-school-charter-approval/|access-date=March 9, 2011|newspaper=The Commercial Appeal|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After issues with state law and court challenges, the merger took effect the start of the 2013–14 school year. In Shelby County, six incorporated cities voted to establish separate school systems in 2013.

The Shelby County School System operates more than 200 elementary, middle, and high schools.

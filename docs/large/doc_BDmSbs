===Identification of remains===
[[File:Yekaterinburg cathedral on the blood 2007.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Yekaterinburg]]'s &quot;[[All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land|Church on the Blood]]&quot;, built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood]]
After the execution of the Romanov family in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra's body, along with Nicholas, their children and some faithful retainers who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt according to the Yurovsky Note. Initially the bodies were thrown down a disused mine-shaft at [[Ganina Yama]], &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;12&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(19&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; north of Yekaterinburg. A short time later, the bodies were retrieved. Their faces were smashed and the bodies, dismembered and disfigured with [[sulphuric acid]], were hurriedly buried under railway sleepers with the exception of two of the children whose bodies were not discovered until 2007. The missing bodies were those of a daughter—Maria or Anastasia—and Alexei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294360,00.html|title=Remains of Tsar Nicholas II's Son May Have Been Found|date=21 August 2009|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=22 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919123811/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294360,00.html|archive-date=19 September 2008|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], the bodies of the majority of the Romanovs were located along with their loyal servants, exhumed and formally identified. A secret report by Yurovsky, which came to light in the late 1970s, but did not become public knowledge until the 1990s, helped the authorities to locate the bodies. Preliminary results of genetic analysis carried out on the remains of a boy and a young woman believed to belong to Nicholas II's son and heir Alexei, and daughter Anastasia or Maria were revealed on 22 January 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;YEKATERINBURG, 22 January 2008 (RIA Novosti)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ekaterinburg region's chief forensic expert said, &quot;Tests conducted in Yekaterinburg and Moscow allowed DNA to be extracted from the bones, which proved positive,&quot; Nikolai Nevolin said. &quot;Once the genetic analysis has been completed in Russia, its results will be compared with test results from foreign experts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Nevolin said the final results would be published in April or May 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Certainty about the remains would definitively put an end to the claim that [[Anna Anderson]] could be connected with the Romanovs, as all remaining bodies would be accounted for.

DNA analysis represented a key means of identifying the bodies. A blood sample from [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] (a grandson of Alexandra's oldest sister, [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]) was employed to identify Alexandra and her daughters through their [[mitochondrial DNA]]. They belonged to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]]. Nicholas was identified using DNA obtained from, among others, his late brother [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia]]. Grand Duke George had died of [[tuberculosis]] in the late 1890s and was buried in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis by Peter Gill, Central Research and Support Establishment, Forensic Science Service, Aldermaston, Reading, Berkshire, RG7 4PN, UK, [[Pavel L.

[[File:Laputa - Grandville.jpg|thumb|right|Gulliver discovers Laputa, the flying island (illustration by [[J. J. Grandville]])]]

'''Laputa''' is a [[flying island]] described in the 1726 book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]]. It is about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, with an [[adamant]]ine base, which its inhabitants can maneuver in any direction using [[magnetic levitation]]. It has a cave in the very centre which is precisely there to gather all the rainwater. It is also used by the king to enforce his [[supremacism|supremacy]].

==Location==
Laputa was located above the realm of [[Balnibarbi]], which was ruled by its king from the flying island.  Gulliver states the island flew by the “magnetic virtue” of  certain minerals in the grounds of Balnibarbi which did not extend to more than {{convert|4|mi|km|round=0.5|abbr=off}} above, and {{convert|6|league|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} beyond the extent of the kingdom,{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 157}} showing the limit of its range.  The position of the island, and the realm below, is some five days' journey south-south-east of Gulliver's last known position, 46N, 183E{{Efn | That is, 177 West.}}{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 143}} (i.e. east of [[Japan]], south of the [[Aleutian Islands]]){{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 319}} down a chain of small rocky islands.{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 143}}

==Description==
The island of Laputa is described as being exactly circular and about {{convert |4+1/2 | mi | km|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, giving an area of roughly {{convert|10000|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.{{Efn |The text actually says &quot;...its Diameter 7837 Yards or about  four Miles and a Half, and consequently contains Ten Thousand Acres&quot; (''Gulliver;'s Travels'' Pt III, Ch III): However, neither of these diameters gives an area of exactly 10,000 acres. It is unclear why Swift chose such exact values for diameter and area, while having them misalign in this way.}} The island was {{convert|300|yard|m|abbr=off}} thick, and comprised a bottom plate of [[adamant]] {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=off}} thick, above which lay &quot;the several minerals in their usual order&quot;, topped with &quot;a coat of rich mould {{convert|10|or|12|ft|m|1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} deep&quot;. {{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 154}}

In shape the upper surface sloped down from circumference to centre, causing all rain to form rivulets into the centre where four large basins {{convert|1/2|mi|m|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} in circuit lie {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=off}} from the absolute centre. {{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 154}}  In the centre of the island itself was a chasm 50 yards in diameter continuing down into a dome extending {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=off}} into the adamantine surface.  This dome served as an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]], and also contained the [[lodestone]] which enabled the island to fly and move above the realm.{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 155}}

==Inhabitants==
[[File:Willmann, Colin, &amp; Outhwaite, the Queen of Laputa, cph.3b18906.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen of Laputa, from a French edition of ''Gulliver's Travels'' (1850s)]]
Laputa's population consists mainly of an educated elite, who are fond of mathematics, [[astronomy]], music and technology, but fail to make practical use of their knowledge. Servants make up the rest of the population.

The Laputans have mastered magnetic levitation. They also are very fond of astronomy, and discovered two moons of Mars. (This is 151 years earlier than the [[Moons of Mars|recognized discovery of the two moons of Mars]] by [[Asaph Hall]] in 1877.) However, they are unable to construct well-designed clothing or buildings, as they despise practical geometry as &quot;vulgar and mechanick&quot;. The houses are ill-built, lacking any right angles,{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 151}} and the clothes of Laputans, which are decorated with astrological symbols and musical figures, do not fit, as they take measurements with instruments such as [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]] and a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] rather than with [[tape measure]]s.{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 150}} They spend their time listening to the music of the spheres. They believe in astrology and worry constantly that the sun will go out.

Many of them have heads angled to one side, and they often suffer from [[strabismus]]: one eye turns inward and the other looks up &quot;to the zenith&quot;, conditions that Swift uses to mock the microscope and the telescope.  Laputans are described as becoming so lost in thought that they cannot focus their attention on a conversation or avoid running into a tree or falling into a ditch unless periodically struck by a bladder full of pebbles or dry peas carried by one or two &quot;flappers&quot; or, in their native language, &quot;climenoles&quot;, hired for the purpose. {{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 148}}

Laputa is a male-dominated society. Wives often request to leave the island to visit the land below; however, these requests are almost never granted because the women who leave Laputa never want to return.
The Laputan women are highly sexed (having &quot;an abundance of vivacity&quot;) and adulterous, and, whenever possible, take on lovers out of visitors from the lands below. The Laputan husbands, who are so abstracted in mathematical and musical calculations, might assume their wives are adulterous, but so long as they have no flapper around, they won't notice the adultery even should it occur right before their eyes.{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 153}}

==Nearby lands==
The land beneath the floating island, within the region the Laputa can travel, is known as Balnibarbi. Balnibarbi is controlled by the king of Laputa; its ground capital is the city of [[Lagado]].

Laputa's king is able to control the mainland mostly by threatening to cover rebel regions with the island's shadow, thus blocking sunlight and rain, or by throwing rocks at rebellious surface cities.{{Sfn | Swift | 2008 | p = 159}} In extreme cases, the island is lowered onto the cities below to crush them, although this is not successful every time, notably in the case of [[Lindalino]].

The Balnibarbian language, spoken on both Laputa and Balnibarbi, is described by Gulliver as sounding similar to [[Italian language|Italian]].

==Symbolism==
Lindalino's rebellion against Laputa is an [[allegory]] of Ireland's revolt against Great Britain, and Great Britain's (meaning the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] government's) violent foreign and internal politics (see [[Jonathan Swift]] for his political career). The Laputans' absurd inventions mock the [[Royal Society]].

As &quot;la puta&quot; means &quot;the whore&quot; in [[Spanish profanity#Puta|Spanish]], some Spanish editions of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; use &quot;Lapuntu&quot;, &quot;Laput&quot;, &quot;Lapuda&quot; and &quot;Lupata&quot; as [[bowdlerisation]]s. It is likely, given Swift's education and satirical style, that he was aware of the Spanish meaning. (Gulliver claimed Spanish among the many languages in which he was fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=D.C. Heath &amp; Co., Publishers|year=1900|isbn=|location=Boston; New York; Chicago |at=Part I, Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Legacy==

On [[Mars]]'s largest [[Natural satellite|moon]], [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], there is one named [[Planetary geology#Regio (astronomy)|regio]], ''Laputa Regio'', which is named after Swift's Laputa because of his [[Moons of Mars#Early speculation|'prediction']] of the two then undiscovered Martian moons, which his Laputan astronomers had discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/PHOBOS/target Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature] [[USGS]] Astrogeology Research Program, Phobos&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 Japanese anime film ''[[Castle in the Sky|Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'', directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]], also derives its name from Swift's novel.

In the video game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', agent Gunther Hermann's killswitch phrase is &quot;Laputan Machine&quot;, an allusion to the fact that despite being enhanced with numerous bio-mechanical and neurological implants, agent Hermann is still highly flawed and impractical.

The '''Abbadid dynasty''' or '''Abbadids''' ({{lang-ar|بنو عباد|Banū ʿAbbād}}) was an [[Arab]] [[Islam|Muslim]] [[dynasty]] which arose in [[al-Andalus]] on the downfall of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]] (756–1031). After the collapse, there were multiple small Muslim states called [[taifas]], each ruled by a different family or tribe: the [[Hammudid]]s, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zayrids]], the Jahwarids, the Dhul-Nunids, the Amirids, the Tojibids, and the [[Banu Hud|Hudids]]. Of all of these small groups, the Abbadid were the strongest and before long absorbed most of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stearns|2001|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbadid rule lasted from about 1023 until 1091,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=col/&gt; but during the short period of its existence it exhibited singular energy and typified its time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abbassid|volume=1|pages=8–9|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (ruled 1023–1042)==
{{main|Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad}}
[[Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad]] ({{reign|1023|1042}}), the ''[[qadi]]'' of [[Seville]], founded the house in 1023.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The Abbadids had not previously played a major role in history, though they were of noble pedigree, hailing from the [[Lakhmids]], the historical kings of [[al-Hira]] in south-central [[Iraq]].{{sfn|Soravia|2011}} The branch that resulted in the Abbadids settled in [[Homs]] in Syria, and was among the first Muslim families to settle in [[al-Andalus]] after the [[Muslim conquest of Hispania]].{{sfn|Soravia|2011}} Abu al-Qasim's father, Isma'il ibn Abbad (died 1023) was named as ''qadi'' of Sevilla by the regent [[Almanzor]], and established his family's leading role in the city: the contemporary historian [[Ibn Hayyan]] reports that his son owned no less than third of Seville's territory, making him by far the richest man in the city.{{sfn|Soravia|2011}}

Abu al-Qasim gained the confidence of the townsmen by playing a major role in the successful resistance to the [[Berber people|Berber]] soldiers of fortune who had grasped at the fragments of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; After the Berbers were forced out, he was, by near unanimous voice of the people and prompting of the merchant and nobles, given the reins of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he refused the position, worried of the fatal repercussions that could follow failure or the changing of the voice of the people.&lt;ref name=sc118&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he professed to rule only with the advice of a council formed of the nobles.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Abu al-Qasim's first order of business was to rebuild the military of Seville, which had, in recent times, disappeared. This, he accomplished by first creating recruiting posts in all settlements controlled by Seville. The promise of substantial pay along with promises of unrestricted looting brought many able men to him.&lt;ref name=sc118/&gt; Second, he opened the ranks to all races and social class, as Berbers, Arabs, Christians, and foreigners were all accepted along with slaves from Nubia and Sudan.&lt;ref name=sc119&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the military could become a formidable force, a Berber army from [[Málaga]] was at the gates demanding entrance and fealty, in the form of sons of the richest and most powerful nobles and merchants as hostages. Abu al-Qasim, to show his people his trust in the situation, offered his own son as solitary collateral. This show of bravery, convinced his population to follow him with near zeal, and at this time dismissed the council and began his solitary rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point on, he was able to make small inroads into the small principalities surrounding him.  This began with an alliance forged with the governor of [[Taifa of Carmona|Carmona]].&lt;ref name=sc121&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first conquest was Beja, followed by the plunder and subsequent control of the coastal regions from [[Cadiz]] west.&lt;ref name=sc121/&gt; The [[Taifa of Badajoz]] was next as he defeated and captured the son of the emir, and at this early time nearly defeated the [[Taifa of Córdoba]], beaten back at the end by an alliance Cordoba made with the Berbers.&lt;ref name=sc121/&gt;

The Berbers continued to be a thorn in the side of Abu al-Qasim, as they now recognized [[Yahya (Zaragoza)|Yahya]] as their supreme leader, something that had not been accomplished before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, it was apparent to Abu al-Qasim that a coalition was needed to defeat the growing Berber threat; however it was also apparent that he would not be accepted as the head of this coalition of caliphates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu al-Qasim was able to procure an imposter that resembled the caliph [[Hisham II]]. This man, who was a mat-maker by trade had previously been involved in an unsuccessful attempt at trickery. This time the deception was successful and the coalition formed starting with Cordoba, then followed by [[Taifa of Dénia|Dénia]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Taifa of Tortosa|Tortosa]], and [[Taifa of Valencia|Valencia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the growing forces against him, Yahya was lured into an ambush and along with the larger portion of his command killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1977|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Abu al-Qasim died in 1042 he had created a state, which, though weak in itself, appeared strong as compared to its neighbours. He had made his family the recognized leaders of the Andalusian [[Muslim]]s against the neo-Berber element arrayed under the king of [[Granada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

==Abbad II al-Mu'tadid (ruled 1042–1069)==
{{main|Abbad II al-Mu'tadid}}
[[Abbad II al-Mu'tadid]] (1042–1069),&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; the son and successor of Abu al-Qasim, became one of the most remarkable figures in [[Al-Andalus|Iberian Muslim]] history. He had a striking resemblance to the Italian princes of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the early [[Renaissance]], of the stamp of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Abbad wrote [[poetry]] and loved literature; he also appears as a poisoner, a drinker of wine, a sceptic, and a man treacherous to the utmost degree. Though he waged war all through his reign, he himself very rarely appeared in the field, but directed the generals, whom he never trusted, from his &quot;lair&quot; in the fortified palace, the [[Alcázar]] of [[Seville, Spain|Seville]]. He killed with his own hand one of his sons who had rebelled against him. In 1053, he tricked a number of his enemies, the Berber chiefs of southern al-Andalus, into visiting him, and got rid of them by smothering them in the hot room of a [[Turkish bath|bath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; He then seized their kingdoms of [[Taifa of Arcos|Arcos]], [[Taifa of Morón|Moron]], and [[Taifa of Ronda|Ronda]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He also forcibly annexed the kingdoms of [[Taifa of Mértola|Mertola]], [[Taifa of Niebla|Niebla]], [[Taifa of Saltés and Huelva|Huelva and Saltes]], [[Taifa of Santa Maria do Algarve|Santa Maria do Algarve]], and [[Taifa of Silves|Silves]]&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He habitually preserved the skulls of the enemies he had killed; those of the meaner men to use as flower-pots, while those of the princes he kept in special chests. He devoted his reign mainly to extending his power at the expense of his smaller neighbours, and in conflicts with his chief rival the king of Granada. These incessant wars weakened the Muslims, to the great advantage of the rising power of the [[Christians|Christian]] kings of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], but they gave the kingdom of Seville a certain superiority over the other little states. After 1063 [[Fernando El Magno]] of [[Castile and León]] assailed him, marched to the gates of Seville, and forced him to pay tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; This fealty was so complete, for the remaining two years of Fernando's reign, that Abbad even surrendered the remains of [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muhammad al-Mu'tamid (ruled 1069–1095)==
{{main|Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad}}

[[File:Al Andalus Dirham 602105.jpg|thumb|right|Coin minted during the reign of al-Mutamid]]

The son of Abbad II, [[Muhammad al-Mu'tamid]] (1069–1095) — who reigned under the title ''al-Mu'tamid'' — was the third and last of the Abbadids.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; No less remarkable than his father, and more amiable, he also wrote poetry and favoured poets. Al-Mu'tamid went, however, considerably further in patronage of literature than his father, for he chose as his [[favourite]] and [[prime minister]] the poet [[Ibn Ammar (poet)|Ibn Ammar]]. In the end, the vanity and feather-headedness of Ibn Ammar drove his master to kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

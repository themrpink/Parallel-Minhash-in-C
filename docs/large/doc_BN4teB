Fortuyn changed the Dutch political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1974184.stm BBC impression] for an early evaluation Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, were marked by large losses for the liberal [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and especially the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the [[Pim Fortuyn List]], and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]. Some commentators in the mainstream political class speculated that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, hence that party's brief surge to 17% of the electoral vote and 26 of the 150 seats in the Dutch Parliament. Although the LPF was able to form a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], it was bereft with internal strife and quickly lost steam.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The [[coalition government|coalition]] cabinet of [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] fell within three months, due to infighting within the LPF. In the following elections, the LPF was left with only eight seats in parliament (out of 150) and was not included in the new government.  Political commentators speculated that discontented voters might vote for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was at hand. Later, the right-wing [[Party for Freedom]], which has a strong stance on immigration, proposing to deport criminal, unemployed or not assimilated non-western immigrants, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and peaked at 24 in 2010.

The Netherlands has made its asylum policy more strict. Opponents of [[Fortuynism]], such as [[Paul Rosenmöller]], [[Thom de Graaf]], and [[Ad Melkert]] (all labelling Fortuyn as a right-wing extremist),&lt;ref name=&quot;documentary&quot;&gt;[Documentary] &quot;A Democracy in Shock&quot; (2002). RTL Nieuws.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to what they think is a harsher political and social climate, especially towards immigrants and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2680881.stm|last=Coughlan|first=Geraldine|title=Fortuyn ghost stalks Dutch politics|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators such as [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], [[David Starkey]] and [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] have retrospectively defended some of Fortuyn's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsi Ali |first=Ayaan |authorlink=Ayaan Hirsi Ali |date=2006 |title=Infidel: My Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1393583/Is-there-a-Prof-Pim-in-Britain.html|title=Is there a Prof Pim in Britain?|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Murray (author) |date=2017 |title=The Strange Death of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Dutch Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] also stated that he later agreed with some of Fortuyn's criticisms of multiculturalism and the purple coalition under [[Wim Kok]].&lt;ref name=rvh46&gt;{{harvnb|Rydgren|van Holsteyn|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sheg&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJ6x8zmRAaEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage|first1=Steven|last1=Van Hecke|first2=Emmanuel|last2=Gerard|title=Christian democratic parties in Europe since the end of the Cold War|year=2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-5867-377-0|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Dutch politics is more polarized than it has been in recent years, especially on the issues for which Fortuyn was best known. People debate the success of their [[multiculturalism|multicultural society]], and whether they need to better [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilate]] newcomers. The government's decision in 2004 to more strictly expel asylum seekers whose applications had failed was controversial. Fortuyn had advocated for a one-time amnesty for those asylum seekers who had resided in the Netherlands for an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3494627.stm|title=Dutch MPs approve asylum exodus|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in a TV show, Fortuyn was chosen as [[De Grootste Nederlander]] (&quot;Greatest Dutchman of all-time&quot;), followed closely by [[William I of Orange|William of Orange]], the leader of the independence war that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=nl|url=http://www.planet.nl/planet/show/id=106882/contentid=525037/sc=5ce917|title=Greatest Dutchman|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310014512/http://www.planet.nl/planet/show/id%3D106882/contentid%3D525037/sc%3D5ce917|archivedate=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was not considered representative, as it was held by viewers' voting through the internet and by phoning in. [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] had been murdered a few days before by a Muslim, which likely affected people's voting in the TV contest for Fortuyn. The program later revealed that William of Orange had received the most votes, but many could not be counted until after the official closing time of the television show (and the proclamation of the winner), due to technical problems. The official rules of the show said that votes counted before the end of the show would be decisive, but it was suggested that all votes correctly cast before the closing of the vote would be counted. Following the official rules, the outcome was not changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/443284/pim-fortuyn-toch-niet-de-grootste-nederlander.html|title=nu.nl/algemeen &amp;#124; 'Pim Fortuyn toch niet de Grootste Nederlander'|publisher=Nu.nl|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Right-wing politics|Right-wing politicians]] gained greater public influence after Fortuyn's death, such as former [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Minister for Integration &amp; Immigration]] [[Rita Verdonk]], the prominent [[Criticism of Islam|critic of Islam]], [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] [[Geert Wilders]] who in 2006 formed the [[Party for Freedom]] (which became the second largest party in the House of Representatives in 2017) and [[Thierry Baudet]], leader of the [[Forum for Democracy]] party. These politicians often focus on the debate over [[cultural assimilation]] and [[Integration law for new immigrants to the Netherlands|integration]].

Supporters of Fortuyn went on to set up the annual ''Pim Fortuyn Prize'' which is awarded to opinion makers, politicians or commentators who best convey the ideas of Pim Fortuyn. Winners have included [[Ebru Umar]] and [[John van den Heuvel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/ebru-umar-krijgt-de-pim-fortuyn-prijs~b853b348/|title=Ebru Umar receives the Pim Fortuyn Prize|publisher=de Volkskrant|accessdate=8 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tellerreport.com/life/2019-05-21---john-van-den-heuvel-and-paul-vugts-receive-the-pim-fortuyn-prize-.ByPX1JGTN.html|title=Vugts receive the Pim Fortuyn Prize|publisher=tellerreport|accessdate=8 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris is a historical achievement of structural engineering.]]

'''Structural engineering''' is a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]] in which [[structural engineer]]s are trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of man-made structures. [[Structural engineers]] need to understand and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity and earthquake of built structures for [[building]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2433e/i2433e04.pdf FAO online publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119191121/http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2433e/i2433e04.pdf |date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nonbuilding structure]]s. The structural designs are integrated with those of other designers such as [[architects]] and [[Building services engineering|building services engineer]] and often supervise the construction of projects by [[contractors]] on site.&lt;ref name = IStructE/&gt; They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.  See [[glossary of structural engineering]].

Structural engineering theory is based upon applied [[physics|physical laws]] and [[empirical]] knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineering design uses a number of relatively simple structural concepts to build complex [[structural system]]s. Structural engineers are responsible for making creative and efficient use of funds, structural elements and materials to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;IStructE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rmg-engineers.com/what-is-a-structural-engineer/|title = What is a structural engineer|accessdate = 2015-11-30|date = 2015-11-30|website = RMG Engineers|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208052438/http://www.rmg-engineers.com/what-is-a-structural-engineer/|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of structural engineering}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]], France, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era aqueduct circa 19 BC.]]
Structural engineering dates back to 2700 B.C.E. when the step pyramid for Pharaoh [[Djoser]] was built by [[Imhotep]], the first engineer in history known by name. Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because the structural form of a pyramid is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).&lt;ref name = Saouma/&gt;

The structural stability of the pyramid, whilst primarily gained from its shape, relies also on the strength of the stone from which it is constructed, and its ability to support the weight of the stone above it.&lt;ref name=Fonte&gt;{{cite report|title=Building the Great Pyramid in a Year: An Engineer's Report |author=Fonte, Gerard C. A.|publisher=Algora Publishing: New York|pages=34|accessdate=2013-12-05}}CV&lt;/ref&gt; The limestone blocks were often taken from a quarry near the building site and have a compressive strength from 30 to 250 MPa (MPa = Pa × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~tyzhu/Documents/Some%20Useful%20Numbers.pdf|title=Some Useful Numbers on the Engineering Properties of Materials (Geologic and Otherwise)|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2013-12-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616163119/http://www.stanford.edu/~tyzhu/Documents/Some%20Useful%20Numbers.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the structural strength of the pyramid stems from the material properties of the stones from which it was built rather than the pyramid's geometry.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction were carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. No theory of structures existed, and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.&lt;ref name=Saouma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E. Saouma|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=2007-11-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413110017/http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|archivedate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behavior of structural material, but the profession of a structural engineer only really took shape with the Industrial Revolution and the re-invention of concrete (see [[Concrete#History|History of Concrete]]. The physical sciences underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the Renaissance and have since developed into computer-based applications pioneered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.structuremag.org/downloads/pulse-release-ETABS-receives-Top-Seismic-product-5-24-06.pdf |title=ETABS receives &quot;Top Seismic Product of the 20th Century&quot; Award |year=2006 |work=Press Release |publisher=Structure Magazine |accessdate=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127130531/http://www.structuremag.org/downloads/pulse-release-ETABS-receives-Top-Seismic-product-5-24-06.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural failure===
{{Main article|Structural failure|List of structural failures and collapses}}
The history of structural engineering contains many collapses and failures.  Sometimes this is due to obvious negligence, as in the case of the [[2008 Pétion-ville school collapse|Pétion-Ville school collapse]], in which Rev. Fortin Augustin ''&quot; constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction&quot;'' following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.

In other cases [[crash testing|structural failures]] require careful study, and the results of these inquiries have resulted in improved practices and a greater understanding of the science of structural engineering.  Some such studies are the result of [[forensic engineering]] investigations where the original engineer seems to have done everything in accordance with the state of the profession and acceptable practice yet a failure still eventuated.  A famous case of structural knowledge and practice being advanced in this manner can be found in a series of failures involving [[box girders]] which collapsed in Australia during the 1970s.

==Theory==
{{Main article|Structural engineering theory}}
[[File:Bolt-in-shear.svg|thumb|Figure of a [[Screw|bolt]] in [[shear stress]]. Top figure illustrates single shear, bottom figure illustrates double shear.]]
Structural engineering depends upon a detailed knowledge of [[applied mechanics]], [[materials science]], and [[applied mathematics]] to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully a structural engineer generally requires detailed knowledge of relevant empirical and theoretical [[design codes]], the techniques of [[structural analysis]], as well as some knowledge of the [[corrosion]] resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment. Since the 1990s, specialist software has become available to aid in the design of structures, with the functionality to assist in the drawing, analyzing and designing of structures with maximum precision; examples include [[AutoCAD]], StaadPro, [[Computers and Structures|ETABS]], Prokon, Revit Structure, Inducta RCB, etc. Such software may also take into consideration environmental loads, such as earthquakes and winds.

==Profession==
{{Main article|Structural engineer}}
Structural engineers are responsible for engineering design and structural analysis. Entry-level structural engineers may design the individual structural elements of a structure, such as the beams and columns of a building. More experienced engineers may be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.

Structural engineers often specialize in particular types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, industrial, tunnels, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.  Structural engineers who specialize in buildings often specialize in particular construction materials such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, alloys, and composites, and may focus on particular types of buildings such as offices, schools, hospitals, residential, and so forth.

Structural engineering has existed since humans first started to construct their structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession with the emergence of architecture as a distinct profession from engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one and the same thing – the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.

The role of a structural engineer today involves a significant understanding of both static and dynamic loading and the structures that are available to resist them. The complexity of modern structures often requires a great deal of creativity from the engineer in order to ensure the structures support and resist the loads they are subjected to. A structural engineer will typically have a four or five-year undergraduate degree, followed by a minimum of three years of professional practice before being considered fully qualified.
Structural engineers are licensed or accredited by different learned societies and regulatory bodies around the world (for example, the Institution of Structural Engineers in the UK). Depending on the degree course they have studied and/or the jurisdiction they are seeking licensure in, they may be accredited (or licensed) as just structural engineers, or as civil engineers, or as both civil and structural engineers.
Another international organisation is IABSE(International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php IABSE &quot;Organisation&quot;, ''iabse website''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806054537/http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php |date=2004-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of that association is to exchange knowledge and to advance the practice of structural engineering worldwide in the service of the profession and society.

Structural building engineering includes all structural engineering related to the design of buildings. It is a branch of structural engineering closely affiliated with [[architecture]].

Structural building engineering is primarily driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms and the underlying mathematical and scientific ideas to achieve an end that fulfills its functional requirements and is structurally safe when subjected to all the loads it could reasonably be expected to experience. This is subtly different from architectural design, which is driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms, mass, space, volume, texture, and light to achieve an end which is aesthetic, functional, and often artistic.

The architect is usually the lead designer on buildings, with a structural engineer employed as a sub-consultant. The degree to which each discipline leads the design depends heavily on the type of structure. Many structures are structurally simple and led by architecture, such as multi-story office buildings and housing, while other structures, such as [[tensile structure]]s, [[Thin-shell structure|shells]] and [[gridshell]]s are heavily dependent on their form for their strength, and the engineer may have a more significant influence on the form, and hence much of the aesthetic, than the architect.

The structural design for a building must ensure that the building can stand up safely, able to function without excessive deflections or movements which may cause fatigue of structural elements, cracking or failure of fixtures, fittings or partitions, or discomfort for occupants. It must account for movements and forces due to temperature, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], cracking, and imposed loads. It must also ensure that the design is practically buildable within acceptable manufacturing tolerances of the materials. It must allow the architecture to work, and the building services to fit within the building and function (air conditioning, ventilation, smoke extract, electrics, lighting, etc.). The structural design of a modern building can be extremely complex and often requires a large team to complete.

===Earthquake engineering structures===
{{Main article|Earthquake engineering structures}}
'''Earthquake engineering structures''' are those engineered to withstand [[earthquake]]s.[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|left|Earthquake-proof pyramid [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]]]]

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand the interaction of [[structure]]s with the shaking ground, foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes, and design and construct the structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] during an earthquake.

Earthquake-proof structures are not necessarily extremely strong like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza shown above.

One important tool of [[earthquake engineering]] is [[base isolation]], which allows the base of a structure to move freely with the ground.

===Civil engineering structures===

[[Civil engineering|Civil structural engineering]] includes all structural engineering related to the built environment. It includes:

{{div col|content=
* [[Bridge]]s
* [[Dam]]s
* [[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]]
* [[Foundation (engineering)|Foundations]]
* [[Offshore construction|Offshore structures]]
* [[Pipeline transport|Pipelines]]
* [[Power station]]s
* [[Railways]]
* [[Retaining wall|Retaining structures and walls]]
* [[Roads]]
* [[Tunnels]]
* [[Waterways]]
* [[Reservoirs]]
* [[Water supply network|Water]] and [[Sewerage|wastewater]] infrastructure
}}

The structural engineer is the lead designer on these structures, and often the sole designer. In the design of structures such as these, structural safety is of paramount importance (in the UK, designs for dams, nuclear power stations and bridges must be signed off by a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]]).

==Promotion==
In order to promote ''Flood'', Elektra produced a promotional video featuring Linnell and Flansburgh facetiously extolling the album's merits. One sarcastic quip was that the album included nineteen songs, which made it inherently better than other albums with fewer tracks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#reedsandifer|Reed &amp; Sandifer 2013]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The video also included a live performance of &quot;Particle Man&quot; and a sample of the lead single &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. The band also produced a music video, directed by [[Adam Bernstein]], for &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. In April, the band appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' to perform the song with [[Doc Severinsen]] and the Tonight Show Band. Severinsen's unusually fast count-in resulted in a performance with a noticeably higher tempo than the album recording. Linnell and Flansburgh would later adopt a similar tempo for subsequent live performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gigantic&quot; /&gt;

===Tour===
In support of ''Flood'', They Might Be Giants toured North America and Europe, including a series of shows in Germany. Due to the scale of the tour, the band's [[road crew]] doubled in size—increasing from two members to four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sassy&quot; /&gt; Linnell and Flansburgh have recounted the unfamiliarity of touring outside of North America. In Europe, they report that crowds acted differently due to cultural gaps.&lt;ref&gt;[[#reedsandifer|Reed &amp; Sandifer 2013]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band continued to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing [[accordion]] and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band [[bass drum]]. Large posters of [[postage stamp]]s adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was received as a boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination of old and new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins 1990&quot; /&gt; As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a [[metronome]] in lieu of a full [[rhythm section]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Santo 1994&quot; /&gt;

''Flood'' received generally positive reviews, though some critics expressed reservations. In an [[AllMusic]] review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that despite some inconsistencies and awkward selections, the album is musically superior to its predecessors. He observed that through ''Flood'', Flansburgh and Linnell &quot;exchange quirky artiness for unabashed geekiness&quot;. Six of the album's nineteen tracks are designated as AllMusic &quot;picks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot; /&gt; Chris Heim wrote for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that the album is a rare example of success for a &quot;quirky cult band&quot; signed to a major label.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot; /&gt; Steve Simels, writing for ''[[Stereo Review]]'', compared the album's structural complexities to [[The Beach Boys]] at the peak of their career. Simels praised the album's originality and intellect, while heavily criticizing other contemporary music for lacking those characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simels 1990&quot; /&gt; Writing in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Ira Robbins called ''Flood'' &quot;another captivating variety show of art-rock, swing, the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band|Bonzo Dog Band]], cow-pop, show tunes and the Schmenge Brothers&amp;nbsp;... Boundless imagination, loopy mix-and-match arrangements and a gyroscopic sense of what makes a pop tune click are still responsible for the easy and abiding appeal of TMBG's ingenious material.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spin&quot; /&gt;

Reviews in the UK were also mostly positive. In a review for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', Peter Kane lauded the record for its uniqueness and for the sheer quantity of tracks, which he said ensured that the listener would enjoy at least one song, and concluded that ''Flood'' was &quot;as playful an entertainment as will be heard all year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&quot; /&gt; In ''[[NME]]'' Jerry Smith called the collection &quot;a weird and wonderful varied combination of the zany, trivial, witty and wacky, delivered with a spritely foot-tapping ease that belies their bizarre subject matter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME&quot; /&gt; ''[[Record Mirror]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Iestyn George observed that &quot;if it's to be faulted, the album is a mite too cluttered for its own good, but the virtues of imagination and originality that these native New Yorkers display are worthy of enthusiastic approval&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RM&quot; /&gt; Andy Ross of ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' believed that it was the duo's melodic talents that prevented them from becoming just a novelty act, and wrote that ''Flood'' was &quot;a real cryptic crossword of an album, requiring perseverance and application with ultimately rewarding and fulfilling results&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sounds&quot; /&gt;

Conversely, ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s David Browne found ''Flood'' to be unremarkable overall. Both critics chastised the band's novelty, which they found to be wearing thin as time progressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS&quot; /&gt; In the UK Caroline Sullivan of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' felt that enjoyment of ''Flood'' &quot;hinges upon one's general feelings about similarly zany characters like [[Talking Heads]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. If their very American, very beatnik, surrealism spells instant yawnorama, forget TMBG—they're the same thing, but minus the good tunes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot; /&gt; However, in a 2009 ''Rolling Stone'' article revisiting ''Flood'' near its twentieth anniversary, DX Ferris praised the album as both the band's most iconic release and one that revolutionized the [[campus radio|college radio]] scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS09&quot; /&gt;

===Commercial response===
''Flood'' peaked at number 75 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], spending 22 weeks on the chart. The lead single from the album, &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;, reached number 3 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The single also charted in Ireland and the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK singles&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish singles&quot; /&gt; &quot;Twisting&quot;, which was released as a domestic promotional single, peaked at number 22 on the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; The album also contains two of the band's most well known songs, &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; and &quot;Particle Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason PM&quot; /&gt; The former was released as a single, reaching number 61 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], but failing to chart in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK singles&quot; /&gt;

''Flood'' was the first album released by They Might Be Giants to receive the [[RIAA]] [[List of music recording sales certifications|Platinum sales award]]—indicating sales over one million copies—which it achieved on July 10, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot; /&gt; It is also certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPI&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:TMBG 2012-12-29 Lincoln and Flood show.jpg|thumb|250px|Flansburgh and Linnell in 2012 performing a dual ''[[Lincoln (album)|Lincoln]]'' and ''Flood'' show]]
''Flood'' is They Might Be Giants' best-selling album, and it is widely regarded as their most iconic.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS09&quot; /&gt; Due to the acclaim with which it was received, the album is considered to have cemented the band's reputation as a staple of [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[college rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller 2011&quot; /&gt; Curtis Silver, in a retrospective for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, many of whom were first exposed to the band through ''Flood''. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver 2013&quot; /&gt; In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not ''Flood'', despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#reedsandifer|Reed &amp; Sandifer 2013]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' aired animated music videos for two tracks from the album, &quot;Particle Man&quot; and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;. Through the program, the band was exposed to a younger set of fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivait 2008&quot; /&gt; This ultimately led the band to begin releasing children's music alongside their &quot;rock albums&quot; over a decade later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ricks 2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blisten 2013&quot; /&gt;

They Might Be Giants has performed ''Flood'' live in its entirety on numerous occasions. In 2015, the band released the live album ''[[Flood Live in Australia]]'', a recording of the album played live in 2013, in which the songs are performed in reverse order, starting with &quot;Road Movie to Berlin&quot; and ending with &quot;Theme from Flood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;floodlive&quot; /&gt;  The band has performed multiple ''Flood'' concerts in the reverse-order format.&lt;ref&gt;[[#reedsandifer|Reed &amp; Sandifer 2013]], p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In other shows, the songs are played out of sequence. Between September 2020 until May 2021, they will be performing a series of these concerts to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the album's release. It was originally to take to place between January and March 2020, but was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearis&quot; /&gt;

'''''The Dark Side of the Moon''''' is the eighth studio album by the English rock band [[Pink Floyd]], released on 1 March 1973 by [[Harvest Records]]. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. The record was conceived as an album that focused on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent [[Mental illness|mental health problems]] suffered by former band member [[Syd Barrett]], who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.

The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. The group employed [[multitrack recording]], [[tape loop]]s, and [[analogue synthesiser]]s, including experimentation with the [[EMS VCS 3]] and a [[EMS Synthi A|Synthi A]]. Engineer [[Alan Parsons]] was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer [[Clare Torry]], who appears on &quot;[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]&quot;.

A [[concept album]], the themes of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's [[road crew]], as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. The sleeve, which depicts a [[Prism spectrometer|prism spectrum]], was designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]], following [[keyboardist]] [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]'s request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: &quot;[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]&quot; and &quot;[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]&quot;.

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is among the most critically acclaimed records in history, often featuring on professional listings of the greatest albums. The record helped to propel Pink Floyd to international fame, bringing wealth and recognition to all four of its members. It has been certified [[BPI certification|14× platinum]] in the United Kingdom, and topped the US [[Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tape|''Billboard'' Top LPs &amp; Tapes]] chart, where it has charted for 951 weeks in total. With estimated sales of over 45&amp;nbsp;million copies, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album, and one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums worldwide]]. In 2013, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background ==
Following ''[[Meddle]]'' in 1971, [[Pink Floyd]] assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s home in [[Camden Town|Camden]], bassist [[Roger Waters]] proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that &quot;make people mad&quot;, focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member [[Syd Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;darkside30&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris | first=John | title='Dark Side' at 30: Roger Waters | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326023152/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | publisher = rollingstone.com | date=12 March 2003 | accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's [[The Man and The Journey|''The Man'' and ''The Journey'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=n/a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', guitarist [[David Gilmour]] said: &quot;I think we all thought{{Snd}} and Roger definitely thought{{Snd}} that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilmour&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first= John|last= Harris |title='Dark Side' at 30: David Gilmour |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937468/dark_side_at_30_david_gilmour |date=12 March 2003 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202754/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937468/dark_side_at_30_david_gilmour |archive-date = 19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, all four members agreed that Waters' album concept unified by a single theme was a good idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;gilmour&quot; /&gt; Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] participated in the writing and [[Record producer|production]] of the new material, and Waters created the early [[Demo (music)|demo tracks]] at his [[Islington]] home in a small studio built in his garden shed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of &quot;[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]&quot; came from an earlier work by Waters and [[Ron Geesin]], written for the soundtrack of ''[[Music from The Body|The Body]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the basic structure of &quot;[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]&quot; borrowed from an original composition by Wright for ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Classic Albums: The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon | type = DVD | publisher = Eagle Rock Entertainment | date = 26 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by [[the Rolling Stones]], and then at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in [[Finsbury Park]], London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a [[Public address system|PA system]], a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three [[Truck|lorries]]; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masonp167&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album had been given the provisional title of ''Dark Side of the Moon'' (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after discovering that that title had already been used by another band, [[Medicine Head]], it was temporarily changed to ''Eclipse''. The new material premiered at [[Brighton Dome|The Dome]] in [[Brighton]], on 20 January 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffnerp162&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|&quot;At one time, it was called ''Eclipse'' because Medicine Head did an album called ''Dark Side of the Moon''. But, that didn't sell well, so what the hell. I was against ''Eclipse'' and we felt a bit annoyed because we had already thought of the title before Medicine Head came out. Not annoyed at them but because we wanted to use the title.&quot;{{Snd}} David Gilmour&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp154&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

[[File:Rainbow theatre london.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph|The [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, where ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was played for the press in 1972]]
''Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics'', as it was then known,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot; /&gt; was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972{{Snd}} more than a year before its release{{Snd}} at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Wale of ''[[The Times]]'' described the piece as &quot;bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd&amp;nbsp;—The Rainbow, Issue 58405; col F | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itweb/mclib?http_rc=400&amp;class=session&amp;sev=temp&amp;type=session&amp;cause=http%3A%2F%2Finfotrac.galegroup.com%2Fitw%2Finfomark%2F383%2F3%2F57424777w16%2Fpurl%3Drc1_TTDA_0_CS168916562%26dyn%3D5!xrn_9_0_CS168916562%26hst_1%3Fsw_aep%3Dmclib&amp;cont=&amp;msg=No+Session+cookies&amp;sserv=no | last = Wale | first = Michael | publisher = infotrac.galegroup.com | page = 10 | date = 18 February 1972 | accessdate =21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek Jewell]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' wrote &quot;The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffnerp162&quot; /&gt; ''[[Melody Maker]]'' was less enthusiastic: &quot;Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album release; differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as &quot;[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]&quot;, and [[Bible]] readings replaced by [[Clare Torry]]'s vocals on &quot;[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp155&quot; /&gt;

Pink Floyd's [[Dark Side of the Moon Tour|lengthy tour]] through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded [[Obscured by Clouds|music]] for French director [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s film ''[[La Vallée (film)|La Vallée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This material was later released under the title ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp155&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=164–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
''The Dark Side of the Moon'' built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic [[David Fricke]], had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968.  Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as &quot;that psychedelic noodling stuff&quot;, and with Waters cited 1971's ''Meddle'' as a turning-point towards what would be realised on the album. ''The Dark Side of the Moon''{{'}}s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt; The album contains [[musique concrète]] on several tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot; /&gt;

Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music.  The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) &quot;empathy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt;  &quot;[[Speak to Me]]&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life{{Snd}} &quot;Don't be afraid to care&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental &quot;On the Run&quot; evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]&quot; examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in &quot;[[Breathe (Reprise)]]&quot;. The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist [[Clare Torry]]'s soulful metaphor for death, &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett&quot; /&gt;

Opening with the sound of [[cash register]]s and loose change, the first track on side two, &quot;[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]&quot;, mocks greed and [[consumerism]] using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related [[sound effect]]s. &quot;Money&quot; became the most commercially successful track, and has been covered by several acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Us and Them&quot; addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of [[emotional conflict|conflict]] and the use of simple [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] to describe personal relationships. &quot;[[Any Colour You Like]]&quot; concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. &quot;[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]&quot; looks at a [[mental illness]] resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line &quot;and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes&quot; reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett.  The album ends with &quot;[[Eclipse (Pink Floyd song)|Eclipse]]&quot;, which espouses the concepts of [[alterity]] and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reisingpp181184&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=181–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recording ==

The album was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973.  The band were assigned staff engineer [[Alan Parsons]], who had worked as assistant tape operator on their album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'' and gained experience as a recording engineer on [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anotherphase&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon |page=1 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/article/another-phase-moon | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = [[Sound &amp; Vision (magazine)|Sound &amp; Vision]] | date = May 2003 | accessdate =20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording sessions made use of advanced studio techniques; the studio was capable of [[Multitrack recording|16-track]] mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes Pink Floyd had previously used, although they often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrispp101102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first track recorded, on 1 June, was &quot;Us and Them&quot;, followed six days later by &quot;Money&quot;. Waters had created [[Sound effect|effects]] [[Tape loop|loops]] from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio; these were rerecorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders).&lt;ref name=&quot;anotherphase&quot; /&gt;  &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]], would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrispp101102&quot; /&gt; Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: &quot;We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = There is no dark side of the moon, really&amp;nbsp;... | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220536301.html | last = Waldon | first = Steve | publisher = [[The Age]] | date = 24 June 2003 | accessdate =19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parsons&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last= Harris | first = John |title='Dark Side' at 30: Alan Parsons |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons  |date=12 March 2003 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624053706/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons |archive-date = 24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;, while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions.  A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]] was booked to play on &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;.  With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumentation ===
The album features metronomic sound effects during &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, and tape loops opening &quot;Money&quot;.  Mason created a rough version of &quot;Speak to Me&quot; at his home, before completing it in the studio.  The track serves as an [[overture]] and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album.  A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of &quot;Breathe&quot;.  Mason received a rare solo composing credit for &quot;Speak to Me&quot;.{{refn|Mason is responsible for most of the sound effects used on Pink Floyd's discography.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffnerp164&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound effects on &quot;Money&quot; were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a [[beat (music)|7-beat]] [[tape loop|effects loop]] (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a &quot;walk around the room&quot; effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled [[multitrack recording]]s of several of the songs (particularly &quot;On the Run&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt;

Along with the conventional [[rock music|rock]] band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent [[synthesiser]]s to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an [[EMS VCS 3]] on &quot;[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]&quot; and &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;, and a [[EMS Synthi A|Synthi A]] on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;.&lt;!--VCS 3 and Synthi A are technically the same, only using different housings!--&gt; They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during &quot;On the Run&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a specially treated [[bass drum]] made to simulate a human [[Heart rate|heartbeat]] (during &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, &quot;On the Run&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot;).  This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt; &quot;Time&quot; features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of [[Rototom]]s. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffnerp164&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voices ===
Several tracks, including &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices.  In the 2003 [[Classic Albums]] documentary ''The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon'', Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilised studio techniques such as the [[double tracking]] of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself.  The engineer also made prominent use of [[flanging]] and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with [[reverberation|reverb]],&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt; and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the [[quadraphonic]] mix of &quot;On the Run&quot;, when the sound of the [[Hammond organ#Console organs|Hammond B3]] organ played through a [[Leslie speaker]] rapidly swirls around the listener).&lt;ref name=&quot;Povey 2007 161&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's credits include [[Clare Torry]], a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road.  She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.  She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch [[Chuck Berry]] perform at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], but arranged to come in on the following Sunday.  The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do.  Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band{{Snd}} only to find them delighted with her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blakepp198199&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track.&lt;ref name=gilmour /&gt; For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|30|1972|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blakepp198199&quot; /&gt;{{Inflation-fn|UK}} In 2004, she sued [[EMI]] and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting [[royalties]], arguing that her contribution to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship.  The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Gv5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA350|page=350|title=Music: The Business |edition=6th |author=Ann Harrison|publisher=Random House|date= 3 July 2014|isbn=9780753550717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poveyp345&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album.  During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on [[flashcard]]s.  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shown such questions as &quot;What's your favourite colour?&quot; and &quot;What's your favourite food?&quot;, before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions such as &quot;When was the last time you were violent?&quot;, followed immediately by &quot;Were you in the right?&quot;, were answered in the order they were presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;makingof&quot; /&gt; Roger &quot;The Hat&quot; Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid.  Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied &quot;...&amp;nbsp;give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock&amp;nbsp;...&quot; When asked about death he responded &quot;live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: &quot;I've been mad for fucking years{{Snd}} absolutely years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's road manager [[Peter Watts (road manager)|Peter Watts]] (father of actress [[Naomi Watts]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = How Naomi told her mum about Oscar | url = https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/22/1077384633676.html | last = Sams | first = Christine | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 23 February 2004 | accessdate =17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed the repeated laughter during &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Speak to Me&quot;.  His second wife, Patricia &quot;Puddie&quot; Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the &quot;geezer&quot; who was &quot;cruisin' for a bruisin{{'&quot;}} used in the segue between &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and the words &quot;I never said I was frightened of dying&quot; heard halfway through &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last1=Sutcliffe |first1=Phil |last2=Henderson |first2=Peter |title=The True Story of Dark Side of the Moon |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |issue=52 |date=March 1998 &lt;!-- |url=https://pfco.neptunepinkfloyd.co.uk/band/interviews/art-rev/art-mojo98.html is probably a copyvio, so leaving it as a comment --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''895''' ('''[[Roman numerals|DCCCXCV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]].

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* The [[Hungarians|Magyars]] are expelled from southern [[Russia]], and settle in the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Carpathian Basin]], under the leadership of [[Árpád]] (The traditional date of [[896]] held during the 20th century has proved to be erroneous). Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] ('''the Wise''') seeks aid from the Magyars, and after crossing the [[Danube]] on [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ships, they ravage Bulgarian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Early Medieval Balkans|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] ('''the Great'''), ruler (''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'') of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], seeks refuge in the fortress of [[Silistra|Drastar]], while the Magyars reach the outskirts of the capital [[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]]. Facing a difficult situation with war on two fronts, Simeon calls for a [[Ceasefire|truce]]. Leo VI sends the diplomat [[Leo Choirosphaktes]] to Bulgaria, to negotiate the terms.&lt;ref&gt;J{{The Early Medieval Balkans|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* King [[Odo of France|Odo]] (or '''Eudes''') takes a large army against [[Reims|Rheims]], and forces anti-king [[Charles the Simple]] to flee to [[Germany]]. King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], throwing off his agreements with Odo, charges his son [[Zwentibold]] to invade the [[West Francia|West Frankish Kingdom]], and re-install Charles on the [[throne]].
* May &amp;ndash; Arnulf of Carinthia summons the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in his residence at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Angered by the non-appearance of Charles the Simple, he again supports Odo's claim to the throne of the West Frankish Kingdom. In the same assembly, he crowns Zwentibold as king of [[Lotharingia]].
* [[Guy IV of Spoleto|Guy IV]], duke of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]], conquers [[Benevento]] (after the Byzantines have moved the capital of [[Longobardia|Byzantine Italy]] from Benevento to [[Bari]]). Guy makes himself prince, thereby uniting the two Italian states. The Byzantines attempt to retake Benevento, but are defeated by Lombard troops.
* December &amp;ndash; Arnulf of Carinthia invades [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]], at the head of an [[East Francia|East Frankish]] expeditionary army. He arrives in [[Pavia]] and reorganizes the [[Lombardy|Lombard state]]. Arnulf partitions the northern part of the kingdom: the western half ('''March of Lombardy''') and the eastern half ('''March of Verona''').
* Arnulf of Carinthia crosses the [[Po (river)|Po River]] and divides his army in two: one corps ([[Swabia]]n) proceeds to [[Florence]] (via [[Bologna]]), while the other corps ([[Francia|Franks]]) moves through the [[Lunigiana]] to the precincts of [[Rome]].
* [[Spytihněv I, Duke of Bohemia|Spytihněv I]], duke of [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]], together with the [[Slavník dynasty|Slavník]] prince [[Witizla]], breaks away from [[Great Moravia]], and swears allegiance to Arnulf of Carinthia in [[Regensburg]].

==== Britain ====
* King [[Anarawd ap Rhodri|Anarawd]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] is supplied with English troops, to assist in his reconquest of [[Seisyllwg]] ([[Wales]]). He is successful, and his brother [[Cadell ap Rhodri|Cadell]] is finally able to take his rightful place on the Seisyllwg throne.
* Autumn &amp;ndash; King [[Alfred the Great]] blockades the [[River Lea|Lea River]] and builds fortifications, trapping the Danes [[Vikings]] at [[Hertford]]. They abandon their [[longship]]s and escape to [[Bridgnorth]], located in the [[Severn Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hill (2009). ''The Viking Wars of Alfred the Great'', pp. 134–135. {{ISBN|978-1-59416-087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arabian Empire ====
* [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]], a [[Taghlib|Taghlibi]] Arab chieftain, is defeated and captured by Caliph [[Al-Mu'tadid]] at the fortress of [[Mardin]] (near modern [[Cizre]]). Hamdan's son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan|Husayn]] enters [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] service, beginning the rise of the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid Dynasty]].

__NOTOC__
Year '''894''' ('''[[Roman numerals|DCCCXCIV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]].

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
* [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|Byzantine–Bulgarian War]]: [[Stylianos Zaoutzes]], leading minister and ''[[basileopator]]'', convinces Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] ('''the Wise''') to move the Bulgarian market from [[Constantinople]] to [[Thessaloniki]]. This affects the commercial importance of Bulgarian trade. [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], ruler (''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'') of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], mobilizes his Bulgarian forces and invades [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory, ravaging the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;John V.A. Fine, Jr. (1991). ''A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'', pp. 137–138. {{ISBN|978-0-472-08149-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Europe ====
* Spring &amp;ndash; King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] invades [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] at the head of an [[East Francia|East Frankish]] expeditionary army, joining up with the deposed king [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]] at [[Verona]]. He conquers [[Brescia]] after little resistance, and sacks [[Bergamo]] after a one-month [[siege]]. The cities of [[Milan]] and [[Pavia]] open their doors to Arnulf. Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy III]] escapes from Pavia, to hide in the mountains of [[Spoleto]] ([[Umbria]]).
* March &amp;ndash; Arnulf of Carinthia proceeds to [[Piacenza]], and from there invades central Italy. After a successful campaign, he calls the invasion off and returns to Pavia – probably because Duke [[Rudolph I of Burgundy]] was threatening to invade [[Lorraine]]. Arnulf has himself proclaimed [[King of Italy]] at Pavia, leaving Berengar I as his [[Regent|vice-regent]] in Italy. 
* Arnulf of Carinthia returns to [[Germany]] through the [[Alps]], harried by militias dispatched by Rudolph I of Burgundy and margrave [[Anscar I of Ivrea]]. Only with much difficulty is Arnulf able to get his army through the [[Aosta Valley]] and through [[St. Moritz]], back into Germany. Guy III descends from the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and re-seizes the Italian kingdom.
* December &amp;ndash; Guy III dies after a 4-year reign, and is succeeded by his 14-year-old son [[lambert of Italy|Lambert]], already associated as co-emperor since [[892]]. At the pleading of Archbishop [[Fulk (archbishop of Reims)|Fulk of Reims]], [[Pope Formosus]] reconciles with the young emperor. Lambert proceeds from Spoleto to Pavia, where he is acclaimed and crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].
* [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]], ruler (''[[knyaz]]'') of [[Great Moravia]], dies after a 34-year reign, in which he has united the [[Slavs|Slav]] tribes in his kingdom. He is succeeded by his eldest son [[Mojmir II of Moravia|Mojmir II]]. The [[Principality of Nitra]] (modern-day [[Slovakia]]) is given as an [[appanage]] to his brother [[Svatopluk II]].
* [[Árpád]], head of the confederation of the [[Magyar tribes|Hungarian tribes]], comes to an agreement with the prince of the Moravians, Svatopluk II, that Hungarian and Moravian armies will together expel the [[East Francia|Eastern Franks]] from [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Gubcsi (2011), ''Hungary in the Carpathian Basin'', p. 7. {{ISBN|978-963-327-515-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prince [[Petar of Serbia]] defeats his revolting cousin [[Bran Mutimirović|Bran]]; he is captured and blinded (according to a [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|Byzantine tradition that meant to disqualify a person to take the throne]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Longworth|first=Philip|title=The making of Eastern Europe: from prehistory to postcommunism|edition=1997|year=1997|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=0-312-17445-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/makingofeasterne00long/page/321 321]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/makingofeasterne00long/page/321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Britain ====
* The [[Vikings]] in [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] swear allegiance and hand over hostages to King [[Alfred the Great]], but promptly break their truce by attacking the south-west of [[England]]. A Viking force returns from [[Exeter]] and sails along the coast, in an attempt to plunder [[Chichester]]. They are defeated by the Saxon [[garrison]], losing many ships and men.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hill (2009). ''The Viking Wars of Alfred the Great'', p. 132. {{ISBN|978-1-59416-087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* King [[Anarawd ap Rhodri|Anarawd]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]'s shaky alliance with the Vikings collapses. His kingdom is ravaged by the [[Norsemen]]. Anarawd is forced to ask for help from Alfred the Great and submits to his overlordship. Alfred imposes oppressive terms and forces Anarawd's confirmation in the [[Christian Church]], with Alfred as 'godfather'.
* Autumn &amp;ndash; [[South Benfleet#Battle of Benfleet|Battle of Benfleet]]: Danish Viking forces retire to [[Essex]], after being deprived of food by Alfred the Great (see [[893]]). They draw their [[longship]]s up the [[Thames]] and into the [[River Lea|Lea]], entrenching themselves at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hill (2009). ''The Viking Wars of Alfred the Great'', p. 134. {{ISBN|978-1-59416-087-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''3 BC''' was a [[common year starting on Wednesday]] or [[Common year starting on Thursday|Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the [[Consulship]] of Lentulus and Messalla''' (or, less frequently, '''year 751 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 3 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

__NOTOC__
Year '''4 BC''' was a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] or [[Common year starting on Wednesday|Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[common year starting on Monday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Rufus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 750 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 4 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

* King [[Berengar II of Italy]] seizes [[Liguria]], with help from the feudal lord [[Oberto I]]. He reorganizes the territories south of the [[Po (river)|Po River]], dividing them into three new [[March (territorial entity)|marches]] (frontier districts), named after their respective [[margrave]]s: the ''[[March of Montferrat|Marca Aleramica]]'', the ''[[March of Turin|Marca Arduinica]]'', and the ''[[March of Genoa|Marca Obertenga]]''. The last division consists of [[Lombardy]] with the cities of [[Genoa]], [[Lunigiana|Luni]], [[Tortona]], [[Parma]], and [[Piacenza]]. Berengar forces [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]], the widow of [[Lothair II of Italy|Lothair II]], to marry his son [[Adalbert of Italy|Adalbert]]. However, she fiercely refuses and Berengar has her imprisoned at [[Garda, Veneto|Garda]] Castle. With the help of Count [[Adalbert Atto of Canossa]] Adelaide manages to escape.
* Fall &amp;ndash; King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] crosses the [[Brenner Pass]] and takes his army into Italy.

Otto faces no opposition and they arrive in Pavia. Berengar II has departed the day before and entrenched himself in [[City of San Marino|San Marino]].

* Otto I dispatches an embassy to [[Rome]] to apply for an imperial coronation with Pope [[Pope Agapetus II|Agapetus II]] – but Prince [[Alberic II of Spoleto|Alberic II]] makes it clear that this is not possible (afraid of Otto's growing power), and opposes the request.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Reuter (1999).

TAPI 3.0 was released in 1999 together with [[Windows 2000]]. This version enables IP telephony ([[VoIP]]) by providing simple and generic methods for making connections between two (using [[H.323]]) or more (using [[IP Multicast]]) computers and now also offers the ability to access any [[streaming media|media stream]] (MSP driver) involved in the connection.

[[Windows XP]] included both TAPI 3.1 and TAPI 2.2. TAPI 3.1 supports the [[Microsoft Component Object Model]] and provides a set of COM objects to application programmers. This version uses File Terminals which allow applications to record streaming data to a file and play this recorded data back to a stream. A [[USB]] Phone TSP ([[Telephony Service Provider]]) was also included which allows an application to control a USB phone and use it as a streaming endpoint. TAPI 3.0 or TAPI 3.1 are not available on operating systems earlier than Windows 2000 and Windows XP respectively.

The [[Telephony Server Application Programming Interface]] ([[TSAPI]]) is a similar standard developed by [[Novell]] for [[NetWare]] servers.

==Telephone address format==
TAPI uses Microsoft canonical address format for telephone numbers&lt;ref name=&quot;MSDN_TAPI_Canonical_Address&quot;&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms726017.aspx#canonical_addresses MSDN: TAPI Applications - Device Control - Canonical Address]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TechNet_Canonical_Address&quot;&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/cc772545(v=ws.10).aspx Microsoft Technet: Dialing Rules and Canonical Address Format]&lt;/ref&gt; to make phone calls. It is a derivative of [[E.123]] international notation.

The canonical address is a text string with the following format: &lt;code&gt;+Country&amp;#9251;(AreaCode)&amp;#9251; SubscriberNumber | Subaddress ^ Name CRLF&lt;/code&gt;. Area code, subaddress and name are optional; the latter can carry extension number for [[direct inward dialing]] and [[caller ID|calling party name]], as used by [[ISDN]]/[[E-carrier|E1]]/[[T-carrier|T1]] telecommunication protocols.

Dialing rules are used to transform the canonical phone number into a dialable calling sequence for the [[modem]], depending on the user's location. The dialing rules include variable-length dialing for area code, trunk access and international access prefixes, as well as central office access and [[Telephone card|calling card]]/[[credit card]] numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSDN_TAPI_Canonical_Address&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TechNet_Canonical_Address&quot;/&gt; 

The calling sequence can contain dialable numbers such as digits &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt; and [[DTMF]] tones &lt;code&gt;ABCD*#&lt;/code&gt;, formatting characters &lt;code&gt; ␣ . -&lt;/code&gt;, and control characters &lt;code&gt;!  P T , W @ $ ? ;&lt;/code&gt; which correspond to the Dial command of the Hayes [[AT command set]]. The following control characters are defined: &lt;ref name=&quot;MSDN_TAPI_Canonical_Address&quot;/&gt;

:! - hookflash, i.e. half second [[on-hook]] followed by half second [[off-hook]];
:P - [[pulse dialing]] mode;
:T - [[tone dialing]] mode;
:, - pause dialing (duration specified by the device);
:W - wait for [[dial tone]];
:@ - wait for &quot;quiet answer&quot;, i.e. the [[ringback tone]] followed by several seconds of silence;
:$ - wait for a billing signal, such as credit card prompt tone;
:? - indicates that the user is to be prompted before continuing (results in an application error since the API has no means to implement a user prompt);
:&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;  - the number is not complete and will be finished later (only valid in a dialable number).

==TAPI 2.x vs TAPI 3.x==
It is a common misconception that '''TAPI 3.0''' (or '''TAPI 3.1''') replaces '''TAPI 2.x'''.

TAPI 2.x and earlier versions were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]; the API uses pointers to structures. Consequently, TAPI 2.x is easy to access from C or [[C++]] applications, but it can be awkward to use from many other [[programming language]]s.

TAPI 3.x was designed with a [[Component Object Model]] (COM) interface. This was done with the intent of making it accessible to higher level applications such as developed in [[Visual Basic|VB]] or other environments that provide easy access to COM but don't deal with C-style pointers. 

TAPI 3.x has a slightly different set of functionality than TAPI 2.x. The addition of integrated media control was the most significant addition. But TAPI 3.x doesn't include all functionality that TAPI 2.x does, like support for the Phone class.

One very notable issue with TAPI 3.x is the lack of support for managed code ([[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] environment). As documented in Microsoft KB Article [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;841712 841712], Microsoft currently has no plans to support TAPI 3.x directly from .NET programming languages. However, Mark Smith has provided a managed C++ library called ITAPI3&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/markjulmar/itapi3 &lt;/ref&gt; and a 2.x wrapper for .NET.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/markjulmar/atapi.net&lt;/ref&gt; Other developers provide libraries to work indirectly with TAPI enabled PBXs.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/siptapi/&lt;/ref&gt;

One often overlooked reason an application developer might choose between TAPI 2.x and TAPI 3.x should be the hardware vendors recommendation. Even though TAPI provides an abstract model of phone lines, telephony applications are still heavily impacted by the specific behavior of the underlying hardware. Troubleshooting behavior issues usually requires both software and hardware vendors to collaborate. Because there is almost a 1:1 relationship between the TAPI Service Provider (TSP) interface and the TAPI 2.x interface, collaboration is often easier if the application is designed using TAPI 2.x. Experience with TAPI 3.x varies significantly between hardware vendors.

==TAPI compliant hardware==
On [[Windows]], TAPI support was almost universal in [[telephony]] hardware such as [[voice modem]]s (both internal and external) and computer expansion boards such as [[Dialogic telephony cards]]. The only notable exception who never natively supported TAPI was the Avaya Communication Manager, which relied solely on the [[TSAPI]] interface for connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100141354 Programmer’s Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] systems provide TAPI-compliant modem interfaces. TAPI compatible PBX solutions include [[Aastra]] (400/800), [[Aastra]] (MX-ONE),  [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] (OXO/OXE),  [[Avaya]] (BCM, IP Office), [[Cisco]] (Call Manager),  [[Ericsson-LG]] (eMG80, iPECS, ipLDK),  NEC-Philips (iS3000, IPC100/500), [[NEC]] (SL1000, SV8100/9100), Nitsuko (DXE600/328), [[Panasonic]] (KX-TDA/TDE/NCP, KX-NS1000), [[Samsung]] (OfficeServ), [[Unify GmbH &amp; Co. KG|Unify]] (3000/4000, Openscape Office), [[ShoreTel]], [[Wildix]], and [[ZyXEL]] (X6004/X2002).

Third party drivers are often available for the telephone systems that don't have drivers made by the manufacturers.

'''Economic history''' is the academic study of [[Economy|economies]] or economic events of the past. Research is conducted using a combination of [[historical method]]s, [[statistical methods]] and the [[Applied economics|application of economic theory]] to historical situations and [[institution]]s. The field can encompass a wide variety of topics, including equality, finance, technology, labor, and business. It emphasizes historicizing the economy itself, analyzing it as a dynamic force and attempting to provide insights into the way it is structured and conceived.

Using both [[quantitative data]] and [[Qualitative data|qualitative sources]], economic historians emphasize understanding the historical context in which major economic events take place. They often focus on the institutional dynamics of systems of [[Production (economics)|production]], [[Wage labour|labor]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]], as well as the economy's impact on society, culture, and language. Scholars of the discipline may approach their analysis from the perspective of different [[schools of economic thought]], such as [[mainstream economics]], [[Marxian economics]], the [[Chicago school of economics]], and [[Keynesian economics]].

Sub-disciplines of the field include [[Template:History of finance|financial]] and [[business history]], which overlaps with areas of [[social history]] such as [[Historical demography|demographic]] and [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history]]. The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] ([[econometric]]) study of economic history is also known as [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, &quot;Cliometrics&quot; by Robert Whaples in S. Durlauf and L. Blume (eds.), ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd ed. (2008). [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000173&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Economic%20history&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have recently re-engaged with the study of economic history in a new field calling itself [[history of capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rockman |first1=Seth |title=What Makes the History of Capitalism Newsworthy? |journal=Journal of the Early Republic |date=2014 |volume=34 |issue=3|pages=439–466 |doi=10.1353/jer.2014.0043 |s2cid=143866857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history of the discipline==
[[File:Economic History Department, 1971 (3925741729).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Economic history department, London School of Economics (1971)]]
In late-nineteenth-century Germany, scholars at a number of universities, led by [[Gustav von Schmoller]], developed the [[Historical school of economics|historical school of economic history]]. It argued that there were no universal truths in history, emphasizing the importance of historical context without quantitative analysis. This historical approach dominated German and French scholarship for most of the 20th century. The [[historical school of economics]] included other economists such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] who reasoned that careful analysis of human actions, cultural norms, historical context, and mathematical support was key to historical analysis. The approach was spread to Great Britain by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]] ([[University of Oxford]]) and dominated [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economic history]] for much of the 20th century. Britain's first professor in the subject was [[George Unwin]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name=MaxBODNB&gt;[[Maxine Berg|Berg, Maxine L.]] (2004) ‘Knowles , Lilian Charlotte Anne (1870–1926)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45651, accessed 6 Feb 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MBerg&gt;Berg, M. (1992). The first women economic historians. ''The Economic History Review'', 45(2), 308–329.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in France, economic history was heavily influenced by the [[Annales School]] from the early 20th century to the present. It exerts a worldwide influence through its journal ''[[Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, &quot;Achievements of the Annales school.&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' 38.01 (1978): 58–76. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2119315 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating economic history as a discrete academic discipline has been a contentious issue for many years. Academics at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] had numerous [[London School of Economics#LSE vs. Cambridge|disputes]] over the separation of economics and economic history in the [[interwar era]]. Cambridge economists believed that pure economics involved a component of economic history and that the two were inseparably entangled. Those at the LSE believed that economic history warranted its own courses, research agenda and academic chair separated from mainstream economics. In the initial period of the subject's development, the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the [[Economic History Society]] had its inauguration at [[London School of Economics|LSE]] in 1926 and the [[University of Cambridge]] eventually established its own economic history programme.

In the United States, the field of economic history was largely subsumed into other fields of economics following the [[Cliometrics|cliometric revolution]] of the 1960s. To many it became seen as a form of [[applied economics]] rather than a stand-alone discipline. [[Cliometrics]], also known as the New Economic History, refers to the systematic use of economic theory and [[econometrics|econometric]] techniques to the study of economic history. The term was originally coined by Jonathan R. T. Hughes and [[Stanley Reiter]] and refers to [[Clio]], who was the [[muse]] of history and heroic poetry in [[Greek mythology]]. One of the most famous cliometric economic historians is [[Douglass North]], who argued that it is the task of economic history to elucidate the historical dimensions of economies through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Structure and Performance: The Task of Economic History|last1=North|first1=Douglass C.|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|year = 1978|volume = 16|issue = 3|pages = 963–978|jstor = 2723471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliometricians argue their approach is necessary because the application of theory is crucial in writing solid economic history, while historians generally oppose this view warning against the risk of generating anachronisms.

Early cliometrics was a type of [[counterfactual history]]. However, counterfactualism was not its distinctive feature; it combines neoclassical economics with quantitative methods in order to explain human choices based on constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=North|first1=Douglass C.|date=1978|title=Structure and Performance: The Task of Economic History|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=16|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that cliometrics had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s and that it is now neglected by economists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|year=2010|title=Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?|journal=Historically Speaking|volume=11|issue=2|pages=17–20 &amp; 20–27 (responses)|doi=10.1353/hsp.0.0109|s2cid=162209922}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to North and [[Robert Fogel]]'s [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 1993, [[Harvard University]] [[economist]] Claudia Goldin argued that:&lt;blockquote&gt;economic history is not a handmaiden of economics but a distinct field of scholarship. Economic history was a scholarly discipline long before it became cliometrics. Its practitioners were economists and historians studying the histories of economies... The new economic history, or cliometrics, formalized economic history in a manner similar to the injection of mathematical models and statistics into the rest of economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldin|first1=Claudia|date=1995|title=Cliometrics and the Nobel|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=9|issue=2|pages=191–208|doi=10.1257/jep.9.2.191|s2cid=155075681|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:30703876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The relationship between economic history, economics and history has long been the subject of intense discussion, and the debates of recent years echo those of early contributors. There has long been a school of thought among economic historians that splits economic history—the study of how economic phenomena evolved in the past—from historical economics—testing the generality of economic theory using historical episodes. US economic historian [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] explained this position in his 1990 book ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Kindleberger (1990), [http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft287004zv;brand=ucpress ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''], University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky]] ([[University of Cambridge]]) argued that [[economic theory]] often employs ahistorical models and methodologies that do not take into account historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFgrJa5X56g|title=Economic History – How &amp; How NOT to Do Economics with Robert Skidelsky|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] economist [[Irving Fisher]] already wrote in 1933 on the relationship between economics and economic history in his &quot;[[Debt deflation|Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions]]&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The study of dis-equilibrium may proceed in either of two ways. We may take as our unit for study an actual historical case of great dis-equilibrium, such as, say, the panic of 1873; or we may take as our unit for study any constituent tendency, such as, say, deflation, and discover its general laws, relations to, and combinations with, other tendencies. The former study revolves around events, or facts; the latter, around tendencies. The former is primarily economic history; the latter is primarily economic science. Both sorts of studies are proper and important. Each helps the other. The panic of 1873 can only be understood in light of the various tendencies involved—deflation and other; and deflation can only be understood in the light of various historical manifestations—1873 and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Irving|date=1933|title=Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions|journal=Econometrica|volume=1|issue=4|pages=337–38|doi=10.2307/1907327|jstor=1907327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Scope and focus of the discipline today ==
The past three decades have witnessed the widespread closure of separate economic history departments and programmes in the UK and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Blum|first1=Matthias|title=Introduction, or Why We Started This Project|date=2018|work=An Economist’s Guide to Economic History|pages=1–10|editor-last=Blum|editor-first=Matthias|series=Palgrave Studies in Economic History|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-96568-0_1|isbn=978-3-319-96568-0|last2=Colvin|first2=Christopher L.|editor2-last=Colvin|editor2-first=Christopher L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] retains a separate economic history department and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate programme in economic history. [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[London School of Economics|LSE]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's]], and [[University of Warwick|Warwick]] together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the British [[Universities in the United Kingdom|higher education system]] today, but do so as part of economics or history degrees. Meanwhile, there have never been specialist economic history graduate programs at universities anywhere in the US. However, economic history remains a special field component of leading economics PhD programs, including [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Harvard University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].

Despite the pessimistic view on the state of the discipline espoused by many of its practitioners, economic history remains an active field of social scientific inquiry. Indeed, it has seen something of a resurgence in interest since 2000, perhaps driven by research conducted at universities in continental Europe rather than the UK and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/network-analysis-economic-history|title=The past's long shadow: A network analysis of economic history|last=Galofré Vilà|first=Gregori|date=13 January 2020|website=VoxEU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the growth in economic history is driven by the continued interest in big policy-relevant questions on the history of economic growth and development. [[MIT]] [[economist]] Peter Temin noted that development economics is intricately connected with economic history, as it explores the growth of economies with different technologies, innovations, and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliometrie.org/images/wp/AFC_WP_04_2018.pdf |last1=Diebolt |first1=Claude |last2=Haupert |first2=Michael |title=We are Ninjas: How Economic History has Infiltrated Economics |website=American Economic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying economic growth has been popular for years among economists and historians who have sought to understand why some economies have grown faster than others. Some of the early texts in the field include [[Walt Whitman Rostow]]'s ''[[Rostow's stages of growth|The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto]]'' (1971) which described how advanced economies grow after overcoming certain hurdles and advancing to the next stage in development. Another economic historian, [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], complicated this theory with works on how economies develop in non-Western countries, as discussed in ''Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective: A Book of Essays'' (1962). A more recent work is [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]]'s ''[[Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty]]'' (2012) which pioneered a new field of persistence studies, emphasizing the path-dependent stages of growth. Other notable books on the topic include [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]'s ''[[The Great Divergence|The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy]]'' (2000) and [[David S. Landes]]'s ''[[The Wealth and Poverty of Nations|The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor]]'' (1998).

In recent decades, and notably since the [[Global financial crisis|global financial crisis of 2007–2008]], scholars have recently become more interested in a field which may be called ''new'' new economic history. Scholars have tended to move away from narrowly quantitative studies toward institutional, [[Social history|social]], and [[cultural history]] affecting the evolution of economies.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass C.

Conversely, economists in other specializations have started to write a new kind of economic history which makes use of historical data to understand the present day.&lt;ref group=&quot;a&quot;&gt;For example: [[Carmen M. Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth S. Rogoff]] (2009),  ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly''. Princeton.

The book described the rise in [[Wealth inequality|wealth]] and [[income inequality]] since the 18th century, arguing that large concentrations of wealth lead to social and economic instability. Piketty also advocated a system of global [[Wealth tax|progressive wealth taxes]] to correct rising inequality. The book was selected as a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best seller]] and received numerous awards. The book was well received by some of the world's major economists, including [[Paul Krugman]], [[Robert Solow]], and [[Ben Bernanke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/upshot/now-that-ben-bernanke-is-blogging-heres-what-he-should-write-about.html|title=The New York Times|last1=Irwin|first1=Neil|website=Now That Ben Bernanke Is Blogging, Here’s What He Should Write About|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books in response to Piketty's book include ''After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality'', by Heather Boushey, J.

In addition to the mainstream in economic history, there is a parallel development in the field influenced by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Marxian economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heller |first1=Henry |title=A Marxist History of Capitalism |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meek |first1=Ronald L. |title=Studies in the Labour Theory of Value |date=1956 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used historical analysis to interpret the role of class and class as a central issue in history. He debated with the &quot;classical&quot; economists (a term he coined), including [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. In turn, Marx's legacy in economic history has been to critique the findings of neoclassical economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Anthony |title=The Marxist Tradition in the History of Economics |journal=Project Muse |url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~pmachala/endnotelibs/Endnote%20Bibliography/MarxSeminar/Marx%20for%2007%20students/Marxcourse-general-archive.Data/PDF/Brewer,The%20Marxist%20Tradition%20in%20the%20History%20of%20Economics-0597073408/Brewer,The%20Marxist%20Tradition%20in%20the%20History%20of%20Economics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist analysis also confronts [[economic determinism]], the theory that economic relationships are the foundation of political and societal institutions. Marx abstracted the idea of a &quot;capitalist mode of production&quot; as a way of identifying the transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Jon S. |title=The Achievements of Economic History: The Marxist School |journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=1978 |volume=38 |issue=1|pages=29–57 |doi=10.1017/S002205070008815X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has influenced some scholars, such as [[Maurice Dobb]], to argue that feudalism declined because of peasants' struggles for freedom and the growing inefficiency of feudalism as a system of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dobb |first1=Maurice |title=Studies in the Development of Capitalism |date=1946 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, in what was later coined the [[Brenner debate]], [[Paul Sweezy]], a Marxian economist, challenged Dob''s definition of feudalism and its focus only on [[western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sweezy |first1=Paul |title=The Transition From Feudalism To Capitalism |journal=Science &amp; Society |date=1950 |volume=14 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

==History of capitalism==
{{main|History of capitalism}}
A new field calling itself the &quot;history of capitalism&quot; has emerged in US history departments since about the year 2000. It includes many topics traditionally associated with the field of economic history, such as insurance, banking and regulation, the political dimension of business, and the impact of capitalism on the middle classes, the poor and women and minorities. The field has particularly focused on the contribution of slavery to the rise of the US economy in the nineteenth century. The field utilizes the existing research of [[business history]], but has sought to make it more relevant to the concerns of history departments in the United States, including by having limited or no discussion of individual business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer Schuessler &quot;In History Departments, It’s Up With Capitalism&quot; [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/education/in-history-departments-its-up-with-capitalism.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' April 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Galambos|Lou Galambos]], &quot;Is This a Decisive Moment for the History of Business, Economic History, and the History Of Capitalism? ''[[Essays in Economic &amp; Business History]]'' (2014) v. 32 pp. 1–18 [http://www.ebhsoc.org/journal/index.php/journal/article/download/271/253 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have critiqued the history of capitalism because it does not focus on systems of production, circulation, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adelman |first1=Jeremy |last2=Levy |first2=Jonathan |title=The Fall and Rise of Economic History |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-FallRise-of-Economic/150247 |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized its lack of social scientific methods and its ideological biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hilt |first1=Eric |s2cid=41971400 |title=Economic History, Historical Analysis, and the &quot;New History of Capitalism&quot; |journal=The Journal of Economic History |year=2017 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=511–536 |doi=10.1017/S002205071700016X |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a new academic journal, ''[https://cap.pennpress.org/about/masthead/ Capitalism: A Journal of History and Economics]'', was founded at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] under the direction of Marc Flandreau ([[University of Pennsylvania]]), Julia Ott ([[The New School|The New School, New York]]) and Francesca Trivellato ([[Institute for Advanced Study|Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]]) to widen the scope of the field. The journal's goal is to bring together &quot;historians and social scientists interested in the material and intellectual aspects of modern economic life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Capitalism and History |url=https://history.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/01/Capitalism-and-History-.pdf |website=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of capitalism have countered these critiques, citing the issues with economic history. As [[University of Chicago]] professor of history Jonathan Levy states, &quot;modern economic history began with industrialization and urbanization, and, even then, environmental considerations were subsidiary, if not nonexistent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=Jonathan |title=Capital as Process and the History of Capitalism |journal=Business History Review |date=2017|volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=483–510 |doi=10.1017/S0007680517001064 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic journals and societies==
The first journal specializing in the field of economic history was ''[[The Economic History Review]]'', founded in 1927, as the main publication of the [[Economic History Society]]. The first journal featured a publication by Professor Sir [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], the first Professor of Economic History in the English-speaking world, who described the emerging field of economic history. The discipline existed alongside long-standing fields such as [[political history]], [[religious history]], and [[military history]] as one that focused on humans' interactions with 'visible happenings'. He continued, '[economic history] primarily and unless expressly extended, the history of actual human practice with respect to the material basis of life. The visible happenings with regard-to use the old formula-to &quot;the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth&quot; form our wide enough field'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashley |first1=William |title=The Place of Economic History in University Studies |journal=The Economic History Review |date=1927 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/2590667 |jstor=2590667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[Economic History Association]] established another academic journal, ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'', in 1941 as a way of expanding the discipline in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heaton |first1=Herbert |title=The Early History of the Economic History Association |journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=1941 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president of the Economic History Association, [[Edwin F. Gay]], described the aim of economic history was to provide new perspectives in the economics and history disciplines: 'An adequate equipment with two skills, that of the historian and the economist, is not easily acquired, but experience shows that it is both necessary and possible'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gay |first1=Edwin F. |title=The Tasks of Economic History |journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=1941 |volume=1|pages=9–16 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700052128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related academic journals have broadened the lens with which economic history is studied. These interdisciplinary journals include the ''[[Business History Review]]'', ''[[European Review of Economic History]]'', ''[[Enterprise and Society]]'', and ''[[Financial History Review]]''.

The ''International Economic History Association'', an association of close to 50 member organizations, recognizes some of the major academic organizations dedicated to study of economic history: the [[Business History Conference]], [[Economic History Association]], [[Economic History Society]], [[Eabh|European Association of Business Historians]], and the [[International Social History Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Members |url=http://www.ieha-wehc.org/members.html |website=International Economic History Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman antiquity===
[[Ancient Greek]] architectural, clothing and coin designs are replete with single or interlinking swastika motifs. There are also gold plate [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] from the 8th century BCE decorated with an engraved swastika.&lt;ref&gt;Biers, W.R. 1996. ''The Archaeology of Greece'', p. 130. Cornell University Press, Ithaca/London.&lt;/ref&gt; Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the cross, the three-legged triskele or [[triskelion]] and the rounded [[lauburu]]. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially ''gammadion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1990.26.0822 |title=Perseus:image:1990.26.0822 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=26 February 1990 |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rather the tetra-gammadion. The name ''gammadion'' comes from its being seen as being made up of four Greek gamma (Γ) letters. Ancient Greek architectural designs are replete with the interlinking symbol.

In [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greco-Roman]] art and architecture, and in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. The swastika often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill. A meander of connected swastikas makes up the large band that surrounds the [[Augustus|Augustan]] [[Ara Pacis]].

A design of interlocking swastikas is one of several [[tessellation]]s on the floor of the [[Amiens Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Amiens]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ferré. &quot;[http://www.labyrinth-enterprises.com/amiens.html Amiens Cathedral]&quot;. ''Labyrinth Enterprises''. Constructed from 1220 to 1402, Amiens Cathedral is the largest [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] cathedral in France, a popular tourist attraction and since 1981 a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. During World War I, [[Amiens]] was targeted by German forces but remained in Allied territory following the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].&lt;/ref&gt; A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Malkin. &quot;[http://romanbristol.tripod.com/avon/tockington.html Tockington Park Roman Villa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040521150446/http://romanbristol.tripod.com/avon/tockington.html |date=21 May 2004 }}&quot;. ''The Area of Bristol in Roman Times''. 9 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of [[meander (art)|meander]], and the individual swastikas in such a border are sometimes called [[Meander (art)|''Greek keys'']]. There have also been swastikas found on the floors of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;Lara Nagy, Jane Vadnal, &quot;Glossary Medieval Art and Architecture&quot;, [http://www.pitt.edu/~medart/menuglossary/greekkey.htm &quot;Greek key or meander&quot;], [[University of Pittsburgh]] 1997–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illyrians===
The swastika was widespread among the [[Illyrians]], symbolizing the Sun. The Sun cult was the main Illyrian cult; the Sun was represented by a swastika in clockwise motion, and it stood for the movement of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stipčević|first=Aleksandar|title=The Illyrians: history and culture|year=1977|publisher=Noyes Press|isbn= 978-0815550525|pages=182, 186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=swastika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenia===
[[File:Armenian Khachkar with Swastikas Sanahin Armenia 1.jpg|thumb|[[Khachkar]] with swastikas [[Sanahin]], [[Armenia]]]]
In [[Armenia]] the swastika is called the &quot;[[arevakhach]]&quot; and &quot;kerkhach&quot; ({{lang-hy|կեռխաչ}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Concise Armenian Encyclopedia p. 663&quot; /&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2014}} and is the ancient symbol of eternity and eternal light (i.e. God). Swastikas in [[Armenia]] were founded on petroglyphs from the copper age, predating the Bronze Age. During the Bronze Age it was depicted on [[cauldron]]s, belts, [[medallion]]s and other items.&lt;ref&gt;T. Wilson [https://archive.org/details/theswastika00wilsuoft The swastika, the earlist known symbol and its migrations], pp. 807, 951&lt;/ref&gt; Among the oldest petroglyphs is the seventh letter of the Armenian alphabet – Է – &quot;E&quot; (which means &quot;is&quot; or &quot;to be&quot;) – depicted as a half-swastika.

Swastikas can also be seen on early Medieval churches and fortresses, including the principal tower in Armenia's historical capital city of [[Ani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Concise Armenian Encyclopedia p. 663&quot; /&gt; The same symbol can be found on [[Armenian carpet]]s, cross-stones ([[khachkar]]) and in medieval manuscripts, as well as on modern monuments as a [[Armenian eternity sign|symbol of eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Epec69LGa0IC&amp;q=symbol+of+eternity+modern+armenia&amp;pg=PA148|title=Armenia|isbn=978-1841623450|last1=Holding|first1=Nicholas|last2=Holding|first2=Deirdre|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

In Christianity, the swastika is used as a hooked version of the [[Christian Cross]], the symbol of Christ's victory over death. Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kyiv]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8YNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Basilica+of+St.+Ambrose+in+Milan+swastika&amp;pg=PA541|title=The Open Court|last=Carus|first=Paul|date=1907|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.

Swastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].

In the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.&lt;ref name=&quot;distedu.ru&quot; /&gt; Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.
The swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century the swastika was one of the Russian Empire's symbols, and was used on coinage as a backdrop to the [[Coat of arms of Russia#1721–1917: Russian Empire|Russian eagle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;klk.pp.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klk.pp.ru/2007/01/26/svastika_istoricheskie_korni.html |author=Vladimir Nikolaevich|title=The Swastika, the historical roots|publisher=Klk.pp.ru |language=Russian |date= |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ruskolan.xpomo.com&quot; /&gt;

===Africa===
Swastikas can be seen in various African cultures. In [[Ethiopia]] the Swastika is carved in the window of the famous 12th Century rock-hewn church [[Lalibela]].
In Ghana, the swastika is among the [[adinkra symbols]] of the [[Akan people]]s. Called ''nkontim'', swastikas could be found on [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] [[Akan goldweights|gold weights]] and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Polakoff.

In the Western world, the symbol experienced a resurgence following the archaeological work in the late 19th century of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who discovered the symbol in the site of ancient [[Troy]] and associated it with the ancient migrations of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], whose proto-language was not coincidentally termed &quot;Proto-Indo-Germanic&quot; by German language historians. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorized that the swastika was a &quot;significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors&quot;, linking it to ancient [[Teutons]], Greeks of the time of [[Homer]] and Indians of the [[Vedas|Vedic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Schliemann, H, ''Troy and its remains'', London: Murray, 1875, pp. 102, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/072900tank-swastika.html|title=One of the World's Great Symbols Strives for a Comeback|first=Sarah|last=Boxer|date=29 June 2000|accessdate=7 May 2012 |publisher=The New York Times|work=Think Tank}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, it was used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck and success.

Schliemann's work soon became intertwined with the political ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' movements, which used the swastika as a symbol for the &quot;[[Aryan race]]&quot; – a concept that theorists such as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] equated with a [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[master race]] originating in northern Europe. Since its adoption by the [[Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], the swastika has been associated with Nazism, fascism, racism in its ([[white supremacy]]) form, the [[Axis powers]] in World War II, and [[the Holocaust]] in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of neo-Nazi groups.

The Benedictine choir school at [[Lambach Abbey]], Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal [[coat of arms]] of Abbot [[Theoderich Hagn]] of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitas-international.org/holocaust/1889-99t.htm Holocaust Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120801224433/http://www.humanitas-international.org/holocaust/1889-99t.htm |date=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

===Europe===
====Britain====
[[File:Theosophicalsealfrench.svg|thumb|Theosophical Seal]]
In the 1880s the [[Theosophical Society]] adopted a swastika as part of its seal, along with an [[Om]], a hexagram or [[star of David]], an [[Ankh]] and an [[Ouroboros]]. Unlike the much more recent [[Raëlian movement]], the Theosophical Society symbol has been free from controversy, and the seal is still used. The current seal also includes the text &quot;There is no religion higher than truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ts-adyar.org/content/emblem-or-seal|title=Emblem or the Seal &amp;#124; TS Adyar|website=www.ts-adyar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The British author and poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] used the symbol on the cover art of a number of his works, including ''[[The Five Nations]]'', 1903, which has it twinned with an elephant.

====Denmark====
[[File:Elefantporten Ny Carlsberg.jpg|thumb|250px|Carlsberg's [[Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg|Elephant Tower]].]]
The Danish brewery company [[Carlsberg Group]] used the swastika as a logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/carlsberg,swastika |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710060411/http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/carlsberg,swastika |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=Flickr Album; &quot;Probably the Best Photo's of Swastikas in the World&quot; |publisher=Fiveprime.org |date= |accessdate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 19th century until the middle of the 1930s when it was discontinued because of association with the Nazi Party in neighbouring Germany. In [[Copenhagen]] at the entrance gate, and tower, of the company's headquarters, built in 1901, swastikas can still be seen. The tower is supported by four stone elephants, each with a swastika on each side. The tower they support is topped with a spire, in the middle of which is a swastika.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergdanmark.dk/omos/historie/ijacobsensfodspor/valby/pages/elefanttaarnet.aspx|title=Carlsberg Group Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
The [[Swastika Laundry]] was a laundry founded in 1912, located on Shelbourne Road, [[Ballsbridge]], a district of [[Dublin]], Ireland. In the fifties [[Heinrich Böll]] came across a van belonging to the company while he was staying in Ireland, leading to some awkward moments before he realized the company was older than Nazism and totally unrelated to it. The chimney of the boiler-house of the laundry still stands, but the laundry has been redeveloped.&lt;ref name=&quot;IT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comehere&quot; /&gt;

====Finland====
[[File:Mursunsydämet.svg|thumb|{{lang|fi|Tursaansydän/Mursunsydämet}} variants.]]
In Finland, the swastika ({{lang|fi|vääräpää}} meaning 'crooked-head', and later {{lang|fi|hakaristi}}, meaning 'hook-cross') was often used in traditional folk-art products, as a decoration or magical symbol on textiles and wood. The swastika was also used by the [[Finnish Air Force]] until 1945, and is still used on air force flags.

The {{lang|fi|[[tursaansydän]]}}, an elaboration on the swastika, is used by [[Scouting|scouts]] in some instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pitva.partio.net |title=Partiolippukunta Pitkäjärven Vaeltajat ry |work=Pitva.Partio.net |date= |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a student organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kainuun Kerho |url= http://ppo.osakunta.fi/kainuunkerho/ |title=Kainuun Kerho |work=PPO.Osakunta.fi |date=18 September 2009 |access-date=2 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091005010249/http://ppo.osakunta.fi/kainuunkerho/ |archive-date=5 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish village of Tursa&lt;!--There's also one in Latvia.--&gt; uses the {{lang|fi|tursaansydän}} as a kind of a certificate of authenticity on products made there, and is the origin of this name of the symbol (meaning 'heart of Tursa'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tursa.fi/info/tursaansydan.html |title=Tursan Sydän |work=Tursa.fi |language=fi |date=2007 |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also known as the {{lang|fi|mursunsydän}} ('walrus-heart').

The [[Finnish Air Force]] used the swastika as an emblem, introduced in 1918, until January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Allen|first=Claudia|date=2020-07-01|title=Finland's air force quietly drops swastika symbol|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53249645|access-date=2020-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of swastika adopted by the air-force was the symbol of luck for the Swedish count [[Eric von Rosen]], who donated one of its earliest aircraft; he later became a prominent figure in the Swedish nazi-movement.

The swastika was also used by the women's paramilitary organization [[Lotta Svärd]], which was banned in 1944 in accordance with the [[Moscow Armistice]] between Finland and the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Soviet Union]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

The [[President of Finland]] is the grand master of the [[Order of the White Rose]]. According to the protocol, the president shall wear the Grand Cross of the White Rose with collar on formal occasions. The original design of the collar, decorated with 9 swastikas, dates from 1918 and was designed by the artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]. The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president [[Urho Kekkonen]] in 1963 after it became known that the [[President of France]] [[Charles De Gaulle]] was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.

Also a design by Gallen-Kallela from 1918, the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty|Cross of Liberty]] has a swastika pattern in its arms.

In December 2007, a silver replica of the World War II-period Finnish air defence's relief ring decorated with a swastika became available as a part of a charity campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rautasormus.fi |title=Campaign site rautasormus.fi (campaign now closed) |publisher=Rautasormus.fi |date= |access-date=2 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221232818/http://www.rautasormus.fi/ |archive-date=21 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original war-time idea was that the public swap their precious metal rings for the state air defence's relief ring, made of iron.

In 2017, the old logo of Finnish Air Force Command with Swastika was replaced by a new logo showing golden eagle and a circle of wings. However, the logo of Finland's air force academy still keeps the swastika symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finland's air force quietly drops swastika symbol |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53249645 |accessdate=3 July 2020 |work=BBC News |date=1 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional symbols of the Podhale Rifles include the [[edelweiss]] flower and the Mountain Cross, a swastika symbol popular in folk culture of the Polish mountainous regions.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

====Sweden====
[[File:ASEA logo pre 1933.jpg|thumb|120px|ASEA logo before 1933.]]
The Swedish company [[ASEA]], now a part of [[ABB]], in the late 1800s introduced a company [[logo]] featuring a swastika. The logo was replaced in 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[Germany]]. During the early 1900s, the swastika was used as a symbol of electric power, perhaps because it resembled a [[waterwheel]] or [[turbine]]. On maps of the period, the sites of hydroelectric [[power station]]s were marked with swastikas.

====Norway====
[[File:Lysverker 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Wrought iron gate of the Oslo Municipal Power Station, 1931]]
The headquarters of the [[Oslo]] Municipal [[Power station|Power Station]] was designed by architects ''Bjercke and Eliassen'' in 1928–31. Swastikas adorn its wrought iron gates. The architects knew the swastika as a symbol of ''electricity'' and were probably not yet aware that it had been usurped by the German Nazi party and would soon become the foremost symbol of the German [[Reich]]. The fact that these gates survived the cleanup after the [[German occupation of Norway]] during [[WW II]] is a testimony to the innocence and good faith of the power plant and its architects. The architects Bjercke and Eliassen knew the swastika as a symbol of power plants on maps in Scandinavia, and as the logo of Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget, ASEA.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Are Tvedt (ed.) (2010). ''Oslo Byleksikon''. Kunnskapsforlaget. Entry: Sommerrogata, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
The swastika motif is found in some traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art and iconography. Historically, the design has been found in excavations of [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]-era sites in the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River]] valleys, and on objects associated with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.)]]. It is also widely used by a number of [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] tribes, most notably the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], and [[Plains Indians|plains nations]] such as the [[Dakota people|Dakota]]. Among various tribes, the swastika carries different meanings. To the [[Hopi]] it represents the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it is one symbol for the whirling log (''tsin náálwołí''), a sacred image representing a legend that is used in healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Dottie Indyke. &quot;[http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa086.shtml The History of an Ancient Human Symbol]&quot;. 4 April 2005. originally from ''The Wingspread Collector's Guide to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]'', Volume 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A brightly colored [[First Nations]] saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Photo and text, [http://www.royalsaskmuseum.ca/research/faqs/ex_8.shtml &quot;Why is there a Swastika on the saddle in the First Nations Gallery?&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118021210/http://www.royalsaskmuseum.ca/research/faqs/ex_8.shtml |date=18 January 2006 }}, Royal [[Saskatchewan]] Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Passamaquoddy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe, now located in the state of [[Maine]] and in [[Canada]], used an elongated swastika on their war canoes in the American colonial period as well as later.&lt;ref&gt;Adney, Edwin Tappan and Chapelle, Howard I.

Before the 1930s, the symbol for the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division of the United States Army]] was a red diamond with a yellow swastika, a tribute to the large Native American population in the southwestern United States. It was later replaced with a [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]] symbol.

A swastika shape is a symbol in the culture of the [[Kuna (people)|Kuna people]] of [[Kuna Yala]], Panama. In Kuna tradition it symbolizes the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainforestart.com/creationch.htm ''Chants and Myths about Creation''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031033352/http://www.rainforestart.com/creationch.htm |date=31 October 2005 }}, from Rainforest Art. Retrieved 25 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1925, the Kuna revolted vigorously against Panamanian suppression of their culture, and in 1930 they assumed autonomy. The flag they adopted at that time is based on the swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Kuna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years: red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added to the center of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panama - Native Peoples&quot; /&gt;

The town of [[Swastika, Ontario|Swastika, Ontario, Canada]], and the hamlet of [[Swastika, New York]] were named after the symbol.

From 1909 to 1916, the K-R-I-T automobile, manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, used a right-facing swastika as their trademark.

The swastika was widely used in Europe at the start of the 20th century. It symbolized many things to the Europeans, with the most common symbolism being of good luck and auspiciousness.&lt;ref name=holocaust2009 /&gt; In the wake of [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|widespread popular usage]], in [[Weimar Republic|post-World War I Germany]], the newly established [[Nazi Party]] formally adopted the swastika in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007453|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|title=History of the Swastika|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/03/18/mysterious-wwii/|last=A.|first=Aleksandra|title=Planted in 1933 this mysterious forest swastika remained unnoticed until 1992 – it was then quickly cut down|date=18 March 2018|publisher=The Vintage News|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emblem was a black swastika rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the party's flag, badge, and armband.

In his 1925 work {{lang|de|[[Mein Kampf]]}}, Adolf Hitler writes that: &quot;I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black hooked cross in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the hooked cross.&quot;

When Hitler created a flag for the Nazi Party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and &quot;those revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honor to the German nation&quot;. (Red, white, and black were the colors of the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1867–1918)|flag of the old German Empire]].) He also stated: &quot;As National Socialists, we see our program in our flag. In red, we see the social idea of the movement; in white, the nationalistic idea; in the hooked cross, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt |title=text of ''Mein Kampf'' at Project Gutenberg of Australia |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swastika was also understood as &quot;the symbol of the creating, effecting life&quot; ({{lang|de|das Symbol des schaffenden, wirkenden Lebens}}) and as &quot;race emblem of Germanism&quot; ({{lang|de|Rasseabzeichen des Germanentums}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walther Blachetta: {{lang|de|Das Buch der deutschen Sinnzeichen}} (The book of German sense characters); reprint of 1941; p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

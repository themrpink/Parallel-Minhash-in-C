      <text bytes="6973" xml:space="preserve">In [[optics]], an '''index-matching material''' is a substance, usually a liquid, cement (adhesive), or [[gel]], which has an [[index of refraction]] that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.).

When two substances with the same index are in contact, light passes from one to the other with neither [[fresnel reflection|reflection]] nor [[refraction]]. As such, they are used for various purposes in science, engineering, and art.

For example, in a popular home experiment, a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index-matched transparent fluid such as [[mineral spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optics4kids.org/home/content/classroom-activities/medium/lose-a-glass-in-a-glass/ Optics For Kids - &quot;Lose a glass in a glass&quot; home experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In microscopy==
{{main|Oil immersion}}

In [[optical microscope|light microscopy]], oil immersion is a technique used to increase the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of a [[microscope]]. This is achieved by immersing both the [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] and the specimen in a transparent oil of high [[refractive index]], thereby increasing the [[numerical aperture]] of the objective lens.

Immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and [[viscosity]] characteristics necessary for use in microscopy. Typical oils used have an [[index of refraction]] around  1.515.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/anatomy/immersion.html &quot;Microscope Objectives: Immersion Media&quot;] by Mortimer Abramowitz  and Michael W. Davidson, ''[[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] Microscopy Resource Center'' (website), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way. The index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass, and of the [[cover slip]].

For more details, see the main article, [[oil immersion]]. Some microscopes also use other index-matching materials besides oil; see [[water immersion objective]] and [[solid immersion lens]].

==In fiber optics==
In fiber optics and [[telecommunications]], an index-matching material may be used in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see [[Optical fiber connector]]). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as −14&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] (i.e., 14&amp;nbsp;dB below the optical power of the incident [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is 28&amp;nbsp;dB plus twice the fiber loss below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog [[baseband]] [[Amplitude|intensity]]-modulated [[video]] signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital [[optical receiver]] except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a [[Distributed Feedback Laser]] may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as −10&amp;nbsp;dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.

For some applications, instead of standard polished connectors (e.g. FC/PC), angle polished connectors (e.g. FC/APC) may be used, whereby the non-perpendicular polish angle greatly reduces the ratio of reflected signal launched into the guided mode even in the case of a fiber-air interface.

==In experimental fluid dynamics==
{{main|Fluid dynamics}}

Index matching is used in liquid-liquid and liquid-solid ([[Multiphase flow]]) experimental systems to minimise the distortions that occur in these systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of solid–fluid selection options for optical-based measurements in single-phase liquid, two-phase liquid–liquid and multiphase solid–liquid flows|authors=Wright, S.F., Zadrazil, I. &amp; Markides, C.N.|journal=Experiments in Fluids |year=2017|volume=58 |issue=9|pages=108|bibcode=2017ExFl...58..108W|doi=10.1007/s00348-017-2386-y|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly important for systems with many interfaces which become optically inaccessible. Matching the refractive index minimises [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[diffraction]] and rotations that occurs at the interfaces allowing access to regions that would otherwise be inaccessible to optical measurements. This is particularly important for advanced optical measurements like [[Laser-induced fluorescence]], [[Particle image velocimetry]] and [[Particle tracking velocimetry]] to name a few.

==In art conservation==
{{see also|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
If a sculpture is broken into several pieces, [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|art conservators]] may reattach the pieces using an adhesive such as [[Paraloid B-72]] or [[epoxy]]. If the sculpture is made of a transparent or semitransparent material (such as glass), the seam where the pieces are attached will usually be much less noticeable if the refractive index of the adhesive matches the refractive index of the surrounding object. Therefore, art conservators may measure the index of objects and then use an index-matched adhesive. Similarly, losses (missing sections) in transparent or semitransparent objects are often filled using an index-matched material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Controlling the refractive index of epoxy adhesives |authors=John M. Messinger and Peter T. Lansbury |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic28-02-006.html |journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation |year=1989 |volume=28 |number=2 |pages=127–136|doi=10.2307/3179485 |jstor=3179485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In optical component adhesives==
Certain optical components, such as a [[Wollaston prism]] or [[Nicol prism]], are made of multiple transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other. The adhesive is usually index-matched to the pieces. Historically, [[Canada balsam]] was used in this application, but it is now more common to use [[epoxy]] or other synthetic adhesives.

[[File: Coupling Coefficient.gif|thumb|300px|k is the [[Inductance#Coupling coefficient|coupling coefficient]], Le1 and Le2 is the [[leakage inductance]], M1 (M2) is the mutual inductance]]
[[File:Lamp powered by induction 1910.jpg|thumb|Example of inductive coupling, 1910. The bottom coil is connected to AC power. The alternating magnetic field through the top coil induces current in it which lights the lamp.]]

In [[electrical engineering]], two [[electrical_conductor|conductors]] are said to be '''inductively coupled''' or '''magnetically coupled''' &lt;ref&gt;Zverev, A.I.:&quot;Handbook of filter synthesis&quot;. Wiley New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; when they are configured such that a change in current through one wire [[Faraday's law of induction|induces]] a voltage across the ends of the other wire through [[electromagnetic induction]].  A changing current through the first wire creates a changing [[magnetic field]] around it by [[Ampere's circuital law]].  The changing magnetic field induces an [[electromotive force]] (EMF or [[voltage]]) in the second wire by [[Faraday's law of induction]].  The amount of inductive coupling between two conductors is measured by their [[mutual inductance]].  

The coupling between two wires can be increased by winding them into [[electromagnetic coil|coils]] and placing them close together on a common axis, so the magnetic field of one coil passes through the other coil.  Coupling can also be increased by a [[magnetic core]] of a [[ferromagnetic]] material like iron or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] in the coils, which increases the magnetic flux.   The two coils may be physically contained in a single unit, as in the primary and secondary windings of a [[Transformer types#.27Interstage.27 and coupling transformers|transformer]], or may be separated.  Coupling may be intentional or unintentional. Unintentional inductive coupling can cause signals from one circuit to be induced into a nearby circuit, this is called [[crosstalk|cross-talk]], and is a form of [[electromagnetic interference]].

An inductively coupled [[transponder]] consists of a solid state [[transceiver]] chip connected to a large coil that functions as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].  When brought within the oscillating magnetic field of a reader unit, the transceiver is powered up by energy inductively coupled into its antenna and transfers data back to the reader unit inductively.  

Magnetic coupling between two [[magnet]]s can also be used to mechanically transfer power without contact, as in the [[magnetic gear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/motorsdrives/could-magnetic-gears-make-wind-turbines-say-goodbye-mechanical-gearboxes|title= Could Magnetic Gears Make Wind Turbines Say Goodbye to Mechanical Gearboxes? |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Inductive coupling is widely used throughout electrical technology; examples include:
* [[Electric motor]]s and [[Electrical generator|generators]]
* [[Inductive charging]] products
* [[Induction cooker]]s and [[induction heating]] systems
* [[Induction loop]] communication systems
* [[Metal detectors]]
* [[Radio-frequency identification]]
* [[Transformer]]s
* [[Wireless power transfer#Inductive coupling|Wireless power transfer]]

==Low-frequency induction==
Low-frequency induction can be a dangerous form of inductive coupling when it happens inadvertently. For example, if metal long-distance [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] is installed along a [[right of way]] in parallel with a high-voltage power line, the power line can induce current on the pipe. Since the pipe is a conductor, insulated by its protective coating from the earth, it acts as a secondary winding for a long, drawn out transformer whose primary winding is the power line. Voltages induced on the pipe are then a hazard to people operating valves or otherwise touching metal parts of the metal pipeline.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Reducing low-frequency magnetic fields may be necessary when dealing with electronics, as sensitive circuits in close proximity to an instrument with a power transformer could begin to display 60Hz pickup. Twisted wires are an effective way of reducing the interference as signals induced in the successive twists cancel. Using magnetic shielding is also an effective way of reducing unwanted inductive coupling, though moving the source of the magnetic field away from sensitive electronics is the simplest solution if possible. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Paul |last2=Hill |first2=Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics Second Edition |date=1989 |publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Caimbridge |isbn=0521370957 |page=456 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521370957 |accessdate=19 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although induced currents can be harmful, they can also be helpful. Electrical distribution line engineers use inductive coupling to tap power for cameras on towers and at substations that allow remote monitoring of the facilities. Using this they can watch from anywhere and not need to worry about changing camera batteries or solar panel maintenance.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In [[telecommunication]]s, an '''information-bearer channel''' is one of: 

#A [[communication channel]] capable of transmitting all the [[information]] required for communication, such as [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[data]], [[synchronizing]] sequences, and control signals. The information-bearer channel may operate at a higher data rate than that required for user data alone. 
#A basic [[telecommunication|communications]] channel with the [[necessary bandwidth]] but without enhanced or value-added services.

A transaction is a change of state, an '''information-transfer transaction''' is a transaction in which one of the following changes occurs: content, ownership, location, format, etc. An information-transfer transaction usually consists of three consecutive phases called the [[access phase]], the [[information transfer]] phase, and the [[disengagement phase]]. Examples of these consecutive phases are the copying and transporting of information. Once a transaction occurs there are also costs to consider, which are associated with that certain transaction. When it comes to the transfer of information some [[transaction cost]]s include time and means (money).

==History of Information-transfer transactions==
There are many social systems and devices that have contributed to information-transfer transactions; starting from people writing letters using postal systems to emailing using [[information technology]]. Two main examples of information-transfer transactions technology development is the copying and transportation of information.

==History of Copying==
{{Main|Copying}}
Copying is the process of duplicating information with the change of location or format of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through copying has been going on for ages and there has been many advances in technology to decrease the time it takes to make copies of said information. The art of copying started with people having to write a copy out by hand, then the [[printing press]], all the way to [[digital copying]] with [[ICTs]]. These developments lead to quicker information-transfer transactions in the form of distributing copies of original information to others through a changes of location or format.

==History of Transporting==
{{Main|Transport}}
Transporting is the movement of information with the change of location or ownership of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through transporting has been going on for ages and there has been social and technological developments to decrease the time it takes for information to change ownership or location.  The transportation of information started with people sending letters by foot, then by horse, the public and international postal service, all the way down to technology networks. It is these developments which led to the ability to send information further and quicker through information-transfer transactions.

==Transaction Costs==
{{Main|Transaction cost}}
Every time a transaction occurs, there are always costs to be considered. In the case of information-transfer transactions, one most consider the costs of time and means (money). Both of these costs are corollated with one another in that to decrease one, you must increase the other.  For example, say Person #1 sends a letter through the [[mail]], while Person #2 sends letters through [[email]]. For Person #1 to send their letter they had to buy paper, means of writing, envelopes, stamps, etc., while Person #2 needed to buy a source of electricity, internet, computer technology, etc. to send an email. It seems like Person #1 has lower transaction costs then Person #2 in terms of means; however, when you look at both information-transfer transactions in terms of time that is a different story. For Person #1 although they had little costs in sending their letter, the time it takes for the transfer of that letter is about 3+ days, while Person #2's transfer through email happens in less than minutes, but they endured high mean costs. Therefore, for information-transfer transaction times to decrease, the costs of means have to increase and vice versa.

==Telecommunication==
In [[telecommunication]], an '''information-transfer transaction''' is a coordinated [[sequence]] of [[User (telecommunications)|user]] and [[telecommunications system]] actions that cause [[information]] present at a [[source user]] to become present at a destination user.

{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}

In [[telecommunications]], '''insertion loss''' is the loss of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] [[power (physics)|power]] resulting from the insertion of a device in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]] and is usually expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  

If the power transmitted to the load before insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the power received by the load after insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, then the insertion loss in dB is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;IL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm T \over P_\mathrm R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electronic filters==

Insertion loss is a [[figure of merit]] for an [[electronic filter]] and this data is generally specified with a filter.  Insertion loss is defined as a ratio of the signal level in a test configuration without the filter installed (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|) to the signal level with the filter installed  (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|).  This ratio is described in [[decibel|dB]] by the following equation:

The transverse de-focusing effect of this radial field gradient is compensated by ridges on the magnet faces which vary the field azimuthally as well. This allows particles to be accelerated continuously, on every period of the [[radio frequency]] (RF), rather than in bursts as in most other accelerator types. This principle that alternating field gradients have a net focusing effect is called [[strong focusing]]. It was obscurely known theoretically long before it was put into practice.&lt;ref name=lhthomas&gt;{{cite journal

The [[TRIUMF]] cyclotron mentioned below is the largest with an outer orbit radius of 7.9&amp;nbsp;metres, extracting protons at up to 510&amp;nbsp;MeV, which is 3/4 of the speed of light. The [[Paul Scherrer Institute|PSI]] cyclotron reaches higher energy but is smaller because of using a higher magnetic field.

==Usage==
For several decades, cyclotrons were the best source of high-energy beams for [[nuclear physics]] experiments; several cyclotrons are still in use for this type of research. The results enable the calculation of various properties, such as the mean spacing between atoms and the creation of various collision products. Subsequent chemical and particle analysis of the target material may give insight into [[nuclear transmutation]] of the elements used in the target.

Cyclotrons can be used in [[particle therapy]] to treat [[cancer]]. Ion beams from cyclotrons can be used, as in [[proton therapy]], to penetrate the body and kill tumors by [[radiation poisoning|radiation damage]], while minimizing damage to healthy tissue along their path.
Cyclotron beams can be used to bombard other atoms to produce short-lived [[positron]]-emitting isotopes suitable for [[PET imaging]].
More recently some cyclotrons currently installed at hospitals for radio isotopes production have been retrofitted to enable them to produce [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Advantages and limitations==
[[File:Cyclotron with glowing beam.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Lawrence's 60-inch cyclotron, circa 1939, showing the beam of accelerated [[ion]]s (likely [[proton]]s or [[deuteron]]s) exiting the machine and ionizing the surrounding air causing a blue glow.]]

The cyclotron was an improvement over the [[linear accelerator]]s (''linac''s) that were available when it was invented, being more cost- and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. In the 1920s, it was not possible to generate the high power, high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs (generated by [[klystron]]s). As such, impractically long linac structures were required for higher-energy particles. The compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well, such as foundations, radiation shielding, and the enclosing building. Cyclotrons have a single electrical driver, which saves both money and power. Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high.

The curving metal frame is the magnet's core, the large cylindrical boxes contain the coils of wire that generate the magnetic field. The vacuum chamber containing the &quot;dee&quot; electrodes is in the center between the magnet's poles.]]

The [[spiral]] path of the cyclotron beam can only &quot;sync up&quot; with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. If the particles become fast enough that [[Special Relativity|relativistic]] effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field, and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent of the speed of light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the [[isochronous cyclotron]]s, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the [[synchrocyclotron]]s, either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex [[synchrotron]] or modern, [[klystron]]-driven [[linear accelerator]]s, both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.

==Notable examples==
One of the world's largest cyclotrons is at the [[RIKEN]] laboratory in Japan. Called the SRC or Superconducting Ring Cyclotron, it has six separated superconducting sectors, and is 19&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and 8&amp;nbsp;m high. Built to accelerate heavy ions, its maximum magnetic field is 3.8&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]], yielding a bending ability of 8&amp;nbsp;T·m. The total weight of the cyclotron is 8,300&amp;nbsp;t. The Riken magnetic field covers from 3.5&amp;nbsp;m radius to 5.5&amp;nbsp;m with the maximum beam radius of about {{convert|5|m|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. It has accelerated uranium ions to 345&amp;nbsp;MeV per atomic mass unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

[[TRIUMF]], Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics, houses the world's largest cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/largest-cyclotron/|title=Largest cyclotron|work=guinnessworldrecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18&amp;nbsp;m diameter, 4,000&amp;nbsp;t main magnet produces a field of 0.46&amp;nbsp;T while a 23&amp;nbsp;MHz 94&amp;nbsp;[[volt|kV]] electric field is used to accelerate the 300&amp;nbsp;μA beam. The TRIUMF field goes from {{convert|0|to|320|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} radius with the maximum beam radius of {{convert|310|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Its large size is partly a result of using negative hydrogen ions rather than protons; this requires a lower magnetic field to reduce EM stripping of the loosely bound electrons. The advantage is that extraction is simpler; multi-energy, multi-beams can be extracted by inserting thin carbon stripping foils at appropriate radii. TRIUMF is run by a consortium of eighteen Canadian universities and is located at the University of British Columbia.

==Related technologies==
The spiraling of electrons in a cylindrical vacuum chamber within a transverse magnetic field is also employed in the [[magnetron]], a device for producing high frequency radio waves ([[microwaves]]). The [[synchrotron]] moves the particles through a path of constant radius, allowing it to be made as a pipe and so of much larger radius than is practical with the cyclotron and [[synchrocyclotron]]. The larger radius allows the use of numerous magnets, each of which imparts angular momentum and so allows particles of higher velocity (mass) to be kept within the bounds of the evacuated pipe. The magnetic field strength of each of the bending magnets is increased as the particles gain energy in order to keep the bending angle constant.

==In fiction==
The [[United States Department of War]] famously asked for dailies of the Superman comic strip to be pulled in April 1945 for having Superman bombarded with the radiation from a cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes cowls and the creation of comic book culture|author1=Laurence Maslon|author2=Michael Kantor|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, however, in ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'', [[Lex Luthor]] uses a cyclotron to start an earthquake.

      <text bytes="9398" xml:space="preserve">'''Radius of gyration''' or '''gyradius''' of a body about an [[axis of rotation]] is defined as the radial distance to a point which would have a [[moment of inertia]] the same as the body's actual distribution of mass, if the total mass of the body were concentrated there.

Mathematically the [[radius]] of [[gyration]] is the [[root mean square]] distance of the object's parts from either its [[center of mass]] or a given axis, depending on the relevant application. It is actually the perpendicular distance from point mass to the axis of rotation. One can represent a trajectory of a moving point as a body. Then radius of gyration can be used to characterize the typical distance travelled by this point.
 
Suppose a body consists of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; particles each of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, r_3, \dots , r_n&lt;/math&gt; be their perpendicular distances from the axis of rotation. Then, the moment of inertia &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of the body about the axis of rotation is
  
:&lt;math&gt;I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 + \cdots + m_n r_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
 
If all the masses are the same (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;), then the moment of inertia is &lt;math&gt;I=m(r_1^2+r_2^2+\cdots+r_n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Since &lt;math&gt;m = M/n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; being the total mass of the body),
 
:&lt;math&gt;I=M(r_1^2+r_2^2+\cdots+r_n^2)/n&lt;/math&gt;
 
From the above equations, we have
 
:&lt;math&gt;MR_g^2=M(r_1^2+r_2^2+\cdots+r_n^2)/n&lt;/math&gt;
 
Radius of gyration is the root mean square distance of particles from axis formula
 
:&lt;math&gt;R_g^2=(r_1^2+r_2^2+\cdots+r_n^2)/n&lt;/math&gt;
 
Therefore, the radius of gyration of a body about a given axis may also be defined as the root mean square distance of the various particles of the body from the axis of rotation. Also known as a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed about its Axis of Rotation.

==Applications in structural engineering==
In [[structural engineering]], the two-dimensional radius of gyration is used to describe the distribution of [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] area in a column around its [[centroid]]al axis with the mass of the body. The radius of gyration is given by the following formula:  

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} = \frac{I}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{g}} = \sqrt{ \frac {I} {A} }&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]] and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the total cross-sectional area. 

The gyration radius is useful in estimating the stiffness of a column. If the principal moments of the two-dimensional [[gyration tensor]] are not equal, the column will tend to [[buckling|buckle]] around the axis with the smaller principal moment. For example, a column with an [[ellipse|elliptical]] cross-section will tend to buckle in the direction of the smaller semiaxis.

In [[engineering]], where continuous bodies of matter are generally the objects of study, the radius of gyration is usually calculated as an integral.

==Applications in mechanics==
The radius of gyration about a given axis (&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{g}\text{ axis}}&lt;/math&gt;) can be computed in terms of the [[mass moment of inertia]] &lt;math&gt;I_\text{axis}&lt;/math&gt; around that axis, and the total mass ''m'';

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{g}\text{ axis}}^{2} = \frac{I_\text{axis}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;r_{\mathrm{g}\text{ axis}} = \sqrt{ \frac{I_\text{axis}}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I_\text{axis}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], and is not the moment of inertia [[tensor]].

==Molecular applications==
In [[polymer physics]], the radius of gyration is used to describe the dimensions of a [[polymer]] [[ideal chain|chain]].  The radius of gyration of a particular molecule at a given time is defined as &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fixman|first=Marshall|date=1962|title=Radius of Gyration of Polymer Chains|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=36|issue=2|pages=306–310|doi=10.1063/1.1732501|bibcode=1962JChPh..36..306F}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;
  R_\mathrm{g}^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ 
  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{r}_k - \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{mean} \right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{mean}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] position of the monomers.
As detailed below, the radius of gyration is also proportional to the root mean square distance between the monomers:

:&lt;math&gt;
  R_\mathrm{g}^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ 
  \frac{1}{2N^2} \sum_{i,j} \left( \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j \right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

As a third method, the radius of gyration can also be computed by summing the principal moments of the [[gyration tensor]].

Since the chain [[Chemical structure|conformations]] of a polymer sample are quasi infinite in number and constantly change over time, the &quot;radius of gyration&quot; discussed in polymer physics must usually be understood as a mean over all polymer molecules of the sample and over time.  That is, the radius of gyration which is measured as an ''average'' over time or [[Ensemble average|ensemble]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
  R_{\mathrm{g}}^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ 
  \frac{1}{N} \left\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{r}_k - \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{mean} \right)^2 \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

where the angular brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[ensemble average]].

An entropically governed polymer chain (i.e. in so called theta conditions) follows a random walk in three dimensions. The radius of gyration for this case is given by

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{g} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}\ } \ \sqrt{N}\ a&lt;/math&gt;

Note that although &lt;math&gt;aN&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[contour length]] of the polymer, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is strongly dependent of polymer stiffness and can vary over orders of magnitude. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is reduced accordingly.

One reason that the radius of gyration is an interesting property is that it can be determined experimentally with [[static light scattering]] as well as with [[Small-angle neutron scattering|small angle neutron-]] and [[Small-angle X-ray scattering|x-ray scattering]]. This allows theoretical polymer physicists to check their models against reality.
The [[hydrodynamic radius]] is numerically similar, and can be measured with [[Dynamic Light Scattering]] (DLS).

===Derivation of identity===
To show that the two definitions of &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{g}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; are identical, 
we first multiply out the summand in the first definition:

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{r}_{k} - \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} \right)^{2} = 
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left[ \mathbf{r}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{k} + 
\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} 
 - 2 \mathbf{r}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out the summation over the last two terms and using the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}}&lt;/math&gt; gives the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   
-\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mean}} + 
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{r}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{k} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications in geographical data analysis==
In data analysis, the radius of gyration is used to calculate many different statistics including the spread of geographical locations. These locations have recently been collected from social media users to investigate the typical mentions of a user. This can be useful for understanding how a certain group of users on social media use the platform.

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{\mathrm{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}m_i(r_i-r_{C})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}m_i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

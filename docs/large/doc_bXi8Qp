===Millennium===
During the 1999–2000 season, Feyenoord participated in the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the second time. This time, the club managed to finish second in their group, behind [[Rosenborg BK]] and ahead of [[Borussia Dortmund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zanzi&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035235/http://www.zanziball.it/en/26/a50.html Champions League 1999/2000 Standings and results], zanziball.it&lt;/ref&gt; Feyenoord reached the second group stage and secured wins against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] (home) and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] (away). [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won both clashes and, as a result, Feyenoord had to win their last group match away to Marseille to reach the knockout stages. The final result was 0–0, and Feyenoord were eliminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;zanzi&quot;/&gt;

Feyenoord again participated in the Champions League in [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|2001–02]], finishing third in a group containing [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070718055613/http://www.zanziball.it/en/26/1033.html Champions League 2001/02 Standings and results], zanziball.it&lt;/ref&gt; This meant Feyenoord continued their European season in the [[2001–02 UEFA Cup]] instead of the second Champions League group stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa2002&quot;&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UEFACup/history/Season=2001/intro.html Van Hooijdonk fires Feyenoord up], uefa.com&lt;/ref&gt; The disappointment of failing to reach the second group stage eventually resulted in optimism and celebration. By defeating [[SC Freiburg]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], Feyenoord faced fellow Dutch club PSV in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa2002&quot;/&gt; Both matches ended in 1–1 draws, and the clash went into extra time and a penalty shoot-out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voetbalstats.nl/ec/1390.html UEFA Cup 2002 – Feyenoord-PSV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827010344/http://www.voetbalstats.nl/ec/1390.html |date=27 August 2007 }}, voetbalstats.nl&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], who had a superb season by scoring many free-kicks goals, secured Feyenoord's win by scoring a 90th-minute equalizer before finishing PSV off by scoring the last goal in the penalty shoot-out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.planet.nl/~rapo/psv/europacup/uefacup.html PSV in de UEFA Cup], planet.nl&lt;/ref&gt; A 1–0 win in [[Milan]] against [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and a 2–2 return match in Rotterdam then earned Feyenoord a spot in [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|the final]], against Borussia Dortmund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-english-football-archive.com/non_domestic_competitions/results/uefa_cup/2002.htm UEFA Cup Results/Fixtures 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120051648/http://www.the-english-football-archive.com/non_domestic_competitions/results/uefa_cup/2002.htm |date=20 November 2006 }}, the-English-football-archive.com&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the final was held at De Kuip, and as a result, most spectators inside the stadium were Feyenoord fans. Feyenoord took a 2–0 lead thanks to another free-kick goal and a penalty by Van Hooijdonk.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa2002&quot;/&gt; Early in the second half, [[Márcio Amoroso]] scored a goal to make it 2–1. [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] then made it 3–1 and things looked good for Feyenoord.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa2002&quot;/&gt; Dortmund only managed to score one more goal and the cup was won by [[Bert van Marwijk]]'s Feyenoord.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa2002&quot;/&gt;

A huge party erupted in and outside De Kuip not only because of the title, but also because the final was held several days after Rotterdam's political figure [[Pim Fortuyn]] was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1972447.stm Low-key plans for Uefa final], bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans were still full of emotion, before and after the match. As a result of Fortuyn's murder, the cup was not officially celebrated in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xsi.cheeseheadz.net/feyenoord/ Feyenoord UEFA Cup Finale 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814071329/http://xsi.cheeseheadz.net/feyenoord/ |date=14 August 2006 }}, cheeseheadz.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 UEFA Cup win was the start of a long dry spell for Feyenoord. In the [[2002–03 Eredivisie|2002–03 season]], the club finish third in the Eredivisie, as well as reach [[2003 KNVB Cup Final|the final]] of the [[2002–03 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], which was lost 1–4 to [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]]. However, in the following years, Feyenoord disappointed in both the Eredivisie and KNVB Cup.

In between, in 2002 Feyenoord and chairman Jorien van den Herik were both found [[Acquittal|not guilty]]. Following the [[prosecutor]]'s appeal, and despite three years of investigations, the trial verdict was upheld. Nonetheless, the prosecution stated it would not yet abandon its case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://int.soccerway.com/news/2002/november/29/feyenoord-cleared-of-fraud Feyenoord cleared of fraud], soccerway.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2005–06 Eredivisie|2005–06 season]] ended in disappointment for Feyenoord. The team pursued the Dutch championship for most of the season, but eventually lost out to champions PSV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foot.dk/Holstilling.asp?SeasonID=108 Eredivisie 2005/06], foot.dk&lt;/ref&gt; The newly created Dutch play-offs then proved to be gloomy for Feyenoord. Ajax, which finished several points behind in the regular league, were Feyenoord's opponent in the play-offs. Ajax outclassed them and Feyenoord lost out on a Champions League place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajax-usa.com/matches/m05-06/feyenoord-s-play-off-nightmare-comes-true-at-arena-3-0.html Feyenoord's play-off nightmare came true at ArenA: 3–0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025155240/http://www.ajax-usa.com/matches/m05-06/feyenoord-s-play-off-nightmare-comes-true-at-arena-3-0.html |date=25 October 2006 }}, ajax-usa.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07 season]], the nightmare grew even bigger. The supporters saw their two star players leave to Chelsea ([[Salomon Kalou]]) and Liverpool ([[Dirk Kuyt]]). At the same time, it became clear Feyenoord were in an appalling financial state despite earlier comments made by chairman Jorien van den Herik, who claimed that the club was financially healthy. Supporters' unrest grew into anger when Feyenoord bought [[Angelos Charisteas]], a back-up striker of arch-rivals Ajax, with a poor track record, as a replacement for Dirk Kuyt. After continuous protests, Van den Herik resigned and the club began managerial reforms. However, the worst was not over. Feyenoord were banned from European competition following hooliganism prior to and during a match against [[AS Nancy|Nancy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UEFACup/FixturesResults/Round=2365/match=85046/Report=RP.html Feyenoord sink as Nancy roar], uefa.com&lt;/ref&gt; despite an appeal by the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/6241919.stm Court upholds Spurs' Uefa Cup bye], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended in bitter disappointment with a seventh-place finish, causing Feyenoord to miss European football for the first time in 16&amp;nbsp;years. While desperate supporters started preparing for a Dark Age, the club surprised friend and foe in the 2007 summer transfer window. A brilliant performance of young Dutch left back [[Royston Drenthe]] at the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had established. The club appointed former manager Bert van Marwijk and was able to make a number of high-profile signings, including [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Roy Makaay]]. Despite the efforts, Feyenoord underperformed once again in the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]], finishing in a disappointing sixth place. The pain was relieved by claiming the first prize in six years: 100&amp;nbsp;years after the foundation of the club, Feyenoord managed to win the [[2007–08 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] after defeating Roda JC 2–0. As Van Marwijk accepted a job as manager of the national team, Feyenoord appointed [[Gertjan Verbeek]] as their manager for the 2008–09 season.

===Financial problems===
In the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]], Feyenoord celebrated their 100th birthday and organised many events throughout the year. The old &quot;golden logo&quot; returned as Feyenoord's official logo, which had earlier been presented at the 2007 New Year's brunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feyenoordleven.nl/feyenoord100jaar.html Feyenoord 100 jaar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225155/http://www.feyenoordleven.nl/feyenoord100jaar.html |date=27 September 2007}}, feyenoordleven.nl&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, a historical tournament was held between Feyenoord and the three opponents they met in the European Cup finals – Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham Hotspur and Celtic – named the [[Feyenoord Jubilee Tournament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;feyenoord100&quot;&gt;[http://www.ad.nl/sport/article1004946.ece Borussia, Spurs en Celtic naar Kuip], ad.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through the season, manager Verbeek was sacked due to disappointing league results. His assistant, Leon Vlemmings, took over as manager. The results in this period improved slightly, resulting in securing a spot in the playoffs for the final Dutch Europa League slot.

For the [[2009–10 Feyenoord season|2009–10 season]], Feyenoord appointed former assistant manager and Feyenoord footballer [[Mario Been]] to take over from Vlemmings. Been, after achieving minor European successes with NEC, was considered the ideal candidate for the job. Former manager Leo Beenhakker, at the time manager of the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]], took over as technical director. Partly because of this position, Beenhakker was able to attract more investors to the club, leading to some unexpected signings, including [[Sekou Cissé]], [[Dani Fernández (footballer, born 1983)|Dani Fernández]] and [[Stefan Babović]].

On 24 October 2010, Feyenoord lost heavily to PSV 10–0. In mid-January 2011, Beenhakker resigned after multiple clashes with the Feyenoord directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/1892970/2011/01/17/Leo-Beenhakker-stapt-zelf-op-bij-Feyenoord.dhtml Beenhakker stapt op], AD.nl&lt;/ref&gt; His replacement was former Feyenoord player [[Martin van Geel]], who at the time was working as technical director for fellow Eredivisie club Roda JC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwslog.nl/2011/02/24/martin-van-geel-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-feyenoord/ van Geel nieuwe technisch directeur] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120906032607/http://www.nieuwslog.nl/2011/02/24/martin-van-geel-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-feyenoord/ |date=6 September 2012}}, nieuwslog.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, a majority of players in the squad voted to oust Been as club manager; 13 of 18 players voted they had lost all confidence in Been's ability to successfully manage the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feyenoordreport.nl/2011/07/14/dit-zijn-de-feyenoorders-die-mario-been-hebben-weggestemd/ Feyenoorders die hebben gestemd] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231521/http://feyenoordreport.nl/2011/07/14/dit-zijn-de-feyenoorders-die-mario-been-hebben-weggestemd/ |date=25 April 2012}}, feyenoordreport.nl&lt;/ref&gt; Been's subsequent sacking became global news, if only because reports of Been's firing quickly became a trending topic on Twitter, leaving people around the world to wonder who exactly Been was.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/255919-vertrek-mario-been-wereldnieuws.html Vertrekt Been wereldnieuws], NOS.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

After Louis van Gaal turned down an offer to manage Feyenoord, the club approached former Barcelona defender [[Ronald Koeman]], who had played for Feyenoord during the late 1990s. With his eventual hiring as manager, Koeman became the first to ever serve as both player and head coach at all teams of the so-called &quot;[[Big Three (Netherlands)|traditional big three]]&quot; of Dutch football: Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. Moreover, he played and managed these teams in the same order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/sport/2570054/ronald-koeman-nieuwe-trainer-feyenoord.html Koemand nieuwe trainer Feyenoord], nu.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[2011–12 Feyenoord season|2011–12 season]], Feyenoord lost valuable players [[Leroy Fer]], [[Georginio Wijnaldum]] and [[André Bahia]] to [[FC Twente|Twente]], PSV and [[Samsunspor]] respectively. In return, the club restocked with players such as [[Jordy Clasie]], [[Miquel Nelom]], [[Guyon Fernandez]] and [[Kaj Ramsteijn]], who came mostly from their own youth academy. Two other players were loaned, [[John Guidetti]] from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Otman Bakkal]] from PSV. Feyenoord started the season well and played the first match of the Eredivisie against the other Rotterdam club in the league, Excelsior. Feyenoord ended the season by placing second in the Eredivisie, resulting in the third qualifying round for Champions League football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/220566/Feyenoord-tweede-na-logische-zege-op-SC-Heerenveen.htm |title=Cookies op VI.nl |website=www.vi.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2011, it was revealed that Feyenoord had been placed in the more favorable second category (Categorie 2), meaning Feyenoord were no longer in debt, according to the KNVB. They achieved the reclassification following the transfer of several significant players and a large capital injection made by the organisation VVF (Friends of Feyenoord, Vrienden Van Feyenoord). However, to remain in the second category, Feyenoord needed to obtain the same number of points earned, rounding up to at least 65&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=16/12/11 07:37 |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/3079368/2011/12/16/Feyenoord-heeft-voldoende-punten-voor-Categorie-2.dhtml |title=Feyenoord heeft voldoende punten voor Categorie 2 – Home – AD |language=nl |publisher=Ad.nl |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2012, Feyenoord was officially out of what has been described as the &quot;financial dangerzone&quot; and was officially placed in the second category.

Feyenoord was therefore demoted to [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|the play-off round]] of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]]. Koeman said that Feyenoord was the better side over the two legs but had missed a scoring striker, referring to John Guidetti, who had rejoined Manchester City following the end of his loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/404145-dinamo-schakelt-feyenoord-uit.html |title=Feyenoord redt het niet tegen Kiev – NOS Sport |publisher=Nos.nl |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2012, Dutch international and [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] defender [[Joris Mathijsen]] joined Feyenoord on a three-year contract. Málaga had made clear to Mathijsen that he needed to find a new club to generate income for the financially suffering Málaga after Sheikh Al Thani left. Stefan de Vrij remained captain, despite Mathijsen being more experienced at both international and club level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/225474/Medisch-goedgekeurde-Mathijsen-tekent-bij-Feyenoord.htm |title=Voetbal International – Medisch goedgekeurde Mathijsen tekent bij Feyenoord |publisher=Vi.nl |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After drawing the first leg of the Europa League qualifier at home 2–2 against [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]], Feyenoord was eliminated following a 2–0 loss in the second leg, meaning Feyenoord would not be playing European football in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportdome.nl/Nieuws/51962-Voorronde-EL--geen-Europees-voetbal-voor-Feyenoord.html |title=Voetbal – Voorronde EL: geen Europees voetbal voor Feyenoord |publisher=Sportdome.nl |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these events, Feyenoord loaned [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] and former AZ striker [[Graziano Pellè]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbal4u.com/2012/08/31/koeman-graziano-pelle-is-net-wat-we-nodig-hebben/ |title=Koeman: ‘Graziano Pelle is net wat we nodig hebben’ |publisher=Voetbal4u.com |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exchanged [[Jerson Cabral]] for Twente striker [[Wesley Verhoek]] in a straight player swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tijd |url=http://www.voetbalprimeur.nl/nieuws/item/feyenoord-en-twente-akkoord-over-ruil-cabral-verhoek |title='Feyenoord en Twente akkoord over ruil Cabral-Verhoek' &amp;#124; VoetbalPrimeur |language=nl |publisher=Voetbalprimeur.nl |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023120335/http://www.voetbalprimeur.nl/nieuws/item/feyenoord-en-twente-akkoord-over-ruil-cabral-verhoek |archive-date=23 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyenoord ended the season in third, behind champions [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and second-placed [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]. Pellè surprised many after scoring 27 goals in 29 matches, prompting Feyenoord to sign him permanently from Parma on a contract lasting until summer 2017.

In the [[2013–14 Eredivisie|2013–14 season]], Feyenoord recorded the worst start in its history, losing its first three matches to [[PEC Zwolle]], Twente and Ajax respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=194575 |title='Feyenoord beleeft slechtste seizoenstart ooit: 'Het is niet dramatisch'' |language=nl |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl |date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyenoord would recover, but its performances were unstable throughout the season. However, because the Eredivisie's other top teams also played inconsistently, Feyenoord remained in the title race, although it eventually finished second, four points behind Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.v-bal.nl/nieuws/259008/feyenoord-wint-ruim-van-cambuur-en-eindigt-tweede.html |title='Feyenoord wint ruim van Cambuur en eindigt tweede' |language=nl |publisher=V-bal.nl |date=27 April 2014 |access-date=31 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903054900/http://www.v-bal.nl/nieuws/259008/feyenoord-wint-ruim-van-cambuur-en-eindigt-tweede.html |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], Feyenoord was eliminated in the third qualifying round by [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]], making it Feyenoord's fifth consecutive season without European football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfvoetbal.nl/nieuws/291693_feyenoord-verliest-ook-thuis-van-krasnodar|title='Feyenoord verliest ook thuis van Krasnodar' |language=nl |publisher=Elfvoetbal.nl |date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2014, Ronald Koeman announced he would be resigning at the end of the season. On 3 March 2014, [[Fred Rutten]] was named the new manager for the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/3716249/rutten-volgt-koeman-bij-feyenoord.html|title='Rutten volgt Koeman op bij Feyenoord'|language=nl |publisher=nu.nl|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of the 2014–15 season, Feyenoord lost four of its best players: Daryl Janmaat to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Stefan de Vrij to Lazio, [[Bruno Martins Indi]] to [[FC Porto|Porto]] and Graziano Pellè to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], with Southampton having just appointed Koeman as its new manager. To replace them, as well as other departed players, Feyenoord signed [[Warner Hahn]] from [[FC Dordrecht|Dordrecht]], [[Luke Wilkshire]] from [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]], [[Khalid Boulahrouz]] from [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]], [[Bilal Başaçıkoğlu]] from [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]], [[Colin Kazim-Richards]] from [[Bursaspor]], [[Jens Toornstra]] from Utrecht, [[Kenneth Vermeer]] from Ajax and Karim El Ahmadi from Aston Villa, returning to the club after two years in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voetbal.com/teams/feyenoord/2015/6/|title='Feyenoord transfers 2014/2015'|language=nl |publisher=voetbal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With new players as well as a new head coach, Feyenoord began the [[2014–15 Eredivisie|2014–15 Eredivisie season]] with just five points after four matches. However, the club was successful in reaching [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage|the Europa League group stage]] for the first time in six years. After losing to [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Besiktas]] 5–2 aggregate in the third [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|qualifying round]] of the Champions League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/sport/06-08-2014/feyenoord-verliest-ook-istanbul|title='Feyenoord verliest ook in Istanbul'|language=nl |publisher=rijnmond.nl|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they defeated [[FC Zorya Luhansk|Zorya Luhansk]] in the final qualifying round of the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League play-off]], 5–4 aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/sport/28-08-2014/feyenoord-worstelt-zich-naar-groepsfase-europa-league|title='Feyenoord worstelt zich naar groepsfase Europa League'|language=nl|publisher=rijnmond.nl|date=28 August 2014|access-date=4 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831074132/http://www.rijnmond.nl/sport/28-08-2014/feyenoord-worstelt-zich-naar-groepsfase-europa-league|archive-date=31 August 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyenoord won with 2–1 against [[Standard Liège]] in their first home match in Group G of the Europa League. It was the first victory for Feyenoord in the Europa League group stage in eight years. Feyenoord also beat [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] (2–0) and defending champions [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] (2–0), results sufficient for Feyenoord's progress to the knockout round for the first time in ten years. In the knockout round, Feyenoord lost to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] 3–2 on aggregate. After this loss, Feyenoord did not recover. Despite nearly securing a spot in [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|next season's Europa League qualification rounds]], they failed to win any of their last five matches, ending the year in the fourth spot, behind AZ. In the play-offs to earn a spot for Europa League, they were eliminated by Heerenveen. After manager Fred Rutten opted not to extend his contract, on 23 March 2015 Feyenoord announced former Dutch international and Feyenoord player Giovanni van Bronckhorst would become its new manager. That summer the club contracted several new key players, [[Eric Botteghin]] from [[FC Groningen]], [[Jan-Arie van der Heijden]] from [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]], and [[Eljero Elia]] from [[SV Werder Bremen]]. It also welcomed back club legend [[Dirk Kuyt]] from [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] on a one-year contract.

After eight years without any prizes, Feyenoord won its 12th KNVB Cup on 24 April 2016. In the Eredivisie the team came third, a distance behind Ajax and the champions PSV. That next summer Feyenoord managed to do some good business in the transfer market. The contracts of starting players like Dirk Kuyt and Eljero Elia were extended. Furthermore, it acquired [[Nicolai Jørgensen]] from [[F.C. Copenhagen]] for €3,500,000 and [[Brad Jones (footballer)|Brad Jones]] was contracted on a free transfer from [[N.E.C.]] as a replacement for injured first-choice goalkeeper [[Kenneth Vermeer]].

The 2016/2017 season started perfectly, as the first nine league matches were won, and Feyenoord beat Manchester United F.C. 1–0 in the Europe League. That was with a little help from the referee as Nicolai Jørgensen, who gave the assist, was clearly offside. This match, and all of Feyenoord's European home games were played in only a half-full stadium. These measurements were taken to avoid new penalties from the UEFA. In that same week reigning Dutch champions PSV were beaten, 0–1. The first loss of points was against Ajax on 23 October 2016. The final score was 1–1 after goals of [[Kasper Dolberg]] and Dirk Kuyt. A week later another draw followed against [[SC Heerenveen]] On 6 November, a weakened team lost for the first time that season; relegation candidate [[Go Ahead Eagles]] won, 1-0] In the European campaign Feyenoord struggled, and after losses to Manchester United (4-0)and Fenerbahçe (0-1) the European adventure ended. In the Eredivisie the team booked big victories, such as a 6–1 defeat against Spartaand 0–4 against AZ. With a 5-point lead to second place Ajax, Feyenoord ended the year at the top of the league table.

The second half of the season, Feyenoord started strong, winning the first seven league games of 2017. However, in Arnhem, Vitesse proved to be too strong in the KNVB Cup (2-0). Feyenoord beat PSV at home (2-1)due, to an own goal from PSV-goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, which was indicated by [[Goal-line technology]]. On 5 March, Sparta was the first team to beat Feyenoord in the new year, by a goal in the first minute of the game, scored by [[Mathias Pogba]]. Feyenoord recovered quickly and another big win followed when they beat AZ, 5–2, and a week later SC Heerenveen were beat, 2–1. When Feyenoord lost to Ajax, and drew against PEC Zwolle, their lead was decreased to one point. After two more victories from Feyenoord, and a loss for number two Ajax against PSV, the gap was four points with two games to go. One week before the end of the competition, Feyenoord could become champions away at Excelsior, just 4 kilometers from their home stadium, De Kuip, and also in Rotterdam. However the team had a complete off-day and lost, 3–0. One week later, in the final game of the season, the team still became champions by beating Heracles by 3–1. All three goals were made by the team captain, Dirk Kuyt, who would later announce his retirement, making it a 'fairytail' last match on his account. The championship was Feyenoord's 15th and the first in 18 years. Feyenoord was the second team in the history of the Dutch league to stay at the top of the table the entire season. Because of the championship, Feyenoord was to compete for the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]] against cup winner Vitesse in the Kuip on 5 August 2017. After a 1–1 tie Feyenoord beat Vitesse by penalties.

As Dutch champion Feyenoord qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League group stage 2017/2018. They played in a group with [[Manchester City]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[SSC Napoli]]. Feyenoord lost the first 5 matches, but they won their last home match against Napoli (2-1). Feyenoord was not able to win the Dutch championship again, but they won the Dutch Cup after beating [[AZ Alkmaar]] in the final with 3–0.

===De Kuip===
{{Main|De Kuip}}
[[File:StadionFeyenoord.jpg|thumb|Outside the stadium.]]

The club's [[De Kuip|Feijenoord Stadion]], located in the IJsselmonde district of Rotterdam, is nicknamed ''De Kuip'', Dutch for ''The Tub''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/uefa_cup/1960050.stm Feyenoord revive glory days], bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1937 and is one of the major European stadiums.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;&gt;[http://www.vasf.nl/historie.php Stadion Feijenoord – historie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516173256/http://www.vasf.nl/historie.php |date=16 May 2007 }}, vasf.nl&lt;/ref&gt; It has 51,117 seats and has hosted a record of ten finals of [[UEFA]] club competitions, including the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final]] fittingly won by Feyenoord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadiumguide.com/europecupspecial.htm Stadiums European Cup finals], stadiumguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; Former Feyenoord player [[Mike Obiku]] once said, &quot;Every time you enter the pitch, you're stepping into a lion's home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; Feyenoord, however, does not own the stadium; it is an organisation on its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt;

In 1935, Feijenoord player [[Puck van Heel]] hit the first pole on their way into their new stadium. The stadium was opened on 27 March 1937 and [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Beerschot]] was beaten by 5–2, [[Leen Vente]] scored the first goal in De Kuip.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; Already in the very beginning the stadium was sold out on several occasions and other events held at de Kuip also gained high attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; During World War II, the stadium was one of the few locations which was not bombed, however the Nazis occupied the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; After the war, De Kuip became a popular location once again. In 1949, the attendance record was broken during the match to decide the Dutch championship between [[FC Dordrecht|SVV Schiedam]] and [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]]; 64,368 fans visited the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt;

Besides football, there were also [[boxing]] and [[motorcycle speedway]] races in De Kuip, which were also gaining popularity. In 1953, people had to hide inside the stadium during the [[North Sea flood of 1953]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; On 27 November 1957, Feyenoord played versus [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] during an evening match. It was the first time the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were taken in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; The players entered the pitch in the dark and the fans were asked to light their matchsticks when the floodlights were activated. Since that evening, that match at De Kuip has always been special among Feyenoord fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt;

In 1963, De Kuip hosted their first European final (Cup winners' Cup) between [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Atlético Madrid]]. Nine more European finals would follow in the years after with Feyenoord's win over Borussia Dortmund in the 2002 UEFA Cup final being the tenth and latest.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt; The attendance record of 1949 was broken in 1968 when 65,427 fans visited the Feyenoord–[[FC Twente|Twente]] match.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuiphist&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Stadion Feijenoord, P1010529.jpg|thumb|De Kuip in 2006]]

===New stadium===
In December 2006, Feyenoord director [[Chris Woerts]] announced that Feyenoord were developing plans to build a new stadium which would have a capacity of roughly 90,000 seats. The stadium would most likely be placed on the [[Nieuwe Maas]], the river that runs through Rotterdam, and should be completed by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/article376313.ece/Feyenoord_houdt_zijn_identiteit/ &quot;Feyenoord behoudt zijn identiteit], Volkskrant&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2008, Woerts announced further details: the club is aiming for a stadium with a capacity of around 100,000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kr.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=688510 &quot;Feyenoord To Build Europe’s Biggest Stadium&quot;], Goal.com&lt;/ref&gt; If possible, a capacity of over 130,000 should be realized according to Woerts, which would earn the title of biggest stadium in Europe. The club emphasized its efforts to make it a true football stadium with seats close to the pitch. The stadium will get a retractable roof so that other events can be held as well. According to plans in those days, the stadium should be ready in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved and the fact that the Netherlands were not chosen to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the plans for a new stadium have been put on hold. A new stadium will most likely be built in the future, though it will likely not have a spectator capacity greater than 70,000.

In September 2012, Feyenoord confirmed that there will arise a new stadium in 2018. The stadium will be built by builder [[VolkerWessels]], it will cost around €300&amp;nbsp;million (~£242&amp;nbsp;million). Another option was a plan made by a consortium of [[Royal BAM Group|BAM]], [[Eneco Energie]] and [[Siemens]]. But the plan was rejected by the Feyenoord and [[Stadion Feijenoord]] direction. The new stadium should be a 63,000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip. One of those initiatives are ''Red de Kuip'', which is Dutch for Save de Kuip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddekuip.nl|title=Home – RedDeKuip|website=www.reddekuip.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made plans of building a third tier on top of the current stadium, increasing the capacity to 68,000. This plan would cost only €117&amp;nbsp;million (~£94&amp;nbsp;million).

In 2016, Feyenoord announced their plans for a new stadium called Feyenoord City. The new stadium will have a capacity of 65,000. The city council agreed with the plans of Feyenoord City which also involve new sporting facilities, nightlife and renewed infrastructure. The old stadium 'De Kuip' will be transformed into an athletics track. The project is ought to be delivered in 2022.

===Stadium songs===

====Official Feyenoord hymn====
Feyenoord's official hymn since 1961 is called &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajax-usa.com/teams/feyenoord.html Feyenoord] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012722/http://www.ajax-usa.com/teams/feyenoord.html |date=2 February 2007 }}, ajax-usa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Its melody was written in the 19th century by German [[:de:Wilhelm Speidel (Musiker)|Wilhelm Speidel]].

The supporters of Feyenoord are said to be one of the most loyal supporter groups in the world supporting the team during both good or bad times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/NG153334060831-1414.htm Dirk Kuyt will be a sensation at Liverpool], liverpoolfc.tv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainbowhearts.co.uk/rotterdammed.html Rotterdammed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623062000/http://www.rainbowhearts.co.uk/rotterdammed.html |date=23 June 2007 }}, rainbowhearts.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; They are nicknamed ''Het Legioen'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''The Legion'' and can be found everywhere in The Netherlands and far across the Dutch borders.

A number of the club's followers acknowledge a very close link with English side [[Sunderland A.F.C.]], although it is an association that is often unwelcome and denied by the authorities. Over 100 Feyenoord supporters attended a function in Sunderland on the evening before their fixture with Newcastle in April 2015 and a similar number of Sunderland fans made the journey to watch the Dutch side in their ultimately delayed fixture against [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1724981-7-friendships-between-football-clubs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://rokerreport.sbnation.com/2018/11/22/18107742/meet-the-branches-chatting-to-the-boisterous-feyenoord-mackems-branch-of-sunderland-supporters&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Feyenoord Supporters Vereniging were wondering about whether or not it would be possible to create more atmosphere inside the stadium mainly during important matches. As a result, a few huge flags were produced and brought into the stadium prior to matches played by Feyenoord.&lt;ref name=&quot;tifoinfo&quot;&gt;[http://www.tifonet.nl/informatie.html TIFO Team Feyenoord Rotterdam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509222834/http://www.tifonet.nl/informatie.html |date=9 May 2007 }}, tifonet.nl&lt;/ref&gt; The flags were a success, but people started asking for more activities and a meeting between fans and officials were arranged. In 2000 [[Harry Veth]] was given permission to establish a group of five Feyenoord fans called TIFO team Feyenoord Rotterdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;tifoinfo&quot;/&gt; Besides creating more flags and small pieces of paper released from the second platform the team also started to organise bigger activities. The first big activity was held on 10 December 2000 when Feyenoord faced Ajax and 40 [[fog machine]]s were activated when the players entered the pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;tifoinfo&quot;/&gt; In the following years many different and various activities were held to improve the atmosphere inside the stadium. Feyenoord's TIFO team became famous abroad as well and the Italian TIFO foundation awarded Feyenoord the [[Best of TIFO Award]] 2000/01.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tifo.it/il_meglio/meglio_eng_00-01.html The best of TIFO 2000/01 TIFO Northstand Feyenoord] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707114325/http://www.tifo.it/il_meglio/meglio_eng_00-01.html |date=7 July 2007 }}, tifo.it&lt;/ref&gt;

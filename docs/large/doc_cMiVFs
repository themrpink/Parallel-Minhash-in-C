'''Dili''' ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]/[[Tetum language|Tetum]]: ''Díli'', [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]]: ''Kota Dili''), also known as ''City of Peace'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://visiteasttimor.com/timor/dili-city-of-peace &quot;City of Peace&quot;], VisitEastTimor.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Capital city|capital]], largest city, chief port, and commercial centre of [[East Timor]] (Timor-Leste). Dili is part of a [[free trade zone]], the [[Timor Leste–Indonesia–Australia Growth Triangle]] (TIA-GT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=14966&amp;lang=en &quot;Boosting Growth through the Growth Triangle&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Battle of Timor}}
[[File:PT Dili 1952-1975 COA.svg|thumb|left|Former coat of arms]]
[[File:DSCI3122_Bucht_von_Dili.jpg|thumb|Dili, 2018]]
[[File:DiliMercadoMunicipal.jpg|thumb|Former Market Hall built by the Portuguese]]

Dili was settled about 1520 by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who made it the capital of [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1769. It was proclaimed a city in January 1864. During [[World War II]], [[Portugal during World War II|Portugal]] and its colonies remained neutral, but the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] saw East Timor as a potential target for Japanese invasion, and Australian and Dutch forces briefly occupied the island in 1941. On the night of 19 February 1942, the Japanese attacked with a force of around 20,000 men, and occupied Dili before spreading out across the rest of the colony.  On 26 September 1945, control of the island was officially returned to Portugal by the Japanese.

East Timor [[unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from [[Portugal]] on 28 November 1975. However, nine days later, on 7 December, [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian forces invaded Dili]]. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia annexed East Timor, which it designated the 27th [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]], ''Timor Timur'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for ''East Timor''), with Dili as its capital. A guerrilla war ensued from 1975 to 1999 between Indonesian and pro-independence forces, during which tens of thousands of [[East Timor]]ese and some foreign civilians were killed. Media coverage of the 1991 [[Dili massacre|Dili Massacre]] helped revitalise international support for the East Timorese independence movement.

In 1999, East Timor was placed under UN supervision, and on 20 May 2002, Dili became the capital of the newly independent Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. In May 2006, [[2006 East Timor crisis|fighting and rioting]] sparked by conflict between elements of the military caused significant damage to the city and led to foreign military intervention to restore order.

==Geography and administration==
[[File:Sucos Dili.png|thumb|left|upright|Administration of district Dili]]
Dili lies on the northern coast of [[Timor]] island, the easternmost of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. It is the seat of the administration of the [[Municipalities of East Timor|municipality]] of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of [[Atauro]] and some cities close to Dili city. The city is divided into the [[Administrative posts of East Timor|Administrative Posts]] (formerly subdistricts) of [[Nain Feto]], [[Vera Cruz (East Timor)|Vera Cruz]], [[Dom Aleixo Subdistrict|Dom Aleixo]] and [[Cristo Rei, East Timor|Cristo Rei]] and is divided into several [[Sucos of East Timor|sucos]], each of which is headed by an elected ''chefe de suco''. 18 of the 26 sucos of the four administrative posts are categorised as urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jornal.gov.tl/public/docs/2009/serie_1/serie1_no33.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jornal da Republica |publisher=Jornal.gov.tl |access-date=12 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203110707/http://www.jornal.gov.tl/public/docs/2009/serie_1/serie1_no33.pdf |archive-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality has an elected mayor and council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estatal.gov.tl/English/News/News_7.html |title=MAEOT - News |publisher=Estatal.gov.tl |date=19 February 2009 |access-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408133644/http://www.estatal.gov.tl/English/News/News_7.html |archive-date=8 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
The 2010 census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of [[Dili (district)|Dili district]] classified as urban, with a population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as Atauro and Metinaro.

Dili is a melting pot of the different ethnic groups of East Timor, due partly to the internal migration of young men from around the country in search of work.  This has led to a [[gender imbalance]], with the male population significantly larger than the female population. Between 2001 and 2004, the population of Dili district grew by 12.58%, with only 54% of the district's inhabitants born in the city. 7% were born in Baucau, 5% each in Viqueque and Bobonaro  4% in Ermera, and the remainder in other districts or overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Population and Housing Atlas 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Dili has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]].

==Buildings and monuments==

[[File:Palacio do Governo 2011.jpg|thumb|Palácio do Governo (Timor-Leste's Prime Minister's Office)]]

Most buildings were damaged or destroyed in the violence of 1999, orchestrated by the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] and local [[pro-Indonesia militia]]s (see [[Timor-Leste Scorched Earth|Operation Scorched Earth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estatal.gov.tl/Documents/District%20Development%20Plans%20and%20Profiles/Dili/Dili%20District%20_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of Dili District : Topography |publisher=Estatal.gov.tl |access-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144609/http://www.estatal.gov.tl/Documents/District%20Development%20Plans%20and%20Profiles/Dili/Dili%20District%20_eng.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city still has many buildings from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era. e.g. the former Market Hall built around 1930 which is used as a Congress Centre nowadays. The former Portuguese Governor's office is now the office of the [[Prime Minister of East Timor|Prime Minister]]. It was previously also used by the Indonesian-appointed Governor, and by the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET).

[[File:Hindu Tempel Dili04.jpg|thumb|[[Pura Girinatha]] [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu]] temple, built during [[Indonesia]]n occupation.]]

Even under Indonesian rule, during which the use of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was banned, Portuguese street names like ''Avenida Marechal Carmona'' remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''Jalan'' or 'road'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m4C6AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Jalan+Avenida+Marechal+Carmona%22+Dili&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Jalan+Avenida+Marechal+Carmona%22++ ''Indonesia: A Travel Survival Kit''], Joe Cummings, Lonely Planet, 1990, pages 657-658&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church at Motael became a focus for resistance to Indonesian occupation. Legacies of [[Jakarta]]'s occupation are the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Dili|Church of the Immaculate Conception]], seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Díli]], purportedly the largest [[cathedral]] in Southeast Asia, and the 'Integration Monument', commemorating the Indonesian annexation of the territory in 1976. Featuring a statue of an East Timorese in traditional dress, breaking the chains round his wrists, the monument has not been demolished.

The [[Cristo Rei of Dili]] is a 27-metre (88.6&amp;nbsp;ft) tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of a peninsula in Dili. It is one of the town's landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/tourism-in-timor |title=Tourism in Timor? &amp;#124; Travel + Leisure |publisher=Travelandleisure.com |access-date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a present from the government of Indonesia during occupation for the 20th anniversary of [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|East Timor's integration into Indonesia]].

==Education==
Schools in Dili include [[St. Joseph's High School, East Timor|St. Joseph's High School]] (Colégio de São José) and [[28 de Novembro Public Secondary School]]. There are five International schools in Dili: St Anthony's International School, which is Timorese owned and managed but teaches in English and uses a modified Australian curriculum; a Portuguese school by the name of [[Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti]]; an Australian managed school by the name of [[Dili International School]]; an American curriculum school called [[QSI International School of Dili]]; and the [[Maharlika International School]] (Formerly Dili Education &amp; Development Center), a Philippine International School.

East Timor's major higher education institution, the [[Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste]] (UNTL) is based in Dili. Other universities situated in Dili include the private undergraduate university, [[Universidade Da Paz|Universidade da Paz]] (UNPAZ), [[Universidade Dili]] (UNDIL) and Dili Institute of Technology (DIT), a community-based, non-profit education institution.

==Transportation==

[[File:110623-F-HS649-551 (5881875275).jpg|upright|thumb|250px|[[Cristo Rei of Dili]] atop a summit on a peninsula outside of Dili]]
Dili is served by [[Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport]], named after independence leader [[Nicolau Lobato]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://visiteasttimor.com/good-to-know/arriving-at-airport Arriving at Dili´s Airport], VisitEastTimor.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only functioning international airport in East Timor, though there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse used for domestic flights. Until recently, Dili's airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the [[Boeing 737]] or [[C-130 Hercules]], but in January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline [[EuroAtlantic Airways]] operated a direct flight from [[Lisbon]] using a [[Boeing 757]], carrying 140 members of the [[Portuguese National Republican Guard|Guarda Nacional Republicana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroatlantic.pt/html/en_29_01_2008.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627103021/http://www.euroatlantic.pt/html/en_29_01_2008.pdf|date=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Portuguese rule, [[Baucau Airport]], which has a much longer runway, was used for international flights, but following the Indonesian invasion this was taken over by the Indonesian military and closed to civilian traffic.

      <text bytes="5936" xml:space="preserve">In [[topology]], '''Urysohn's lemma''' is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that states that a [[topological space]] is [[normal space|normal]] if and only if any two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[closed set|closed subsets]] can be [[separated by a function|separated]] by a [[continuous function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} Section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urysohn's lemma is commonly used to construct continuous functions with various properties on normal spaces. It is widely applicable since all [[metric space]]s and all [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s are normal. The lemma is generalized by (and usually used in the proof of) the [[Tietze extension theorem]].

The lemma is named after the [[mathematician]] [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn]].

==Formal statement==
Two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' are said to be [[separated by neighbourhoods]] if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]]s ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' that are disjoint. In particular ''A'' and ''B'' are necessarily disjoint.

Two plain subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be [[separated by a function]] if there exists a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from ''X'' into the [[unit interval]] [0,1] such that ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;= 0 for all ''a'' in ''A'' and ''f''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;= 1 for all ''b'' in ''B''. Any such function is called a '''Urysohn function''' for ''A'' and ''B''. In particular ''A'' and ''B'' are necessarily disjoint.

It follows that if two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by a function]] then so are their closures.&lt;br&gt;
Also it follows that if two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by a function]] then ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by neighbourhoods]].

A [[normal space]] is a topological space in which any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighbourhoods. Urysohn's lemma states that a topological space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function.

The sets ''A'' and ''B'' need not be [[precisely separated by a function|precisely separated by ''f'']], i.e., we do not, and in general cannot, require that ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and ≠&amp;nbsp;1 for ''x'' outside of ''A'' and ''B''. The spaces in which this property holds are the [[perfectly normal space]]s.

Urysohn's lemma has led to the formulation of other topological properties such as the 'Tychonoff property' and 'completely Hausdorff spaces'. For example, a corollary of the lemma is that normal [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] are [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].

== Sketch of proof ==
[[Image:Urysohn-function01.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of Urysohn's &quot;[[onion]]&quot; function.]]
The procedure is an entirely straightforward application of the definition of normality (once one draws some figures representing the first few steps in the induction described below to see what is going on), beginning with two disjoint closed sets. The ''clever'' part of the proof is the indexing of the open sets thus constructed by dyadic fractions.

For every [[dyadic fraction]] ''r'' ∈ (0,1), we are going to construct an [[open set|open subset]] ''U''(''r'') of ''X'' such that:
# ''U''(''r'') contains ''A'' and is disjoint from ''B'' for all ''r'',
# For ''r'' &lt; ''s'', the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''U''(''r'') is contained in ''U''(''s'').
Once we have these sets, we define ''f''(''x'') = 1 if ''x'' ∉ ''U''(''r'') for any ''r''; otherwise ''f''(''x'') = [[infimum|inf]]{ ''r'' : ''x'' ∈ ''U''(''r'') } for every ''x'' ∈ ''X''. Using the fact that the dyadic rationals are [[Dense set|dense]], it is then not too hard to show that ''f'' is continuous and has the property ''f''(''A'') ⊆ {0} and ''f''(''B'') ⊆ {1}.

In order to construct the sets ''U''(''r''), we actually do a little bit more: we construct sets ''U''(''r'') and ''V''(''r'') such that
* ''A'' ⊆ ''U''(''r'') and ''B'' ⊆ ''V(r)'' for all ''r'',
* ''U''(''r'') and ''V''(''r'') are open and disjoint for all ''r'',
* For ''r'' &lt; ''s'', ''V''(''s'') is contained in the complement of ''U''(''r'') and the complement of ''V''(''r'') is contained in ''U''(''s'').
Since the complement of ''V''(''r'') is closed and contains ''U''(''r''), the latter condition then implies condition (2) from above.

This construction proceeds by [[mathematical induction]]. First define ''U''(1) = ''X'' \ ''B'' and ''V''(0) = ''X'' \ ''A''. Since ''X'' is normal, we can find two disjoint open sets ''U''(1/2) and ''V''(1/2) which contain ''A'' and ''B'', respectively. Now assume that ''n'' ≥ 1 and the sets ''U''(''k''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''V''(''k''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) have already been constructed for ''k'' = 1, ..., 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−1. Since ''X'' is normal, for any ''a'' ∈ { 0, 1, ..., 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 }, we can find two disjoint open sets which contain ''X'' \ ''V''(''a''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''X'' \ ''U''((''a''+1)&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Call these two open sets ''U''((2''a''+1)&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''V''((2''a''+1)&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;), and verify the above three conditions.

It is hypothesised that the accretion of Earth began soon after the formation of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions and the meteorites. Because the time this accretion process took is not yet known, and predictions from different accretion models range from a few million up to about 100 million years, the difference between the age of Earth and of the oldest rocks is difficult to determine. It is also difficult to determine the exact age of the [[oldest dated rocks|oldest rocks]] on Earth, exposed at the surface, as they are [[aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] of minerals of possibly different ages.

Studies of [[stratum|strata]]—the layering of rocks and earth—gave [[natural history|naturalists]] an appreciation that Earth may have been through many changes during its existence.

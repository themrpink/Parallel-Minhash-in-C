===Old Swiss Confederacy===
[[File:MerianBern.jpg|thumb|Bern in 1638]]

In 1353, Bern joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]], becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.

Bern invaded and conquered [[Aargau]] in 1415 and [[Vaud]] in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest [[city-state]] north of the [[Alps]]; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the [[canton of Bern]] and the [[canton of Vaud]].

The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river [[Aare]]. The ''[[Zytglogge]]'' tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the ''Käfigturm'' took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the ''[[Christoffelturm]]'' (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the [[Thirty Years' War]], two new fortifications – the so-called big and small ''[[Schanze]]'' (entrenchment) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.

After a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by [[half-timbered]] houses and subsequently the [[sandstone]] buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of [[Bubonic plague|pestilence]] that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to [[immigration]] from the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|209|Bern: Development of the settlement and the population}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Bern was occupied by [[First French Republic|French]] troops in 1798 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the [[Bernese Oberland]] in 1802, and following the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814, it newly acquired the [[Bernese Jura]]. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the [[Restoration (Switzerland)|Restoration]] and until the secession of the [[canton of Jura]] in 1979.
Bern was made the [[Federal City]] (seat of the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]]) within the new [[Switzerland as a federal state|Swiss federal state]] in 1848.

A number of congresses of the [[socialist]] [[First International|First]] and [[Second International]]s were held in Bern, particularly during [[World War I]] when Switzerland was neutral; see [[Bern International]].

The city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.
Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.
As of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate [[urban agglomeration]].&lt;ref&gt;municipal statistics,[http://www.bern.ch/leben_in_bern/stadt/statistik/in_kuerze] includes 6,816 weekend commuters not included in the federal statistics of 123,466.{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/02/blank/dos/result.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126162846/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/02/blank/dos/result.html |archive-date=26 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bern lies on the [[Swiss plateau]] in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[Bernese Alps]]. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent [[ice age]]. The two mountains closest to Bern are [[Gurten (mountain)|Gurten]] with a height of {{convert|864|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Bantiger]] with a height of {{convert|947|m|0|abbr=on}}. The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the [[Swiss coordinate system|CH1903 coordinate system]] at {{Coord|46|57|08.66|N|7|26|22.50|E|region:CH_type:landmark}}.

The city was originally built on a hilly [[peninsula]] surrounded by the river [[Aare]], but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A [[List of Aar bridges in Bern|number of bridges]] have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.

Bern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare ([[Mattequartier|Matte]], Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, Länggasse).

Bern has an area, {{as of|2013|lc=on}}, of {{convert|51.62|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this area, {{convert|9.42|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 18.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|17.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 33.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, {{convert|23.76|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 46.0% is settled (buildings or roads), {{convert|1.08|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and {{convert|0.14|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 0.3% is unproductive land.&lt;ref name=BFS_land&gt;[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/raum-umwelt/bodennutzung-bedeckung/gesamtspektrum-regionalen-stufen/gemeinden.assetdetail.11007176.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics] 2018 data {{in lang|de}} accessed 26 July 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the developed area of Bern, 3.1% consists of industrial buildings, 22.3% housing and other buildings, and 12.9% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.2% of the city, while another 6.5% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.

Of Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 13.3% is used for growing crops and 4.4% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.&lt;ref name=BFS_land/&gt;

[[File:Rathaus (Bern).jpg|thumb|right|Rathaus]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Bern}}
{{See also|Gemeinderat (Bern)}}

The Municipal Council (de: '''Gemeinderat''', fr: '''conseil municipal''') constitutes the [[executive (government)|executive]] government of the City of Bern and operates as a [[collegiate authority]]. It is composed of five councillors ({{lang-de|Gemeinderat/-rätin}}, {{lang-fr|conseiller/conseillère municipal(e)}}), each presiding over a directorate (de: ''Direktion'', fr: ''direction'') comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as [[mayor]] (de: ''Stadtpräsident'', fr: ''Le Maire''). In the mandate period 2017–2020 (''Legislatur'') the Municipal Council is presided by ''Stadtpräsident'' [[Alec von Graffenried]]. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of [[Proportional representation|Proporz]]. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the [[Junkerngasse|Erlacherhof]], built by architect [[Albrecht Stürler]] after 1747.&lt;ref name=GR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bern.ch/gemeinderat |title=Gemeinderat |publisher=Stadtkanzlei, Stabsstelle des Gemeinderats, Stadt Bern |type=official site |language=de |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=16 January 2016 |access-date=17 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223151529/http://www.bern.ch/gemeinderat |archive-date=23 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017}}, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP ([[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]]), and one each of CVP ([[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic Party]]), GFL (''Grüne Freie Liste'' a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB ([[Grünes Bündnis Bern|Green Alliance of Berne]]), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 27 November 2016/15 January 2017.&lt;ref name=GR/&gt;

The City Council (de: '''Stadtrat''', fr: '''Conseil de ville''') holds [[legislative power]]. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every four years. The City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of [[proportional representation]].

The sessions of the City Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the ''Stadthaus'' (Town Hall).&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bern.ch/politik-und-verwaltung/stadtrat |title=Aktuelles aus dem Stadtrat |publisher=Stadt Bern |type=official site |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=de |access-date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

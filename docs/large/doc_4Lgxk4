==The One-and-a-Half Defenestration of Prague==
This defenestration took place on September 24, 1483{{Citation needed |date=August 2019}} during the storms of the Prague population during the reign of King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]], when the party of the [[Communion under both kinds]], fearing for their influence, carried out a violent coup in the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old]] and [[New Town, Prague|New]] Towns and [[Malá Strana|Lesser Town]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2019}} The Old Town [[Burgomaster]] and the dead bodies of seven New Town councilors were defenestrated from the respective town halls. The coup in Prague contributed to the limitation of ruling power and prevented the resumption of pre-Hussian conditions. On October 6, 1483, three Prague municipalities signed a treaty on unity and common action, which brought the dominion of the [[Utraquism]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2019}} The development then led to [[Religious peace of Kutná Hora|religious reconciliation]] and the declaration of equality of both churches at the Kutná Hora Assembly in 1485.{{Citation needed |date=August 2019}}

==The Second Defenestration of Prague==
The Second Defenestration significantly influenced the history of Europe and led to the [[Thirty Years' War]].

In 1555, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] had settled religious disputes in the Holy Roman Empire by enshrining the principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'', allowing a prince to determine the religion of his subjects. The Kingdom of Bohemia since 1526 had been governed by [[Habsburg]] kings, who did not force their Catholic religion on their largely Protestant subjects. In 1609, [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia (1576–1612), increased Protestant rights. He was increasingly viewed as unfit to govern, and other members of the Habsburg dynasty declared his younger brother, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], to be family head in 1606. Matthias began to gradually wrest territory from Rudolf, beginning with Hungary. In 1609, to strengthen his hold on Bohemia, Rudolf issued the ''[[Letter of Majesty]]'', which granted Bohemia's largely Protestant estates the right to freely exercise their religion, essentially setting up a Protestant Bohemian state church controlled by the estates, &quot;dominated by the towns and rural nobility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Peter |title=The Long European Reformation |year=2004 |location=New York, NY|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Rudolf's death, Matthias succeeded in the rule of Bohemia (1612–1619) and extended his offer of more legal and religious concessions to Bohemia, relying mostly on the advice of his chancellor, Bishop [[Melchior Klesl]].{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

Conflict was precipitated by two factors: Matthias, already aging and without children, made his cousin [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Styria]] his heir and had him elected king in 1617. Ferdinand  was a proponent of the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] and not likely to be well-disposed to Protestantism or Bohemian freedoms. Bohemian Protestants opposed the royal government as they interpreted the Letter of Majesty to extend not only to the land controlled by the nobility or self-governing towns but also to the King's own lands.  Whereas Matthias and Klesl were prepared to appease these demands, Ferdinand was not; in 1618 he forced the Emperor to order the cessation of construction of some [[Protestant]] chapels on royal land. When the Bohemian estates protested against this order, Ferdinand had their assembly dissolved.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}

===The Defenestration===
On May 23, 1618, four Catholic Lords Regent, Count [[Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice]], Count [[Vilem Slavata of Chlum]], Adam II von Sternberg (who was the supreme [[burgrave]]), and Matthew Leopold Popel Lobkowitz (who was the grand prior), arrived at the Bohemian Chancellory at 8:30 am. After preparing the meeting hall, members of the dissolved assembly of the three main Protestant estates gathered at 9:00 am, led by [[Jindřich Matyáš Thurn|Count Thurn]], who had been deprived of his post as [[castellan]] ([[burgrave]]) of [[Karlštejn Castle]] by the Emperor. The Protestant lords' agenda was to clarify whether the four regents present were responsible for persuading the Emperor to order the cessation of Protestant church construction on royal lands. According to count of Martinice himself:

{{quote|Lord Paul Rziczan read aloud... a letter with the following approximate content: His Imperial Majesty had sent to their graces the lord regents a sharp letter that was, by our request, issued to us as a copy after the original had been read aloud, and in which His Majesty declared all of our lives and honour already forfeit, thereby greatly frightening all three Protestant estates. As they also absolutely intended to proceed with the execution against us, we came to a unanimous agreement among ourselves that, regardless of any loss of life and limb, honour and property, we would stand firm, with [[Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno|all for one and one for all]]... nor would we be subservient, but rather we would loyally help and protect each other to the utmost, against all difficulties. Because, however, it is clear that such a letter came about through the advice of some of our religious enemies, we wish to know, and hereby ask the lord regents present, if all or some of them knew of the letter, recommended it, and approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helfferich |first=Tryntje |title=The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History |year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |location=Indianapolis |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Slawata001.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Vilem Slavata of Chlum]], 1618 enamel on copper, by follower of [[Dominicus Custos]]]]

Before the regents gave any answer, they requested that the Protestants give them the opportunity to confer with their superior, Adam von Waldstein, who was not present. If they were given the opportunity, the Protestants were to receive an official answer to their grievance by the next Friday (the encounter took place on the eve of Ascension Day, and they all had to observe the holy day). The Protestant lords, however, demanded an immediate answer. Two regents, Adam II von Sternberg and Matthew Leopold Popel Lobkowitz, were declared innocent by the Protestant Estate holders, deemed to be too pious to have any responsibility in the preparation of the Emperor's letter. They were removed from the room; before leaving, Adam II von Sternberg made it clear that they &quot;did not advise anything that was contrary to the Letter of Majesty&quot;. This left Count Vilem Slavata of Chlum and Count Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice (who had replaced Thurn as Castellan), both known Catholic hard-liners, and [[Filip Fabricius|Philip Fabricius]], the secretary to the Regents. They eventually acknowledged responsibility for the letter and, presuming they would only be arrested, welcomed any punishment the Protestants had planned.

Count von Thurn turned to both Martinice and Slavata and said &quot;you are enemies of us and of our religion, have desired to deprive us of our Letter of Majesty, have horribly plagued your Protestant subjects... and have tried to force them to adopt your religion against their wills or have had them expelled for this reason&quot;. Then to the crowd of Protestants, he continued &quot;were we to keep these men alive, then we would lose the Letter of Majesty and our religion... for there can be no justice to be gained from or by them&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the two Regents and their secretary were defenestrated, but they survived the {{convert|70|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}} fall from the third floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;beaulac2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=148–77 |doi=10.1163/15718050020956812 |title=The Westphalian Legal Orthodoxy – Myth or Reality? |year=2000 |last1=Beaulac |first1=S. |journal=Journal of the History of International Law |volume=2 |issue=2|url=https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/bitstream/1866/1373/1/The%20Westphalian%20Legal%20Orthodoxy%20-%20Myth%20or%20Reality.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mackay&quot;&gt;MacKay, John P; Hill, Bennett D; Buckler, John (1995).

===Aftermath===
Immediately after the defenestration, the Protestant estates and Catholic Habsburgs started gathering allies for war.&lt;ref name=Gutmann&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gutmann |first=Myron P. |title=The Origins of the Thirty Years War |journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume=18 |number=4  |year=1988 |pages=764–765 |doi=10.2307/204823|jstor=204823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Matthias in 1619, Ferdinand II was elected Holy Roman Emperor. At the same time, the Bohemian estates deposed him as King of Bohemia and replaced him with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], a leading [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and son-in-law of the Protestant [[James I of England|James VI and I, King of Scotland, England and Ireland]].

Because they deposed a properly chosen king, the Protestants could not gather the international support they needed for war.&lt;ref name=Gutmann/&gt; Just two years after the defenestration, Ferdinand and the Catholics regained power in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] on November 8, 1620. This became known as the first battle in the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=This View of Life: The Diet of Worms and the Defenestrations of Prague |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |year=1996 |number=9 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |url=http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/BioNB427/READINGS/Gould1996.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328010647/http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/bionb427/readings/gould1996.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was plundering and pillaging in Prague for weeks following the battle. Several months later, twenty-seven nobles and citizens were tortured and [[Old Town Square execution|executed]] in the Old Town Square. Twelve of their heads were impaled on iron hooks and hung from the Bridge Tower as a warning. This  contributed to the resentment that gave rise to the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt;

==Further defenestrations==
More events of defenestration have occurred in Prague during its history, but they are not usually called ''defenestrations of Prague''.

Sometimes, the name ''the fourth'' or ''the third defenestration of Prague'' is used, although it has no standard meaning. For example, it has been used&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ian. [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/introlecture.htm &quot;Some Introductory Historical Observations&quot;] (lecture transcript)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the death of [[Jan Masaryk]], who was found below the bathroom window of the building of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 10 March 1948. The official report listed the death as a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/24973|title=Jan Masaryk died 54 years ago|last=Horáková|first=Pavla|publisher=Radio Prague|date=11 March 2002|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was widely believed he was murdered, either by the nascent Communist government in which he served as a non-partisan Foreign Minister, or by the [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|Soviet secret services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/101758|title=Sixty years on, the mystery of Jan Masaryk's tragic death remains unresolved|last=Richter|first=Jan|publisher=Radio Prague|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Prague police report in 2004 concluded after forensic research that Masaryk had indeed been defenestrated to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Rob, [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/49113 &quot;Police close case on 1948 death of Jan Masaryk – murder, not suicide&quot;], Radio Prague, 06-01-2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  This report was seemingly corroborated in 2006 when a Russian journalist said that his mother knew the Russian intelligence officer who defenestrated Masaryk.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Rob, [http://www.radio.cz/en/article/86404 &quot;Masaryk murder mystery back in headlines as Russian journalist speaks out&quot;], Radio Prague, 18-12-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conrad II''' ({{circa|lk=no|989/990}} – 4 June 1039), also known as {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.

The son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinfurter99&quot; /&gt;

Conrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role and [[Imperial Church System|organisation of the Church]] and the status and affairs of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.&lt;ref name=boni/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenthal1988&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Uta-Renate Blumenthal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&amp;pg=PA45 |title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8122-1386-6 |pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire. Upon the death of the childless King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] in 1032, Conrad claimed dominion over the [[Kingdom of Arles|''Kingdom of the Two Burgundies'']], conquered it and incorporated it into the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinfurter99&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stefan Weinfurter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&amp;pg=PA49 |title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8122-3508-8 |pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three kingdoms (Germany, Italy, and Burgundy) formed the basis of the empire as the &quot;royal triad&quot; (''regna tria'').

The origins of the [[Salian dynasty]] can be traced back to [[Werner (Salian)|Count Werner V of Worms]], a [[Franks|Frankish]] nobleman from the [[Duchy of Franconia]] to the east of the [[Rhine River]]. His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;urku&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Konrad II |url=https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&amp;leftTab=toc&amp;sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |publisher=Monumenta Germaniae Historica |access-date=January 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977–978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself &quot;Duke of Worms&quot; and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin2017&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greta Austin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT4 |title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms |date=15 May 2017 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-351-90055-3 |pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was taken care of by Conrad's the Elder.&lt;ref name=&quot;MöllerAmmerich2015&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lenelotte Möller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3 |title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |last2=Hans Ammerich |date=1 December 2015 |publisher=marixverlag |isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5 |pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinfurter99&quot; /&gt;

===Adulthood===
In 1016 Conrad married the twice widowed [[duchess]] [[Gisela of Swabia]], daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, had unsuccessfully claimed the German throne upon [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, and had lost the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Conrad II Holy Roman emperor |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |last=Peter Munz |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II eventually reconciled and he returned to Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;MöllerAmmerich2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Emperor Henry II died childless in 1024, bringing an end to the [[Ottonian dynasty]] that had ruled Germany since 919.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Germany&quot;, Martin Volkl, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology'', Volume 2, ed. Clifford J. Rogers, (Oxford University Press, 2010), 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear successor to the German throne, Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers Bishop [[Dietrich I of Metz]] and Duke [[Henry V of Bavaria]]. Archbishop [[Aribo of Mainz]], the [[primate of Germany]], also assisted Cunigunde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Archbishop Aribo di Magonza |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmagon.html |date=July 24, 2017 |publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy |access-date=January 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1024, the German princes gathered at Kamba, a historical name for an area on the east banks of the [[Rhine River]] opposite the modern German town of [[Oppenheim]]. Now the location of ''Kamba'' is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad's [[chaplain]], [[Wipo of Burgundy]] attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad]]. Both were [[kings of Germany family tree|descendants]] of [[Emperor Otto I]] by their common grandfather [[Otto of Worms]], son of Liutgarde, one of Otto's daughters.{{sfn|Bernhardt|2002|p=311}} Although further members of the Ottonian dynasty existed, none were seriously considered eligible. The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well. Archbishop [[Pilgrim of Cologne]], Duke [[Gothelo I of Lower Lorraine]], and Duke [[Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] did not support him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutz2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Herbert Schutz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ikkaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |title=The Medieval Empire in Central Europe: Dynastic Continuity in the Post-Carolingian Frankish Realm, 900-1300 |date=19 February 2010 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-4438-2035-6 |pages=115– |author-link=Herbert Schutz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Speyer dom 11.jpg|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], consecrated in 1061]]
Conrad was crowned [[king of Germany]] by Archbishop Aribo in [[Mainz Cathedral]] on September 8, 1024 at the age of 34.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=97}} To mark his election, Conrad commissioned the construction of [[Speyer Cathedral]], near his ancestral home of Worms. Construction began in 1030. Archbishop Aribo, as archbishop of Mainz, was already the chancellor of Germany. Conrad wanted to reward the archbishop for his electoral support, so he made Aribo chancellor of Italy as well, making Aribo the second most powerful man in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the imperial chancellor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinfurter992&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stefan Weinfurter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&amp;pg=PA49 |title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8122-3508-8 |pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rege&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Heinrich V. in seiner Zeit |url=http://www.regesta-imperii.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Regesta_Imperii_Beiheft_34.pdf |last=Gerhard Lubich |publisher=Regesta |access-date=February 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aribo refused to crown Conrad's wife Gisela as queen as their marriage violated canon law. Conrad refused to accept Archbishop Aribo's position. Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne saw the situation as an opportunity to restore his relationship with the king, after refusing to support Conrad's election, and he crowned Gisela queen on September 21, 1024. The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Gisela |url=https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0001/bsb00016322/images/index.html?seite=427 |last=Otto zu Stolberg-Wernigerode |publisher=Neue deutsche Biographie |access-date=April 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reign===

Conrad inherited a kingdom troubled by problems. The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as a successor of the empire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting abbesses [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Sophia I of Gandersheim]], daughters of [[Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram2&quot; /&gt;

Conrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Herwig Wolfram |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&amp;pg=PA443 |title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=978-0-271-04818-5 |pages=443–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davids2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Adelbert Davids |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&amp;pg=PA92 |title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium |date=15 August 2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52467-4 |pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}

===Unrest in Italy===
[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]
In Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However, the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}

When the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Owenson1821&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sydney Morgan-Owenson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=Italy |publisher=H. Colburn |year=1821 |pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Pavia was no longer the seat of imperial administration in Italy since the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been perceived as a symbol of imperial authority in Italy and its mere presence within the city walls had been deemed intolerable. Pavia, had thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France become an important commercial center. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.&lt;ref name=&quot;boni&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III |url=https://www.academia.edu/40250313 |last=Robert Houghton |date=July 24, 2017 |publisher=Academiaa |access-date=January 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (&quot;Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom&quot;) of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stock1983&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brian Stock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C |title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-691-10227-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.&lt;ref name=boni/&gt;

In February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halfond2016&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gregory I.

==Reign as Emperor==

===Imperial coronation===
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (190)2.JPG|thumb|225px|right|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]. Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]
On March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently, Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinfurter19&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stefan Weinfurter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&amp;pg=PA228 |title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8122-3508-8 |page=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutz2010&quot; /&gt;

In May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of choosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.

The young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

===Uprising in Swabia===
In 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.

In 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutz2010&quot; /&gt;

In 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutz2010&quot; /&gt;

===Conflict with Adalbero===
[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromised the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]
Conrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.

In particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Györffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}

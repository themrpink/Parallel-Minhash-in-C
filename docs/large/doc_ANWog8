{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Aten''' also '''Aton''', '''Atonu''', '''Itn''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:jtn|jtn]]}}, ''reconstructed'' {{IPA-all|ˈjaːtin|}}) was the focus of [[Atenism]], the religious system established in ancient Egypt by the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] [[pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]. The Aten was the disc of the sun and originally an aspect of [[Ra]], the sun god in traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]], but Akhenaten made it the sole focus of official worship during his reign.

In his poem &quot;[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]&quot;, Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a creation myth or family but is mentioned in the [[Book of the Dead]]. The worship of Aten was eradicated by [[Horemheb]].

{{stack end}}

The word ''Aten'' appears in the Old Kingdom as a noun meaning &quot;disc&quot; which referred to anything flat and circular; the sun was called the &quot;disc of the day&quot; where Ra was thought to reside.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Akhenaten: The Heretic King|last=Redford|first=Donald|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-691-03567-3|location=|pages=170–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, the term &quot;silver aten&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian (1997). ''The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth.'' Duncan Baird Publishers. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; High relief and low relief illustrations of the Aten show it with a curved surface, therefore, the late scholar [[Hugh Nibley]] insisted that a more correct translation would be globe, orb or sphere, rather than disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Zarathustra : myth, message, history |last=Khamneipur |first=Abolghassem |publisher= |year=2015 |isbn=9781460268810 |edition=1st |location=Victoria, BC, Canada|pages=81|oclc=945369209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known reference to Aten the sun-disk as a deity is in the ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]'' from the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]],&lt;ref name=&quot; Wilkinson 2003&quot;&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt.'' Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 236–240&lt;/ref&gt; in which the deceased king is described as rising as a god to the heavens and uniting ''with the sun-disk, the divine body merging with its maker.''&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature,'' Vol. 1, 1980, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Reign of Akhenaten. From Amarna, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
The solar Aten was extensively worshipped as a god in the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] when it was depicted as a falcon-headed man much like [[Ra]]. In the reign of Amenhotep III's successor, Amenhotep IV, the Aten became the central god of the Egyptian state religion, and Amenhotep IV changed his name to [[Akhenaten]] to reflect his close link with the new supreme deity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 2003&quot;/&gt;
The principles of Aten's religion were recorded on the rock tomb walls of Akhetaten.
In the religion of Aten (Atenism), night is a time to fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Akhenaten and the Religion of Light |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwUiuI79nUEC&amp;q=afterlife&amp;pg=PA64 |date=2001 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=8 |isbn= 978-0801487255|access-date=15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is done best when the sun, Aten, is present. Aten cares for every creature, and created a [[Nile river]] in the sky (rain) for the Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Glenn |title=The History of Egypt |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptth00glen |url-access=registration |quote=aten nile river in sky syria. |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptth00glen/page/n7 1] |isbn= 9780313322648|access-date=15 February 2015 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aten created all countries and people. The rays of the sun disk only holds out life to the royal family; everyone else receives life from Akhenaten and Nefertiti in exchange for loyalty to Aten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinch |first=Geraldine |title=Handbook of Egyptian Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-mTqRTrimgC&amp;q=aten+ray+light+royal+family+hold+out+life&amp;pg=PA110 |date=2002 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=110 |isbn= 9781576072424|access-date=15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aten is depicted caring for the people through Akhenaten by Aten's hands extending towards the royalty, giving them ankhs representing life being given to humanity through both Aten and Akhenaten. In Akhenaten's Hymn to Aten, a love for humanity and the Earth is depicted in Aten's mannerisms:

{{quote|Aten bends low, near the earth, to watch over his creation; he takes his place in the sky for the same purpose; he wearies himself in the service of the creatures; he shines for them all; he gives them sun and sends them rain. The unborn child and the baby chick are cared for; and Akhenaten asks his divine father to 'lift up' the creatures for his sake so that they might aspire to the condition of perfection of his father, Aten.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;}}

Akhenaten represented himself not as a god, but as a son of Aten, shifting the previous methods of pharaohs claiming to be the embodiment of Horus. This contributes to the belief that Atenism should be considered a monotheistic religion where &quot;the living Aten beside whom there is no other; he was the sole god&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt;

There is only one known instance of the Aten talking, &quot;said by the 'Living Aten': my rays illuminate...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldwasser|first1=Orly|title=The Aten is the &quot;Energy of Light&quot;: New Evidence from the Script|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=2010|volume=46|pages=163|jstor=41431576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aten is an evolution of the idea of a sun god in Egyptian mythology, deriving a lot of his concepts of power and representation from the earlier god Ra but building on top of the power Ra represents. Aten carried absolute power in the universe, representing the life-giving force of light to the world as well as merging with the concept and goddess Maat to develop further responsibilities for Aten beyond the power of light itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pharaohs of the sun : Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen|date=1999|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts in association with Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Co|author1=Freed, Rita E.|author2=D'Auria, Sue|author3=Markowitz, Yvonne J.|isbn=978-0878464708|location=Boston|oclc=42450325|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780821226209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography ===
Aten, by nature, was everywhere and intangible because he was the sunlight and energy in the world. Therefore, he did not have physical representations that other Egyptian gods had; he was represented by the sun disc and reaching rays of light.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The explanation as to why Aten could not be fully represented was that Aten was beyond creation. Thus the scenes of gods carved in stone previously depicted animals and human forms, now showed Aten as an orb above with life-giving rays stretching toward the royal figure. This power transcended human or animal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groenewegen-Frankfort|first=Henriette Antonia|date=1951|title=Arrest and Movement: An Essay on Space and Time in the Representational Art of the Ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdiysCKHbOMC&amp;pg=PA99|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=99|isbn=978-0674046566|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[iconoclasm]] was enforced, and even sun disc depictions of Aten were prohibited in an edict issued by [[Akhenaten]]. In the edict, he stipulated that Aten's name was to be spelt phonetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Douglas j.|title=Egypt and the Egyptians|edition=2nd |date=22 February 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85150-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evudwvrKErEC&amp;q=elevation+of+the+king+and+his+queen+Nefertiti&amp;pg=PA105|author2=Emily Teeter|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, the Trunk of the Tree.

== Worship ==

The cult centre of Aten was at the new city [[Akhetaten]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aton|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aton|website=Britannica|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; some other cult cities include [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. The principles of Aten's cult were recorded on the rock walls of tombs of Amarna. Significantly different from other ancient Egyptian temples, temples of Aten were open-roofed to allow the rays of the sun. Doorways had broken lintels and raised thresholds. No statues of Aten were allowed; those were seen as idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aten, god of Egypt|url=http://www.landofpyramids.org/aten.htm|publisher=Siteseen Ltd.|date=June 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these were typically replaced by functionally equivalent representations of Akhenaten and his family venerating the Aten and receiving the [[ankh]] (breath of life) from him. Priests had less to do since offerings (fruits, flowers, cakes) were limited, and oracles were not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History embalmed: Aten|url=http://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-gods/aten.htm|publisher=2014 Siteseen Ltd.|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the worship of Aten, the daily service of purification, anointment, and clothing of the divine image was not performed. Incense was burnt several times a day. Hymns sung to Aten were accompanied by harp music. Aten's ceremonies in Akhetaten involved giving offerings to Aten with a swipe of the royal scepter. Instead of barque processions, the royal family rode on a chariot on festival days. Elite women were known to worship the Aten in sun-shade temples in Akhetaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquali|first1=Stéphane|title=A sun-shade temple of Princess Ankhesenpaaten in Memphis?|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|date=2011|volume=97|pages=219|doi=10.1177/030751331109700118|jstor=23269901|s2cid=194880030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two temples were central to the city of Akhetaten, the larger of the two had an &quot;open, unroofed structure covering an area of about {{convert|800 x 300|m|-2}} at the northern end of the city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ancient gods speak : a guide to Egyptian religion|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Redford, Donald B.|isbn=978-0195154016|location=Oxford|oclc=49698760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples to the Aten were open-air structures with little to no roofing to maximize the amount of sunlight on the interior making them unique compared to other Egyptian temples of the time. Balustrades depicting Akhenaten, the queen and the princess embracing the rays of Aten flanked stairwells, ramps, and altars. These fragments were initially identified as [[stele]] but were later reclassified as balustrades based on the presence of scenes on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Ian|date=1994|title=Balustrades, Stairs and Altars in the Cult of the Aten at el-Amarna|jstor=3821854|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=80|pages=109–127|doi=10.2307/3821854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal titulary==
[[File:Stela of the Great temple of Aten at Akhetaten2008.jpg|thumb|left|Stela of the Great temple of the Aten showing the early form the Aten's names.]]

During the Amarna Period, the Aten was given a royal titulary enclosed in a double [[cartouche]], carrying royal implications. Some have interpreted this to mean that Akhenaten was the embodiment of Aten, and the worship of Aten is directly worship of Akhenaten; but others have taken this as an indicator of Aten as the supreme ruler even over the current reigning royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=John|date=1965|title=Notes on the 'Aten'|jstor=3855637|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=51|pages=207–209|doi=10.2307/3855637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Battiscombe|date=1923|title=Notes on the Aten and His Names|jstor=3854036|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=9|issue=3/4|pages=168–176|doi=10.2307/3854036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two forms of the title; the first had the names of other gods, and the second later one was more 'singular' and referred only to the Aten himself. The early form was ''[[Re-Horakhti]] who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name [[shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], which is the Aten.'' The later form was ''Re, ruler of the two horizons, who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name of light, which is the Aten.''{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Ra-Horus, more usually referred to as ''Ra-Horakhty'' (''Ra, who is Horus of the two horizons''), is a synthesis of two other gods, both of which are attested from very early on. During the [[Amarna]] period, this synthesis was seen as the invisible source of energy of the sun god, of which the visible manifestation was the Aten, the solar disk. Thus Ra-Horus-Aten was a development of old ideas which came gradually. The real change, as some see it, was the apparent abandonment of all other gods, especially [[Amun]]-[[Ra]], prohibition of idolatry, and the debatable introduction of quasi-[[monotheism]] by Akhenaten.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press 2005, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The syncretism is readily apparent in the Great Hymn to the Aten in which Re-Herakhty, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and Aten are merged into the creator god.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Vol. 2, 1980, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominic Montserrat]], ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt,'' Routledge 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-18549-1}}, pp. 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten. Other scholars call the religion [[henotheism|henotheistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Douglas J.|title=Egypt and the Egyptians|date=22 February 2007|edition=2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85150-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evudwvrKErEC&amp;q=elevation+of+the+king+and+his+queen+Nefertiti&amp;pg=PA105|author2=Emily Teeter|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After Akhenaten ==
[[File:Respaldo del trono de oro de Tutankamón.jpg|thumb|right|The Aten depicted in art from the throne of [[Tutankhamun]], perhaps originally made for [[Akhenaten]]]]
Akhenaten was considered the &quot;high priest&quot; or even a prophet of Aten, being the main propagator of the religion in Egypt during his reign. After the death of Akhenaten, his son, Tutankhamun, reinstated the cult of Amun and the ban on religions in competition with Atenism was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Akhenaten and the religion of light|last=Hornung |first=Erik |date=2001 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0801487255 |location=Ithaca, NY |oclc=48417401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of this transition can be seen in the name change of Tutankh'''aten''' into Tutankh'''amun''' indicating the loss of favor in the worship of Aten.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The cult of Aten was still in Egypt for another ten years or so as it faded and there was no purge of the cult after Akhenaten's death. When Tutankhamun came into power, his religious reign was one of tolerance, the only difference was that Aten was no longer the only god.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Tutankhamun rebuilt the temples that were destroyed during Akhenaten's reign and he reinstated the old pantheon of gods. This return to the gods that were before Aten was &quot;a move based publicly on the doctrine that Egypt's woes stemmed directly from its ignoring the gods, and in turn the gods' abandonment of Egypt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;

{{Short description|The temperature minimum at the boundary between the mesosphere and the thermosphere}}
 
The '''mesopause''' is the point of minimum temperature at the boundary between the [[mesosphere]] and the [[thermosphere]] [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] regions. Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong [[radiative cooling]] from [[carbon dioxide]], the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100&amp;nbsp;°C (-148&amp;nbsp;°F or 173 [[Kelvin|K]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. &quot;mesosphere&quot;. Compendium of Chemical Terminology Internet edition&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude of the mesopause for many years was assumed to be at around 85&amp;nbsp;km (53&amp;nbsp;mi.), but observations to higher altitudes and modeling studies in the last 10 years have shown that in fact the mesopause consists of two minima - one at about 85&amp;nbsp;km and a stronger minimum at about 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Xu, Jiyao|author2=Liu, H.-L.|author3=Yuan, W.|author4=Smith, A.K.|author5=Roble, R. G.|author6=Mertens, C.J.|author7=Russell, J.M.|author8=Mlynczak, M.G.|title=Mesopause structure from Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED)/Sounding of the Atmosphere Using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=112|issue=D9|doi=10.1029/2006jd007711|bibcode=2007JGRD..112.9102X|year=2007|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b6aff8d590d322f117099739951caa5dd84e2de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature is that the summer mesopause is cooler than the winter (sometimes referred to as the ''mesopause anomaly''). It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the summer pole and downwelling at the winter pole. Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer mesopause and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter mesopause. In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to [[gravity wave]] dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east–west flow, resulting in a small north–south circulation.&lt;ref&gt;The Physics of Atmospheres, John Theodore Houghton, section and references therein of ''The general circulation of the middle atmosphere''&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the mesopause has also been the focus of studies on global [[climate change]] associated with increases in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Unlike the [[troposphere]], where [[greenhouse gases]] result in the atmosphere heating up, increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[mesosphere]] acts to cool the atmosphere due to increased radiative emission. This results in a measurable effect - the mesopause should become cooler with increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Observations do show a decrease of temperature of the mesopause, though the magnitude of this decrease varies and is subject to further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beig|first1=G.|last2=Keckhut|first2=P.|last3=Lowe|first3=R.P.|display-authors=etal|title=Review of mesospheric temperature trends (2003)|journal=Rev.

The '''Apollo asteroids''' are a group of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s named after [[1862 Apollo]], discovered by German astronomer [[Karl Reinmuth]] in the 1930s. They are [[Earth-crosser asteroid|Earth-crossing asteroid]]s that have an orbital [[semimajor axis|semi-major axis]] greater than that of the Earth (&amp;gt; 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) but [[perihelion]] distances less than the Earth's [[aphelion]] distance (q &lt; 1.017 AU).&lt;ref name=&quot;NEO-groups&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram-Apollo&quot; /&gt;

{{As of|2018|12}} the number of known Apollo asteroids is 10,485, making the class the largest group of [[near-Earth object]]s (''cf''. the [[Aten asteroid|Aten]], [[Amor asteroid|Amor]] and [[Atira asteroid|Atira]] asteroids),&lt;ref name=&quot;neo-jpl-stats&quot; /&gt; of which 1,409 are [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] (asteroids are not numbered until they have been observed at two or more [[Opposition (planets)|oppositions]]), and 1,648 are identified as [[potentially hazardous asteroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine|url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi|publisher=JPL/NASA|date=2018-12-04|accessdate=2018-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pha-apollo&quot; /&gt;

The closer their semi-major axis is to Earth's, the less [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] is needed for the [[orbit]]s to cross. The February 15, 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] that exploded over the city of [[Chelyabinsk#2013 meteor|Chelyabinsk]] in the southern Urals region of Russia, injuring an estimated 1,500 people with flying glass from broken windows, was an Apollo-class [[asteroid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USA-Today-Chelyabinsk&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist-Chelyabinsk&quot; /&gt;

== List ==
The largest known Apollo asteroid is [[1866 Sisyphus]], with a diameter of about 8.5&amp;nbsp;km. Examples of known Apollo asteroids include:

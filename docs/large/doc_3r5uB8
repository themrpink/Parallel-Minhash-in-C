'''''Gigi''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒi.ʒi|pron}}) is a [[1944 in literature|1944]] [[novella]] by [[France|French]] writer [[Colette]]. The plot focuses on a young Parisian girl being groomed for a career as a [[courtesan]] and her relationship with the wealthy cultured man named Gaston who falls in love with her and eventually marries her.

The novel was translated into English by [[Roger Senhouse]] and published (with &quot;The Cat&quot; translated by [[Antonia White]]) in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/wzgw?id=090415d0d5302b304eff4899aaa0ea2bcd79b9&amp;rsn=1&amp;esn=F&amp;f=u&amp;rn=11| title=Vintage reissue of 1953 edition| accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life story of [[Yola Letellier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hicks |first1=Pamela |title=Daughter of Empire: My Life as a Mountbatten |date=2014 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNGKBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=gigi |accessdate=19 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the wife of Henri Letellier (publisher of ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'' and mayor of [[Deauville]] (1925–1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4rpmVb2ZrkC&amp;pg=PA91|title=Elegance: The Seeberger Brothers and the Birth of Fashion Photography|author=Sylvie Aubenas, Virginie Chardin, Xavier Demange|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2007|pages=91, 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was the inspiration for the novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks&quot; /&gt;

==Adaptations==
The novella was the basis for [[Gigi (1949 film)|a 1949 French film]] starring [[Danièle Delorme]] and [[Gaby Morlay]]. 

In 1951, it was [[Gigi (play)|adapted for the stage]] by [[Anita Loos]]. Colette had personally picked the yet unknown [[Audrey Hepburn]] on first sight to play the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gigi Times Three |date=June 4, 2018 |url=http://loveletterstooldhollywood.blogspot.com/2018/06/gigi-times-three.html |website=Love Letters to Old Hollywood |accessdate=25 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Aunt Alicia was played by stage legend [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], who was to become Hepburn's acting mentor from that time on. Opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Fulton Theatre]] on 24 November 1951, the play ran for 219 performances (finishing on 31 May 1952) and Hepburn's Broadway debut earned her a [[Theatre World Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gigi&quot;&gt;{{ibdb title|id=1977|title=Gigi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Gigi (1958 film)|1958 musical film version]], starring [[Leslie Caron]] in the title role, with a screenplay by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and a score by Lerner and [[Frederick Loewe]], won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Lerner and Loewe adapted the film for an [[expurgation|expurgated]]{{cn|date=December 2018}} [[Gigi (musical)|1973 stage musical]] that proved to be unsuccessful, but was revived on Broadway in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles.

[[File:Elvish-druid.png|frame|[[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elvish]] druid, taken from the [[Battle for Wesnoth]] computer game. ]]
In [[role-playing game]]s, a '''druid''' is a [[character class]] that is generally portrayed as using nature-based [[magic (gaming)|magical]] abilities and striving to protect nature from civilized intrusion. Druid characters tend to have abilities that involve healing, weather or plant related spells, summoning animal allies, and [[shapeshifting]].

== ''Dungeons and Dragons'' ==
{{main|Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}
Druids in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' are spellcasters of neutral [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]] who gain [[divine magic]] from being at one with nature. As of 4th edition druids power source was changed to primal. Unlike [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]]s and [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|paladins]], druids do not have special powers against [[Undead (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|undead]]. Because of their spiritual oaths, druids cannot wear metal armor. Druids have the unique ability to change into various animal forms, and are accompanied on adventures by an animal companion.

== ''EverQuest II'' ==
In ''[[EverQuest II]]'', Druids are a priest class divided into Wardens and Furies. They are neutral and can come from cities of either alignment. They specialize in healing spells, particularly their heal over time (HoT) spells.  They are restricted to cloth and leather armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everquest2druids&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/en/main.vm#professionWarden|title=Everquest II - Warden (Druid) Class|accessdate=2007-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226100117/http://everquest2.station.sony.com/en/main.vm#professionWarden|archive-date=2007-02-26|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''World of Warcraft'' ==
In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/classes/druid/index.html |title=Classes - Game Guide - World of Warcraft |publisher=Wow-europe.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Night Elves, Tauren, Highmountain Tauren, Worgen, Trolls, Zandalari Trolls and Kul'Tiran Humans can become druids. They are spell casters (healer/damage dealer hybrids) in their humanoid form, but they gain the ability to shapeshift into different forms as they progress through the game. The basic forms that every druid can have, sorted by the order they become available, are: Cat, Bear, Travel (cheetah/stag), Stormcrow and Swift Stormcrow.  Depending on how a player distributes their talent points two additional forms may become available: Moonkin and Tree of Life. The forms let druids assume a specific role in a group or they provide utility functions such as improving travel speed. They have spells that seem to be very close to nature in their name and function, like Regrowth, Tranquility, Typhoon, Barkskin or Eclipse. In their feral forms they have ferocious-sounding abilities that resemble animal actions like Prowl, Bash, Berserk, Pounce or Growl.

Druids take less damage and appear to be more threatening to monsters while in Bear form, and they can use relatively low damage but high [[Hate (MMORPG terminology)|threat]] physical abilities like Maul or Lacerate, or they can Swipe multiple targets to generate threat on all of them, making Bears suitable for [[Tank (gaming)|tanking]]. Cat form is the opposite, but also builds on physical damage abilities, with gameplay mechanics similar to that of rogues, including stealth and alternatives for most of their offensive moves; Cats excel in damage dealing so in cat form the druid assumes the melee damage dealer role. The travel and Cheetah forms gives extra running speed so it is useful for escaping or traveling. The Aquatic form is the same except that it's only usable while underwater, but it provides both extra swimming speed and unlimited breath. The Stormcrow and Swift Stormcrow (or Flight Form and Swift Flight Form) gives the druid the ability to fly at the same speed as that of the level-appropriate flying mounts in the game, with the same restrictions of course. The druids specialized in Balance can shapeshift into a Moonkin, which will enhance the druid's and their group's offensive spells, making them viable as ranged damage dealers and support. Finally, Restoration druids can temporarily assume Tree of Life form, which boosts the strength of their healing spells, their armor, and empowers several of their abilities while they are in the Tree of Life form.

One unique feature of druids in [[Player vs Player|PvP]] combat is that in their different forms (except normal humanoid form) they are immune to polymorph effects and the act of shapeshifting frees them from any polymorph or movement impairing effect. Another unique feature of druids that is more apparent in [[Player vs Environment|PvE]] combat is that they can resurrect dead group members even in combat, while normal resurrection spells only work out of combat. However, this powerful resurrection spell has a long (10 minutes) [[cooldown]].

Druids are the most versatile class in the game, but they lose their instant versatility already on lower levels, as later on a druid that is specialized in the Restoration talent tree for example will not be able to effectively tank in a high level instance just by shapeshifting into Bear form. However, with the proper talent specialization via Feral/Guardian/Balance/Restoration affinity they can partly take role depending on a chosen affinity for a short time, until a problem in group is solved, like resurrecting a tank or a healer.

With the launch of the ''Cataclysm'' expansion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/cataclysm/features/index.html |title=Blizzard Entertainment: World of Warcraft: Cataclysm |publisher=Wow-europe.com |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new Alliance race Worgen and the Horde's Trolls are able to become druids in addition to Tauren and Night Elves.

With the Batlle for Azeroth expansion, the new Alliance race Kul'tiral human, and the Horde's Zandalari Trolls are able to become druids in addition to Tauren, Trolls and Night Elves, Worgen.

The '''National Center for Science Education''' ('''NCSE''') is a [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] membership organization in the United States whose stated mission is to educate the press and the public on the scientific and educational aspects of controversies surrounding the teaching of [[evolution]] and [[climate change]], and to provide information and resources to schools, parents, and other citizens working to keep those topics in public school science education. Based in [[Oakland, California]], it claims 4,500 members that include scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens of varied religious and political affiliations.&lt;ref name=AboutNCSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/about |title=About NCSE |date=January 2012 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119181010/http://ncse.com/about |archive-date=January 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/about/faq &quot;Frequently Asked Questions about NCSE&quot;].

==History==
In 1980 [[Stanley L. Weinberg]], a veteran high-school teacher in Iowa, began to organize statewide Committees of Correspondence &quot;committed to the defense of education in evolutionary theory,&quot; modelled upon the [[committees of correspondence]] in pre-Revolutionary America. Their purpose was to keep interested parties informed about creationist endeavours and to share ideas for responses, allowing a political response at a local level. This grew into volunteer networks in most states, with the ''Creation/Evolution Newsletter'' interconnecting them,&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p353&lt;/ref&gt; which was incorporated as the NCSE in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/about/history History of NCSE], National Center for Science Education&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, author and lecturer [[Eugenie Scott]], who holds a [[PhD]] in [[Physical Anthropology]], became its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;Tom McIver in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', quoted in [http://www.ncse.com/evc Eugenie C. Scott's ''Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction''], National Center for Science Education&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors and official supporters, as explained by NCSE, &quot;reflects our scientific roots.&quot;{{cite quote|date=March 2011}}

In the 1990s, based upon its monitoring of creationist efforts, it issued warnings of high levels of official anti-evolutionism and a &quot;sharp surge upwards&quot; in creationist attacks on evolution, including attempts to downgrade evolution from &quot;fact&quot; to &quot;theory&quot; (see [[evolution as theory and fact]]) or present the &quot;evidence against evolution&quot; (see [[objections to evolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p2&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's supporters include [[Bruce Alberts]], former President of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]; [[Donald Johanson]], discoverer of the &quot;[[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]]&quot; fossil; and evolutionary biologist [[Francisco J. Ayala]]. Also the late [[paleontologist]] and writer [[Stephen Jay Gould]] was a long-time supporter. As of 2012, the group has 4500 members who are &quot;scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious and political affiliations.&quot;&lt;ref name=AboutNCSE /&gt;

In November 2013 Ann Reid succeeded Eugenie C. Scott as executive director. Eugenie C. Scott served as executive director for 27 years, 1986 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2013/11/ncses-new-executive-director-0015185 | title=NCSE's new executive director  | publisher=National Center for Science Education |year= 2013 | access-date =2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and programs ==
The NCSE maintains up-to-date listings of current events and information regarding creationist and antievolution advocacy, as well as about evolution education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution and Creationism|author-first1=Christian C.|author-last1=Young|author-first2=Mark A.|author-last2=Largent|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33953-0|p=292|section=Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science [[Michael Shermer]] describes its website as being one of &quot;the two best resources on the Internet on the evolution/creation topic&quot; (the other being [[TalkOrigins Archive]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown'', [[Michael Shermer]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The NCSE also opposes [[intelligent design]] and other &quot;alternatives&quot; to [[evolution]] because it says they are misleading euphemisms for creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/facing-challenges-to-evolution-education | title=Facing Challenges to Evolution Education  | publisher=National Center for Science Education |year= 2008 | access-date =2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCSE &quot;is religiously neutral, though it cooperates nationally and locally with religious organizations, as well as scientific and educational organizations like the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Association of Biology Teachers]], and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].&quot; Its willingness to engage positively with, and avoid taking sides against, religiously minded supporters of evolution has been noted by historian of creationism [[Ronald L. Numbers]] and atheist author [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]], pp66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCSE offers a variety of lecturers, including biologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, for topics relating to evolution, science, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ncse.com/about/staff | title=Staff | publisher=National Center for Science Education | year=2008 | access-date=2008-11-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019165214/http://ncse.com/about/staff | archive-date=2009-10-19 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it hosts activities including trips and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/ncse-events | title=NCSE Events | publisher=National Center for Science Education |year= 2008| access-date =2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes '''''Reports of the National Center for Science Education''''' bimonthly, containing peer-reviewed articles, book reviews, and news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ncse.com/media/rncse | title=''Reports of the National Center for Science Education'' | publisher=National Center for Science Education |year= 2008| access-date =2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1997, it published the '''''Creation/Evolution Journal''''', which has since been merged into ''Reports of the National Center for Science Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ncse.com/media/cej | title=Creation/Evolution Journal | access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it publishes books, such as a compilation of scientific analyses of creationist books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/store/ncse-books | title=NCSE Books | publisher=National Center for Science Education |year= 2008| access-date =2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the NCSE gained international attention with [[Project Steve]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve Project Steve], National Center for Science Education, Last updated October 25, 2008, ''retrieved November 4, 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the NCSE assisted the plaintiffs in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', the most prominent case testing the constitutionality of intelligent design in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] science classes, and put their extensive library of creationist materials at the plaintiffs' disposal. [[Nick Matzke]], the NCSE's Public Information Project Director at the time, served as liaison to the legal team, and was responsible for uncovering the substitution of &quot;intelligent design&quot; for &quot;creationism&quot; within drafts of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', which became a devastating part of the testimony of [[Barbara Forrest]] (also an NCSE Director),&lt;ref&gt;''Deception by Design'', Lenny Flank, Lenny Flank, Jr., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and was cited extensively in Judge [[John E. Jones III]]'s [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|decision]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], p32&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the NCSE launched Expelled Exposed, a website critical of the alleged documentary ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' starring [[Ben Stein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/expelled-flunks-test-002310 | title=Expelled flunks the test | publisher=National Center for Science Education |date= April 15, 2008| access-date =2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website received press attention and a large amount of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/04/expelled-exposed-002306 | title=Expelled exposed | publisher=National Center for Science Education |date= April 18, 2008| access-date =2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the NCSE announced they would be engaged in efforts to keep climate change education, and global warming issues, safe from threats from special interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/education-advocates-enter-the.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308234531/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/education-advocates-enter-the.html |archive-date=2013-03-08 |work=ScienceInsider |title=Education Advocates Enter the Climate Tempest |first=Sara |last=Reardon |date=January 17, 2012 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed a series of lessons addressing climate change misconceptions and offer teacher training through a Teacher Ambassador program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.skepticzone.tv/ |title=The Skeptic Zone |website=www.skepticzone.tv/ |host=[[Richard Saunders (skeptic)|Richard Saunders]] |date=January 20, 2019 |access-date=January 29, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
[[Eugenie Scott]] appeared on [[Uncommon Knowledge]], as NCSE spokesperson, twice in 2001 debating intelligent design creationist [[William A. Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3004521.html |title=Darwin Under The Microscope: Questioning Darwinism |date=December 7, 2001 |access-date=2008-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610060419/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3004521.html |archive-date=2010-06-10 |publisher=[[Uncommon Knowledge]] |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3004591.html |title=In Whose Image?

She noted, &quot;it would be unfair to tell students that there is a serious dispute going on among scientists whether evolution took place. There's not.&quot; She further noted that &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;a lot of the time the creationists ... they'll search through scientific journals and try to pull out something they think demonstrates evolution doesn't work and there is a kind of interesting rationale behind it. Their theology is such that if one thing is wrong with the Bible you have to throw it all out so that's why Genesis has to be interpreted literally. They look at science the same way. If one little piece of the evolutionary puzzle doesn't fit the whole thing has to go.&quot; Scott then explained &quot;that's not the way science is done.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2007 Scott discussed the NCSE's exploration of [[intelligent design]] on the [[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]] documentary ''[[Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial]]'', which documented [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/11/judgment-day-news-001251 |title=Judgment Day in the news |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=2008-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427194810/http://ncse.com/news/2007/11/judgment-day-news-001251 |archive-date=2016-04-27 |publisher=National Center for Science Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

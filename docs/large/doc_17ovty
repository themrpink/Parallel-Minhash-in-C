Bogdanovich, drawing from his encyclopedic knowledge of film history, authored several critically lauded books, including ''Peter Bogdanovich's Movie of the Week'', which offered the lifelong cinephile's commentary on 52 of his favorite films, and ''Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors'' and ''Who the Hell's in It: Conversations with Hollywood's Legendary Actors'', both based on interviews with directors and actors.

===Later career===
In 1998, the [[National Film Preservation Board]] of the [[Library of Congress]] named ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' to the [[National Film Registry]], an honor awarded only to &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films.&quot;

In 2001, Bogdanovich resurfaced with ''[[The Cat's Meow]]''. Returning once again to a reworking of the past, this time the supposed murder of director [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] by Orson Welles's ''bête noire'' [[William Randolph Hearst]], ''The Cat's Meow'' was a modest critical success but made little money at the box office. Bogdanovich says he was told the story of the alleged Ince murder by Welles, who in turn said he heard it from writer [[Charles Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=213 |title=Interview with Peter Bogdanovich from March 9, 2008 |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=2008-03-14 |access-date=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest role on the cable television series ''[[The Sopranos]]'', playing [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]]'s psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in [[Yokel Chords|an episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and appeared as himself in the &quot;[[Robots Versus Wrestlers]]&quot; episode of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' along with [[Arianna Huffington]] and [[Will Shortz]]. [[Quentin Tarantino]] also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2]]''. &quot;Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices&quot;, said Bogdanovich. &quot;So he called me and he said, 'I stole your voice from ''The Last Picture Show'' for the rough cut, but I need you to come down and do that voice again for my picture ... '&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=10bqs/bogdanovich |title=ESPN interview with Peter Bogdanovich |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1999-02-22 |access-date=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdanovich hosted ''The Essentials'' on [[Turner Classic Movies]], but was replaced in May 2006 by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]] and film critic [[Molly Haskell]]. Bogdanovich has hosted introductions to movies on [[Criterion Collection]] DVDs, and has had a supporting role as a fictional version of himself in the Showtime comedy series ''[[Out of Order (miniseries)|Out of Order]]''. He will next appear in ''The Dream Factory''.

In 2006, Bogdanovich joined forces with ClickStar, where he hosts a classic film channel, Peter Bogdanovich's [[Golden Age of Movies]]. Bogdanovich also writes a blog for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://community.cstar.com/thread.jspa?threadID=400000020# |title=Community.cstar.com |access-date=2007-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313135456/http://community.cstar.com/thread.jspa?threadid=400000020# |archive-date=2016-03-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he appeared in the BBC documentary, ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' and in 2006, he appeared in the documentary ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]''.

In 2007, Bogdanovich was presented with an award for outstanding contribution to film preservation by the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiff07.ca/filmsandschedules/filmdetails.aspx?ID=707112015001386|title=Films &amp; Schedules La Grand Illusion|last=Frank|first=Sylvia|date=2007|website=Toronto International Film Festival Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113145613/http://www.tiff07.ca/filmsandschedules/filmdetails.aspx?ID=707112015001386|archive-date=2007-11-13|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bogdanovich joined the directing faculty at the School of Filmmaking at the [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]]. On April 17, 2010, he was awarded the Master of Cinema Award at the 12th Annual RiverRun International Film Festival. In 2011, he was given the Auteur Award by the [[International Press Academy]], which is awarded to filmmakers whose singular vision and unique artistic control over the elements of production give a personal and signature style to their films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressacademy.com/award_cat/current-nominees/ 2011 Satellite Winners], December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Bogdanovich made news with an essay in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', published in the aftermath of the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting]], in which he argued against excessive violence in the movies:

{{quote|Today, there's a general numbing of the audience. There's too much murder and killing. You make people insensitive by showing it all the time. The body count in pictures is huge. It numbs the audience into thinking it's not so terrible. Back in the '70s, I asked Orson Welles what he thought was happening to pictures, and he said, &quot;We're brutalizing the audience. We're going to end up like the Roman circus, live at the [[Colosseum|Coliseum]].&quot; The respect for human life seems to be eroding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dark-knight-rises-shooting-peter-bogdanovich-353774 |title=Legendary Director Peter Bogdanovich: What If Movies Are Part of the Problem? |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2012-07-25 |access-date=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bogdanovich's most recent narrative film, ''[[She's Funny That Way (film)|She's Funny That Way]]'', was released in theaters and on demand in 2014, followed by the documentary ''The Great Buster: A Celebration'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Great Buster|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt8758548/|access-date=2020-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated with Turner Classic Movies, and TCM host [[Ben Mankiewicz]] to create a documentary podcast about his life. Season One premieres April 28, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplotthickens.tcm.com/ |title=The Plot Thickens |publisher=tcm.com  |access-date=2020-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odense University''' was a [[university]] in [[Odense]], [[Denmark]]. It was established in 1966. In 1998, the university was merged with two other institutions to form the [[University of Southern Denmark]]. Its campus is now known as University of Southern Denmark Odense (''Syddansk Universitet Odense'', abbr. SDU Odense) and is the university's biggest campus.

==History==
The university was established in 1966. It had four faculties: Humanities, Social Sciences, Health Science and Natural Sciences.

In 1998, Odense University was merged with the Southern Denmark School of Business and Engineering and the South Jutland University Centre to form the University of Southern Denmark. The campus is now known as SDU Odense, and is considered the main campus of the University of Southern Denmark, both because of its relative size and because the central administration of the university is situated there.

==Campus==
Being an epitome of [[Danish Functionalism (architecture)|Danish functionalist architecture]], the campus has been [[nickname]]d ''Rustenborg'' (which roughly translates as ''The Rusty Castle'') by students and staff, because it is built from gray concrete slabs clad with [[weathering steel]], in an early architectural use of that material. Its architecture has also given rise to other nicknames and slang expressions among students and staff. For instance, the administrative block goes by the name of ''Førerbunkeren'' (''&quot;[[Führerbunker]]&quot;''), referring to the architectural similarities between the university building and a stereotypical military building. The University of Southern Denmark's students' magazine is simply called ''Rust''.

==Motto and logo==
When abbreviated, the university motto becomes ''FIONIA'', the [[Latin]] name for [[Funen]]. The motto was created by the university's first [[Rector (academia)|rector]], [[Mogens Brøndsted]] in 1966. Brøndsted also designed the university logo, featuring an apple tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Administration and organization==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 9 members: 5 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 1 member is appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the students. The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sdu.dk/Om_SDU/Organisationen/Bestyrelsen.aspx | title= Syddansk Universitets bestyrelse| accessdate= 2009-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

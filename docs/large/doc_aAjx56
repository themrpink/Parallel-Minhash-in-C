=={{anchor|LEAD}}Unwanted and wanted photodiode effects==
Any p–n junction, if illuminated, is potentially a photodiode. Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors and ICs contain p–n junctions, and will not function correctly if they are illuminated by unwanted electromagnetic radiation (light) of wavelength suitable to produce a photocurrent.&lt;ref&gt;Shanfield, Z. et al (1988) [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA210165 Investigation of radiation effects on semiconductor devices and integrated circuits], DNA-TR-88-221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iniewski, Krzysztof (ed.) (2010), ''Radiation Effects in Semiconductors'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4398-2694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeller | first1 = H.R. | year = 1995 | title = Cosmic ray induced failures in high power semiconductor devices | journal = Solid-State Electronics| volume =  38| issue = 12| pages = 2041–2046| doi=10.1016/0038-1101(95)00082-5| bibcode = 1995SSEle..38.2041Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to induced photo-currents. Background radiation from the packaging is also significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alpha-particle-induced soft errors in dynamic memories|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|volume=26|issue=1|pages=2–9|doi=10.1109/T-ED.1979.19370|year=1979|last1=May|first1=T.C.|last2=Woods|first2=M.H.|bibcode=1979ITED...26....2M|s2cid=43748644}} Cited in {{cite journal|author=Baumann, R.

In some cases, the effect is actually wanted, for example to use [[LED]]s as light-sensitive devices (see [[LED as light sensor]]) or even for [[energy harvesting]], then sometimes called ''light-emitting and light-absorbing diodes'' (LEADs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Halbleitertechnik Der LED fehlt der Doppelpfeil |author-first=Arno |author-last=Erzberger |journal=Elektronik |language=German |date=2016-06-21 |url=http://www.elektroniknet.de/elektronik/power/der-led-fehlt-der-doppelpfeil-131470.html |access-date=2017-02-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181713/http://www.elektroniknet.de/elektronik/power/der-led-fehlt-der-doppelpfeil-131470.html |archive-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Response silicon photodiode.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Response of a silicon photo diode vs wavelength of the incident light]]
Critical performance parameters of a photodiode include spectral responsivity, dark current, response time and noise-equivalent power.

;[[Responsivity|Spectral responsivity]]: The spectral responsivity is a ratio of the generated photocurrent to incident light power, expressed in [[Ampere|A]]/[[Watt|W]] when used in photoconductive mode. The wavelength-dependence may also be expressed as a ''[[quantum efficiency]]'' or the ratio of the number of photogenerated carriers to incident photons which is a unitless quantity.

;[[Dark current (physics)|Dark current]]: The dark current is the current through the photodiode in the absence of light, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by [[calibration]] if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of [[Electronic noise|noise]] when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.

;[[Response time (technology)|Response time]]: The response time is the time required for the detector to respond to an optical input. A photon absorbed by the semiconducting material will generate an electron–hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under the effect of the electric field and thus generate a [[Electric current|current]]. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using [[Shockley–Ramo theorem|Ramo's theorem]]. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is [[Elementary charge|e]] and not 2e as one might expect by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the [[integral]] of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as [[RC time constant]] (&lt;math&gt;\tau=RC&lt;/math&gt;). This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the [[impulse response]] of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.

;[[Noise-equivalent power]]: Noise-equivalent power (NEP) is the minimum input optical power to generate photocurrent, equal to the rms noise current in a 1&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]] bandwidth.  NEP is essentially the minimum detectable power. The related ''characteristic detectivity'' (&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;) is the inverse of NEP (1/NEP) and the ''[[specific detectivity]]'' (&lt;math&gt;D^\star&lt;/math&gt;) is the detectivity multiplied by the square root of the area (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) of the photodetector (&lt;math&gt;D^\star=D\sqrt{A}&lt;/math&gt;) for a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth.  The specific detectivity allows different systems to be compared independent of sensor area and system bandwidth; a higher detectivity value indicates a low-noise device or system.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Graham (2009) ''Introduction to Sensors for Ranging and Imaging'', ScitTech Publishing. p. 87. {{ISBN|9781891121746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is traditional to give (&lt;math&gt;D^\star&lt;/math&gt;) in many catalogues as a measure of the diode's quality, in practice, it is hardly ever the key parameter.

When a photodiode is used in an optical communication system, all these parameters contribute to the ''[[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]'' of the optical receiver which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified ''[[bit error rate]]''.

==Applications==
P–n photodiodes are used in similar applications to other [[photodetector]]s, such as [[photoconductor]]s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD, and [[photomultiplier]] tubes. They may be used to generate an output which is dependent upon the illumination (analog for measurement), or to change the state of circuitry (digital, either for control and switching or for digital signal processing).

Photodiodes are used in [[consumer electronics]] devices such as [[compact disc]] players, [[smoke detector]]s, medical devices&lt;ref name=Aguilar&gt;E. Aguilar Pelaez et al., &quot;LED power reduction trade-offs for ambulatory pulse oximetry,&quot; 2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Lyon, 2007, pp. 2296-2299.
doi: 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352784, URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4352784&amp;isnumber=4352185&lt;/ref&gt; and the receivers for infrared [[Remote control|remote control devices]] used to control equipment from [[Television set|televisions]] to air conditioners. For many applications either photodiodes or photoconductors may be used. Either type of photosensor may be used for light measurement, as in [[camera]] light meters, or to respond to light levels, as in switching on street lighting after dark.

Photosensors of all types may be used to respond to incident light or to a source of light which is part of the same circuit or system. A photodiode is often combined into a single component with an emitter of light, usually a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), either to detect the presence of a mechanical obstruction to the beam ([[slotted optical switch]]) or to [[Coupling (electronics)|couple]] two digital or analog circuits while maintaining extremely high [[electrical isolation]] between them, often for safety ([[optocoupler]]). The combination of LED and photodiode is also used in many [[sensor]] systems to characterize different types of products based on their [[absorbance|optical absorbance]].

Photodiodes are often used for accurate measurement of light intensity in science and industry. They generally have a more linear response than photoconductors.

They are also widely used in various medical applications, such as detectors for [[computed tomography]] (coupled with [[scintillator]]s), instruments to analyze samples ([[immunoassay]]), and [[pulse oximeter]]s.

[[PIN diode]]s are much faster and more sensitive than p–n junction diodes, and hence are often used for [[optical communication]]s and in lighting regulation.

P–n photodiodes are not used to measure extremely low light intensities. Instead, if high sensitivity is needed, [[avalanche photodiode]]s, [[intensified charge-coupled device]]s or [[photomultiplier]] tubes are used for applications such as [[astronomy]], [[spectroscopy]], [[night vision equipment]] and [[laser rangefinder|laser rangefinding]].

===Comparison with photomultipliers===

Advantages compared to [[photomultiplier]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sales.hamamatsu.com/assets/html/ssd/si-photodiode/index.htm Photodiode Technical Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104122603/http://sales.hamamatsu.com/assets/html/ssd/si-photodiode/index.htm |date=2007-01-04 }} on Hamamatsu website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinned photodiode===
The pinned photodiode (PPD) has p+/n/p regions in it. The PPD has a shallow P+ implant in N type diffusion layer over a P-type epitaxial substrate layer. It is not to be confused with the [[PIN diode|PIN]] photodiode. The PPD is used in [[CMOS]] [[active-pixel sensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/83018/difference-between-buried-photodiode-and-pinned-photodiode Difference between Buried Photodiode and Pinned Photodiode]. stackexchange.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Early charge-coupled device [[image sensor]]s suffered from [[shutter lag]]. This was largely resolved with the invention of the pinned photodiode (PPD).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt; It was invented by [[Nobukazu Teranishi]], Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at [[NEC]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4484210|U.S. Patent 4,484,210: Solid-state imaging device having a reduced image lag}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recognized that lag can be eliminated if the signal carriers could be transferred from the photodiode to the CCD. This led to their invention of the pinned photodiode, a photodetector structure with low lag, low [[noise (electronics)|noise]], high [[quantum efficiency]] and low [[dark current (physics)|dark current]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt; It was first publicly reported by Teranishi and Ishihara with A. Kohono, E. Oda and K. Arai in 1982, with the addition of an anti-blooming structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teranishi |first1=Nobuzaku |author1-link=Nobukazu Teranishi |last2=Kohono |first2=A. |last3=Ishihara |first3=Yasuo |last4=Oda |first4=E. |last5=Arai |first5=K. |title=No image lag photodiode structure in the interline CCD image sensor |journal=1982 International Electron Devices Meeting |date=December 1982 |pages=324–327 |doi=10.1109/IEDM.1982.190285|s2cid=44669969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new photodetector structure invented at NEC was given the name &quot;pinned photodiode&quot; (PPD) by B.C. Burkey at Kodak in 1984. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD sensors, becoming a fixture in [[consumer electronic]] [[video cameras]] and then [[digital still camera]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, [[Eric Fossum]], while working at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), proposed an improvement to the [[CMOS sensor]]: the integration of the pinned photodiode. A CMOS sensor with PPD technology was first fabricated in 1995 by a joint JPL and [[Kodak]] team that included Fossum along with P.P.K. Lee, R.C. Gee, R.M. Guidash and T.H. Lee. Since then, the PPD has been used in nearly all CMOS sensors. The CMOS sensor with PPD technology was further advanced and refined by R.M. Guidash in 1997, K. Yonemoto and H. Sumi in 2000, and I. Inoue in 2003. This led to CMOS sensors achieve imaging performance on par with CCD sensors, and later exceeding CCD sensors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt;

==Photodiode array==
[[File:Photodiode array chip.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A 2 x 2 cm photodiode array chip with more than 200 diodes]]
A one-dimensional array of hundreds or thousands of photodiodes can be used as a position [[sensor]], for example as part of an angle sensor.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, one advantage of modern photodiode arrays (PDAs) is that they may allow for high speed parallel readout since the driving electronics may not be built in like a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or [[CMOS sensor]].

===Passive-pixel sensor===
The [[passive-pixel sensor]] (PPS) is a type of photodiode array. It was the precursor to the [[active-pixel sensor]] (APS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fossum |first1=Eric R. |author1-link=Eric Fossum |last2=Hondongwa |first2=D. B. |title=A Review of the Pinned Photodiode for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors |journal=IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society |date=2014 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=33–43 |doi=10.1109/JEDS.2014.2306412 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A passive-pixel sensor consists of passive pixels which are read out without [[amplifier|amplification]], with each pixel consisting of a photodiode and a [[MOSFET]] switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozlowski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozlowski |first1=L. J. |last2=Luo |first2=J. |last3=Kleinhans |first3=W. E. |last4=Liu |first4=T. |title=Comparison of passive and active pixel schemes for CMOS visible imagers |journal=Infrared Readout Electronics IV |date=14 September 1998 |volume=3360 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1117/12.584474 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268189518 |publisher=International Society for Optics and Photonics|bibcode=1998SPIE.3360..101K |s2cid=123351913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a photodiode array, pixels contain a [[p-n junction]], integrated [[capacitor]], and MOSFETs as selection [[transistors]]. A photodiode array was proposed by G. Weckler in 1968, predating the CCD.&lt;ref name=fossum93&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fossum |first1=Eric R. |author1-link=Eric Fossum |title=Active pixel sensors: are CCDs dinosaurs? |journal=SPIE Proceedings Vol. 1900: Charge-Coupled Devices and Solid State Optical Sensors III |volume=1900 |date=12 July 1993 |doi=10.1117/12.148585 |publisher=International Society for Optics and Photonics |pages=2–14 |editor1-last=Blouke |editor1-first=Morley M.|citeseerx=10.1.1.408.6558 |bibcode=1993SPIE.1900....2F |s2cid=10556755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the basis for the PPS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fossum2014&quot;/&gt;

Early photodiode arrays were complex and impractical, requiring selection transistors to be fabricated within each pixel, along with on-chip [[multiplexer]] circuits. The [[noise (electronics)|noise]] of photodiode arrays was also a limitation to performance, as the photodiode readout [[memory bus|bus]] capacitance resulted in increased noise level. [[Correlated double sampling]] (CDS) could also not be used with a photodiode array without external [[computer memory|memory]]. It was not possible to [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricate]] active pixel sensors with a practical pixel size in the 1970s, due to limited [[microlithography]] technology at the time.&lt;ref name=fossum93/&gt;

The [[antibiotic]]s complestatin and [[corbomycin]] prevent autolysin from remodeling the cell wall by binding to peptidoglycan, therefore stopping bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;CulpWaglechner2020&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Culp EJ, Waglechner N, Wang W, Fiebig-Comyn AA, Hsu YP, Koteva K, Sychantha D, Coombes BK, Van Nieuwenhze MS, Brun YV, Wright GD | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolution-guided discovery of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan remodelling | journal = Nature | volume = 578 | issue = 7796 | pages = 582–587 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32051588 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-020-1990-9 | bibcode = 2020Natur.578..582C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amide linkages between stem peptide and lactyl moiety of muramoyl residue are cleaved by [[N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase|N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases]] and partakes in cell separation and the dissociation of the cell septum.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; There are 5 types of autolysins that contribute to cell separation of daughter cells, LytC, LytD, LytE, and LytF.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Lysis of Mother Cell ===
{{Infobox enzyme|name=N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase|EC_number=3.5.1.28|CAS_number=9013-25-6|GO_code=GO:0008745}}
LytC and CwlC are two [[amidase]]s from the LytC family that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan of the mother cell wall to allow for the release of the mature endospore. CwlC is directly found in the mother cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Motility ===
Expression of lytC, lytD, and lytF genes together leads to flagellar motility and is controlled by the activity of the chemotaxis sigma factor,  σ&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of this sigma factor peaks at the start of the stationary phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Potential Lethality ===
Autolysins are naturally produced by peptidoglycan containing bacteria, but excessive amounts will degrade the peptidoglycan matrix and cause the cell to burst due to [[osmotic pressure]]. Previous studies have found that the byproducts of autolysin during cell wall breakdown are highly immunogenic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; When observed in the bacteria, [[Bacillus subtilis]] (B. subtilis), there were potentially lethal amounts of autolysin found in the cell walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In Steptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), it was found that N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, a cell wall autolysin, could assist in pathogenesis due to its ability to break down the wall or lyse a portion of the invading pneumococci and release potentially lethal toxins into the cell. Researchers studied the function, structure, and cloning ability through Escherichia coli (E. coli) and also determined its nucleotide sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

== Families ==

=== LytC amidase Family ===

==== LytC ====
LytC as well as LytD are considered as two major autolysins that contribute to vegetative cell wall growth and account for 95% of the autolytic activity in B. subtilis. LytC is found in the cell wall. LytB, a non-autolysin, was found to enhance LytC activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; LytC and LytA interact and function together for lysis and cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Pedro|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Maria Paz|last3=Garcia|first3=Ernesto|last4=Garcia|first4=Jose Luis|last5=Lopez|first5=Rubens|date=July 1999|title=The molecular characterization of the first autolytic lysozyme of Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals evolutionary mobile domains|journal=Molecular Microbiology|volume=33|issue=1|pages=128–138|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01455.x|pmid=10411730|issn=0950-382X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox enzyme

==== CwlC ====
CwlC is found in the mother cell wall and functions for the lysis of the mother cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; CwlC does not have a signal sequence but participates in late sporulation and is present in the cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuroda|first=A|last2=Asami|first2=Y|last3=Sekiguchi|first3=J|date=1993|title=Molecular cloning of a sporulation-specific cell wall hydrolase gene of Bacillus subtilis.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=175|issue=19|pages=6260–6268|doi=10.1128/jb.175.19.6260-6268.1993|pmid=8407798|pmc=206722|issn=0021-9193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=T J|last2=Foster|first2=S J|date=1995|title=Characterization of the involvement of two compensatory autolysins in mother cell lysis during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis 168.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=177|issue=13|pages=3855–3862|doi=10.1128/jb.177.13.3855-3862.1995|pmid=7601853|pmc=177106|issn=0021-9193}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in B. subtilis that CwlC is able to hydrolyze both vegetative cell walls and spore peptidoglycan.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== LytD glucosaminidase Family ===
This family of autolysin consist of only LytD itself. LytD functions for vegetative growth. Autolytic activity is found within the C-terminal region with catalytic domain homologous to the glucosaminidase domain. LytD is found in the cell wall. LytD activity was studied in B. subtilis and glucosaminidase activity was found in mature glycan strands due to the presence of MurNAc at the nonreducing ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

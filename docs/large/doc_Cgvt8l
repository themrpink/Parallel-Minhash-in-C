'''Hitchhiking''' (also known as '''thumbing''' or '''hitching''') is a means of [[transportation]] that is gained by asking individuals, usually strangers, for a ride in their [[car]] or other vehicle. The ride is usually, but not always, free.

[[Nomad|Nomads]] have also used hitchhiking as a primary mode of travel for the better part of the last century, and continue to do so today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hitchtheworld.com/ Hitch The World | ...indefinite vagabond travel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velabas.com Velabas – Travel Narrative and Drawings from Hitchhiking Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signaling methods==
[[Image:Hitchhiker's gesture.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A typical hitchhiker's gesture]]
;Signals used by hitchhikers
Hitchhikers use a variety of signals to indicate they need a ride. Indicators can be physical gestures or displays including written signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Do Hitchhikers Say &quot;(Destination)...Or Bust!&quot;?|author=Kovalchik, Kara|date=January 9, 2015|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60989/why-do-hitchhikers-say-destinationor-bust|website=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical gestures, e.g., hand signals, hitchhikers use differ around the world: 
*In some African countries, the hitchhiker's hand is held with the palm facing upwards.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} 
*In most of Europe, North America, and the United Kingdom, most hitchhikers stand with their back facing the direction of travel. The hitchhiker typically extends their arm towards the road with the thumb of the closed hand pointing upward or in the direction of vehicle travel. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}
*In other parts of the world, such as Australia, it is more common to use the index finger to point at the road. {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

;Signals used by drivers
In 1971, during the [[Vietnam War]], drivers invented methods to communicate various messages to hitchhikers (frequently soldiers in those areas of the U.S. near military bases). To indicate to a hitchhiking soldier that their vehicles have no additional space to accommodate them, drivers could tap on the vehicle roof. Another common message that drivers could signal to hitchhikers—who usually sought to travel long distances, distances too far to walk in a reasonable amount of time—was that the driver's destinations were located nearby—and of little use to the hitchhiker—by pointing at the ground for a few seconds.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Legal status==
[[Image:US no hitchhiking signs.svg|thumb|225px|Two of the signs used in the United States, forbidding hitchhiking]]
Hitchhiking is a historically common ([[Autonomy|autonomous]]) practice worldwide and hence there are very few places in the world where laws exist to restrict it. However, a minority of countries have laws that restrict hitchhiking at certain locations.&lt;ref&gt;Nwanna, p.573&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, some local governments have laws outlawing hitchhiking, on the basis of drivers' and hitchhikers' safety. In 1946, [[New Jersey]] arrested and imprisoned a hitchhiker, leading to intervention by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=So You Won't Talk, Huh? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777285,00.html |quote=In her cell, Susan learned that it also (technically) forbids hitchhiking, and demands (by a law passed in 1799) that strangers be able to give a good account of themselves.... Attorney James A. Major of the American Civil Liberties Union demanded that she be given a new trial.  |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=18 November 1946 |access-date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], several highways have restrictions on hitchhiking, particularly in [[British Columbia]] and the [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-series highways]] in Ontario. In all countries in Europe, it is legal to hitchhike and in some places even encouraged.  However, worldwide, even where hitchhiking is permitted, laws forbid hitchhiking where pedestrians are banned, such as the [[Autobahn]] ([[Germany]]), [[Autostrade of Italy|Autostrade]] ([[Italy]]), [[motorway]]s (United Kingdom and continental Europe) or [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] (United States), although hitchhikers often obtain rides at entrances and truck stops where it is legal at least throughout Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiffarmingsociety.com/hitchhiking/hitchhiking.htm Hitchhiking Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asitoughttobe.com/2009/10/19/hitchhiking-trainhopping-part-ii/ Hitchhiking]&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://hitchwiki.org/en/Italy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In 2011, ''[[Freakonomics Radio]]'' reviewed sparse data about hitchhiking, and identified a decline in hitchhiking in the US since the 1970s, which it attributed to a number of factors, including lower air travel costs due to deregulation, the presence of more money in the economy to pay for travel, more numerous and more reliable cars, and a lack of trust of strangers.&lt;ref name=Huynh&gt;{{cite news|author=Huynh, Diana |url=http://freakonomics.com/podcast/where-have-all-the-hitchhikers-gone-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/ |title=Where Have All the Hitchhikers Gone?|work= Freakonomics Radio Podcast |date=10 October 2011|access-date= 21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of hitchhiking is thought to have been spurred by movies such as ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and a few real stories of imperiled passengers, notably the [[kidnapping of Colleen Stan]] in California.&lt;ref name=Huynh/&gt; See {{section link||Safety}}, below.

Julian Portis points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&amp;context=etd_hon_theses |type=BA thesis |last=Compagni Portis |first=Julian |date=2015 |title=Thumbs Down: America and the Decline of Hitchhiking |publisher=Wesleyan University }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the rise of faster highways, such as freeways, motorways, and expressways, has made hitchhiking more difficult. He adds:

{{quote|The real danger of hitchhiking has most likely remained relatively constant, but the general perception of this danger has increased. ... [O]ur national tolerance for danger has gone down: things that we previously saw as reasonably safe suddenly appeared imminently threatening. This trend is not just isolated to the world of hitchhiking; it has become a pernicious artifact throughout the American cultural conscience.}}

Some British researchers discuss reasons for hitchhiking's decline in the UK, and possible means of reviving it in safer and more-organized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sociological Research Online|volume=6|number=3 |author1=Chesters, Graeme |author2=Smith, David |year=2001|title='The Neglected Art of Hitch-hiking: Risk, Trust and Sustainability |url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/6/3/chesters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, hitchhikers have started efforts to strengthen their community. Examples include the annual [[Hitchgathering]], an event organized by hitchhikers, for hitchhikers, and websites such as [[hitchwiki]] and hitchbase, which are platforms for hitchhikers to share tips and provide a way of looking up good hitchhiking spots around the world. While hitchhiking is on the decline, it is still in regular use around the globe.

==Public policy support==
[[File:Mitfahrerbank Flensburg.jpg|thumb|left|''Mitfahrbank'' with destination signs in Flensburg]]Since the mid-2010s, local authorities in rural areas in Germany have started to support hitch-hiking, and this has spread to Austria and the German-speaking region of Belgium. The objectives are both social and environmental: as ridesharing improves mobility for local residents (particularly young and old people without their own cars) in places where public transport is inadequate, thus improving etworking among local communities in an environmentally friendly way. This support typically takes the form of providing hitch-hiking benches (in German ''[[:de:Mitfahrbank|Mitfahrbänke]]'') where people hoping for a ride can wait for cars. These benches are usually brightly coloured and located at the exit from a village, sometimes at an existing bus stop lay-by where vehicles can pull in safely. Some are even provided with large fold-out or slide-out signs with place names allowing hitchers to clearly signal where they want to go. Some ''Mitfahrbänke'' have been installed wth the help of the EU's [[LEADER programme]] for rural [[local development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.swp.de/suedwesten/landkreise/kreis-neu-ulm-bayern/nersingen-will-mitfahrbaenke-aufstellen-27322168.html |title=Projekt: Nersingen will Mitfahrbänke aufstellen |author=Bianca Frieß |newspaper=Südwest Presse |date=2018-08-10 |access-date=2019-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, ''Mitfahrbänke'' are especially common in [[Lower Austria]] and [[Tyrol]], and are promoted by the [[Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism]] under its ''klimaaktiv'' climate protection initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klimaaktiv.at/mobilitaet/mobilitaetsmanagem/kommunalregional/Die-Mitfahrbank.html|title=Die Mitfahrbank als unkomplizierte Mitfahrbörse für alle BürgerInnen |publisher=Österreichisches Bundesministerium für Nachhaltigkeit und Tourismus |date=2018-08-20 |access-date=2019-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the Tyrolean ''MobilitäterInnen'' network published a ''Manual for the Successful Introduction of Hitch-hiking Benches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbuch für eine erfolgreiche Einführung von Mitfahrbänken |publisher=MobilitäterInnen |date=2018 |url=http://www.mobilitaeterinnen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mobilitaeter-handbuch-web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies on the topic include a 1974 [[California Highway Patrol]] study and a 1989 German federal police study.&lt;ref name=&quot;dearth&quot; /&gt; The California study found that hitchhikers were not disproportionately likely to be victims of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod |first=Jamie |title=The 'better' Better Way |url=http://theeyeopener.com/2007/01/the-better-better-way/ |access-date=3 May 2013 |newspaper=The Eyeopener |date=10 January 2007 |quote=The most recent hard evidence I could find about hitchhiking danger was a 1974 study conducted by the California Highway Patrol examining crimes committed by and on hitchhikers.

Please note: http://enwp.org/WP:NOTHOWTO forbids &quot;instructing the reader in the [[imperative mood]]&quot; but seems to allow &quot;describing to the reader how other people [...] do something&quot;. Anyway, the above-recommended safety practices briefly summarize lessons from countless hours of safe and unsafe experiences from various hitchhikers. I think that, by doing so, the four lines significantly improve the section; please see http://enwp.org/WP:IAR.

==Around the world==
[[File:Hitching out of Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|275px|left|[[Orthodox Jews]] tremping in [[Jerusalem]]]]

===Cuba===
In [[Cuba]], picking up hitchhikers is mandatory for government vehicles, if passenger space is available. Hitchhiking is encouraged, as Cuba has few cars, and hitchhikers use designated spots. Drivers pick up waiting riders on a first come, first served basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/cuba/Cuba-Hitchhiking-Guide/255 Cuba Hitchhiking Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127044805/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/cuba/Cuba-Hitchhiking-Guide/255 |date=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{main|Hitchhiking in Israel}}
In [[Israel]], hitchhiking is commonplace at designated locations called ''trempiyadas'' ({{Hebrew|טרמפיאדה}} in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], derived from the [[German language|German]] ''trampen'').  Travelers soliciting rides, called ''trempists'', wait at trempiyadas, typically junctions of highways or main roads outside of a city.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, hitchhiking is very common in rural areas. Many do not own cars so hitchhiking is a common practice especially in and around villages.

===Netherlands===
[[Image:Hitchhiker sign amsterdam amstel.jpg|thumb|right|167px|Hitchhiking (called ''liften'') is legal in the [[Netherlands]]. This sign indicates a good place to get a lift.]]

In the [[Netherlands]], hitchhiking is legal and official signs indicate where one may wait for a ride.  These designated hitchhiking locations are called ''liftershalte'' or ''liftplaats'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and they are particularly common in university towns.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Verhart. [http://www.franknature.nl/hitchhike/hitchhikeen.htm Lifts (ad-hoc carpooling) in Netherlands.] 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitch-hiking.org/liftershalte.htm The Liftershalte: Hitchhiking in the Netherlands.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===Poland===
Hitchhiking in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] has a long history and is still popular. It was legalised and formalised  in 1957 so hitchhikers could buy booklets including coupons from travel agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autostopem.net/g-12-ksiazeczki_autostopu_78__81.html booklets]&lt;/ref&gt; These coupons were given to drivers who took hitchhikers. By the end of each season drivers who collected the highest number of coupons could exchange them for prizes, and others took part in a lottery. This so-called &quot;Akcja Autostop&quot; was popular till the end of the 1970s, but the sale of the booklet was discontinued in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Jakub Czupryński (red.), &quot;Autostop polski. PRL i współczesność&quot;, Korporacja Ha!art, Kraków 2005. {{ISBN|83-89911-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Hitchhiking in Ireland is legal, unless it takes place on motorways. A backpacker will most likely still get a lift if the car has enough space to park. Local police ([[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]]) usually let backpackers get away with a verbal warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchwiki.org/en/Ireland|title=Ireland - Hitchwiki: the Hitchhiker's guide to Hitchhiking|website=hitchwiki.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Hitchhiking became a common method of traveling during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].
[[File:Slug Line.gif|thumb|left|A &quot;slug line&quot; of passengers waiting for rides in the US]]
Warnings of the [[Stranger danger|potential dangers of picking up hitchhikers]] were publicized to drivers, who were advised that some hitchhikers would rob drivers and, in some cases, sexually assault or murder them. Other warnings were publicized to the hitchhikers themselves, alerting them to the same types of crimes being carried out by drivers. Still, hitchhiking was part of the American psyche and many people continued to stick out their thumbs, even in states where the practice had been outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dooling, Michael C. |title=Clueless in New England: The Unsolved Disappearances of Paula Welden, Connie Smith and Katherine Hull|publisher=The Carrollton Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, hitchhiking is legal in 44 of the 50 states,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchwiki.org/en/United_States_of_America|title=United States of America - Hitchwiki: the Hitchhiker's guide to Hitchhiking|website=hitchwiki.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that the hitchhiker is not standing in the roadway or otherwise hindering the normal flow of traffic. Even in states where hitchhiking is illegal, hitchhikers are rarely ticketed. For example, the [[Wyoming Highway Patrol]] approached 524 hitchhikers in 2010, but only eight of them were cited (hitchhiking was subsequently legalized in Wyoming in 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Hancock |url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-senate-committee-debates-advances-hitchhiking-bill/article_d18dfcdb-9125-5f9e-8201-b9eba3fedb07.html |title=Wyoming Senate committee debates, advances hitchhiking bill |newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune |date=13 January 2013 |access-date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchhiking is still in regular practice, but hitchhikers must accept the risks. 

In several urban areas, a variation of hitchhiking called [[slugging]] occurs, motivated by [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV]] lanes.&lt;ref name=HoustonChron&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/falkenberg/4939305.html |title=Slugs avoid the slow lane |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=July 2, 2007 |last=Falkenberg |first=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
====Early roles and breakthrough (1980–1989)====
In 1980, director [[George Roy Hill]] discovered Close on Broadway and asked her to audition with [[Robin Williams]] for a role in ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]],'' which would become her first film role.&lt;ref name=&quot;makers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makers.com/glenn-close|title=Glenn Close|access-date=2016-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302034408/http://www.makers.com/glenn-close|archive-date=March 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1980s proved to be Close's most successful decade in Hollywood. She made her debut film performance in ''The World According to Garp''  which earned Close her first Oscar nomination. She played [[Robin Williams]]'s mother, despite being just four years older. The following year she played Sarah Cooper in [[The Big Chill (film)|''The Big Chill'']], a character that director [[Lawrence Kasdan]] said he specifically wrote for her. The movie received positive reviews and was a financial success. Close became the third actor to receive a Tony, Emmy, and Oscar ([[Academy Award]]) nomination all in the same calendar year after the release of ''The Big Chill''.

In 1984 Close was given a part in [[Robert Redford]]'s baseball drama [[The Natural (film)|''The Natural'']], and although it was a small supporting role she earned a third consecutive Oscar nomination. Close, to this day, credits her nomination to cinematographer [[Caleb Deschanel]], stating &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;That hat was designed so the sunlight would come through. We waited for a certain time of day, so the sun was shining through the back of the stadium. And he had a lens that muted the people around me. It was an incredibly well thought-out shot. And I honestly think that's the reason I got nominated.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/gallery/glenn-close-reflects-10-roles/518384_natural-1984|title=Glenn Close Reflects on 10 Roles|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close also starred opposite [[Robert Duvall]] in the drama ''[[The Stone Boy (film)|The Stone Boy]]'' (1984), a film about a family coping after their youngest child accidentally kills his older brother in a hunting accident.

Eventually, Close began to seek different roles to play because she did not want to be typecast as a motherly figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Close&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/01/24/glenn-closes-13-favorite-movie-roles.html|title=Glenn Close's 13 Favorite Movie Roles|last=Close|first=Glenn|date=2010-01-24|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She starred in the 1985 romantic comedy ''[[Maxie (1985 film)|Maxie]]'', alongside [[Mandy Patinkin]]. Close was given favorable reviews and even received her second [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, but the movie was critically panned and under-performed at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-27/entertainment/ca-18442_1_maxie|title=Movie Reviews : 'Maxie': A Would-be Star Of The '20s Is Reborn|last=THOMAS|first=KEVIN|date=1985-09-27|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/maxie-1985|title=Maxie Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1985) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Close starred in the legal thriller ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'', opposite [[Jeff Bridges]]. Initially, [[Jane Fonda]] was attached to the role, but was replaced with Close when she requested changes in the script. Producer [[Martin Ransohoff]] was against the casting of Close because he said she was &quot;too ugly&quot; for the part. Close eventually heard about this and said she didn't want Ransohoff on set while she was making her scenes. Director [[Richard Marquand]] stood by her side and sent Ransohoff away. Infuriated, Ransohoff went to the studio heads trying to get Close and Marquand fired from the picture. The studio refused, stating they were pleased with their work in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood Animal|last=Eszterhas|first=Joe|publisher=Hutchinson|year=2004}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jagged Edge'' received favorable to positive reviews and grossed $40-million on a $15-million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jagged-edge-1985|title=Jagged Edge Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1985)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Close played the disturbed book editor Alex Forrest in ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''. The movie became a huge box-office success, the highest-grossing film worldwide of that year. The film propelled Close to international stardom and the character of Alex Forrest is considered one of her most iconic roles; the phrase &quot;bunny boiler&quot; has even been added to the dictionary, referring to a scene from the movie.

During the re-shoot of the ending, Close suffered a concussion from one of the takes when her head smashed against a mirror. After being rushed to the hospital, she discovered, much to her horror, that she was actually a few weeks pregnant with her daughter.  Close stated in an interview that, &quot;''Fatal Attraction'' was really the first part that took me away from the Jenny Fields, Sarah Coopers—good, nurturing women roles. I did more preparation for that film than I've ever done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Close&quot;/&gt; Close received her fourth Oscar nomination for this role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1988|title=The 60th Academy Awards - 1988|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also won the [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Motion Picture Actress.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She played a scheming aristocrat, the Marquise de Merteuil, in 1988's ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tca&quot; /&gt; Close earned stellar reviews for this performance, and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/dangerous-liaisons-4-1200427610/|title=Review: 'Dangerous Liaisons'|date=1988-01-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she received her first [[BAFTA]] nomination but did not win. Close's final film role of the decade was ''[[Immediate Family (film)|Immediate Family]]'' (1989), a drama about a married couple seeking to adopt a child. Producer Lawrence Kasdan had Close star in the film, as he directed her previously in ''The Big Chill''.

====Established actress (1990–1999)====
In 1990 Close went on to play the role of [[Sunny von Bülow]] opposite [[Jeremy Irons]] in ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' to critical acclaim. The film drew some controversy since it dealt with the [[Claus von Bülow]] murder trial, while the real Sunny von Bülow was still in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]]. Sunny's children publicly criticized the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/1990/11/02/objections-reversal-fortune|title=Objections to ''Reversal of Fortune''|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113513,00.html|title=Reversal of Fortune? For Claus, Yes, but for Sunny, Never, as a New Film Puts the Von Bülows on Trial Again : People.com|website=www.people.com|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Close played Gertrude in [[Franco Zeffirelli|Franco Zeffirelli's]] film adaption of [[Hamlet (1990 film)|''Hamlet'']]. It was the first [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] role that Close had ever attempted on screen (she appeared in 1975 in a stage production of ''King Lear'' in Milwaukee). Close would later go on to join the cast of ''[[The House of the Spirits (film)|The House of the Spirits]]'', reuniting her with Jeremy Irons. She also had a cameo appearance in [[Steven Spielberg|Steven Spielberg's]] [[Hook (film)|''Hook'']] (1991) as a pirate. In 1992, Close starred in ''[[Meeting Venus]]'' for which she received critical acclaim and won Best Actress ([[Ciak d'oro|Golden Ciak]]) at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. In the same year, Close became a trustee emeritus of [[Sundance Film Festival|The Sundance Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundance.org/blogs/news/sundance-institute-adds-five-new-trustees-2015|title=Sundance Institute Adds Five New Trustees|website=www.sundance.org|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close appeared in the newsroom comedy-drama ''[[The Paper (film)|The Paper]]'' (1994), directed by her good friend [[Ron Howard]]. She would go on to appear in the alien invasion satire ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996) as The First Lady and as the sinister [[Cruella de Vil]] in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] hit ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians.]]'' Close's portrayal of Cruella de Vil was universally praised and earned her a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress in a comedy. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $320.6 million in theaters against a $75 million budget. The following year, Close appeared in another box office hit with ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), playing the trustworthy [[vice president]] to [[Harrison Ford]]'s president. Ford stated in an interview that the role of the vice president was already written for a woman and that he personally chose Close for the role after meeting her at a birthday party for then-president [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11745123|title=Some little-known facts about the Harrison Ford film Air Force One|date=2016-11-09|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-12-13|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close would later star in the war film [[Paradise Road (1997 film)|''Paradise Road'']] (1997) as a choir conductor of the women imprisoned by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] in [[World War II]]. In 1999, Close provided the voice of Kala in Disney's animated film [[Tarzan (1999 film)|''Tarzan'']]. She later went on to receive great reviews for her comedic role as Camille Dixon in ''[[Cookie's Fortune]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cookies-fortune-1999|title=Cookie's Fortune Movie Review (1999) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independent films and break (2000–2010)====
Close began to appear in television movies rather than doing theatrical films in the early 2000s. She returned as Cruella de Vil in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' (2000). Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office. Close later filmed ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' which premiered in 2001, a movie about four suburban families dealing with maladies. This was [[Kristen Stewart|Kristen Stewart's]] first film role, and Close and Stewart would later reunite in the 2015 film ''[[Anesthesia (2015 film)|Anesthesia]]''. Close starred in ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'' in the same year, this would be one of many future collaborations with director [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo Garcia]]. In 2004, she played Claire Wellington, an uptight socialite in the comedy ''[[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|The Stepford Wives]]'' opposite [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. She provided the voice of the Blue Fairy in the English version of ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (2002) and Granny in the animated film ''[[Hoodwinked!|Hoodwinked]]'' (2005). Close continued to do smaller films like ''[[Le Divorce]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Chumscrubber]]'' (2005). In 2005, she reunited with director Rodrigo Garcia to do ''[[Nine Lives (2005 film)|Nine Lives]]''; he would later direct Close in the film ''[[Albert Nobbs]]'' (2011). In the same year, she starred in the film ''[[Heights (film)|Heights]]'' (2005), an independent drama centered on the lives of five [[New York City|New Yorkers]]. Close's performance was lauded by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/heights|title=Heights {{!}} Film Review {{!}} Slant Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/heights-2005|title=Heights Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2005) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she acted alongside her friend and previous co-star [[Meryl Streep]] in the ensemble drama [[Evening (film)|''Evening'']]. This would be Close's final theatrical film role of the decade, since she began to star in her own television series, ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' (2007). Close was asked about her contributions to independent films, to which she responded &quot;I love the casts that gather around a good piece of writing certainly not for the money but because it is good and challenging. Sometimes I've taken a role for one scene that I thought was phenomenal. Also my presence can help them get money, so it's I think a way for me to give back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/glenn-close-whiplash-director-revel-709773|title=Glenn Close, 'Whiplash' Director Revel in Rewards of Risky Indie Film Biz at Sundance Benefit|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to film and further acclaim (2011–present)====
[[File:Glennclosetiff.jpg|thumb|Close at the 2017 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]|alt=|279x279px]]
In December 2010, Close began filming ''[[Albert Nobbs]]'' in [[Dublin]]. She had previously won an [[Obie Award|Obie]] in 1982 for her role in the play on stage. She had been working on the project, in which she appeared alongside ''101 Dalmatians'' co-star Mark Williams, for almost twenty years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the script and produced the film.&lt;ref&gt;BWW Staff.

And I said, 'No I won't.' Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to 'die off'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kiri-westby/albert-nobbs_b_1292338.html|title=Glenn Close's 'Albert Nobbs' Brings Transgender Identity To The Red Carpet|last1=Changemaker|first1=Kiri Westby|last2=Rulebreaker|date=2012-02-23|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-08-20|last3=Storyteller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Close played the title role of ''Albert Nobbs'', a woman living as a man in 19th century Ireland after being [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] as a young girl. While the film overall received mixed reviews, Close's performance received critical acclaim, as it was noted for being the most subtle and introverted of her career to that point and a departure from her previous roles.

When asked during the film's awards campaign about the fact of not having an Oscar, Close said: &quot;I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. Because if you just do the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you're one of five [nominees]. How could you possibly think of yourself as a loser?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/oscar-nominees-mingle-share-excitement-138820984/165131.html|title=Oscar Nominees Mingle, Share Excitement|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her television series ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' ended, Close returned to film in 2014, in which she played [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Rael]] in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GotG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/05/glenn-close-is-head-cop-in-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy/ |title=Glenn Close Is Head Cop In Marvel's 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' |last=Fleming, Jr. |first=Mike |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607071152/http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/glenn-close-is-head-cop-in-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy/ |archive-date=June 7, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/2014/1/3/21707/read_the_official_synopsis_for_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy |title=Read the Official Synopsis For Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy |publisher=Marvel |date=January 3, 2014 |accessdate=February 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221221947/http://marvel.com/news/movies/2014/1/3/21707/read_the_official_synopsis_for_marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy |archive-date=February 21, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in the independent movies ''[[5 to 7]]'' (2014) and ''[[Low Down]]'' (2014).

In 2005, Close joined the FX crime series ''[[The Shield]],'' in which she played Monica Rawling, a no-nonsense precinct captain, this became her first TV role in a series.

====''Damages'' and critical acclaim (2007–present)====
Shortly after her stint on ''The Shield'', Close was approached by [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] executives who pitched a television series for her to star in.

Her portrayal of this character was met with rave reviews and a plethora of [[List of awards and nominations received by Damages|award nominations]], in addition she went on to win two consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce Eng&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Joyce Eng | title=Kristin Chenoweth, Jon Cryer Win First Emmys | url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Kristin-Chenoweth-Jon-1009931.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=20 September 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close's win also made her the first Best Actress winner in a drama series at the Emmy's for a cable show.

Close is regarded as an extraordinarily versatile actress with an immersive acting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/11/glenn-close-a-delicate-balance-broadway|title=Glenn Close Is Keeping A Delicate Balance on Broadway|last=Heilpern|first=John|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Close guest-starred on [[Inside the Actors Studio]] to discuss her film career. [[James Lipton]] described her as an actor who &quot;can find an outstanding number of layers in a role or a single moment; she is a supple actor who performs subtle feats.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tca&quot; /&gt; Close is also professionally trained by acting coach [[Harold Guskin]], who also mentored [[Kevin Kline]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[James Gandolfini]]. Working with Guskin, Close learned several important lessons, which she said she's applied to her career as well as her life. One such lesson, she claims, was to &quot;read the lines off the page&quot; and remembering to breathe. Close states, &quot;You have to maintain a certain openness, and if you don't maintain that, you lose something vital as an actor. It's how we're wired, and it's not a bad thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/awards-watch-emmy-roundtable-drama-24033|title=Awards Watch: Emmy Roundtable -- Drama Actresses|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close says that she went to every rehearsal in order to master her acting skills .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndsmcobserver.com/2010/03/actress-glenn-close-speaks-at-saint-marys/|title=Actress Glenn Close speaks at Saint Mary's // The Observer|date=2010-03-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/howtostopacting/haroldguskin|title=How to Stop Acting {{!}} Harold Guskin {{!}} Macmillan|last=Macmillan|website=Macmillan|access-date=2016-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113023920/http://us.macmillan.com/howtostopacting/HaroldGuskin|archive-date=January 13, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[method acting]], Close claims that while she found it an interesting technique, it was not her preferred style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2013/a-conversation-with-glenn-close-741.php|title=William &amp; Mary - A conversation with Glenn Close '74|website=www.wm.edu|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Close does extensive research and preparation for her roles, she also relies less on the technicality of a performance saying, &quot;Good acting I think is like being a magician, in that you make people believe; because it's only when they believe that they are moved. And I want people to get emotionally involved. I think technique is important but it isn't everything. You can have a great technical actor who'll leave people cold. That's not my idea of great acting. As audience, I don't want to be aware of acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?Article_ID=251&amp;p=y|title=Urban Cinefile CLOSE, GLENN: Paradise Road|website=www.urbancinefile.com.au|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime collaborator and playwright [[Christopher Hampton]] describes Close an actress who can very easily convey &quot;a sense of strength and intelligence.&quot; Hampton worked on ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' and the stage production of ''[[Dangerous Liaisons|Dangerous Liaisions]]'', later casting Close in the movie version of the latter production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/06/glenn-close-profile-critical-acclaim-strength-sunset-boulevard|title=Glenn Close: critical acclaim built on strength of character|last=Rose|first=Steve|date=2015-11-06|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Glenn is often described as having a glacial or distant quality about her, but in person she's the absolute opposite: warm and intimate,&quot; says the actor [[Iain Glen]], who co-starred with her in the 2002 stage production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. &quot;She was able to bring strength to the role, she was able to completely access that vulnerability.

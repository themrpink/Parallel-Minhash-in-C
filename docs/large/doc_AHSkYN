The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by [[George Mallory]] and [[Guy Bullock]] on the initial [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition]]. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of {{convert|7005|m|ft|0}}. From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared for the great task of climbing any further and descended.

The British returned for a [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition|1922 expedition]]. [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—{{convert|290|m|ft|0}} per hour, and reached an altitude of {{convert|8320|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and [[Edward Felix Norton|Col. Felix Norton]] made a second unsuccessful attempt. Mallory was faulted{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} for leading a group down from the North Col which got caught in an avalanche. Mallory was pulled down too but survived. Seven native porters were killed.

The [[1924 British Mount Everest Expedition|next expedition was in 1924]]. The initial attempt by Mallory and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp&amp;nbsp;VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the [[Great Couloir]]. Norton managed to reach {{convert|8550|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though he ascended only {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.

On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the [[Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition]] found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp&amp;nbsp;VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29&amp;nbsp;years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953.

In 1933, [[Lucy, Lady Houston|Lady Houston]], a British [[millionaire]]ss, funded the [[Houston–Mount Everest flight expedition|Houston Everest Flight of 1933]], which saw a formation of two [[Westland Wallace|aeroplanes]] led by the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Marquess of Clydesdale]] fly over the Everest [[Summit (topography)|summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crompton|first=Teresa|title=Adventuress: The Life and Loves of Lucy, Lady Houston|publisher=The History Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flymicro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flymicro.com/everest/index.cfm?page=docs%2FHistory%2FAeroplanes.htm |title=Aeroplane expeditions to Everest|publisher=flymicro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k2news_woe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.k2news.com/wingsover.htm |title=Wings Over Everest 2003|publisher=Everestnews.com|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flying Over World's Highest Peak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|issue=5|journal=[[Popular Science]]|volume=122|date=May 1933|page=20|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early expeditions—such as [[Charles Granville Bruce|Charles Bruce]]'s in the 1920s and [[Hugh Ruttledge]]'s two unsuccessful attempts in [[1933 British Mount Everest expedition|1933]] and [[1936 British Mount Everest expedition|1936]]—tried to ascend the mountain from [[Tibet]], via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, [[Bill Tilman]] and a small party which included [[Charles Snead Houston|Charles Houston]], Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an [[Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal#1950 Houston–Tilman exploration of Solu Khumbu|exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal]] along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.&lt;ref name=evhist_timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/time3.htm |title=Everest History Time Line |website=Everest History |year=2003 |accessdate=17 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526185812/http://www.everesthistory.com/time3.htm |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition]], led by [[Edouard Wyss-Dunant]], was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of {{convert|7986|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Raymond Lambert]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] [[Tenzing Norgay]] were able to reach an elevation of about {{convert|8595|m|ft|abbr=on}} on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagingeverest.rgs.org/Concepts/Virtual_Everest/-116.html |title=Tenzing Norgay GM |website=Imagining Everest |publisher=The Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=21 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414143647/http://imagingeverest.rgs.org/Concepts/Virtual_Everest/-116.html |archivedate=14 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reference says that no attempt at an ascent of Everest was ever under consideration in this case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpt from: Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, 1939 to 1970|location=Zurich|date=1972|url=http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308015050/http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html|archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
although [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]] (who met the team in Zurich on their return) wrote that when the Swiss Expedition &quot;just failed&quot; in the spring they decided to make another post-monsoon (summit ascent) attempt in the autumn; although as it was only decided in June the second party arrived too late, when winter winds were buffeting the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hunt |first= John |title= The Ascent of Everest |year= 1953 |publisher= Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location= London |pages= 51, 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953===

[[File:Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.jpg|thumb|[[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]]]]

In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]], returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, [[Tom Bourdillon]] and [[Charles Evans (mountaineer)|Charles Evans]], came within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]], a Nepali [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] climber. They reached the summit at 11:30 local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullman&quot; /&gt; They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.

News of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II's]] [[coronation]], 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be [[Knighthood|knighted]] in the [[Order of the British Empire]] for the ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39886/page/3273 |title=The London Gazette |date=6 June 1953 |access-date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the [[George Medal]] by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a [[life peer]] in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the [[Order of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.honours.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz |title= The Order of New Zealand(Instituted 1987) |website= Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |access-date= 27 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160106081352/http://www.honours.govt.nz/honours/lists/onz |archivedate= 6 January 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillary and Tenzing have also been recognised in Nepal.

===1970s===
{{see also|1970 Mount Everest disaster}}

In 1970 Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centerpiece was a large &quot;siege&quot;-style expedition led by [[Saburo Matsukata]], working on finding a new route up the southwest face.{{sfnp|Unsworth|2000|p=594}} Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=&quot;japtimes&quot;/&gt; Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.&lt;ref name=japtimes/&gt; However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, [[Yuichiro Miura]] became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col (he descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries). Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.&lt;ref name=japtimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.himalayanclub.org/hj/31/8/the-japanese-mount-everest-expedition-1969-1970/|title=The Japanese Mount Everest Expedition, 1969–1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/everestsummits/summits70.htm |title=Everest Summits in the 1970s |website=EverestHistory.com |access-date=25 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014112932/http://www.everesthistory.com/everestsummits/summits70.htm |archivedate=14 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9303665/japan-yuichiro-miura-80-oldest-reach-top-mount-everest |title=Yuichiro Miura, 80, scales Everest |agency=Associated Press |date=23 May 2013 |website=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Junko Tabei]], a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=japtimes/&gt;{{clear}}

In 1978, [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Peter Habeler]] made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.

===1979/1980: Winter Himalaism===
[[File:Mount Everest winter 1980 cert.jpg|thumb|Confirmation of the summit obtained by the Nepalese Ministry of Tourism]]
The Polish climber [[Andrzej Zawada]] headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on [[Khumbu Glacier]] in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 meters above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when [[Leszek Cichy]], Walenty Fiut and [[Krzysztof Wielicki]] set up camp IV on [[South Col]] (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50&amp;nbsp;am on 17 February. At 2:40&amp;nbsp;pm [[Andrzej Zawada]] at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio{{Snd}} &quot;We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time.

===Lho La tragedy, 1989===
In May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May in the avalanche from the wall [[Khumbutse]] on the [[Lho La]] Pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, [[Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich]] and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which [[Artur Hajzer]] and New Zealanders [[Gary Ball]] and [[Rob Hall]] took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia [[Reinhold Messner]], [[Elizabeth Hawley]], [[Carlos Carsolio]] and the US consul.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tygodnikpowszechny.pl/zgineli-bo-byli-najlepsi-134200 Zginęli bo byli najlepsi]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 disaster===
{{main|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}
On 10 and 11 May 1996 eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche]]. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.

Journalist [[Jon Krakauer]], on assignment from ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', which related his experience. [[Anatoli Boukreev]], a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer's book, co-authored a rebuttal book called ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]].'' The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community.&lt;!-- sentence regarding Krakauer as a personna non grata removed until someone cites a source --&gt;

In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L. Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the [[University of Toronto]], told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title = The day the sky fell on Everest| journal = New Scientist| issue = 2449| page = 15| date = 29 May 2004| url = http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703183045/http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/mg18224492.200-the-day-the-sky-fell-on-everest.html| archivedate = 3 July 2007| accessdate = 11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BioEd Online&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=986| title=High winds suck oxygen from Everest.

He calculates that this typically reduces the partial pressure of oxygen in the air by about 6%, which translates to a 14% reduction in oxygen uptake for the climbers. Air at that altitude already contains only one third as much oxygen as sea-level air.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the survivors was [[Beck Weathers]], an American client of New Zealand-based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;badassoftheweek.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Beck Weathers|url=http://www.badassoftheweek.com/weathers.html|website=Badass of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weathers|first1=Beck|title=My Journey Home From Everest|journal=D Magazine|date=May 2000|url=http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2000/may/my-journey-home-from-everest/|accessdate=31 January 2017|quote=They left me alone in [[Scott Fischer]]'s tent that night, expecting me to die. On a couple of occasions, I heard the others referring to 'a dead guy' in the tent. Who could that be? I wondered as I slipped in and out of wakefulness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMag&quot;/&gt; A helicopter rescue was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2. Eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepalese Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;badassoftheweek.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DMag&quot;/&gt;

The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer [[Matt Dickinson]] in his book ''The Other Side of Everest''. 16-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, ''Within Reach: My Everest Story''.

The 2015 feature film ''[[Everest (2015 film)|Everest]]'', directed by [[Baltasar Kormákur]], is based on the events of this guiding disaster.&lt;ref name=Baltasar&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopewell|first=John|title='2 Guns' Helmer Kormakur Set to Climb 'Everest'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/2-guns-kormakur-set-to-climb-everest-1200574821/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/25/travel/everest-2012-anniversary/|title=Striving for Everest: World's highest battle|author=Ashley Strickland, CNN|date=25 May 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season was also remembered for the rescue of [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.

====David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006====
There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]], who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1909966/over-top|title=Over the Top|website=Outside Online|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a &quot;loose group&quot;, offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtontimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/may/22/20060522-110420-9433r/|title=Everest climber left to die alone|website=The Washington Times|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.&lt;ref name=top/&gt;

Double-amputee climber [[Mark Inglis]] said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang {{convert|450|m|ft}} below the summit, without attempting a rescue.&lt;ref name=abcnews052006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1645603.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823184345/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1645603.htm|archivedate=23 August 2006|title=Everest climber defends leaving dying Briton|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=23 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed &quot;[[Green Boots]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Breed |first1=Allen G. |last2=Gurubacharya |first2=Binaj | url = http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=305837&amp;rel_no=1 | title = Part II: Near top of Everest, he waves off fellow climbers: 'I just want to sleep' | date = 18 July 2006 | work = Oh My News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman named [[Burçak Özoğlu Poçan|Burçak Poçan]]). There has also been some discussion about [[Himex]] in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was &quot;...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite{{Snd}} he later had five fingertips amputated.&quot; When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for US$7,490, believed to be the whole financial cost.&lt;ref name=thefever&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3662508/Summit-fever.html|title=Summit fever|author=Ed Douglas|date=13 January 2007|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to US$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/23/the-economics-of-everest/|title=How Much it Costs to Climb Mount Everest|journal=Time|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summitted Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.&lt;ref name=change/&gt; On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the North Side route.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;

Some climbers who left him said that the rescue efforts would have been useless and only have caused more deaths.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Beck Weathers]] of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600309_pf.html|title=Did Everest Climber Sharp Have to Die?|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tribune'' of India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as &quot;the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061210/spectrum/main6.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune{{Snd}} Spectrum|website=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=7925|title=Everest K2 News ExplorersWeb{{Snd}} Un-named Everest Sherpa gets a name{{Snd}} and fatality details|website=explorersweb.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&quot;You are never on your own. There are climbers everywhere.&quot;|David Sharp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/outdoors/2003127747_webeverest16.html|title=The Seattle Times: Outdoors: David Sharp's vow on Everest: &quot;If I don't do it this time, I'm not coming back.&quot;|website=seattletimes.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much of this controversy was captured by the ''[[Discovery Channel]]'' while filming the television program ''[[Everest: Beyond the Limit]]''. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber Lebanese adventurer [[Maxim Chaya]] is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager ([[Russell Brice]]) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from [[frostbite]], preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.

David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to &quot;Green Boots&quot;; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;change&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

====Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006====
As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] was found alive after being left for dead the day before.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; He was found by a party of four climbers ([[Dan Mazur]], Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/1519597/Climber-declared-dead-on-Everest-is-brought-down-alive.html|title=Climber declared dead on Everest is brought down alive|last=Sydney|first=By Nick Squires in|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/world/asia/lincoln-hall-australian-mountaineer-dies-at-56.html|title=Lincoln Hall, Australian Mountaineer, Dies at 56|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=24 March 2012|accessdate=23 October 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family.

{{quote|I imagine you are surprised to see me here.|Lincoln Hall&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;}}
Lincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/world/asia/lincoln-hall-australian-mountaineer-dies-at-56.html|title=Lincoln Hall, Australian Mountaineer, Dies at 56|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=24 March 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
Heroic rescue actions have been recorded since Hall, including on 21 May 2007, when Canadian climber [[Meagan McGrath]] initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of [[Nepal]]i Usha Bista. Recognising her heroic rescue, Major Meagan McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesiredmundhillaryfoundation.ca/ |title=Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada |publisher=Thesiredmundhillaryfoundation.ca |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascent statistics up to 2010 season===
[[File:EverestAscents.svg|thumb|left|Ascents of Mount Everest by year through 2010]]
[[File:Sunrise over Everest.jpg|thumb|The sun rising on Everest in 2011]]
By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77% of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 [[Sherpa people|sherpas]].&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers{{Snd}} more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5%) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt; Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for [[2008 Summer Olympics summit of Mt. Everest|carrying the Olympic torch]] for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/world/asia/15nepal.html|title=Nepal Puts Everest Off Limits During China's Olympic Torch Relay in May | work=The New York Times | first=Somini|last=Sengupta|date=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/4806464/China-closes-Tibetan-side-of-Everest-to-climbers-ahead-of-anniversary-of-Dalai-Lamas-exile.html|title=China closes Tibetan side of Everest to climbers ahead of anniversary of Dalai Lama's exile | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm|last=Moore|date=25 February 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.&lt;ref name=8000ers /&gt;

===2010s===
{{main|Mount Everest in 2012|Mount Everest in 2013}}
[[File:Andreas Breitfuss Mt Everest Summit.jpg|thumb|Selfie on the summit, 2012]]
The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back to back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits{{Snd}} 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0x&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2018/05/24/everest-2018-season-summary-record-weather-record-summits/|title=Everest 2018: Season Summary – Record Weather, Record Summits|date=25 May 2018|website=The Blog on alanarnette.com|language=en-US|access-date=22 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.&lt;ref name=&quot;time5604758&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5604758/mount-everest-deaths/|title=Greed, Weather and Inexperience: See How Mount Everest's Deadly Season Compares to Past Years|last=Time|first=Emily Barone and Lon Tweeten|website=Time|language=en|access-date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mt Everest.jpg|thumb|Mount Everest, 2014]]

On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below the Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about {{convert|5900|m}}.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27075638 |title= Everest avalanche kills at least 12 Sherpa guides |work= BBC News |date= 18 April 2014 |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepalese guides) and nine more were injured.&lt;ref name=NYr&gt;{{cite news |last=Krakauer |first= Jon |title= Death and Anger on Everest |url= https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/04/everest-sherpas-death-and-anger.html |accessdate= 22 April 2014 |work= [[The New Yorker]] |date=21 April 2014 |quote=Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb.

2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|earthquake measuring 7.8]] [[Moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] triggered an avalanche that hit [[Everest Base Camp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Everest Climbers Are Killed as Nepal Quake Sets Off Avalanche |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/asia/everest-climbers-killed-as-nepal-quake-sets-off-avalanche.html |author= Gardiner Harris |work=New York Times |date= 25 April 2015 |accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2015/05/06/everest-2015-season-summary-summits-dont-matter-2/ |title= Everest 2015: Season Summary – Summits Don't Matter |website= alanarnette.com |format=Blog |accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/Avalanche-triggered-by-quake-kills-18-on-Mount-Everest/articleshow/47055195.cms |website=The Times of India|title=Avalanche triggered by quake kills 18 on Mount Everest| access-date= 26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avalanche began on [[Pumori]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150425-everest-earthquake-basecamp-nepal-himalaya-climbing-sherpa/ |title= Everest Base Camp a 'War Zone' After Earthquake Triggers Avalanches |magazine= National Geographic |accessdate= 26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved through the [[Khumbu Icefall]] on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the [[Everest Base Camp#South Base Camp in Nepal|South Base Camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2015/04/25/cfa47ee6-eb95-11e4-9a6a-c1ab95a0600b_story.html?hpid=z2 |title= 10 confirmed dead in Mount Everest avalanche, but toll expected to rise |date= 25 April 2015 |website= The Washington Post |accessdate= 25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://snowbrains.com/everest-will-not-be-climbed-for-first-time-since-1974/ |title= Mt.

The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;supplies&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/26/8-dead-as-quake-triggered-avalanche-sweeps-everest-in-nepal/|work=Fox News |title= Trapped at 20,000 feet: Hundreds of Everest climbers await choppers as supplies run low}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;supplies&quot;/&gt; Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;supplies&quot;/&gt; The Everest tragedy was small compared the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead&lt;ref name=drrportal&gt;{{cite web |url= http://drrportal.gov.np/ |website= Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, drrportal.gov.np |title= Incident Report of Earthquake 2015 |accessdate= 28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;D2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.timesofindia.com/world/south-asia/Nepal-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-8413/articleshow/47187088.cms |title= Nepal earthquake death toll rises to 8,413 |date= 7 May 2015 |website= The Times of India |accessdate= 9 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510085521/http://m.timesofindia.com/world/south-asia/Nepal-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-8413/articleshow/47187088.cms |archivedate= 10 May 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 22,000 injured.&lt;ref name=drrportal/&gt; In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/tibet-quake-toll-rises-to-25-117-injured-115042800106_1.html |title= Nepal quake: Death toll rises to 25 in Tibet; 117 injured |agency= Press Trust of India |date=28 April 2015 |work= Business Standard |accessdate= 17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.outsideonline.com/1974091/breaking-north-side-everest-closing |title= North Side of Everest Closing |website= Outside |accessdate= 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.smh.com.au/world/nepal-earthquake-hopes-fade-for-survivors-180-rescued-on-mount-everest-20150427-1mungw.html |title= Nepal earthquake: Hopes fade for survivors; 180 rescued on Mount Everest |website= The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate= 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of capitalism ===
Kropotkin pointed out what he considered to be the fallacies of the [[Economics#Criticisms|economic systems]] of [[feudalism]] and [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism]].  He believed they create poverty and [[artificial scarcity]], and promote [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]. Instead, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid, [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual support]], and [[cooperation|voluntary cooperation]]. He argued that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mutualaidafacto00knigoog|title=Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|publisher=McClure, Philips &amp; Company|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mutualaidafacto00knigoog/page/n247 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin disagreed with the Marxist critique of capitalism, including the [[labour theory of value]], believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the values of commodities. Instead, his attack on the institution of wage labour was based more on the power employers exerted over employees than the extraction of [[surplus value]] from their labour. Kropotkin claimed this power was made possible by the state's protection of private ownership of productive resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PoqAJrrYtAC&amp;q=kropotkin+labor+theory&amp;pg=PT18|title=Radical Economics and Labour.

=== Cooperation and competition ===
In 1902, Kropotkin published his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which gave an alternative view of animal and human survival. At the time, some &quot;[[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]]&quot; such as [[Francis Galton]] proffered a theory of interpersonal competition and natural hierarchy. Instead, Kropotkin argued that &quot;it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (1 July 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212113034/http://amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ |date=12 December 2010 }}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the last chapter, he wrote:
{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species [...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits [...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development [...] are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not consider them the driving force of history.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA262 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262}} He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the State or [[organized religion|the Church]], which he saw as stifling human creativity and impeding human instinctual drive towards cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander|title=Darwin in Russian Thought|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=9780520062832|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh1NvIxiaIIC&amp;pg=PA349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin's observations of cooperative tendencies in [[indigenous people]]s (pre-feudal, feudal, and those remaining in modern societies) led him to conclude that not all human societies were based on competition as were those of industrialized Europe, and that many societies exhibited cooperation among individuals and groups as the norm. He also concluded that most pre-industrial and pre-authoritarian societies (where he claimed that [[leadership]], central government, and class did not exist) actively defend against the accumulation of private property by equally distributing within the community a person's possessions when they died, or by not allowing a gift to be sold, bartered or used to create wealth, in the form of a [[gift economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, David.

=== Mutual aid ===
[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', influential work by Kropotkin which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
In his 1892 book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', Kropotkin proposed a system of economics based on mutual exchanges made in a system of voluntary cooperation. He believed that in a society that is socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services it needs, there would be no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange, to prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conquestbread00kropgoog|title=The Conquest of Bread|publisher=Putnam|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|year=1892|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conquestbread00kropgoog/page/n219 201]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]] economic model was just a wage system by a different name&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin wrote: &quot;After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap.&quot; (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&amp;pg=PA211}})&lt;/ref&gt; and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labour]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=The Russian Anarchists|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29|title-link=The Russian Anarchists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], &quot;[w]ith ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of [[communal anarchism]], following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;

=== Self-sufficiency ===
Kropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends, he advocated [[irrigation]] and [[greenhouse]]s to boost local food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFFOCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Kropotkin+on+self-sufficiency&amp;pg=PA114|title=Kropotkin, Read, and the Intellectual History of British Anarchism: Between Reason and Romanticism|last=Adams|first=Matthew S.|date=4 June 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137392626|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Thalidomide''', sold under the brand name '''Thalomid''' among others, is a medication used to treat a number of cancers including [[multiple myeloma]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and a number of skin conditions including complications of [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2019&gt;{{cite web |title=Thalidomide Monograph for Professionals |url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/thalidomide.html |website=Drugs.com |access-date=14 November 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been used in a number of [[HIV]] associated conditions, such use is associated with increased levels of the virus.&lt;ref name=AHFS2019/&gt; It is administered orally.&lt;ref name=AHFS2019/&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
Common side effects include sleepiness, rash, and [[dizziness]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2019/&gt; Severe side effects include [[tumor lysis syndrome]], [[blood clots]], and [[peripheral neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=BNF76&gt;{{cite book|title=British national formulary : BNF 76|date=2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|isbn=9780857113382|pages=936|edition=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use in [[pregnancy]] may harm the baby, including resulting in [[phocomelia|malformation of the limbs]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2019/&gt; In males who are taking the medication, contraception is essential if the partner could become pregnant.&lt;ref name=BNF76/&gt; It is an [[immunotherapy|immunomodulatory medication]] and works by a number of mechanisms including stimulating [[T cells]] and decreasing [[TNF-α]] production.&lt;ref name=AHFS2019/&gt;

==Medical uses==
[[File:Pack of Thalidomide tablets.jpg|thumb|Pack of thalidomide capsules]]

Thalidomide is used as a first-line treatment in [[multiple myeloma]] in combination with [[dexamethasone]] or with [[melphalan]] and [[prednisone]], to treat acute episodes of [[erythema nodosum leprosum]], and for maintenance therapy.&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg Hard Capsules - Summary of Product Characteristics |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21005|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium |access-date=26 June 2017 |date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabel2017&gt;{{cite web |title=US Thalomid label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/020785s061lbl.pdf |publisher=FDA |date=January 2017 |access-date=26 June 2017}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&amp;ApplNo=020785 FDA index page for NDA 020785]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacterium that causes [[tuberculosis]] (TB) is related to [[leprosy]]. Thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where [[Tuberculosis management|standard TB drugs]] and [[corticosteroid]]s are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buonsenso D, Serranti D, Valentini P | title = Management of central nervous system tuberculosis in children: light and shade | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 845–53 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21222370 | url = http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/827.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223324/http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/827.pdf | archive-date = 2016-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Toorn R, Solomons R | title = Update on the diagnosis and management of tuberculous meningitis in children | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Neurology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–8 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24655399 | doi = 10.1016/j.spen.2014.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a second-line treatment to manage [[graft versus host disease]] and [[aphthous stomatitis]] in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children including [[actinic prurigo]] and [[epidermolysis bullosa]]; the evidence for these uses is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang CS, Kim C, Antaya RJ | title = Review of thalidomide use in the pediatric population | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 703–11 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25617013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft-versus-host-disease in adults, based on lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff D, Gerbitz A, Ayuk F, Kiani A, Hildebrandt GC, Vogelsang GB, Elad S, Lawitschka A, Socie G, Pavletic SZ, Holler E, Greinix H | display-authors = 6 | title = Consensus conference on clinical practice in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): first-line and topical treatment of chronic GVHD | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 1611–28 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20601036 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.015 | url = http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(10)00275-2/fulltext | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff D, Schleuning M, von Harsdorf S, Bacher U, Gerbitz A, Stadler M, Ayuk F, Kiani A, Schwerdtfeger R, Vogelsang GB, Kobbe G, Gramatzki M, Lawitschka A, Mohty M, Pavletic SZ, Greinix H, Holler E | display-authors = 6 | title = Consensus Conference on Clinical Practice in Chronic GVHD: Second-Line Treatment of Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20685255 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.011 | url = http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(10)00223-5/fulltext | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Thalidomide should not be used by women who are breastfeeding or pregnant, trying or able to conceive a child, or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies. The prescribing doctor is required to ensure that [[contraception]] is being used, and regular pregnancy tests are taken. Those allergic to thalidomide should not take it. It should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis B.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of thalidomide side effects}}
Thalidomide [[Teratogen|causes birth defects]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=toxmech2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SW | title = Chiral toxicology: it's the same thing...only different | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–30 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19414517 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfp097 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[FDA|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable [[risk evaluation and mitigation strategy]] that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to both men and women, as the drug can be transmitted in [[semen]].&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive [[Thrombosis|blood clots]]. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[lymphopenia]], and risks that blood will not clot via [[thrombocytopenia]]. There is also a risk of [[anemia]] via lack of red blood cells.  The drug can also damage nerves, causing [[peripheral neuropathy]] that may be irreversible.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[pulmonary hypertension]], and changes in heart rhythm including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[bradycardia]], and [[atrioventricular block]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

It can cause [[liver damage]] and severe skin reactions like [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk when driving and operating other machinery. As it kills cancer cells, it can cause [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. Thalidomide can [[Amenorrhea|prevent menstruation]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Other than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include [[tremor]], dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and [[peripheral edema]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Common adverse effects (reported by 1–10% of people) include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

=== Interactions ===
There are no expected [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on [[P-glycoprotein]] and the [[cytochrome P450]] family.  It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action and bradycardic agents, like beta-blockers, due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.&lt;ref name = TGA&gt;{{cite web|title=THALOMID® CAPSULES|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Celgene Pty Limited|date=21 June 2013|access-date=17 January 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&amp;id=CP-2010-PI-03581-3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of [[venous thromboembolism]]s with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with [[oral contraceptives]] or other cytotoxic agents (including [[doxorubicin]] and [[melphalan]]) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with various contraceptives, and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are taking thalidomide.&lt;ref name = TGA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

===Overdose===
As of 2013, eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4&amp;nbsp;grams, none of them fatal.&lt;ref name = TGA/&gt; No specific antidote for overdose exists and treatment is purely [[Supportive treatment|supportive]].&lt;ref name = TGA/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is not known, although efforts to identify thalidomide's [[Teratology|teratogenic]] action generated 2,000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Stephens2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ | title = Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1489–99 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10799645 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the main theories were inhibition of the process of [[angiogenesis]], its inhibition of [[cereblon]], a [[ubiquitin ligase]], and its ability to generate [[reactive oxygen species]] which in turn kills cells.&lt;ref name=Vargesson2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargesson N | title = Thalidomide-induced teratogenesis: history and mechanisms | journal = Birth Defects Research.

Thalidomide also binds to and acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) and hence is a [[nonsteroidal antiandrogen]] (NSAA) of some capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LiuSu2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Su L, Geng J, Liu J, Zhao G | title = Developments in nonsteroidal antiandrogens targeting the androgen receptor | journal = ChemMedChem | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 1651–61 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20853390 | doi = 10.1002/cmdc.201000259 | s2cid = 23228778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance, it can produce [[gynecomastia]] and [[sexual dysfunction]] as side effects in men.&lt;ref name=&quot;NuttallWarrier2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nuttall FQ, Warrier RS, Gannon MC | title = Gynecomastia and drugs: a critical evaluation of the literature | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 569–78 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25827472 | pmc = 4412434 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-015-1835-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thalidomide is provided as a [[racemic mixture]] of two [[enantiomer]]s; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

Thalidomide is [[Racemic mixture|racemic]]; while R-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can [[Racemization|racemize]] to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the [[chiral centre]], which is the carbon of the [[glutarimide]] ring bonded to the [[phthalimide]] [[substituent]].

[[Celgene Corporation]] originally synthesized thalidomide using a three-step sequence starting with [[Glutamate|L-glutamic acid]] treatment, but this has since been reformed by the use of [[Glutamine|L-glutamine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;synth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Konnecke|first2=William|last3=Smith|first3=Alison|last4=Khetani|first4=Vikram | name-list-style = vanc | date=19 March 1999|title=A Concise Two-Step Synthesis of Thalidomide | journal=Organic Process Research &amp; Development|volume=3|issue=2|pages=139–140|doi=10.1021/op980201b|last1=Muller|first1=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the image below, N-carbethoxyphthalimide (1) can react with L-glutamine to yield N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine (2). Cyclization of N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine occurs using [[carbonyldiimidazole]], which then yields thalidomide (3).&lt;ref name=&quot;synth&quot; /&gt; Celgene Corporation's original method resulted in a 31% yield of S-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85–93% product that is 99% pure.

==History ==
In 1952, thalidomide was synthesised by [[Novartis#Ciba-Geigy|Chemical Industry Basel]] (CIBA), but was found &quot;to have no effect on animals and was discarded&quot; on that basis.&lt;ref name=themee&gt;{{cite web|author1=Royal Pharmaceutical Society|title=The evolution of pharmacy, Theme E, Level 3 Thalidomide and its aftermath|url=https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf|date=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009110927/https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957 it was acquired by [[Chemie-Grunenthal]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=themee/&gt; The German company had been established as a soap maker after World War II ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Heinrich Mueckter&lt;ref name=ktnyt&gt;{{Cite news|last=Thomas|first=Katie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/health/thalidomide-survivors-usa.html|title=The Unseen Survivors of Thalidomide Want to Be Heard|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research. While preparing [[reagents]] for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product that was recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of [[glutethimide]], a [[sedative]]. The medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug: the result was thalidomide. The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative; it was never tested on pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter | name-list-style = vanc |title=Drug discovery: a history|url=https://archive.org/details/drugdiscoveryhis00snea|url-access=limited|date=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/drugdiscoveryhis00snea/page/n380 367]|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

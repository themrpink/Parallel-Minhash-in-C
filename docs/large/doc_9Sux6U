In 1915, when Einstein successfully explained the apparent anomaly in Mercury's orbit, most astronomers abandoned the search for Vulcan. A few, however, remained convinced that not all the alleged observations of Vulcan were unfounded. Among these was Henry C Courten, of [[Dowling College]], New York. Studying photographic plates of the 1970 eclipse of the Sun, he and his associates detected several objects which appeared to be in orbits close to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', 15 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Even accounting for artifacts, Courten felt that at least seven of the objects were real.

Courten believed that an intra-Mercurial [[planetoids|planetoid]] between {{Convert|130|and|180|km|round=5}} in diameter was orbiting the Sun at a distance of about {{Convert|0.1|AU|abbr=on}}. Other images on his eclipse plates led him to postulate the existence of an asteroid belt between Mercury and the Sun.

None of these claims has ever been substantiated after more than forty years of observation. It has been surmised that some of these objects—and other alleged intra-Mercurial objects—may exist, being nothing more than previously unknown comets or small asteroids. No [[vulcanoid asteroid]]s have been found, and searches have ruled out any such asteroids larger than about {{Convert|6|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Steffl2013/&gt; Neither [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] nor [[STEREO]] has detected a planet inside the orbit of Mercury.&lt;ref name=Steffl2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher/&gt;

The '''Avro Vulcan''' (later '''Hawker Siddeley Vulcan'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/aircraft.cfm?aircraft=Hawker%20Siddeley%20Vulcan%20B2 |title=Hawker Siddeley Vulcan B2 |website=National Cold War Exhibition |accessdate=24 July 2013 |publisher=Trustees of the Royal Air Force Museum }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; from July 1963)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%201528.html &quot;Hawker Siddeley Aviation Ltd.&quot;] ''Flight'', 29 August 1963, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Jet aircraft|jet-powered]] [[Tailless aircraft|tailless]] [[delta wing]] high-altitude [[strategic bomber]], which was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company ([[Avro]]) designed the Vulcan in response to [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification B.35/46]]. Of the three [[V bomber]]s produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several reduced-scale aircraft, designated [[Avro 707]], were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles.

The Vulcan B.1 was first delivered to the RAF in 1956; deliveries of the improved Vulcan B.2 started in 1960. The B.2 featured more powerful engines, a larger wing, an improved electrical system and [[electronic countermeasure]]s (ECM); many were modified to accept the [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] missile. As a part of the [[V bomber|V-force]], the Vulcan was the backbone of the United Kingdom's airborne nuclear deterrent during much of the [[Cold War]]. Although the Vulcan was typically armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, it was capable of conventional bombing missions, a capability which was used in [[Operation Black Buck]] during the [[Falklands War]] between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982.

The Vulcan had no defensive weaponry, initially relying upon high-speed high-altitude flight to evade interception. Electronic countermeasures were employed by the B.1 (designated B.1A) and B.2 from circa 1960. A change to low-level tactics was made in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s nine Vulcans were adapted for maritime radar reconnaissance operations, [[British military aircraft designation systems|redesignated]] as B.2 (MRR). In the final years of service six Vulcans were converted to the K.2 tanker configuration for [[Aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]].

After retirement by the RAF, one example, B.2 [[XH558]], named ''The Spirit of Great Britain'', was restored for use in display flights and air shows, whilst two other B.2s, [[XL426]] and [[XM655]], have been kept in taxiable condition for ground runs and demonstrations at [[London Southend Airport]] and [[Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield]] respectively. B.2 [[Avro Vulcan XH558|XH558]] flew for the last time in October 2015, before also being kept in taxiable condition at [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]].

==Development==

===Origins===
{{further|V bombers}}
[[File:Avro 698 and Avro 710 top-view silhouettes.png|thumb|Silhouettes of an early Avro 698 concept and the cancelled [[#Avro_707_and_Avro_710|Avro 710]]]]
The origin of the Vulcan and the other V bombers is linked with early [[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|British atomic weapon programme]] and [[Deterrence theory#Nuclear power and deterrence|nuclear deterrent]] policies. Britain's atom bomb programme began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946. This anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons, the U.S. [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) having prohibited exporting atomic knowledge, even to countries that had collaborated on the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, pp. 7, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed {{convert|24|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} in length, {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|10000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in weight. The weapon had to be suitable for release from {{convert|20000|to|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1947, the [[Ministry of Supply]] distributed [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification B.35/46]] to UK aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for &quot;a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one {{convert|10000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bomb to a target {{convert|1500|nmi|mi km}} from a base which may be anywhere in the world.&quot; A cruising speed of {{convert|500|kn|mph km/h}} at heights between {{convert|35000|and|50000|ft|m|abbr=on}} was specified. The maximum weight when fully loaded ought not to exceed {{convert|100000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. In addition to a &quot;special&quot; (i.e., atomic) bomb, the aircraft was to be capable of alternatively carrying a conventional bomb load of {{convert|20000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The similar OR.230 required a &quot;long range bomber&quot; with a {{convert|2000|nmi|mi km}} radius of action with a maximum weight of {{convert|200000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} when fully loaded; this requirement was considered too exacting.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of six companies submitted technical brochures to this specification, including Avro.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Required to tender by the end of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by technical director [[Roy Chadwick]] and chief designer [[Stuart Davies (engineer)|Stuart Davies]]; the type designation was ''Avro 698''. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) or the US, they investigated German Second World War [[swept wing]] research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail ([[empennage]]) and the supporting [[fuselage]], it thus became a swept-back [[flying wing]] with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin ([[vertical stabilizer]]) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the [[wingspan]] and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met.&lt;ref name='gunst143'&gt;Gunston, W.T. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1958/1958%20-%200139.html?tracked=1 &quot;The Vulcan Story.&quot;] ''Flight'', 31 January 1958, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Alexander Lippisch]] is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process.&lt;ref name='laming23-24'&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 23, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two [[bomb-bay]]s.&lt;ref name='gunst143'/&gt;

In August 1947, Chadwick was killed in the crash of the [[Avro Tudor|Avro Tudor 2 prototype]] and was succeeded by Sir William Farren.&lt;ref name='laming26'&gt;Laming 2002, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side by side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline.&lt;ref name='gunst143'/&gt; Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged [[Handley-Page Victor|HP.80]] B.35/46 tender in November 1947.&lt;ref name='laming26'/&gt; Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established.&lt;ref name ='but 31'&gt;Buttler 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948.&lt;ref name='laming26'/&gt; As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, [[Short Brothers]] received a contract for the prototype [[Short Sperrin|SA.4]] to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers]] also received authority to proceed with their [[Vickers Valiant|Type 660]] which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avro 707 and Avro 710===
[[File:Avro Vulcan VX770 VX777 FAR 13.09.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype Vulcans (VX777 front, VX770 rear) with four [[Avro 707]]s at the [[Farnborough Air Show]] in September 1953. The large [[delta wing]]s of the Vulcan quickly gave it the affectionate nickname of 'Tin Triangle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=June 1993 |title=Can Vulcan be Saved? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMXnUv3iIjoC&amp;pg=PA38 |magazine=Flying Magazine |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|Hachette Filipacchi]] |access-date= 24 March 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Avro 707}}

As Avro had no flight experience of the delta wing, the company planned two smaller experimental aircraft based on the 698, the one-third scale model 707 for low-speed handling and the one-half scale model 710 for high-speed handling. Two of each were ordered. However, the 710 was cancelled when it was considered too time-consuming to develop; a high-speed variant of the 707 was designed in its place, the 707A.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The first 707, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|VX784]], flew in September 1949 but crashed later that month killing Avro test pilot Flt Lt Eric Esler. The second low-speed 707, VX790, built with the still uncompleted 707A's nose section (containing an [[ejection seat]])&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and redesignated 707B, flew in September 1950 piloted by Avro test pilot Wg Cdr [[Roland Falk|Roland &quot;Roly&quot; Falk]]. The high speed 707A, WD480, followed in July 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackman21&quot;&gt;Blackman 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the delay of the 707 programme, the contribution of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant,&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Blackman 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]]. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackman21&quot;/&gt;

===Vulcan B.1 and B.2{{anchor|Vulcan B.1}}{{anchor|Vulcan B.1A}}{{anchor|Vulcan B.2}}===

====Prototypes and type certification====
More influential than the 707 in the 698's design was wind-tunnel testing performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at [[Farnborough Airport|Farnborough]], which indicated the need for a wing redesign to avoid the onset of [[Compressibility#Aeronautical dynamics|compressibility]] drag which would have restricted the maximum speed.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted gloss white, the 698 prototype VX770 flew for the first time on 30 August 1952 piloted by Roly Falk flying solo. The prototype 698, then fitted with only the first-pilot's ejection seat and a conventional control wheel, was powered by four [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon]] engines of {{convert|6500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust; there were no wing fuel tanks, temporary tankage was carried in the bomb bay.&lt;ref&gt;Blackman 2007, pp. 38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; VX770 made an appearance at the 1952 [[Society of British Aerospace Companies|Society of British Aircraft Constructors']] (SBAC) [[Farnborough Air Show]] the next month when Falk demonstrated an almost vertical bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot;&gt;Hamilton-Paterson 2010, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; After its Farnborough appearance, the future name of the Avro 698 was a subject of speculation; Avro had strongly recommended the name ''Ottawa'',{{refn|RAF bombers had been traditionally named after inland towns in the British Commonwealth, or towns associated with industry.&lt;ref name='white44'&gt;Wansbrough-White 1995, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} in honour of the company's connection with [[Avro Canada]].&lt;ref name = 'but 31'/&gt;&lt;ref name='white44'/&gt; Weekly magazine ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'' suggested ''Albion'' after rejecting ''Avenger'', ''Apollo'' and ''Assegai''. The chief of the air staff preferred a V-class of bombers, and the Air Council announced the following month that the 698 would be called ''Vulcan'' after the [[Vulcan (mythology)|Roman god of fire and destruction]].&lt;ref name='brookes8'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1953, VX770 was grounded for the installation of wing fuel tanks, [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Armstrong Siddeley ASSa.6 Sapphire]] engines of {{convert|7500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust and other systems; it flew again in July 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Blackman 2007, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison of Vulcan Planforms.jpg|thumb|upright|Comparison of Vulcan wing designs]]
The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More representative of production aircraft, it was lengthened to accommodate a longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with [[Bristol Olympus]] 100 engines of {{convert|9750|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of {{convert|11000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude [[flight envelope]], mild [[buffeting]] and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&amp;AEE) at [[MOD Boscombe Down|Boscombe Down]]. The solution included the &quot;phase 2&quot; wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and [[vortex generator]]s on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer was introduced to give a nose-up pitching moment, but more than was necessary just to counteract the diving tendency, so that the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight. This artificial pitch-up made the Vulcan appear more like other aircraft as the speed increased.&lt;ref&gt;Blackman 2007, pp. 82/83&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the first production B.1,{{refn|A contract for 25 production models had been made in July 1952. The same number of the rival Handley Page design were also ordered.&lt;ref name='wynn62'&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} XA889, had flown in February 1955 with the original wing.&lt;ref&gt;Blackman 2007, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1955, Falk, flying the second production B.1 XA890, amazed crowds at the Farnborough Air Show by executing a [[barrel roll]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackman, 2007, 128&quot; &gt;Blackman 2007, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; on his second flypast in front of the SBAC president's tent. After two days flying, he was called in front of service and civil aviation authorities and ordered to refrain from carrying out this &quot;dangerous&quot; manoeuvre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackman, 2007, 128&quot; /&gt; Now fitted with a phase 2 wing, XA889 was delivered in March 1956 to the A&amp;AEE for trials for the type's initial [[Certificate of Airworthiness]] which it received the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further developments====
The first 15 B.1s were powered by the Olympus 101 with {{convert|11000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. Many of these early examples in a metallic finish remained the property of the Ministry of Supply being retained for trials and development purposes. Those entering RAF service were delivered to [[No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit RAF|No 230 Operational Conversion Unit]] (OCU), the first in July 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 217–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Later aircraft, painted in [[anti-flash white]] and powered by the Olympus 102 with {{convert|12000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust, began to enter squadron service in July 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympus 102s were quickly modified to the Olympus 104 standard, ultimately rated at {{convert|13500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1990, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1952, Bristol Aero Engines had begun development of the BOl.6 (Olympus 6) rated at {{convert|16000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200198.html?tracked=1 16,000 lb Thrust] ''Flight'' 15 February 1957 p 200&lt;/ref&gt; but if fitted to the B.1, this would have re-introduced the buffet requiring further redesign of the wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;laming p62&quot;&gt;Laming 2002, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to proceed with the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956, being developed by Avro's chief designer [[Roy Ewans]]. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, pp. 315, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] equipment and tanker aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of [[electronic countermeasure]] (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro [[Blue Steel (missile)|Blue Steel]] [[stand-off missile]], then in development.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refuelling receiving equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. Other B.1s were used for the development of the BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a [[tail warning radar]], XA895.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 218, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SBAC58 Vulcan.jpg|thumb|left|Avro Vulcan B.2 XH533, the first B.2 Vulcan, flying at Farnborough in 1958]]
The 46th production aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 fitted with Olympus 200 engines with {{convert|16000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust, six months before the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1's service life, 28 were upgraded by [[Armstrong Whitworth]] between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM equipment,&lt;ref&gt;Brookes and Davey, 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; in-flight refuelling receiving equipment,&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' intro. Para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and UHF radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;PilotNotes&quot;&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, ch. 16, para. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201 with {{convert|17000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust, it was more representative of a production aircraft, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM tail cone. Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were fitted retrospectively. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials and it was the 12th B.2, XH558, that was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 would also be the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 63, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26th B.2, XL317, the first of a production batch ordered in February 1956, was the first Vulcan, apart from development aircraft, capable of carrying the Blue Steel missile; 33 aircraft were delivered to the RAF with these modifications.&lt;ref&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Mk.2 version of Blue Steel was cancelled in favour of the [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] [[GAM-87 Skybolt]] [[air-launched ballistic missile]] in December 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; fittings were changed in anticipation of the new missile, one under each wing. Though Skybolt was cancelled in November 1962, many aircraft were delivered or retrofitted with &quot;Skybolt&quot; blisters.&lt;ref&gt;Bulman 2001, pp. 155–161.&lt;/ref&gt; Later aircraft (XL391 and XM574 onwards) were delivered with Olympus 301 engines with {{convert|20000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. Two earlier aircraft were re-engined (XH557 and XJ784) for trials and development work; another seven aircraft (XL384–XL390) were converted around 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Bulman 2001, pp. 149, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last B.2 XM657 was delivered in 1965 and the type served till 1984. Whilst in service the B.2 was continuously updated with modifications including rapid engine starting, bomb-bay fuel tanks, wing strengthening to give the fatigue life to enable the aircraft to fly at low level (a tactic introduced in the mid-1960s), upgraded navigation equipment, terrain following radar (TFR), standardisation on a common nuclear weapon ([[WE.117]]) and improved ECM equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The B.1As were not strengthened, thus all were withdrawn by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 217–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine B.2s were modified for a maritime radar reconnaissance (MRR) role&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookes83&quot;&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and six for an airborne tanker role.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; An updated bomb rack assembly allowed the carriage of 30 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb bombs, up from 21&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOmPJOT-wUg&lt;/ref&gt; and the updated wing profile increased range to 4,000&amp;nbsp;nm (7,400&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=239 |title = Avro Vulcan High-Altitude Long-Range Heavy Bomber - United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed developments and cancelled projects===
;Avro Type 718:
The Avro 718 was a 1951 proposal for a delta-winged military transport based on the Type 698 to carry 80 troops or 110 passengers. It would have been powered by four Bristol Olympus [[Rolls-Royce Olympus#Variants|BOl.3]] engines.&lt;ref name='avrotypelist'&gt;[http://www.avroheritage.com/page10a.html &quot;Avro Type List.&quot;] ''Avro Heritage.'' Retrieved: 4 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Avro Atlantic:
{{main|Avro Atlantic}}
The Avro Type 722 Atlantic was a 1952 proposal (announced in June 1953) for a 120-passenger delta-winged airliner based on the Type 698.&lt;ref name='avrotypelist'/&gt;
;Avro Type 732:
The Avro 732 was a 1956 proposal for a supersonic development of the Vulcan and would have been powered by 8 [[de Havilland Gyron Junior]] engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the [[Avro 730]] supersonic [[stainless steel]] [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its Vulcan heritage.&lt;ref name='avrotypelist'/&gt;
;Vulcan Phase 6 (Vulcan B.3)
[[File:Avro Vulcan B.3 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|Silhouette of the original study for the Vulcan B.3 patrol missile carrier]]
In 1960, the Air Staff approached Avro with a request into a study for a patrol missile carrier armed with up to six [[Skybolt missile]]s capable of a mission length of 12 hours. Avro's submission in May 1960 was the Phase 6 Vulcan, which if built would have been the Vulcan B.3. The aircraft was fitted with an enlarged wing of {{convert|121|ft|m|abbr=on}} span with increased fuel capacity; additional fuel tanks in a dorsal spine; a new main undercarriage to carry an all-up-weight of {{convert|339000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}; and reheated Olympus 301s of {{convert|30000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. An amended proposal of October 1960 inserted a {{convert|10|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} plug into the forward fuselage with capacity for six crew members including a relief pilot, all facing forwards on ejection seats, and [[Turbofan#Aft-fan turbofan|aft-fan]] versions of the Olympus 301.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;&gt;Gibson 2011, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export proposals===
Other countries expressed interest in purchasing Vulcans but, as with the other V-bombers, no foreign sales materialised.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Labour research, Volume 51.&quot; 1962, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Australia:
As early as 1954, Australia recognised that the [[English Electric Canberra]] was becoming outdated and evaluated aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and [[Handley-Page Victor]] as potential replacements.&lt;ref name = 'stephens 142'&gt;Stephens 1992, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Political pressure for a Canberra replacement rose to a head in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the [[BAC TSR-2]], [[General Dynamics F-111C]], and [[North American A-5 Vigilante]] had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=1345810&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1 &quot;Correspondence between the Australian and British Governments concerning the selection of the F-111 over the TSR-2.&quot;] ''National Archives of Australia''.

;Argentina:
In the early 1980s, Argentina approached the UK with a proposal to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, British ministers approved the export of a single aircraft, but emphasised that clearance had not been given for the sale of a larger number. A letter from the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/118426 &quot;Falklands: FCO to MOD (sale of Vulcans to Argentina – no clearance given for sales – declassified 2012)&quot;] ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved: 4 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falklands War|Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands]] less than three months later, after which a British [[embargo]] on the sale of any military equipment was quickly imposed, ending the prospect of any sale.

===Overview===
Despite its radical and unusual shape, the airframe was built along traditional lines. Except for the most highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down into a number of major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear [[Spar (aviation)|spars]] and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre [[fuselage]]; the front fuselage, incorporating the [[Cabin pressurization|pressure cabin]]; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.&lt;ref&gt;Gunston, W. T. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%201836.html &quot;Building the Vulcan.&quot;] ''Flight'', 13 December 1957, p. 926.&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-man crew, the first pilot, co-pilot, [[Bombardier (aircrew)|navigator radar]], [[Navigator|navigator plotter]] and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on [[Martin-Baker]] 3K (3KS on the B.2) [[ejection seat]]s whilst on the lower level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, leading particulars.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 2, para. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The original B35/46 specification sought a [[Escape crew capsule|jettisonable crew compartment]], this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected.&lt;ref name='wynn97'&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='laming64'&gt;Laming 2002, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member;&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, introduction, para 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats were no more than cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual [[Bombardier (air force)|bomb-aimer's]] compartment could be fitted with a [[Mark XIV bomb sight|T4 (Blue Devil)]] [[bombsight]],&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E102'&gt;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted [[Vinten]] F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.&lt;ref name='brookes65'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel was carried in 14 bag tanks, four in the centre fuselage above and to the rear of the nosewheel bay and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The [[Center of mass|centre of gravity]] was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 8, paras. 1, 2, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 8, paras. 3, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being designed before a low [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) and other [[Stealth technology|stealth]] factors were ever a consideration,&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist82&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=New Scientist|last=Sweetman|first=Bill|title=The Bomber that radar cannot see|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVJyHCXAOtsC&amp;pg=PA566|date=4 March 1982|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated that of all the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1957, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Writing for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, J. Seddon and E. L.

===Colour schemes===
[[File:Aerial Vulcan.JPEG|thumb|Aerial view of a Vulcan B.2 in late RAF markings on static display at [[RAF Mildenhall]], 1984]]
The two prototype Vulcans were finished in gloss white. Early Vulcan B.1s left the factory in a natural metal finish; the front half of the nose [[radome]] was painted black, the rear half painted silver. Front-line Vulcan B.1s had a finish of [[anti-flash white]] and [[Royal Air Force roundels|RAF &quot;type D&quot; roundels]]. Front-line Vulcan B.1As and B.2s were similar but with 'type D pale' roundels.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookes33-35&quot;&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the adoption of low-level attack profiles in the mid-1960s, B.1As and B.2s were given a glossy sea grey medium and dark green disruptive pattern camouflage on the upper surfaces, white undersurfaces and &quot;type D&quot; roundels. (The last 13 Vulcan B.2s, XM645 onwards, were delivered thus from the factory&lt;ref name=&quot;bulman43&quot;&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the mid-1970s: Vulcan B.2s received a similar scheme with matte camouflage, light aircraft grey undersides, and &quot;low-visibility&quot; roundels; B.2(MRR)s received a similar scheme in gloss; and the front half of the radomes were no longer painted black. Beginning in 1979, 10 Vulcans received a wrap-around camouflage of dark sea grey and dark green&lt;ref name=&quot;brookes36-41&quot;&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bulman170&quot;&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; because, during [[Red Flag (United States Air Force)|Red Flag]] exercises in the US, defending [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] forces had found that the grey-painted undersides of the Vulcan became much more visible against the ground at high angles of bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 72&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Avro_Vulcan_Flight_Deck.jpg|thumb|Avro Vulcan Flight Deck]]

===Avionics===
The original Vulcan B.1 radio fit was: two 10-channel [[Very high frequency|VHF]] transmitter/receivers (TR-1985/TR-1986) and a 24-channel [[High frequency|HF]] transmitter-receiver (STR-18).&lt;ref name='Wynn137'&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan B.1A also featured a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] transmitter-receiver (ARC-52).&lt;ref name=&quot;PilotNotes&quot; /&gt; The initial B.2 radio fit was similar to the B.1A&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E112'&gt;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; though it was ultimately fitted with the ARC-52, a V/UHF transmitter/receiver (PTR-175), and a [[single-sideband modulation]] [[High frequency|HF]] transmitter-receiver ([[Rockwell Collins|Collins]] 618T).&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 14, paras. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The navigation and bombing system (NBS) comprised an [[H2S radar|H2S Mk9 radar]] and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1.&lt;ref name='Wynn137'/&gt; Other navigation aids included a [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] radio compass ([[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|ADF]]), [[GEE (navigation)|GEE Mk3]], [[Green Satin radar|Green Satin]] [[Doppler radar]] to determine the [[groundspeed]] and [[Wind triangle|drift angle]], [[Radio altimeter|radio and radar altimeters]], and an [[instrument landing system]].&lt;ref name='Wynn137'/&gt; [[TACAN]] replaced GEE in the B.1A&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, ch. 16, para. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and B.2 in 1964 . [[Decca Radar|Decca]] Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E102/3'&gt;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, pp. 102, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuous display of the aircraft's position was maintained by a ground position indicator (GPI).&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E102/3'/&gt;

Vulcan B.2s were eventually fitted with the twin-gyro free-running [[Gyroscopes|gyroscopic]] heading reference system (HRS) Mk.2, based upon the [[Inertial navigation system|inertial platform]] of the Blue Steel missile, which had been integrated into the system when the missile had been carried.&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E102/3'/&gt; With the HRS a navigator's heading unit (NHU) was provided which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the [[LORAN]] C navigation system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookes83&quot;/&gt;

The original ECM fit as fitted to the B.1A and B.2 was: one Green Palm voice communications' jammer; two Blue Diver metric jammers; three [[Red Shrimp]] S-band jammers; a Blue Saga [[Radar warning receiver|passive warning receiver]] with four aerials (PWR); a Red Steer [[tail warning radar]]; and [[Chaff (countermeasure)|window (chaff)]] dispensers.&lt;ref name='Wynn321'&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the equipment was carried in a large extended tail cone, and a flat ECM aerial counterpoise plate mounted between the starboard tailpipes.&lt;ref name='Wynn151'&gt;Wynn 1997, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Some B.2 aircraft armed with Blue Steel had an additional aerial plate fitted between the port tailpipes as the Blue Steel fin, in the lowered position, blanked signals from the starboard side.&lt;ref name='bulman153'&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Later equipment on the B.2 included: an [[L band]] jammer (replacing a Red Shrimp); the ARI 18146 X-band jammer;&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E106'&gt;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the Green Palm; the improved Red Steer Mk.2; [[Flare (countermeasure)|infra-red decoys]] (flares); and the ARI 18228 PWR with its aerials that gave a squared top to the fin.&lt;ref name='PB&amp;E112'/&gt;&lt;ref name='brookes57'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
Economic growth in the People's Republic of China has given mainland Chinese more opportunities to [[Chinese emigration|emigrate]]. A 2011 survey showed that 60% of Chinese millionaires plan to emigrate, with 40% of Chinese millionaires selecting the United States as the top destination for immigration.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 2011-11-11&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/11/world/asia/china-rich-emigration/index.html|title=As China's rich grow in numbers, so do their mobile aspirations - CNN|date=21 November 2011|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-invests.net/20120710/29447.aspx|title=Chinese millionaires seek for overseas activities- China Business Network|website=China-invests.net|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ Plan B&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577181461401318988 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Plan B for China's Wealthy: Moving to the U.S., Europe - WSJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/01/report-half-of-chinas-rich-want-to-leave/ | publisher=CNN | title=Report: Half of China's millionaires want to leave | date=1 November 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711131410/http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/01/report-half-of-chinas-rich-want-to-leave/ | archivedate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/usa/business/2011-11/03/content_14028392.htm Chinese rich are keen to emigrate], China Daily, 3 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/47599766/The_Mass_Migration_of_the_Super_Rich|title=The Mass Migration of the Super-Rich – U.S. Business News|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=15 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403094725/http://www.cnbc.com/id/47599766/The_Mass_Migration_of_the_Super_Rich|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EB-5 Investment Visa allows many Chinese to seek U.S. citizenship.

There has been a significant change in the perceptions about Chinese Americans. In as little as 100 years of American history, [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the Western world|stereotypes of Chinese Americans]] have changed to portraying a hard working and educated minority. Thus, most Chinese Americans work as [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professionals, many of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed in management, professional, and related occupations such as engineering, medicine, investment banking, law, and academia. 56.2% of Chinese Americans work in many white collar professions compared with 52.1% for all Asian Americans and a national average of 38.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;American FactFinder&quot;/&gt; Chinese Americans also make up a third of the Asian American high tech professional workforce and a tenth of the entire Silicon Valley workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&amp;catid=47:society&amp;Itemid=56 |title=Chinese American Contributions to Silicon Valley |publisher=Modelminority.com |date=31 March 2003 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916155237/http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&amp;catid=47:society&amp;Itemid=56 |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Americans also hold lower unemployment rates than the population average with a figure of 4.7% compared to a national rate of 5.9% in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;American FactFinder&quot;/&gt;

Between 2008 and 2017, the number of Chinese-educated physicians practicing in the United States rose by 38.1%, and the total number of Chinese-educated physicians actively practicing in the United States was about 0.6% of the active physician workforce in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Robbert J. Duvivier, John Boulet &amp; Jason Z.

Many Chinese Americans have turned to the high tech center to jump-start potential computer science and programming startups to capitalize on the region's wealth of venture capital, business expertise, and cultural and financial incentives for innovation. Ethnic Chinese have been successful in starting new firms in technology centers across the United States, including California's [[Silicon Valley]]. Chinese Americans have been disproportionately successful in high technology sectors, as evidenced by the [[Goldsea]] 100 Compilation of America's Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldsea.com/Profiles/100/100.html | title=100 Most Successful Asian American Entrepreneurs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Americans accounted for 4% of people listed in the 1998 Forbes Hi Tech 100 List.&lt;ref name=&quot;Awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurhu.com/index/aaward.htm#beauty|title=Awards|publisher=Arthurhu.com|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annalee Saxenian, a [[UC Berkeley]] professor, whose research interests include the contribution of Chinese immigrants on America's technology concludes that in Silicon Valley, carried out a study that showed that since 1998, one out of five high tech start-ups in Silicon Valley were led by Chinese Americans. During the same year, 5 of the 8 fastest growing companies had Chinese American CEOs, except for [[Yahoo]], whose [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] was a founder but not a CEO. In Silicon Valley there are at least 2 to 3 dozen Chinese American organizations according to professional interests each with at least 100 members, one prominent organization of which is the [[Committee of 100 (United States)|Committee of 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&amp;catid=47:society&amp;Itemid=56 | title=Chinese American Contributions to Silicon Valley | access-date=10 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916155237/http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&amp;catid=47:society&amp;Itemid=56 | archive-date=16 September 2013 | url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants from mainland China and Taiwan were key founders in 12.8% of all Silicon Valley start-ups between 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careerbright.com/tag/immigrant-entrepreneurs |title=Immigrant Entrepreneurs |publisher=Careerbright |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 6% of the immigrants who founded companies in the innovation/manufacturing-related services field are from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IA12Df01.html |title=South Asia news – More foreign cogs in the US engine |work=Asia Times |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research funded by the [[Public Policy Institute of California]] indicates that in 1996, 1,786 Silicon Valley technology companies with $12.5 billion in sales and 46,000 employees were run by Indian or Chinese executives. Moreover, the pace of entrepreneurship among local immigrants is increasing rapidly. While Chinese or Indian executives are at the helm of 13% of the Silicon Valley technology businesses started between 1980 and 1985, they are running 27% of the more than 4,000 businesses started between 1991 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppic.org/main/commentary.asp?i=206 |title=A Valley Asset: Chinese, Indians Creating Businesses, Jobs, Wealth As Successful Entrepreneurs (PPIC Commentary) |publisher=Ppic.org |date=21 June 1998 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527000933/http://www.ppic.org/main/commentary.asp?i=206 |archivedate=27 May 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Start-up firms remain a primary source for new ideas and innovation for Chinese American internet entrepreneurs.

Despite positive economic indicators, a number of economic deterrents have been noted to afflict the Chinese American community. While median income remains above some ethnic groups in the United States, studies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis revealed that Asian men have the highest rate of persistent long-term unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/long_term_unemployment_hits_asian_americans_hardest/11005574.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies have shown that Asian Americans have been discriminated in companies with lower pay grades; even in larger corporate settings such as Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/google-gender-pay-gap.html|title=Google Finds It's Underpaying Many Men as It Addresses Wage Equity|last=Wakabayashi|first=Daisuke|date=4 March 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=21 June 2019|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
A research on the whole genome patterns of common DNA variation in different human populations (African-American, Asian-American and European American) finds some common [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) in these three populations with diverse ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hinds|first1=David A.|last2=Stuve|first2=Laura L.|last3=Nilsen|first3=Geoffrey B.|last4=Halperin|first4=Eran|last5=Eskin|first5=Eleazar|last6=Ballinger|first6=Dennis G.|last7=Frazer|first7=Kelly A.|last8=Cox|first8=David R.|date=18 February 2005|title=Whole-Genome Patterns of Common DNA Variation in Three Human Populations|journal=Science|volume=307|issue=5712|pages=1072–1079|doi=10.1126/science.1105436|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15718463|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1072H|citeseerx=10.1.1.115.3580|s2cid=27107073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the samples of Han Chinese in America, 74% of the total SNPs have two alleles, and majority of the segregating SNPs have a [[minor allele frequency]] (MAF) greater than 10%. Another noticeable point is that MAFs show similar distributions in European-American and Han Chinese populations. Besides, rarer haplotype is found to be absent in the samples of Han Chinese, and they also possess a high level of redundancy.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

A study analyzing East Asian Genetic Substructure using genome-wide SNP arrays is carried out with greater than 200,000 genotypes from people of East Asian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tian|first1=Chao|last2=Kosoy|first2=Roman|last3=Lee|first3=Annette|last4=Ransom|first4=Michael|last5=Belmont|first5=John W.|last6=Gregersen|first6=Peter K.|last7=Seldin|first7=Michael F.|date=5 December 2008|title=Analysis of East Asia Genetic Substructure Using Genome-Wide SNP Arrays|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=3|issue=12|pages=e3862|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003862|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2587696|pmid=19057645|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3862T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continental populations are from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (Cambodian, Yi, Daur, Mongolian, Lahu, Dai, Hezhen, Miaozu, Naxi, Oroqen, She, Tu, Tujia, Naxi, Xibo, and Yakut), HapMap (Han Chinese and Japanese), as well as East Asian or East Asian American subjects of Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino and Chinese ancestry. A clear understanding of the genetic substructure of any population helps in the studies of complex diseases, as well as the design and execution of association tests. Results of this study have identified markers that can not only reduce type 1 errors in future genetic disease studies, but also identify homogeneous groups and hence make this study more powerful.

The group of Chinese American in the same study consists of subjects with origins from North China, South China and Taiwan. This group is paired with Han Chinese from Beijing, and results indicate that the population differentiation values was small (&lt;0.0025). There is substantially less genetic substructure between Han Chinese and Chinese American, compared with that between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean groups, yet there is still a substructure in principal component, according to the split half reliability test.

Another study aiming to estimate cardiometabolic risk profile of Chinese adults with diabetes is also useful to reveal the personal genomics of Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Lin|last2=Xu|first2=Yu|last3=Wang|first3=Limin|last4=Xu|first4=Min|last5=Jiang|first5=Yong|last6=Zhang|first6=Mei|last7=Li|first7=Yichong|last8=Lu|first8=Jieli|last9=Wang|first9=Tiange|date=26 October 2016|title=The cardiometabolic risk profile of Chinese adults with diabetes: A nationwide cross-sectional survey|journal=Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications|volume=31|issue=1|pages=43–52|doi=10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2016.10.023|issn=1873-460X|pmid=27838099}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, all subjects are over 18 years old and non-institutionalized. Results derived from a complex, multistage, probability sampling design show that 12,607 out of 98,658 Chinese adults are suffering from diabetes, based on the criteria of 2010 American Diabetes Association. In addition, the study reaches a conclusion that for those Chinese adults defined with diabetes, cardiometabolic risk factors are highly prevalent, including metabolic syndrome, systolic blood pressure that is higher than 140mmHg, low fruit and vegetable intake, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that is higher than 110&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.

The circumstance of Asian American population is informative in a way that some knowledge about Chinese American can be inferred from it. The statistics of diabetes in Asian American population reveals that approximately 10% of the entire population are diabetic, and in which 90–95% are type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.plos.org/publichealth/2012/11/27/overcoming-the-obstacles-of-diagnosing-diabetes-in-asian-americans/|title=Overcoming the obstacles of diagnosing diabetes in Asian Americans {{!}} Public Health|date=27 November 2012|newspaper=Public Health|access-date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current situation is that there are some challenges in diagnosing diabetes in many Asian Americans. The main obstacle is that many clinical features along with risks factors associated with diabetes are obtained from studies that focus on Caucasian populations, which might result in misdiagnoses between type 1 and type 2 diabetes for Asian Americans. In fact, the reason why classic features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in America might not apply to Asian American population is about shared absence of common HLA DR-DQ genotype, low prevalence of positive anti-islet antibodies and low BMI in both types of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hsu|first1=William C.|last2=Okeke|first2=Eyiuche|last3=Cheung|first3=Sophia|last4=Keenan|first4=Hillary|last5=Tsui|first5=Tracy|last6=Cheng|first6=Kyle|last7=King|first7=George L.|date=2 December 2011|title=A Cross-Sectional Characterization of Insulin Resistance by Phenotype and Insulin Clamp in East Asian Americans with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=12|pages=e28311|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028311|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3229556|pmid=22164267|bibcode=2011PLoSO...628311H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other studies have pointed out that for people of Asian descent and without diabetes, their insulin resistance levels are higher than non-diabetic people of Caucasian descent. Thus, Asian Americans are relatively more predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes. This suggests that insulin resistance, rather than body mass index (BMI) should be targeted while making diagnoses. A potential biomarker to identify diabetes in young Asian American population is adipocyte fatty acid binding protein that has a strong association with insulin resistance but is independent of adiposity. Nevertheless, more research studies should be carried out in order to confirm such finding. With further applying the above outcome on the population of Chinese Americans, it is rational that there is a higher tendency for type 2 diabetes among this group of people, who also face the challenge of correct diagnosis in America.

Genetic mental illness is stigmatized in China. A study compares the attitude of Chinese American towards mental illness with genetic causes and that of European American. It finds out that there is a perception of eugenics existing among Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=WonPat-Borja|first1=Ahtoy J.|last2=Yang|first2=Lawrence H.|last3=Link|first3=Bruce G.|last4=Phelan|first4=Jo C.|date=4 December 2016|title=Eugenics, genetics, and mental illness stigma in Chinese Americans|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|volume=47|issue=1|pages=145–156|doi=10.1007/s00127-010-0319-7|issn=0933-7954|pmc=3141094|pmid=21079911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in order to reduce the stigma in the society, more efforts should be devoted to this population.

The journal launched by the above study highlights the idea of genetic essentialism, namely, genes are largely deterministic of individual characteristics and behavior. There is a separation between the normal and the deviant, which drives the process of stigma labeling. On the other hand, since genetic diseases can be passed on from one generation to another, some mental illnesses are shared in a family, stigmatizing all members involved. Another viewpoint relevant to genetic essentialism is that, since genes are perceived by the common people as difficult to modify, genetic mental illness is likely to persist, and so is the stigma. As a result, the mindset of many Chinese Americans is formulated as diseases with genetic causes being more serious than those without.

The same journal also delivers some hypotheses made on the basis of the long history of eugenics in China. First, Chinese Americans are more in favor of eugenic policies than European Americans. Secondly, more stigma would be generated towards genetic attributions of any diseases in Chinese American population. China used to implement restrictions on marriage licenses to people with genetic illnesses, which has made the attitude of Chinese American towards premarital genetic screening more supportive, especially when facing a chance of genetic defects. Moreover, from the perspective of this group of people, knowing whether a marriage partner has family history of mental illness with genetic basis is fairly important.

{{Campaignbox Civil rights movement}}
The '''civil rights movement'''{{efn|The social movement has also been called the American civil rights movement, the 1960s civil rights movement, the African-American civil rights movement, the Afro-American civil rights movement, the American freedom movement, the black civil rights movement, the black revolution, the black rights movement, the civil rights revolution, the modern civil rights movement, the Negro American revolution, the Negro freedom movement, the Negro movement, the Negro revolt, the Negro revolution, the Second Reconstruction, the Southern freedom movement, the United States civil rights movement and the U.S. civil rights movement. The term ''civil rights struggle'' can denote this or other [[social movements]] that occurred in the United States during the same period. The social movement's span of time is called the civil rights era.}} in the [[United States]] was a decades-long struggle by [[African Americans]] and their like-minded allies to end [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] [[Racial discrimination in the United States|racial discrimination]], [[disenfranchisement in the United States|disenfranchisement]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in the United States. The movement has its origins in the [[Reconstruction era]] during the late 19th century, although the movement achieved its largest [[legislative]] gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]] campaigns eventually secured new protections in [[federal law]] for the [[human rights]] of all [[Americans]].

After the [[American Civil War]] and the subsequent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in the 1860s, the [[Reconstruction Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]] granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved. For a short period of time, African American men voted and held political office, but they were increasingly deprived of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], often under the so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], and African Americans were subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by white supremacists in the South. Over the following century, various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal and civil rights. In 1954, the [[separate but equal]] policy, which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws, was substantially weakened and eventually dismantled with the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling and other subsequent rulings which followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka|title=Brown v. Board of Education|publisher=History.com|access-date=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1955 and 1968, [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] mass protests and [[civil disobedience]] produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to immediately respond to these situations, which highlighted the [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|inequities faced by African Americans]] across the country. The [[lynching]] of Chicago teenager [[Emmett Till]] in Mississippi, and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused when his mother decided to have an open-casket funeral, galvanized the African-American community nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/how-the-blood-of-emmett-till-still-stains-america-today/516891/ |title=How 'The Blood of Emmett Till' Still Stains America Today |last=II |first=Vann R.

At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 under the leadership of [[Earl Warren]] struck down many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Morton J.|date=Winter 1993|title=The Warren Court And The Pursuit Of Justice|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1814&amp;context=wlulr|journal=Washington and Lee Law Review|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Warren Court and American Politics|last=Powe, Jr.|first=Lucas A.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swindler|first=William F.|date=1970|title=The Warren Court: Completion of a Constitutional Revolution|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003223936/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf|archive-date=October 3, 2019|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driver|first=Justin|date=October 2012|title=The Constitutional Conservatism of the Warren Court|journal=California Law Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1101–1167|jstor=23408735}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Warren Court]] made a series of landmark rulings against racist discrimination, such as ''Brown v. Board of Education'' (1954), ''[[Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States]]'' (1964), and ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967) which banned segregation [[school segregation in the United States|in public schools]] and public accommodations, and struck down [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|all state laws banning interracial marriage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1964/515|title=Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964&amp;nbsp;– CRA&amp;nbsp;– Title VII&amp;nbsp;– Equal Employment Opportunities&amp;nbsp;– 42 US Code Chapter 21&amp;nbsp;– findUSlaw |access-date=July 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archive-date=October 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States'' (1964), explicitly banned all discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices, ended unequal application of voter registration requirements, and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in [[public accommodations]]. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] restored and protected voting rights for minorities by authorizing federal oversight of registration and elections in areas with historic under-representation of minorities as voters. The [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and young people across the country were inspired to take action. From 1964 through 1970, a wave of [[Urban riots|inner-city riots and protests]] in black communities dampened support from the white middle class, but increased support from [[private foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICqREHoO6hoC&amp;q=radical+flank.+foundations&amp;pg=PA93 |title=Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 1954–1970 |last=Haines |first=Herbert H. |date=1995 |publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press |isbn=978-1-57233-260-7 |pages=98–118 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted from 1965 to 1975, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its constant practice of [[Legality|legalism]] and [[non-violence]]. Instead, its leaders demanded that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency had to be developed in the black community. Ultimately, the emergence of the Black power movement came from an increasingly disillusioned African American proletariat. Many African Americans had seen little material improvement on the opportunities afforded them since the Civil Rights Movement's peak in the mid 1960's. The reality for African Americans remained the same: they still faced mass discrimination in jobs, housing, education and politics. Even if it was not overtly written into law anymore, African Americans still faced the reality of mass discrimination. Many popular representations of the Civil Rights movement are centered on the charismatic leadership and philosophy of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], who won the 1964 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. However, some scholars note that the movement was too diverse to be credited to any particular person, organization, or strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.msu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://history.msu.edu/files/2010/04/Timothy-Tyson.pdf Timothy B.

Saito (1998). ''Race and Politics: Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites in a Los Angeles Suburb''. p. 154. University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Civil War, three constitutional amendments were passed, including the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] (1865) that ended slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (1869) that gave African-Americans citizenship, adding their total population of four million to the official population of southern states for [[United States congressional apportionment|Congressional apportionment]]; and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (1870) that gave African-American males the right to vote (only males could vote in the U.S. at the time). From 1865 to 1877, the United States underwent a turbulent [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]] trying to establish free labor and [[civil rights]] of freedmen in the South after the end of slavery. Many whites resisted the social changes, leading to insurgent movements such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], whose members attacked black and white [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to maintain [[white supremacy]].

After the [[1876 United States presidential election|disputed election]] of 1876, which resulted in the end of Reconstruction and the withdrawal of federal troops, whites in the South regained political control of the region's state legislatures. They continued to intimidate and violently attack blacks before and during elections to suppress their voting, but the last African Americans were elected to Congress from the South before disenfranchisement of blacks by states throughout the region, as described below.

From 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] African Americans and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] by creating barriers to voter registration; voting rolls were dramatically reduced as blacks and poor whites were forced out of electoral politics. After the landmark [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), which prohibited [[white primaries]], progress was made in increasing black political participation in the Rim South and [[Acadiana]] – although almost entirely in urban areas&lt;ref&gt;Klarman, Michael J.; 'The White Primary Rulings: A Case Study in the Consequences of Supreme Court Decisionmaking'; ''Florida State University Law Review'', vol. 29, issue 55, pp. 55-107&lt;/ref&gt; and a few rural localities where most blacks worked outside plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Hanes (junior); Puckett, Sherman and Deskins Donald R. (junior); ''The African American Electorate: A Statistical History'', p. 539 {{ISBN|0872895084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''status quo ante'' of excluding African Americans from the political system lasted in the remainder of the South, especially [[North Louisiana]], Mississippi and Alabama, until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s to provide federal enforcement of constitutional voting rights. For more than sixty years, blacks in the South were essentially excluded from politics, unable to elect anyone to represent their interests in Congress or local government.&lt;ref name=&quot;States afraid to take action&quot; /&gt; Since they could not vote, they could not serve on local juries.

During this period, the white-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] maintained political control of the South. With whites controlling all the seats representing the total population of the South, they had a powerful [[voting bloc]] in Congress. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]{{mdash}}the &quot;party of Lincoln&quot; and the party to which most blacks had belonged{{mdash}}shrank to insignificance except in remote [[Southern Unionist|Unionist]] areas of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]] as black voter registration was suppressed. The Republican [[lily-white movement]] also gained strength by excluding blacks. Until 1965, the “[[Solid South]]” was a one-party system under the white Democrats. Excepting the previously noted historic Unionist strongholds the Democratic Party nomination was tantamount to election for state and local office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Otis H Stephens, Jr |author2=John M Scheb, II |title=American Constitutional Law: Civil Rights and Liberties |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFcwj2yrLcwC&amp;pg=PA528 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=528 |isbn=978-0-495-09705-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] invited [[Booker T.

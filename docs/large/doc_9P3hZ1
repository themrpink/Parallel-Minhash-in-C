==Etymology==
The word ''garlic'' derives from [[Old English]], ''garlēac'', meaning ''gar'' ([[spear]]) and [[leek]], as a 'spear-shaped leek'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/garlic|title=garlic (n.)|date=2018|website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Allium sativum'' is a perennial flowering plant growing from a [[bulb]], it has a tall, erect flowering stem that grows up to {{cvt|1|m|ft|0}}. The leaf blade is flat, linear, solid, and approximately {{cvt|1.25|–|2.5|cm|in|1}} wide, with an acute apex. The plant may produce pink to purple flowers from July to September in the Northern Hemisphere. The bulb is odoriferous and contains outer layers of thin sheathing leaves surrounding an inner sheath that encloses the clove. Often the bulb contains 10 to 20 cloves that are asymmetric in shape, except for those closest to the center.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt; If garlic is planted at the proper time and depth, it can be grown as far north as Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rader |first1=Heidi |last2=McGuinness |first2=Julianne |title=Growing Garlic in Alaska |url=https://uaf.edu/ces/garden/garlic/ |website=[[Alaska Cooperative Extension Service|Cooperative Extension Service]] |publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks |accessdate=24 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces [[hermaphrodite]] flowers. It is [[Pollination|pollinated]] by bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|title=Growing Garlic from True Seed|last1=Meredith|first1=Ted Jordan|last2=Drucker|first2=Avram|website=Blogspot: Garlic Analecta|access-date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and major types==
Identification of the wild progenitor of common garlic is difficult due to the sterility of its many [[cultivars]], which limits the ability to [[test cross|cross test]] with wild relatives. Genetically and morphologically, garlic is most similar to the wild species ''Allium longicuspis'', which grows in central and southwestern Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Domestication of Plants in the Old World |edition=3rd |last1=Zohary|first1=Daniel|last2=Hopf|first2=Maria|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-850357-6|publication-date=January 11, 2001|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Vegetable Science and Technology: Production, Compostion, Storage, and Processing|publisher=Marcel Dekker|isbn=978-0-8247-0105-5|editor-last=Salunkhe|editor-first=D.K.|publication-date=March 19, 1998|page=397|editor-last2=Kadam|editor-first2=S.S.|date=March 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because ''Allium longicuspis'' is also mostly sterile, it is doubtful that it is the ancestor of ''Allium sativum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;/&gt; Other candidates that have been suggested include ''[[Allium tuncelianum]]'', ''[[Allium macrochaetum]]'', and ''[[Allium truncatum]]'', all of which are native to the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;/&gt;

''Allium sativum'' grows in the wild in areas where it has become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]]. The &quot;wild garlic&quot;, &quot;crow garlic&quot;, and &quot;[[field garlic]]&quot; of [[Great Britain|Britain]] are members of the species ''[[Allium ursinum]]'', ''[[Allium vineale]]'', and ''[[Allium oleraceum]]'', respectively. In North America, ''[[Allium vineale]]'' (known as &quot;wild garlic&quot; or &quot;crow garlic&quot;) and ''[[Allium canadense]]''( known as &quot;meadow garlic&quot;, &quot;wild garlic&quot;, or &quot;wild onion&quot;) are common [[weed]]s in fields.&lt;ref&gt;McGee p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; So-called [[Elephant Garlic|elephant garlic]] is actually a wild leek (''[[Allium ampeloprasum]]''), and not a true garlic. [[Solo garlic|Single clove]] garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the [[Yunnan]] province of China.

==Subspecies and varieties==
There are two subspecies of ''A. sativum,''&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ten major groups of varieties, and hundreds of varieties or cultivars.

*''A. sativum'' var. ''ophioscorodon'' (Link) Döll, called ''Ophioscorodon'', or hard-necked garlic, includes porcelain garlics, rocambole garlic, and purple stripe garlics. It is sometimes considered to be a separate species, ''Allium ophioscorodon'' G.Don.
*''A. sativum'' var. ''sativum'', or soft-necked garlic, includes artichoke garlic, silverskin garlic, and creole garlic.

There are at least 120 cultivars originating from [[Central Asia]], making it the main center of garlic biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kamenetsky, R. |author2=London Shafir, I. |author3=Khassanov, F.|display-authors=etal |title=Diversity in fertility potential and organo-sulphur compounds among garlics from Central Asia |journal=Biodivers Conserv |date=2005 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=281–295 |doi=10.1007/s10531-004-5050-9 |s2cid=17749916 |url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/338008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
[[File:Garlic plate no 6 bv73c1191 bk128b698 crop.jpeg|thumb|right|Garlic, from ''The Book of Health'', 1898, by Henry Munson Lyman]]
Garlic is easy to grow and can be grown year-round in mild climates.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=677|title=Garlic|date=2017|publisher=[[The Royal Horticultural Society]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sexual propagation of garlic is possible, nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], by planting individual cloves in the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;/&gt; 
In colder climates, cloves are best planted about six weeks before the soil freezes. The goal is to have the bulbs produce only roots and no shoots above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;October is garlic planting time&quot;, Michigan State University Extension, 2011, https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/october_is_garlic_planting_time Accessed Dec. 2019&lt;/ref&gt;
Harvest is in late spring or early summer.

Garlic plants can be grown closely together, leaving enough space for the [[bulb]]s to mature, and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth. Garlic does well in loose, dry, well-drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout USDA climate zones 4–9. When selecting garlic for planting, it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves. Large cloves, along with proper spacing in the planting bed, will also increase bulb size. Garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high [[organic material]] content, but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;/&gt;

There are different varieties or subspecies of garlic, most notably hardneck garlic and softneck garlic.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt; The [[latitude]] where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly-packed cloves.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

Garlic [[scape (botany)|scapes]] are removed to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth. The scapes can be eaten raw or cooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;cult&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/garden/30garden.html|title=The Cult of the Cloves|last=Tortorello|first=Michael|date=September 29, 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 5, 2010|quote=You sow it in fall, not spring. The plant often forms strange curling stalks, or 'scapes', with odd nodules called [[umbels]]. These rococo growths contain their own minicloves called bulbils.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scapes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/dining/18appe.html|title=A Garlic Festival Without a Single Clove|last=Clark|first=Melissa|date=June 18, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 5, 2010|quote=Garlic scapes are pencil thin and exuberantly loopy, and emanate a clean and mildly garlicky scent. … They had a gently spicy undertone and an exquisitely fresh green, mellow taste. Unlike regular garlic, which needs some kind of vehicle to carry its intense flavor to the mouth, scapes are self-sufficient; vegetable and aromatic all in one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diseases===
Garlic plants are usually hardy and not affected by many pests or diseases. Garlic plants are said to repel [[rabbits]] and [[mole (animal)|moles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AN&quot;/&gt; 
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) conducts a certification program to assure freedom from [[nematode]] and white rot disease caused by ''[[Stromatinia cepivora]]'', two pathogens that can both destroy a crop as well as remain in the soil indefinitely, once introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;/&gt;
Garlic may also suffer from pink root, a typically non-fatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r584100711.html |title=UC IPM: UC Management Guidelines for Pink Root on Onion and Garlic |publisher=Ipm.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Leek#Growing|leek rust]].&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt; The larvae of the [[leek moth]] attack garlic by mining into the leaves or bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landry|first=Jean-François|s2cid=86748199|date=June 2007|title=Taxonomic review of the leek moth genus Acrolepiopsis (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae) in North America|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=139|issue=3|pages=319–353|doi=10.4039/n06-098|issn=1918-3240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, world production of garlic was 28.5 million [[tonnes]], with [[China]] alone accounting for 78% of the total.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Alliin Structural Formula V.1.svg|thumb|280px|[[Alliin]], a [[sulfur]]-containing compound found in garlic.]]
Fresh or crushed garlic yields the [[sulfur]]-containing compounds [[allicin]], [[ajoene]], diallyl polysulfides, [[vinyldithiin]]s, ''S''-[[allylcysteine]], and [[enzyme]]s, [[saponin]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, and [[Maillard reaction]] products, which are not sulfur-containing compounds.

The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's [[cell (biology)|cells]] are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell [[vacuole]]s trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids ([[cytosol]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Meriel G.|last2=Hughes|first2=Jill|date=August 2004|title=Biosynthesis of the flavour precursors of onion and garlic|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=55|issue=404|pages=1903–18|doi=10.1093/jxb/erh138|pmid=15234988|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or [[leek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, pp. 310–311&lt;/ref&gt; Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macpherson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macpherson|first1=Lindsey J.|last2=Geierstanger|first2=Bernhard H.|last3=Viswanath|first3=Veena|last4=Bandell|first4=Michael|last5=Eid|first5=Samer R.|last6=Hwang|first6=SunWook|last7=Patapoutian|first7=Ardem|title=The Pungency of Garlic: Activation of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in Response to Allicin|url=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(05)00391-X.pdf|journal=[[Current Biology]]|publication-date=May 24, 2005|volume=15|issue=10|pages=929–34|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.018|pmid=15916949|year=2005|s2cid=163993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, people throughout history have used garlic to keep away pests such as mosquitoes and slugs.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the &quot;hot&quot; sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-[[transient receptor potential]] channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness.&lt;ref name=Macpherson/&gt; Allicin, along with its decomposition products [[diallyl disulfide]] and [[diallyl trisulfide]], are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as [[vinyldithiin]]s and [[ajoene]].&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt; Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the &quot;stinking rose&quot;. When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and [[garlic breath]] the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. [[Allyl methyl sulfide]] (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the [[blood]]. It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt;

Abundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during pickling and cooking. Under these conditions (''i.e.'', acidity, heat) the sulfur-containing compound [[alliin]] reacts with common [[amino acid]]s to make [[pyrrole]]s, clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Imai|first=Shinsuke|last2=Akita|first2=Kaori|last3=Tomotake|first3=Muneaki|last4=Sawada|first4=Hiroshi|year=2006|title=Model Studies on Precursor System Generating Blue Pigment in Onion and Garlic|journal=[[Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry]]|volume=54|issue=3|pages=848–852|doi=10.1021/jf051980f|pmid=16448193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cho|first=Jungeun|last2=Lee|first2=Seung Koo|last3=Patil|first3=B.S.|last4=Lee|first4=Eun Jin|last5=Yoo|first5=Kil Sun|title= Separation of Blue Pigments in Crushed Garlic Cloves: The Color-Forming Potential of Individual Amino Acids|url=http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=841_66|journal= Acta Horticulturae|issue=841|pages=491–494|doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.841.66|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rings can be linked together into [[polypyrrole]] molecules.

===Culinary===
Numerous cuneiform records show that garlic has been cultivated in [[Mesopotamia]] for at least 4,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;/&gt; The use of garlic in China and Egypt also dates back thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;/&gt; Well-preserved garlic was found in the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1325&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zohary&quot;/&gt; It was consumed by ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] soldiers, sailors, and rural classes ([[Virgil]], ''Eclogues'' ii. 11), and, according to [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for [[Hecate]] ([[Theophrastus]], ''Characters, The Superstitious Man'').

Garlic was rare in traditional [[British cuisine|English cuisine]] (though it is said to have been grown in England before 1548) but has been a common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forloveofgarlicc0000reno/page/21|title=For the Love of Garlic: The Complete Guide to Garlic Cuisine|last=Renoux|first=Victoria|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Square One Publishers, Inc.|isbn=9780757000874|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forloveofgarlicc0000reno/page/21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the {{circa|lk=no|1300}} [[Assize of Weights and Measures]], an English statute generally dated to the 13th century, indicate a passage as dealing with standardized units of garlic production, sale, and taxation — the [[hundred (unit)|hundred]] of 15 [[rope (garlic)|ropes]] of 15 heads each&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Statutes of the Realm |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I |date=1810 |location=London |publisher=G.

In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] gives a list of scenarios in which garlic was considered beneficial (''N.H.'' xx. 23).

Garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment.

The garlic plant's [[bulb]] is the most commonly used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic [[piquancy|pungent, spicy flavor]] that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Alli_sat.html|title=Garlic (''Allium sativum'' L.)|last=Katzer|first=Gernot|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The distinctive aroma is mainly due to [[organosulfur]] compounds including [[allicin]] present in fresh garlic cloves and [[ajoene]] which forms when they are crushed or chopped.  A further metabolite [[allyl methyl sulfide]] is responsible for garlic breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Block 1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1021/ja00338a049| year=1984|vauthors=Block E, Ahmad S, Jain MK, Crecely R, Apitz-Castro R, Cruz MR |title=(''E'',''Z'')-Ajoene: A potent antithrombotic agent from garlic|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|volume=106| issue=26|pages=8295–8296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Block, E | title= The chemistry of garlic and onions | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=252 | issue= 3| year=1985 | pages=114–119 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0385-114 | pmid = 3975593 | bibcode= 1985SciAm.252c.114B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the garlic plant are also edible. The [[leaves]] and [[flowers]] ([[bulbil]]s) on the head ([[spathe]]) are sometimes eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs,&lt;ref name=&quot;AN&quot;/&gt; and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as &quot;green garlic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kitchen Garden Cookbook|last=Thompson|first=Sylvia|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1997|isbn=978-0-553-37476-6|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; When green garlic is allowed to grow past the &quot;scallion&quot; stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic &quot;round&quot;, a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kitchen Garden Cookbook|last=Thompson|first=Sylvia|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1997|isbn=978-0-553-37476-6|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food, minus the spiciness. Green garlic is often chopped and [[stir-fried]] or cooked in [[soup]] or [[hot pot]] in Southeast Asian (i.e. [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Burmese cuisine|Myanmar]], [[Lao cuisine|Lao]], [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodian]], [[Singaporean cuisine|Singaporean]]), and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese cookery]], and is very abundant and low-priced. Additionally, the immature flower stalks ([[scape (botany)|scapes]]) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to [[asparagus]] in [[Stir frying|stir-fries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/pubs/SFNews/archive/95071.htm|title=Small Farm News Archive|last=Voss|first=Ronald E.|date=July 1995|publisher=UC Davis Small Farm Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313210109/http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/pubs/SFNews/archive/95071.htm|archive-date=March 13, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the &quot;skin&quot; covering each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of &quot;skin&quot; over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in [[Korea]] immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amanda |url=http://www.food-links.com/countries/korea/food-terms-korea.php |title=Glossary of Foods and Food Terms in Korea |publisher=Food-links.com |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root cluster attached to the [[bulb|basal plate]] of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling [[olive oil]] (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and [[roast]] them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called [[black garlic (food)|black garlic]], is sweet and syrupy, and is exported to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.

Garlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as [[garlic bread]], [[garlic toast]], [[bruschetta]], [[Crostino|crostini]], and [[canapé]]. The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with [[onion]], [[tomato]], or [[ginger]].

Immature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as &quot;garlic spears&quot;, &quot;stems&quot;, or &quot;tops&quot;. Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus.&lt;ref name=scapes/&gt; Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.

Garlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic. If used as a substitute for fresh garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder is approximate to one clove of garlic.

Garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, [[cuisine of the Mediterranean|southern Europe]], and parts of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meredith, Ted.|title=The complete book of garlic : a guide for gardeners, growers, and serious cooks|date=2008|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-883-9|location=Portland|pages=17–22|oclc=172521653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American seasonings, particularly, use garlic in [[sofrito]]s and [[mofongo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Root|first1=Zella Palmer Cuadra; photographs by Natalie|title=New Orleans con sabor Latino : the history and passion of Latino cooking|date=2013|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1-62103-984-6|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of [[vegetables]], meats, breads, and [[pasta]]. Garlic, along with [[fish sauce]], chopped fresh chilis, [[lime juice]], sugar, and water, is a basic essential item in [[nước chấm|dipping fish sauce]], a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in [[Indochina]]. In [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[chili oil]] with garlic is a popular [[dipping sauce]], especially for meat and seafood. [[Tuong ot toi Viet Nam]] (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.

In some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. [[Laba garlic]], prepared by soaking garlic in [[vinegar]], is a type of pickled garlic served with [[dumpling]]s in northern China to celebrate the [[Chinese New Year]].&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt;

Garlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In Levantine countries such as [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called [[Toum]] (تُوم; meaning &quot;garlic&quot; in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as [[shawarma]]. Garlic is also a key component in some [[hummus]] varieties, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.

Lightly [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]] garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews.

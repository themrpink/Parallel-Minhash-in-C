=== Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) ===
VQ has been used to quantize a feature representation layer in the discriminator of GANs. The feature quantization (FQ) technique performs implicit feature matching&lt;ref&gt;Feature Quantization Improves GAN Training https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02088&lt;/ref&gt;. It improves the GAN training, and yields an improved performance on a variety of popular GAN models: BigGAN for image generation, StyleGAN for face synthesis, and U-GAT-IT for unsupervised image-to-image translation.

Retrieved 9 April 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; his philosophical works include numerous commentaries on [[Aristotle]], for which he was known in the west as ''The Commentator'' and ''Father of rationalism''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=John|title=Andalucía : a cultural history|year=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-537610-4|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Rushd also served as a chief [[judge]] and a court physician for the [[Almohad Caliphate]]. 

He was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 1126 to a family of prominent judges—his grandfather was the chief judge of the city. In 1169 he was introduced to the caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]], who was impressed with his knowledge, became his patron and commissioned many of Averroes' commentaries. Averroes later served multiple terms as a judge in [[Seville]] and Córdoba. In 1182, he was appointed as court physician and the chief judge of Córdoba. After Abu Yusuf's death in 1184, he remained in royal favor until he fell into disgrace in 1195. He was targeted on various charges—likely for political reasons—and was exiled to nearby [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]]. He returned to royal favor shortly before his death on 11 December 1198.

Averroes was a strong proponent of [[Aristotelianism]]; he attempted to restore what he considered the original teachings of Aristotle and opposed the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] tendencies of earlier Muslim thinkers, such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. He also defended the pursuit of philosophy against criticism by [[Ashari]] theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]]. Averroes argued that philosophy was permissible in Islam and even compulsory among certain elites. He also argued scriptural text should be interpreted allegorically if it appeared to contradict conclusions reached by reason and philosophy. In Islamic jurisprudence, he wrote the ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid'' on the differences between [[Madhhab|Islamic schools of law]] and the principles that caused their differences. In medicine, he proposed a new theory of stroke, described the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease for the first time, and might have been the first to identify the retina as the part of the eye responsible for sensing light. His medical book ''Al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb,'' translated into Latin and known as the ''[[Colliget]],'' became a textbook in Europe for centuries.

His legacy in the Islamic world was modest for geographical and intellectual reasons. In the west, Averroes was known for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, many of which were translated into Latin and Hebrew. The translations of his work reawakened western European interest in Aristotle and Greek thinkers, an area of study that had been widely abandoned after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. His thoughts generated controversies in Latin [[Christendom]] and triggered a philosophical movement called [[Averroism]] based on his writings. His [[unity of the intellect]] thesis, proposing that all humans share the same intellect, became one of the most well-known and controversial Averroist doctrines in the west. His works were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1270 and 1277. Although weakened by condemnations and sustained critique from [[Thomas Aquinas]], Latin Averroism continued to attract followers up to the sixteenth century.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rushd was born on 14 April 1126 (520 [[Hijri calendar|AH]]{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}}) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/10/day-1198-islamic-philosopher-averroes-dies-marrakech/|title=On this day in 1198: the Islamic philosopher Averroës dies in Marrakech|date=2017-12-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2020-04-12|url-status=live|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|author-link=Dominic Selwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}} His family was well known in the city for their public service, especially in the legal and religious fields.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}} His grandfather Abu al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was the chief judge (''[[qadi]]'') of Córdoba and the imam of the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] under the [[Almoravid]]s.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}} His father Abu al-Qasim Ahmad was not as celebrated as his grandfather, but was also chief judge until the Almoravids were replaced by the [[Almohad]]s in 1146.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}

According to his traditional biographers, Averroes' education was &quot;excellent&quot;,{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}} beginning with studies in [[hadith]] (traditions of Prophet [[Muhammad]]), ''fiqh'' ([[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]]), medicine and theology. He learned [[Maliki jurisprudence]] under al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad ibn Rizq and hadith with Ibn Bashkuwal, a student of his grandfather.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} His father also taught him about jurisprudence, including on [[Imam Malik]]'s ''magnum opus'' the ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]'', which Averroes went on to memorize.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}}{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} He studied medicine under Abu Jafar Jarim al-Tajail, who probably taught him philosophy too.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He also knew the works of the philosopher [[Ibn Bajjah]] (also known as Avempace), and might have known him personally or been tutored by him.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} He joined a regular meeting of philosophers, physicians and poets in [[Seville]] which was attended by philosophers [[Ibn Tufayl]] and [[Ibn Zuhr]] as well as the future caliph [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur|Abu Yusuf Yaqub]].{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} He also studied the ''[[kalam]]'' theology of the [[Ashari]] school, which he criticized later in life.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} His 13th century biographer [[Ibn al-Abbar]] said he was more interested in the study of law and [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|its principles]] (''usul'') than that of hadith and he was especially competent in the field of ''[[Glossary of Islam#K|khilaf]]'' (disputes and controversies in the Islamic jurisprudence).{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Ibn al-Abbar also mentioned his interests in &quot;the sciences of the ancients&quot;, probably in reference to Greek philosophy and sciences.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}

=== Career ===
[[File:Almohad Expansion.png|thumb|alt=Map of North Africa and Spain, with several shades to mark territories|Averroes served various official positions in the [[Almohad Caliphate]], whose territories are depicted in this map.]]
[[File:The Disgrace of Averroes - Vies Des Savants Illustrés.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a man being dismissed at court|For a brief period starting from 1195, Averroes was banished by Caliph [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur]], likely for political reasons.]]

By 1153 Averroes was in [[Marrakesh]] (Morocco), the capital of the Almohad Caliphate, to perform astronomical observations and to support the Almohad project of building new colleges.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He was hoping to find physical laws of astronomical movements instead of only the mathematical laws known at the time but this research was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} During his stay in Marrakesh he likely met Ibn Tufayl, a renowned philosopher and the author of ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' who was also the court physician in Marrakesh.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} Averroes and ibn Tufayl became friends despite the differences in their philosophies.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}}

In 1169 Ibn Tufayl introduced Averroes to the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} In a famous account reported by historian [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] the caliph asked Averroes whether the heavens had existed since eternity or had a beginning.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Knowing this question was controversial and worried a wrong answer could put him in danger, Averroes did not answer.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} The caliph then elaborated the views of Plato, Aristotle and Muslim philosophers on the topic and discussed them with Ibn Tufayl.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} This display of knowledge put Averroes at ease; Averroes then explained his own views on the subject, which impressed the caliph.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Averroes was similarly impressed by Abu Yaqub and later said the caliph had &quot;a profuseness of learning I did not suspect&quot;.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

After their introduction, Averroes remained in Abu Yaqub's favor until the caliph's death in 1184.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} When the caliph complained to Ibn Tufayl about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's work, Ibn Tufayl recommended to the caliph that Averroes work on explaining it.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} This was the beginning of Averroes' massive commentaries on Aristotle;{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} his first works on the subject were written in 1169.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

In the same year, Averroes was appointed ''qadi'' (judge) in Seville.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}} In 1171 he became ''qadi'' in his hometown of Córdoba.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}} As ''qadi'' he would decide cases and give ''[[fatwa]]''s (legal opinions) based on the [[Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}} The rate of his writing increased during this time despite other obligations and his travels within the Almohad empire.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He also took the opportunity from his travels to conduct astronomical researches.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} Many of his works produced between 1169 and 1179 were dated in Seville rather than Córdoba.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} In 1179 he was again appointed ''qadi'' in Seville.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}} In 1182 he succeeded his friend Ibn Tufayl as court physician and later the same year he was appointed the chief ''qadi'' of Córdoba, a prestigious office that had once been held by his grandfather.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}}

In 1184 Caliph Abu Yaqub died and was succeeded by Abu Yusuf Yaqub.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Initially, Averroes remained in royal favor but in 1195 his fortune reversed.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} Various charges were made against him and he was tried by a tribunal in Córdoba.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} The tribunal condemned his teachings, ordered the burning of his works and banished Averroes to nearby [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]].{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Early biographers' reasons for this fall from grace include a possible insult to the caliph in his writings{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} but modern scholars attribute it to political reasons. The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' said the caliph distanced himself from Averroes to gain support from more orthodox ''ulema'', who opposed Averroes and whose support al-Mansur needed for his war against Christian kingdoms.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Historian of Islamic philosophy [[Majid Fakhry]] also wrote that public pressure from traditional Maliki jurists who were opposed to Averroes played a role.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

After a few years, Averroes returned to court in Marrakesh and was again in the caliph's favor.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He died shortly afterwards, on 11 December 1198 (9 Safar 595 in the Islamic calendar).{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He was initially buried in North Africa but his body was later moved to Córdoba for another funeral, at which future Sufi mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240) was present.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}

Averroes was a prolific writer and his works, according to Fakhry, &quot;covered a greater variety of subjects&quot; than those of any of his predecessors in the East, including philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence or legal theory, and linguistics.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} Most of his writings were commentaries on or paraphrasings of the works of Aristotle that—especially the long ones—often contain his original thoughts.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} According to French author [[Ernest Renan]], Averroes wrote at least 67 original works, including 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle's works and his commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.{{sfn|Ahmad|1994}} Many of Averroes' works in Arabic did not survive, but their translations into Hebrew or Latin did.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|pp=180–181}} For example, of his long commentaries on Aristotle, only &quot;a tiny handful of Arabic manuscript remains&quot;.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}

=== Commentaries on Aristotle ===
[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a mean teaching another man, with Arabic script under the drawing|An Arabic illustration of Aristotle teaching a student, {{circa|1220}}. Aristotle's works are the subject of extensive commentaries by Averroes.]]

Averroes wrote commentaries on nearly all of Aristotle's surviving works.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} The only exception is ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', which he did not have access to, so he wrote commentaries on Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} He classified his commentaries into three categories that modern scholars have named ''short'', ''middle'' and ''long'' commentaries.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} Most of the short commentaries (''jami'') were written early in his career and contain summaries of Aristotlean doctrines.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} The middle commentaries (''talkhis'') contain paraphrases that clarify and simplify Aristotle's original text.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} The middle commentaries were probably written in response to his patron caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf's complaints about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's original texts and to help others in a similar position.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} The long commentaries (''tafsir'' or ''sharh''), or line-by-line commentaries, include the complete text of the original works  with a detailed analysis of each line.{{sfn|McGinnis|Reisman|2007|p=295}} The long commentaries are very detailed and contain a high degree of original thought,{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} and were unlikely to be intended for a general audience.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} Only five of Aristotle's works had all three types of commentaries: ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', and ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}}

=== Stand alone philosophical works ===
Averroes also wrote stand alone philosophical treatises, including ''On the Intellect'', ''On the Syllogism'', ''On Conjunction with the Active Intellect'', ''On Time'', ''On the Heavenly Sphere'' and ''On the Motion of the Sphere''. He also wrote several [[polemic]]s: ''Essay on [[al-Farabi]]'s Approach to Logic, as Compared to that of Aristotle'', ''Metaphysical Questions Dealt with in the [[Book of Healing]] by Ibn Sina'', and ''Rebuttal of Ibn Sina's Classification of Existing Entities''.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}}

=== Islamic theology ===
Scholarly sources, including Fakhry and the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', have named three works as Averroes' key writings in this area. ''[[On the Harmony of Religions and Philosophy|Fasl al-Maqal]]'' (&quot;The Decisive Treatise&quot;) is an 1178 treatise that argues for the compatibility of Islam and philosophy.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=911–912}} ''Al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adillah'' (&quot;Exposition of the Methods of Proof&quot;), written in 1179, criticizes the theologies of the Asharites,{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=913–914}} and lays out Averroes' argument for proving the existence of God, as well as his thoughts on God's attributes and actions.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=914}} The 1180 ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence|Tahafut al-Tahafut]]'' (&quot;Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;) is a rebuttal of [[al-Ghazali]]'s (d. 1111) landmark criticism of philosophy ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''. It combines ideas in his commentaries and stand alone works, and uses them to respond to al-Ghazali.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=915}} The work also criticizes Avicenna and his [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonist]] tendencies, sometimes agreeing with al-Ghazali's critique against him.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=915}}

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Avenzohar, &quot;Colliget Averroys ...&quot;, 1530 Wellcome L0026358.jpg|thumb|alt=A title page of a Latin book &quot;Colliget Aver.&quot;|Title page from a Latin edition of ''Colliget'', Averroes' main work in medicine]]
Averroes, who served as the royal physician at the Almohad court, wrote a number of medical treatises. The most famous was ''al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb'' (&quot;The General Principles of Medicine&quot;, Latinized in the west as the ''Colliget''), written around 1162, before his appointment at court.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}} The title of this book is the opposite of ''al-Juz'iyyat fi al-Tibb'' (&quot;The Specificities of Medicine&quot;), written by his friend Ibn Zuhr, and the two collaborated intending that their works complement each other.{{sfn|Arnaldez|2000|pp=28–29}} The Latin translation of the ''Colliget'' became a medical textbook in Europe for centuries.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}} His other surviving titles include ''On Treacle'', ''The Differences in Temperament'', and ''Medicinal Herbs''.{{sfn|Arnaldez|2000|p=28}} He also wrote summaries of the works of Greek physician [[Galen]] (died {{circa|210}}) and a commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s ''Urjuzah fi al-Tibb'' (&quot;Poem on Medicine&quot;).{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}}

=== Jurisprudence and law ===
Averroes served multiple tenures as judge and produced multiple works in the fields of Islamic jurisprudence or legal theory. The only book that survives today is ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid'' (&quot;Primer of the Discretionary Scholar&quot;).{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=xvi}} In this work he explains the differences of opinion (''[[ikhtilaf]]'') between the Sunni ''[[madhhab|madhhabs]]'' (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) both in practice and in their underlying juristic principles, as well as the reason why they are inevitable.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=188}} Despite his status as a [[Maliki]] judge, the book also discusses the opinion of other schools, including liberal and conservative ones.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=xvi}} Other than this surviving text, bibliographical information shows he wrote a summary of Al-Ghazali's ''[[On Legal Theory of Muslim Jurisprudence]]'' (''Al-Mustasfa'') and tracts on [[Qurbani|sacrifices]] and land tax.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=115}}

== Philosophical ideas ==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}
=== Aristotelianism in the Islamic philosophical tradition ===
In his philosophical writings, Averroes attempted to return to [[Aristotelianism]], which according to him had been distorted by the Neoplatonist tendencies of Muslim philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=5}}{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=27}} He rejected al-Farabi's attempt to merge the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, pointing out the differences between the two, such as Aristotle's rejection of Plato's [[Theory of forms|theory of ideas]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=6}} He also criticized Al-Farabi's works on logic for misinterpreting its Aristotelian source.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=6–7}} He wrote an extensive critique of Avicenna, who was the standard-bearer of Islamic Neoplatonism in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=7}} He argued that Avicenna's theory of [[Emanationism|emanation]] had many fallacies and was not found in the works of Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=7}} Averroes disagreed with Avicenna's view that existence is merely an [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] added to essence, arguing the reverse; something exists ''per se'' and essence can only be found by subsequent abstraction.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=8–9}} He also rejected [[Avicenna's modality]] and [[Proof of the Truthful|Avicenna's argument]] to prove the existence of God as the Necessary Existent.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=9}}

=== Relation between religion and philosophy ===

During Averroes' lifetime, philosophy came under attack from the [[Sunni]] Islam tradition, especially from theological schools like the [[Traditionalist theology (Islam)|traditionalist (Hanbalite)]] and the [[Ashari theology|Ashari]] schools.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}} In particular, the Ashari scholar [[al-Ghazali]] (1058&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;1111) wrote ''The Incoherence of the Philosophers'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa''), a scathing and influential critique of the Neoplatonic philosophical tradition in the Islamic world and against the works of Avicenna in particular.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=paragraph 2}} Among others, Al-Ghazali charged philosophers with non-belief in Islam and sought to disprove the teaching of the philosophers using logical arguments.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}}{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=55}}

In ''Decisive Treatise'', Averroes argues that philosophy—which for him represented conclusions reached using reason and careful method—cannot contradict revelations in Islam because they are just two different methods of reaching the truth, and &quot;truth cannot contradict truth&quot;.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=184}} When conclusions reached by philosophy appear to contradict the text of the revelation, then according to Averroes, revelation must be subjected to interpretation or allegorical understanding to remove the contradiction.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}} This interpretation must be done by those &quot;rooted in knowledge&quot;{{mdash}}a phrase taken from the Quran, 3:7, which for Averroes refers to philosophers who during his lifetime had access to the &quot;highest methods of knowledge&quot;.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=184}} He also argues that the Quran calls for Muslims to study philosophy because the study and reflection of nature would increase a person's knowledge of &quot;the Artisan&quot; (God).{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} He quotes Quranic passages calling on Muslims to reflect on nature and uses them to render a ''fatwa'' (legal opinion) that philosophy is allowed for Muslims and is probably an obligation, at least among those who have the talent for it.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=182}}

Averroes also distinguishes between three modes of discourse: the [[rhetoric]]al (based on persuasion) accessible to the common masses; the [[dialectic]]al (based on debate) and often employed by theologians and the ''[[ulama]]'' (scholars); and the demonstrative (based on logical deduction).{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}}{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} According to Averroes, the Quran uses the rhetorical method of inviting people to the truth, which allows it to reach the common masses with its persuasiveness,{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=183}} whereas philosophy uses the demonstrative methods that were only available to the learned but provided the best possible understanding and knowledge.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=183}}

Averroes also tries to deflect Al-Ghazali's criticisms of philosophy by saying that many of them apply only to the philosophy of Avicenna and not to that of Aristotle, which Averroes argues to be the true philosophy from which Avicenna has deviated.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}}

=== Nature of God ===
==== Existence ====
[[File:Beauty of Curug Cikaso (cikaso waterfall).jpg|thumb|alt=A waterfall in a rainforest|To Averroes, the world—including the sun, the moon, the rivers, the seas, and the location of humans—seems to be tuned to support human life and indicates the existence of a creator.]]
Averroes lays out his views on the existence and nature of God in the treatise ''The Exposition of the Methods of Proof''.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=74}} He examines and critiques the doctrines of four sects of Islam: the [[Asharites]], the [[Mutazilites]], the [[Sufis]] and those he calls the &quot;literalists&quot; (''al-hashwiyah'').{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=74}} Among other things, he examines their proofs of God's existence and critiques each one.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} Averroes argues that there are two arguments for God's existence that he deems logically sound and in accordance to the Quran; the arguments from &quot;providence&quot; and &quot;from invention&quot;.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} The providence argument considers that the world and the universe seem [[Fine-tuned universe|finely tuned to support human life]]. Averroes cited the sun, the moon, the rivers, the seas and the location of humans on the earth.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=77}} According to him, this suggests a creator who created them for the welfare of mankind.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} The argument from invention contends that worldly entities such as animals and plants appear to have been invented. Therefore, Averroes argues that a designer was behind the creation and that is God.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} Averroes's two arguments are [[Teleological argument|teleological]] in nature and not [[cosmological argument|cosmological]] like the arguments of [[Aristotle]] and most contemporaneous Muslim kalam theologians.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=77–78}}

==== God's attributes ====
Averroes upholds the doctrine of divine unity (''[[tawhid]]'') and argues that God has seven [[God#Specific attributes|divine attributes]]: knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision and speech. He devotes the most attention to the attribute of knowledge and argues that divine knowledge differs from human knowledge because God knows the universe because God is its cause while humans only know the universe through its effects.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}

Averroes argues that the attribute of life can be inferred because it is the precondition of knowledge and also because God willed objects into being.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=79}} Power can be inferred by God's ability to bring creations into existence. Averroes also argues that knowledge and power inevitably give rise to speech. Regarding vision and speech, he says that because God created the world, he necessarily knows every part of it in the same way an artist understands his or her work intimately. Because two elements of the world are the visual and the auditory, God must necessarily possess the vision and speech.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}

=== Pre-eternity of the world ===
In the centuries preceding Averroes, there had been a debate between Muslim thinkers questioning whether the world was created at a specific moment in time or whether it has [[eternity of the universe|always existed]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=14}} Neo-Platonic philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna argued the world has always existed.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}}  This view was criticized by theologians and philosophers of the Ashari kalam tradition; in particular, al-Ghazali wrote an extensive refutation of the pre-eternity doctrine in his ''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' and accused the Neo-Platonic philosophers of unbelief (''[[kufr]]'').{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}}

Averroes responded to Al-Ghazali in his ''[[Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''. First, he argued that the differences between the two positions were not vast enough to warrant the charge of unbelief.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}} He also said the pre-eternity doctrine did not necessarily contradict the Quran and cited verses that mention pre-existing &quot;throne&quot; and &quot;water&quot; in passages related to creation.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Hillier  |loc=Origin of the World}} Averroes argued that a careful reading of the Quran implied only the &quot;form&quot; of the universe was created in time but that its existence has been eternal.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=19}} Averroes further criticized the ''kalam'' theologians for using their own interpretations of scripture to answer questions that should have been left to philosophers.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=19–20}}

=== Politics ===
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An old man pointing to the sky|Averroes describes his political philosophy in his commentary of Plato's (''pictured'') ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.]]
Averroes states his political philosophy in his commentary of Plato's ''Republic''. He combines his ideas with Plato's and with Islamic tradition; he considers the ideal state to be one based on the Islamic law (''[[shariah]]'').{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}  His interpretation of Plato's [[philosopher-king]] followed that of Al-Farabi, which equates the philosopher-king with the [[imam]], [[caliph]] and lawgiver of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=111}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}} Averroes' description of the characteristics of a philosopher-king are similar to those given by Al-Farabi; they include love of knowledge, good memory, love of learning, love of truth, dislike for sensual pleasures, dislike for amassing wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence and the ability to &quot;light quickly on the [[middle term]]&quot;.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=111}} Averroes writes that if philosophers cannot rule—as was the case in the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] empires around his lifetime—philosophers must still try to influence the rulers towards implementing the ideal state.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}

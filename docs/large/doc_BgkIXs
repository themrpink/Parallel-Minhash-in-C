{{quote|In ''Terre des Hommes'', his haunting book, so filled with dreams and hopes for the future, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry writes of how deeply moved he was when, flying for the first time by night alone over Argentina, he happened to notice a few flickering lights scattered below him across an almost empty plain. They &quot;twinkled here and there, alone like stars.{{nbsp}}...&quot; In truth, being made aware of our own solitude can give us insight into the solitude of others. It can even cause us to gravitate towards one another as if to lessen our distress.  Without this inevitable solitude, would there be any fusion at all, any tenderness between human beings.

Moved as he was by a heightened awareness of the solitude of all creation and by the human need for solidarity, Saint-Exupéry found a phrase to express his anguish and his hope that was as simple as it was rich in meaning; and because that phrase was chosen many years later to be the governing idea of Expo 67, a group of people from all walks of life was invited by the Corporation to reflect upon it and to see how it could be given tangible form.|Gabrielle Roy&lt;ref&gt;Roy (1967), pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Construction begins===
Construction started on August 13, 1963, with an elaborate ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges anchored in the St. Lawrence River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette Construction Begins&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% was coming from the [[Montreal Metro]]'s excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, pp. 260,262&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) to reduce the amount of fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the [[artificial island]] of [[Notre Dame Island|Île Notre-Dame]] and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the [[Cité du Havre]]. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.263&quot; /&gt; This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the [[critical path method]] (CPM).&lt;ref name=&quot;cpm&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Building and enlarging the islands, along with the new [[Concorde Bridge]] built to connect them with the site-specific mass transit system known as the [[Montreal Expo Express]], plus a boat pier, cost more than the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] project did only five years earlier: this was even before any buildings or infrastructure were constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.263&quot; /&gt; With the initial phase of construction completed, it is easy to see why the budget for the exhibition was going to be larger than anyone expected. In the fall of 1963, Expo's general manager, Andrew Kniewasser, presented the master plan and the preliminary budget of $167 million for construction: it would balloon to over $439 million by 1967. The plan and budget narrowly passed a vote in Pearson's federal cabinet, passing by one vote, and then it was officially submitted on December 23, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===
The [[:File:Expo 67 logo.svg|logo]] was designed by Montreal artist Julien Hébert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Julien Hebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic unit of the logo is an ancient symbol of man.  Two of the symbols (pictograms of &quot;man&quot;) are linked as to represent friendship. The icon was repeated in a circular arrangement to represent &quot;friendship around the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidebook&quot;&gt;Expo 67 Guidebook, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The logotype is lower-case [[Optima]] font. It did not enjoy unanimous support from federal politicians, as some of them tried to kill it with a motion in the [[House of Commons of Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Julien Hebert&quot; /&gt;

===Theme songs===
The official Expo 67 theme song was composed by [[Stéphane Venne]] and was titled: &quot;Hey Friend, Say Friend/Un Jour, Un Jour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Un Jour/ Hey Friend&quot;&gt;

The [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde amusement park]] was always intended to be a lasting legacy of the fair.  Most of its rides and booths were permanent.

===Problems===

Despite its successes, there were problems: [[Front de libération du Québec]] militants had threatened to disrupt the exhibition, but were inactive during this period. Vietnam war protesters picketed during the opening day, April 28. [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s visit became a focus of war protesters. Threats that the Cuba pavilion would be destroyed by anti-Castro forces were not carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot;&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]  in the [[Middle East]] flared up again in the [[Six-Day War]], which resulted in [[Kuwait]] pulling out of the fair in protest to the way Western nations dealt with the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt; The president of France, [[Charles De Gaulle]], caused an international incident on July 24 when he addressed thousands at Montreal City Hall by yelling out the now famous words ''&quot;Vive Montréal... Vive le Québec... [[Vive le Québec libre speech|Vive le Québec Libre!]]&quot;'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson's Response&quot; /&gt;

In September, the most serious problem turned out to be a 30-day transit strike. By the end of July, estimates predicted that Expo would exceed 60 million visitors, but the strike cut deeply into attendance and revenue figures, just as the fair was cruising to its conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt; Another major problem, beyond the control of Expo's management, was guest accommodation and lodging. Logexpo was created to direct visitors to accommodations in the Montreal area, which usually meant that visitors would stay at the homes of people they were unfamiliar with, rather than traditional hotels or motels. The Montreal populace opened their homes to thousands of guests. Unfortunately for some visitors, they were sometimes sent to less than respectable establishments where operators took full advantage of the tourist trade. Management of Logexpo was refused to Expo and was managed by a Quebec provincial authority. Still, Expo would get most of the blame for directing visitors to these establishments.  But overall, a visit to Expo from outside Montreal was still seen as a bargain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt;

===Expo ends===
[[File:Montréal Expo 67 Site Map.png|thumb|Site map of Expo 67, highlighting 20 of the 90 pavilions]]

Expo 67 closed on Sunday afternoon, October 29, 1967. The fair had been scheduled to close two days earlier, however a two-day extension granted by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) allowed it to continue over the weekend. On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (54,991,806&lt;ref name=&quot;expo-67.ca&quot;&gt;https://expo-67.ca/en/the-film/&lt;/ref&gt;) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIE&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Starting at 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Expo Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy officiated over the medal ceremony, in which participating nations and organizations received gold and silver medallions, and over the ceremony in which national flags were lowered in the reverse order to which they had been raised, with Canada's flag lowered first and [[Nigeria]]'s lowered last.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt; After Prime Minister Pearson doused the Expo flame, Governor General [[Roland Michener]] closed Expo at Place des Nations with the mournful spontaneous farewell: &quot;It is with great regret that I declare that the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 has come to an official end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt; All rides and the [[minirail]] were shut down by 3:50&amp;nbsp;p.m., and the Expo grounds closed at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., with the last [[Montreal Expo Express|Expo Express train]] leaving for ''Place d'Accueil'' at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt;  A fireworks display, that went on for an hour, was Expo's concluding event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackman&quot; /&gt;

Expo performed better financially than expected.  Expo was intended to have a deficit, shared between the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government.  Significantly better-than-expected attendance revenue reduced the debt to well below the original estimates.  The final financial statistics, in 1967 Canadian dollars, were: revenues of $221,239,872, costs of $431,904,683, and a deficit of $210,664,811.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIE&quot; /&gt;

Expo 67 featured 90 pavilions representing Man and His World themes, nations, corporations, and industries including the [[Biosphère|U.S. pavilion]], a [[geodesic dome]] designed by [[Buckminster Fuller]]. Expo 67 also featured the [[Habitat 67]] modular housing complex designed by architect [[Moshe Safdie]], which was later purchased by private individuals and is still occupied.

The most popular pavilion was the Soviet Union's exhibit. It attracted about 13 million visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ussr&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Man and His World (1968–1984)===
After 1967, the exposition struggled for several summer seasons as a standing collection of international pavilions known as &quot;Man and His World&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Expo Legacy&quot; /&gt; However, as attendance declined, the physical condition of the site deteriorated, and less and less of it was open to the public. After the 1971 season, the entire Notre Dame Island site closed and three years later completely rebuilt around the new [[Rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|rowing]] and [[Canoeing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|canoe sprint]] (then [[canoe racing|flatwater canoeing]]) [[Venues of the 1976 Summer Olympics|basin]] for Montreal's [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympic Basin&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space for the basin, the boathouses, the changing rooms and other buildings was obtained by demolishing many of the former pavilions and cutting in half the area taken by the artificial lake and the canals.

In 1976, a fire destroyed the acrylic outer skin of [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s dome, and the previous year the Ontario pavilion was lost due to a major fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biosphere&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last = Kelly  | first = Mark | url = http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/celebrations/expo-67-montreal-welcomes-the-world/a-pavilion-reborn.html | title = Expo 67's U.S. pavilion becomes the Biosphere | work= Prime Time News | date=  June 5, 1995 | publisher  = [[CBC News]] | access-date = April 26, 2012 | location   = Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the site falling into disrepair, and several pavilions left abandoned and vandalized, it began to resemble ruins of a futuristic city.

In 1980 the Notre Dame Island site was reopened (primarily for the [[Floralies Internationales de Montréal|Floralies]]) making both islands simultaneously accessible again, albeit only for a brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Expo Legacy&quot; /&gt; shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with the small number of pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Georges |last=Lamon |date=August 31, 1984 |title=Terre des Hommes, c'est fini! |url=https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/l/t31.0-8/1899575_10152698984043968_7099189167940062300_o.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108031953/https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/l/t31.0-8/1899575_10152698984043968_7099189167940062300_o.jpg |archive-date=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Park and surviving relics===
[[File:Biosphere montreal.JPG|thumb|200px|The former Expo 67 American Pavilion became the [[Montreal Biosphère]], an environmental museum on Saint Helen's Island.]]

After the Man and His World summer exhibitions were discontinued, with most pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on [[Saint Helen's Island]] and [[Notre Dame Island]] was incorporated into a municipal park run by the city of Montreal. The park, named Parc des Îles, opened in 1992 during Montreal's 350th anniversary&lt;ref name=&quot;parc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to [[Parc Jean-Drapeau]], after Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]], who had brought the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the ''Société du parc des Îles'' to the ''Société du parc Jean-Drapeau''.&lt;ref name=&quot;parc&quot; /&gt; Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton form its [[Buckminster Fuller]] dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the [[Montreal Biosphere]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Biosphere&quot; /&gt; and [[Habitat 67]], now a condominium residence.

Place des Nations, where the opening and closing ceremonies were held remains, however in an abandoned and deteriorating state. The Jamaican, Tunisian and partial remains of the Korean pavilion (roof only) also survive, as well as the CIBC banking centre. In Cite du Havre the Expo Theatre, Administration and Fine Arts buildings remain. Other remaining structures include sculptures, lampposts and landscaping.  The [[Montreal Metro]] subway station [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri-UQAM]] still has an original &quot;Man and His World&quot; welcome sign with logo above the pedestrian tunnel entrance to the [[Yellow Line (Montreal Metro)|Yellow Line]].

The Olympic basin is used by many local rowing clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympic Basin&quot; /&gt; A beach was built on the shores of the remaining artificial lake. There are many acres of parkland and cycle paths on both Saint Helen's Island and the western tip of Notre Dame Island. The site has been used for a number of events such as a BIE-sponsored international botanical festival, ''Les floralies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islands History&quot; /&gt; The young trees and shrubs planted for Expo 67 are now mature. The plants introduced during the botanical events have flourished also.

Another attraction on today's Notre Dame Island site is the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] race track that is used for the [[Canadian Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Islands History&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Czechoslovakian pavilion was designed to be disassembled and sold, attracting the interest of the province of Newfoundland, though its bid was not preferred by the Czechoslovakian government at first. On September 5, 1967, [[ČSA Flight 523|Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie Flight 523]] crashed during takeoff from [[Gander International Airport]], and many people were saved by the residents of Gander, which may have led to Newfoundland's purchase offer being accepted. It was assembled as the [[Arts and Culture Centre|Grand Falls Arts and Culture Centre]], now the Gordon Pinsent Centre for the Arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrandFalls&quot;&gt;{{cite web

One of the few Vaporettos (Italian for water bus) that shuttled visitors around the park on &quot;Expo Service No. 5&quot; survived. After it was decommissioned it ended up in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1971 where it gave harbour tours. It was later moved to Nova Scotia and then New Brunswick. It has subsequently been renovated and returned to Charlottetown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vaporetto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ride Solar |url=http://www.ridesolar.com |publisher=Parc Jean-Drapeau |access-date=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expo 67 was one of the most successful World Exhibitions, and is still regarded fondly by Canadians.&lt;ref name=&quot;40th anniversary&quot; /&gt; In Montreal, 1967 is often referred to as &quot;the last good year&quot; before economic decline, [[Quebec sovereignism]]  (seen as negative from a federalist viewpoint), deteriorating infrastructure and political apathy became common.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, Book Jacket and pp.358-364&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it has much in common with the 1964–65 [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. In 2007, a new group, [[Expo 17]], was looking to bring a smaller-scale — [[Bureau of International Expositions|BIE sanctioned]] — exposition to Montreal for Expo 67's 50th anniversary and Canada's [[sesquicentennial]] in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;expo17&quot;&gt;{{cite web

* Outdoors exhibitions and events were presented across [[downtown Montreal]]. From September 18 to 30, 2017, the central square of [[Place des Arts]] was the site of a multi-screen installation ''Expo 67 Live'', with images of Expo 67 projected onto exterior surfaces of arts complex, some as high as five storeys.

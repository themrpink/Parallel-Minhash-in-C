== Politics, literary reception and legacy ==
=== Politics ===
[[File:Vitoria -  Graffiti &amp; Murals 0392.JPG|thumb|right|Street art depicting Morrison in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Spain.]]
Morrison was not afraid to comment on American politics and race relations.

In writing about the 1998 [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]], she claimed that since [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]], [[Bill Clinton]] was being mistreated in the same way black people often are:
 
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |Years ago, in the middle of the Whitewater investigation, one heard the first murmurs: white skin notwithstanding, this is our first black President. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.''&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni (October 5, 1998). [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1998/10/05/1998_10_05_031_TNY_LIBRY_000016504 &quot;Talk of the Town: Comment&quot;]. ''The New Yorker''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The phrase &quot;our first Black president&quot; was adopted as a positive by Bill Clinton supporters. When the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] honored the former president at its dinner in Washington, D.C. on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]] (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton &quot;took so many initiatives he made us think for a while we had elected the first black president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%2FNation%2Farchive%2F200110%2FNAT20011001e.html |title=Congressional Black Caucus |access-date=May 24, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215132455/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%2FNation%2Farchive%2F200110%2FNAT20011001e.html |archive-date=December 15, 2007 }} ''[[CNSNews.com]], October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2008 Democratic Primary campaign]], Morrison stated to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine: &quot;People misunderstood that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Andrea.[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1738303,00.html &quot;10 Questions for Toni Morrison&quot;], ''Time'', May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary contest for the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential race]], Morrison endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] over Senator [[Hillary Clinton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/29/headlines |title=Headlines for January 29, 2008 – Sen.

She said, &quot;I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brockes&quot; /&gt;

In April 2015, speaking of the deaths of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], [[Death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] and [[Shooting of Walter Scott|Walter Scott]]&amp;nbsp;— three unarmed black men killed by white police officers&amp;nbsp;— Morrison said: &quot;People keep saying, 'We need to have a conversation about race.' This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a black woman. Then when you ask me, 'Is it over?', I will say yes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 19, 2015 |first=Gaby |last=Wood |author-link=Gaby Wood|title=Toni Morrison interview: on racism, her new novel and Marlon Brando |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/11532385/Toni-Morrison-interview-on-racism-her-new-novel-and-Marlon-Brando.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump]] as President of the United States, Morrison wrote an essay, &quot;Mourning for Whiteness,&quot; published in the November 21, 2016 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. In it she argues that white Americans are so afraid of losing privileges afforded them by their race that white voters elected Trump, whom she described as being &quot;endorsed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]&quot;, in order to keep the idea of [[white supremacy]] alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/21/aftermath-sixteen-writers-on-trumps-america#anchor-morrison|title=Mourning For Whiteness|last=Morrison|first=Toni|date=November 21, 2016|website=The New Yorker|access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/22/toni-morrison-decline-of-white-superiority-scared-/|title=Toni Morrison: Decline of 'white superiority' scared Americans into electing Donald Trump|last=Chasmar |first=Jessica |work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to feminism ===
Although her novels typically concentrate on black women, Morrison did not identify her works as [[Feminism|feminist]]. When asked in a 1998 interview, &quot;Why distance oneself from feminism?&quot; she replied: &quot;In order to be as free as I possibly can, in my own imagination, I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book&amp;nbsp;— leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Jaffrey|first=Zia|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/02/02/cov_si_02int/|title=The Salon Interview - Toni Morrison|date=February 3, 1998|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=December 20, 2014}}&lt;!-- {{Quote|'''Why distance oneself from feminism?''' In order to be as free as I possibly can, in my own imagination, I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book – leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity. I detest and loathe [those categories]. I think it's off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't think it should be substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to state that she thought it &quot;off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't think it should be substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot; /&gt;

In 2012, she responded to a question about the difference between black and white feminists in the 1970s. &quot;Womanists is what black feminists used to call themselves,&quot; she explained. &quot;They were not the same thing. And also the relationship with men. Historically, black women have always sheltered their men because they were out there, and they were the ones that were most likely to be killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

W. S. Kottiswari writes in ''Postmodern Feminist Writers'' (2008) that Morrison exemplifies characteristics of &quot;[[postmodern feminism]]&quot; by &quot;altering Euro-American dichotomies by rewriting a history written by mainstream historians&quot; and by her usage of shifting narration in ''Beloved'' and ''Paradise''. Kottiswari states: &quot;Instead of western logocentric abstractions, Morrison prefers the powerful vivid language of women of color&amp;nbsp;... She is essentially postmodern since her approach to myth and folklore is re-visionist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVStc4m8euEC&amp;q=toni+morrison+postmodern+feminist&amp;pg=PA48|title=Postmodern Feminist Writers|last=Kottiswara|first=W.

[http://www.nationalBook.org/nba1983.html &quot;National Book Awards – 1983&quot;]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-01-26. &lt;br&gt;(With essays by Anna Clark and Tarayi Jones from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=paperback&gt;
Walker won the 1983 [[National Book Award for Fiction#1980 to 1989|award for hardcover Fiction]]. &lt;br&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1983 Fiction.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adapted into a [[The Color Purple (film)|film]] and [[The Color Purple (musical)|musical]] of the same name.

Taking place mostly in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the story focuses on the life of African-American women in the [[Southern United States]] in the 1930s, addressing numerous issues including their exceedingly low position in American social culture. The novel has been the frequent target of censors and appears on the [[American Library Association]] list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009 at number seventeen because of the sometimes explicit content, particularly in terms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/2000_2009|title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102105805/http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/top-100-bannedchallenged-books-2000-2009|archive-date=2019-11-02|accessdate=22 Apr 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Walker – biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alice-walker-9521939|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the book was listed on the BBC's [[The Big Read]] poll of the UK's &quot;best-loved novels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top200.shtml &quot;BBC – The Big Read&quot;].

==Plot==
Celie is a poor, uneducated 14-year-old girl living in the [[Southern United States]] in the early 1900s. She writes letters to God because the man she thought was her father, Alphonso, beats and rapes her. Alphonso has already impregnated Celie once, a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of a boy named Adam, whom Alphonso also abducts, and Celie thinks he killed him. Celie then has a second child,  Celie's ailing mother dies after cursing Celie on her deathbed. 
The second child was a girl she named Olivia, but Alphonso took the baby away shortly after her birth. 

Celie and her younger sister, 12-year-old Nettie, learn that a man identified only as Mister wants to marry Nettie. Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, instead arranging for Mister to marry Celie. Mister, a widower needing someone to care for his children and keep his house, eventually accepts the offer. Mister physically, sexually, and verbally abuses Celie, and all his children treat her badly as well. 

Shortly thereafter, Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie's house, where Mister makes sexual advances toward her. Celie then advises Nettie to seek assistance from a well-dressed black woman that she saw in the general store a while back; the woman has unknowingly adopted Olivia and was the only black woman that Celie had ever seen with money of her own. Nettie is forced to leave after promising to write. Celie, however, never receives any letters and concludes that her sister is dead.

Time passes and Harpo, Mister's son, falls in love with an assertive girl named Sofia, who becomes pregnant with Harpo's baby and, despite initial resistance from Mister, Harpo marries Sofia. Harpo and Sofia have five more children in short order.

Celie is amazed by Sofia's defiant refusal to submit to Harpo's attempts to control her. As Harpo is kinder and gentler than his father, Celie advises him not to try to dominate Sofia. Harpo temporarily follows Celie's advice but falls back under Mister's sway. Celie, momentarily jealous of Harpo's genuine love of Sofia, then advises Harpo to beat her. Sofia fights back, however, and confronts Celie. A guilty Celie apologizes and confides in Sofia about all the abuse she suffers at Mister's hands. She also begins to consider Sofia's advice about defending herself against further abuse from Mister.

Shug Avery, a jazz and blues singer and Mister's long-time mistress, falls ill, and Mister takes her into his house. Celie, who has been fascinated by photos of Shug she found in Mister's belongings, is thrilled to have her there. Mister's father expresses disapproval of the arrangement, reminding Mister that Shug has three out-of-wedlock children, though Mister indirectly implies to him that he is those children's father. Mister's father then leaves in disgust. While Shug is initially rude to Celie, who has taken charge of nursing her, the two women become friends, and Celie soon finds herself infatuated with Shug.

Frustrated by Harpo's domineering behavior, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where a fully recovered Shug performs nightly. Shug decides to stay when she learns that Mister beats Celie when she is away. Shug and Celie grow closer.

Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets into a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak, knocking Squeak's teeth out. In town one day, while Sofia is enjoying a day out with her new boyfriend, a prizefighter, and their respective children, she gets into a physical fight with the mayor after his wife, Miss Millie, insults Sofia and her children. The police arrive and brutally beat Sofia, leaving her with a cracked skull, broken ribs, her face rendered nearly unrecognizable, and blind in one eye. She is subsequently sentenced to 12 years in jail.

Squeak, a mixed-race woman and Sheriff Hodges' illegitimate niece, attempts to blackmail the sheriff into releasing Sofia, resulting in her being raped by her uncle. Squeak cares for Sofia's children while she is incarcerated, and the two women develop a friendship. Sofia is eventually released and begins working for Miss Millie, which she detests.

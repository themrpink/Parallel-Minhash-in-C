Primatologist [[Frans de Waal]] states bonobos are capable of [[altruism]], [[compassion]], [[empathy]], kindness, patience, and [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1997&quot;/&gt; and described &quot;bonobo society&quot; as a &quot;[[gynecocracy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Waal | first = Frans | title = The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates | publisher = W.

An analysis of female bonding among wild bonobos by Takeshi Furuichi stresses female sexuality and shows how female bonobos spend much more time in [[estrus]] than female chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 22038769| year = 2011| last1 = Furuichi| first1 = T| s2cid = 17830996| title = Female contributions to the peaceful nature of bonobo society| journal = Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 131–42| doi = 10.1002/evan.20308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some primatologists have argued that de Waal's data reflect only the behavior of captive bonobos, suggesting that wild bonobos show levels of aggression closer to what is found among chimpanzees. De Waal has responded that the contrast in temperament between bonobos and chimpanzees observed in captivity is meaningful, because it controls for the influence of environment. The two species behave quite differently even if kept under identical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/204757| title = The Social Behavior of Chimpanzees and Bonobos: Empirical Evidence and Shifting Assumptions| journal = Current Anthropology| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 399–420| year = 1998| last1 = Stanford | first1 = C.

===Social behavior===
[[File:6_bonobos_WHCalvin_IMG_1341.jpg|thumb|Bonobos are very social.]]
[[File:A Bonobo at the San Diego Zoo &quot;fishing&quot; for termites.jpg|thumb|left|Bonobo searching for termites]]
Bonobos are unique among nonhuman apes for their distinct social organisation which, like many lemur species, is largely matriarchal. At the top of the hierarchy is a coalition of high-ranking females who dominate the majority of males, and make the core of the group. While there is a clearly defined alpha male who leads the group, protects it from threats, and decides where they travel to and where they feed, he needs the loyalty of the resident females to retain this position, and these alphas typically have a mutual, co-dominant relationship with the highest-ranking females. Only the alpha male can eat with the high-ranking females while the other males wait at the periphery of the group. Females often have the final say on where the group travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Raffaele|first=Paul|title=The Smart and Swinging Bonobo|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-smart-and-swinging-bonobo-134784867/|access-date=2020-09-07|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male derives his status from the status of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;White F. (1996) &quot;Comparative socio-ecology of ''Pan paniscus''&quot;, pp. 29–41 in: McGrew WC, Marchant LF, Nishida T (eds.) ''Great ape societies''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ Press, {{ISBN|0521555361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother–son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, and although the son of a high ranking female may outrank a lower female, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;&gt;Henry Nicholls. 17 March 2016. [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160317-do-bonobos-really-spend-all-their-time-having-sex Do bonobos really spend all their time having sex?]. ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

A mother bonobo will also support her sons in conflicts with other males and help them secure better ties with other females, enhancing her chance of gaining grandchildren from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=High social status, maternal support play important role in mating success of male bonobos|url=https://phys.org/news/2010-09-high-social-status-maternal-important.html|access-date=2020-09-28|website=phys.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the promiscuous mating behavior of female bonobos, a male cannot be sure which offspring are his. As a result, the entirety of parental care in bonobos is assumed by the mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthon Lang KA. (December 2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160412150955/http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/bonobo/behav Primate Factsheets: Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'') behavior]. University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt; However, bonobos are not as promiscuous as chimpanzees and slightly polygamous tendencies occur, with high-ranking males enjoying greater reproductive success than low-ranking males. Unlike chimpanzees, where any male can coerce a female into mating with him, female bonobos enjoy greater sexual preferences, an advantage of female-female bonding, and actively seek out higher-ranking males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=16 The Absence of Sexual Coercion in Bonobos|date=2009-12-31|work=Sexual Coercion in Primates and Humans|pages=410–423|publisher=Harvard University Press|doi=10.4159/9780674054349-016|isbn=978-0-674-05434-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonobo [[Group size measures|party size]] tends to vary because the groups exhibit a [[Fission-fusion society|fission–fusion pattern]]. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then will come back together to sleep. They sleep in nests that they construct in trees.

In captive settings, females exhibit extreme food-based aggression towards males, and forge coalitions against them to monopolize specific food items, often going as far as to mutilate any males who fail to heed their warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nicholls|first=Henry|title=Do bonobos really spend all their time having sex?|url=https://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160317-do-bonobos-really-spend-all-their-time-having-sex|access-date=2020-08-08|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wild settings, however, female bonobos are not above begging males for food if they had gotten it first, suggesting sex-based hierarchy roles are less rigid than in captive colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Apr 2018|first=Nicola Jones / 5|date=2018-04-05|title=Bonobos Spied Sharing a Feast|url=https://www.sapiens.org/evolution/bonobos-meal-sharing/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=SAPIENS|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female bonobos are known to lead hunts on [[duiker]]s and successfully defend their bounty from marauding males in the wild. They are more tolerant of younger males pestering them yet exhibit heightened aggression towards older males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bonobos Eat and Share Meat at Rates Similar to Chimpanzees|url=https://leakeyfoundation.org/bonobos-eat-and-share-meat-at-rates-similar-to-chimpanzees/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=The Leakey Foundation|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociosexual behaviour====
{{see also|Animal sexual behaviour#Genital-genital rubbing|Homosexual behavior in animals#Bonobo}}
[[File:Bonobo sexual behavior 1.jpg|thumb|Bonobos mating, [[Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens]].]]
Sexual activity generally plays a major role in bonobo society, being used as what some scientists perceive as a [[greeting]], a means of forming social bonds, a means of [[conflict resolution]], and [[reconciliation (democratic process)#In animals|postconflict reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~jel/512/aggression-01.html Aggression topics]. [[University of New Hampshire]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot; /&gt; Bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in [[tongue kiss]]ing.&lt;ref name=Manson1997&gt;{{cite journal|author = Manson, J.H.|author2 = Perry, S. |author3=Parish, A.R.|year = 1997|title = Nonconceptive Sexual Behavior in Bonobos and Capuchins|journal = International Journal of Primatology|volume = 18|issue = 5|pages = 767–86 |doi = 10.1023/A:1026395829818|s2cid = 3032455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonobos and humans are the only primates to typically engage in face-to-face genital sex, although a pair of western gorillas has been photographed in this position.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Tuan C. (2008-02-13). [http://www.livescience.com/2298-gorillas-caught-human-act.html &quot;Gorillas Caught in Very Human Act&quot;]. ''Live Science''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonobos do not form [[monogamy|permanent monogamous sexual relationships]] with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual activity between mothers and their adult sons. When bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bonobo Sex and Society | last = de Waal | first = Frans B.

More often than the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital-rubbing behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males.&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot; /&gt; Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. This migration mixes the bonobo [[gene pool]]s, providing [[genetic diversity]]. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group.

Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) often occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together, but such behavior also occurs outside agonistic contexts: Kitamura (1989) observed rump–rump contacts between adult males following sexual solicitation behaviors similar to those between female bonobos prior to GG-rubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kitamura |first1=Koji |title=Genito-Genital Contacts in the Pygmy Chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) |journal=African Study Monographs |date=August 1989 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=49–67 |doi=10.14989/68052 |hdl=2433/68052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takayoshi Kano]] observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat.

Recent studies show that there are significant brain differences between bonobos and chimps.

Surbeck and Hohmann showed in 2008 that bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species.

Some, such as [[philosopher]] and [[bioethics|bioethicist]] [[Peter Singer]], argue that these results qualify them for &quot;[[Right to life|rights to survival and life]]&quot;—rights which humans theoretically accord to all [[person]]s (See [[great ape personhood]]). In the 1990s, Kanzi was taught to make and use  simple stone tools. This resulted from a study undertaken by researchers [[Kathy Schick]] and [[Nicholas Toth]], and later Gary Garufi. The researchers wanted to know if Kanzi possessed the cognitive and biomechanical abilities required to make and use stone tools. Though Kanzi was able to form flakes, he did not create them in same way as humans, who hold the core in one hand and knap it with the other, Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schick|first1=Kathy|last2=Toth|first2=Nicholas|last3=Garufi|first3=Gary|last4=Savage-Rumbaugh|first4=E.Sue|last5=Rumbaugh|first5=Duane|last6=Sevcik|first6=Rose|title=Continuing Investigations into the Stone Tool-making and Tool-using Capabilities of a Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'')|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|issue=7|pages=821–832|date=1999|doi=10.1006/jasc.1998.0350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other great apes and humans, third party affiliation toward the victim—the affinitive contact made toward the recipient of an aggression by a group member other than the aggressor—is present in bonobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palagi E| title = Reconciliation and consolation in captive bonobos (''Pan paniscus'') |year= 2004| journal = Am J Primatol| volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages= 15–30| pmid = 14752810 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.20000 | last2 = Paoli | last3 = Tarli}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palagi E|author2= Norscia I| title = Bonobos Protect and Console Friends and Kin |year= 2013| journal = PLOS ONE| volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages= e79290 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0079290|pmid= 24223924|bibcode= 2013PLoSO...879290P | pmc=3818457}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that both the affiliation spontaneously offered by a bystander to the victim and the affiliation requested by the victim (solicited affiliation) can reduce the probability of further aggression by group members on the victim (this fact supporting the ''Victim-Protection Hypothesis''). Yet, only spontaneous affiliation reduced victim anxiety—measured via self-scratching rates—thus suggesting not only that non-solicited affiliation has a consolatory function but also that the spontaneous gesture—more than the protection itself—works in calming the distressed subject. The authors hypothesize that the victim may perceive the motivational autonomy of the bystander, who does not require an invitation to provide post-conflict affinitive contact. Moreover, spontaneous—but not solicited—third party affiliation was affected by the bond between consoler and victim (this supporting the ''Consolation Hypothesis''). Importantly, spontaneous affiliation followed the empathic gradient described for humans, being mostly offered to kin, then friends, then acquaintances (these categories having been determined using affiliation rates between individuals). Hence, consolation in the bonobo may be an empathy-based phenomenon.

Instances in which non-human primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human infants and bonobos when they were tickled.&lt;ref name=discoverylaugh&gt;{{cite web|author=Beale, B. |year=2003|title=Where Did Laughter Come From?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/10/07/961420.htm|publisher=ABC Science Online|access-date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bonobos' laugh was at a higher [[audio frequency|frequency]], the laugh was found to follow a [[spectrogram|spectrographic]] pattern similar to that of human babies.&lt;ref name=discoverylaugh/&gt;

Ernst Schwarz's 1927 paper “''Le Chimpanzé de la Rive Gauche du Congo''”, announcing his discovery, has been read as an association between the Parisian [[Left Bank (Paris)|Left Bank]] and the left bank of the Congo River; the bohemian culture in Paris, and an unconventional ape in the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quammen|first=David|title=The Left Bank Ape|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bonobos/quammen-text|work=The New Age of Exploration, 2013|publisher=National Geographic|access-date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
The [[IUCN Red List]] classifies bonobos as an [[endangered species]], with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot; /&gt; Major threats to bonobo populations include [[habitat loss]] and hunting for [[bushmeat]], the latter activity having increased dramatically during the [[First Congo War|first]] and [[Second Congo War|second Congo wars]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] due to the presence of heavily armed militias even in remote &quot;protected&quot; areas such as [[Salonga National Park]]. This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.

As the bonobos' habitat is shared with people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts still rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John (2006-06-15). [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Parks-and-people-not-parks-vs-people-2533132.php ''Parks and people, not parks vs. people''], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; is salient in the [[Cuvette Centrale]] the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities have often been driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the [[African forest elephant]], and other species have been devastated by [[Poaching|poachers]] and the thriving bushmeat trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/Survey.php Bonobo and large mammal survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233748/http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/Survey.php |date=May 6, 2012}}. Zoological Society of Milwaukee.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.

During the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) were driven out of the bonobo habitat. In 2002, the [[Bonobo Conservation Initiative]] initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project supported by the Global Conservation Fund of [[Conservation International]] and in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities. The Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves, managed by local and indigenous people. This model, implemented mainly through DRC organizations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over {{convert|50,000|sqmi|km2}} of the bonobo habitat. According to Dr. Amy Parish, the Bonobo Peace Forest &quot;is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loe.org/shows/shows.htm?programID=06-P13-00027#feature2 The Make Love, Not War Species], ''Living on Earth'', (July 2006), National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, concern over declining numbers of bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee, in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], with contributions from bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for ''Pan paniscus'': A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.

Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society's initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:
*Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes
*Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a UN World Heritage site
*Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes – the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.
*Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo

Starting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), [http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf Vision for a Sustainable World], WORLDWATCH magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

In addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[African Wildlife Foundation]], and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.

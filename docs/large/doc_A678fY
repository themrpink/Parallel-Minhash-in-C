George's French opponents encouraged [[Jacobite uprising|rebellion by the Jacobites]], the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart was the son of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1719|1719]] had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]], popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged on a promise of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], in the [[Battle of Culloden]], the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the [[House of Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in [[Green Park, London]], for which Handel composed ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:George II 1755-1767.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George in his seventies|Portrait by [[John Shackleton]], in or after 1755]]
In the [[1747 British general election|general election of 1747]] the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 199; Trench, p. 243; Van der Kiste, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in [[Leicester Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 208; Trench, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 207–211; Thompson, p. 209; Trench, p. 249; Van der Kiste, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year, George lamented, &quot;This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son&amp;nbsp;– but I am glad of it&amp;nbsp;... Now [Louisa] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Walpole]]'s memoirs, vol. I, p. 152, quoted in Thompson, p. 213 and Trench, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven Years' War===
In 1754 Pelham died, to be succeeded by his elder brother, the Duke of Newcastle. Hostility between France and Britain, particularly over the [[colonization of North America]], continued.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 233–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, [[Frederick the Great]]), Austria's enemy. Russia and France allied with Austria, their former enemy. A French [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|invasion of the British-held island of Minorca]] led to the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to Newcastle's resignation and the appointment of [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]], as prime minister and [[William Pitt the Elder]] as [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 231–232; Thompson, p. 252; Trench, pp. 271–274.&lt;/ref&gt; In April the following year George dismissed Pitt in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July Pitt was recalled, and Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover, and Prussia and their allies [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] and [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and [[Saxony]]. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of [[Robert Clive]] over French forces and their allies at the [[Battle of Arcot]] and the [[Battle of Plassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|George said his son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]] (pictured), had &quot;ruined me and disgraced himself&quot; at the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]], 1757.]]

George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, commanded the king's troops in northern Germany. In 1757 [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Hanover was invaded]] and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 265–266; Trench, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; but by September he was furious at [[Convention of Klosterzeven|Cumberland's negotiated settlement]], which he felt greatly favoured the French.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 268; Trench, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; George said his son had &quot;ruined me and disgraced himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole's memoirs, vol. III, p. 61, quoted in Trench, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 276; Trench, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 270; Trench, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|annus mirabilis]]'' of 1759 British forces [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|captured Quebec]] and [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]]. A French [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|plan to invade Britain]] was defeated following naval battles at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 293–296.&lt;/ref&gt; and a resumed French advance on Hanover was halted by a joint British–Hanoverian force at the [[Battle of Minden]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
By October 1760 George II was blind in one eye and [[hard of hearing]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 275; Trench, p. 292; Van der Kiste, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 25 October he rose as usual at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, drank a cup of hot chocolate, and went to his [[close stool]] alone. After a few minutes, his valet&lt;!--Schröder--&gt; heard a loud crash and entered the room to find the king on the floor;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 289–290; Van der Kiste, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; his physician, [[Frank Nicholls]], recorded that he &quot;appeared to have just come from his necessary-stool, and as if going to open his [[escritoire]]&quot;.&lt;ref name='Nicholls' /&gt;

The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for; before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77 he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[post-mortem]] revealed that the king had died as the result of a [[thoracic aortic dissection]].&lt;ref name='Nicholls'&gt;[[Frank Nicholls|Nicholls, Frank]] (1761) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYWNFD7xRXkC&amp;pg=PA265 &quot;Observations concerning the body of His Late Majesty&quot;], ''Philos Trans Lond'' '''52''': 265–274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Criado, Frank J. (2011) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3233335/ &quot;Aortic dissection: a 250-year perspective&quot;], ''Texas Heart Institute Journal'' '''38''' (6): 694–700.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his grandson [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and buried on 11 November in [[Westminster Abbey]]. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 253; Thompson, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the most recent monarch to be buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Legacy==
George donated the royal library to the [[British Museum]] in 1757, four years after the museum's foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 68, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; He had no interest in reading,&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 127; Thompson, pp. 97–98; Trench, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128; Trench, pp. 140, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1737, he founded the [[Georg August University of Göttingen]], the first university in the [[Electorate of Hanover]], and visited it in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[asteroid]] [[359 Georgia]] was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], between 1716 and 1727; and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became [[Columbia University]]. The [[province of Georgia]], founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George II statue 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Weathered statue in Roman garb|Statue by [[John Van Nost]] erected in 1753 in [[Golden Square]], London&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, between pp. 150 and 151.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During George II's reign British interests expanded throughout the world, the Jacobite challenge to the Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, and the power of ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Lord Hervey]] and [[Horace Walpole]], George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 255–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the last quarter of the twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 144–146; Cannon; Trench, pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; This academic reassessment, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of George II as a &quot;faintly ludicrous king&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Best, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, though his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 82; Trench, p. 300; ''Lord Waldegrave's Memoirs'' quoted in Trench, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] excused George's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, &quot;His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, he always was what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charlemont quoted in Cannon and Trench, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Waldegrave wrote, &quot;I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Trench, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; George may not have played a major role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 138; Cannon; Trench, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Montagu]] said of him, &quot;With him our laws and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times&amp;nbsp;... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Black, ''George II'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
* {{note|dates|O.S./N.S.}}Over the course of George's life, two calendars were used: the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian calendar]]. Before 1700, the two calendars were 10 days apart. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain switched on 3/14 September 1752. George was born on 30 October Old Style, which was 9 November New Style, but because the calendar shifted forward a further day in 1700, the date is occasionally miscalculated as 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;Huberty ''et al''., p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.
* {{note|Hanover|A}}Hanover had about 1,800 houses, whereas London had 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{note|duel|B}}George shook his fist at Newcastle and said &quot;You are a rascal; I shall find you out!&quot;, which the duke apparently misheard as &quot;You are a rascal; I shall fight you!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward IV''' (28 April 1442&amp;nbsp;– 9 April 1483) was [[King of England]] from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward IV |work=Archontology.org |date=14 March 2010 |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/edward4.php |quote=Set sail on 2 October 1470 from England and took refuge in Burgundy; deposed as King of England on 3 October 1470}}&lt;/ref&gt; then again from 11 April 1471 until his death. He was a central figure in the [[Wars of the Roses]], a series of civil wars in England fought between the [[Yorkist]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] factions between 1455 and 1487. 

Edward inherited the Yorkist claim when his father, [[Richard, Duke of York]], died at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460. After defeating Lancastrian armies at [[Mortimer's Cross]] and [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] in early 1461, he deposed [[King Henry VI]] and took the throne. His marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]] in 1464 led to conflict with his chief advisor, [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], known as the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;. In 1470, a revolt led by Warwick and Edward's brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]], briefly [[Readeption of Henry VI|re-installed Henry VI]]. 

Edward fled to [[Flanders]], where he gathered support and invaded England in March 1471; after victories at the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]], he resumed the throne. Shortly afterwards, Henry VI was found dead in the [[Tower of London]]. Despite a continuing threat from [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the last Lancastrian claimant, Edward reigned in relative peace for the next twelve years. 

When Edward died suddenly in April 1483, his minor son became [[King Edward V]], with his father's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, as Lord Protector. In June, Gloucester seized the throne as [[Richard III]] after declaring his nephews illegitimate; they are generally supposed to [[Princes in the Tower|have been murdered]] shortly afterwards. In 1485, he was killed at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] by Henry Tudor, who ruled as Henry VII, and married Edward IV's daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], thus uniting the two houses. 

== Birth and heredity ==
Edward was born on 28 April 1442 at [[Rouen]] in [[Normandy]], eldest surviving son of [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=8}} Until his father's death, he was known as the [[Earl of March]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=14}} Both his parents were direct descendants of [[King Edward III]], giving Edward a potential claim to the throne. This was strengthened in 1447, when York became heir to the childless [[King Henry VI]] on the death of [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=3–7}}{{efn|Henry's grandfather was [[Henry IV of England]], whose father [[John of Gaunt]] was [[Edward III]]'s third surviving son. Henry IV had deposed [[Richard II]] from the senior line. York's claim derived from Edward III's fourth son, [[Edmund, 1st Duke of York]], but his mother [[Anne de Mortimer]] was the senior descendant of Edward III's second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp]]. By modern standards, York was the senior heir, although this was less clear at the time. In practical terms, it meant both he and Edward had a legitimate claim to the throne.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=3–7}}}} 

Allegations of illegitimacy were discounted at the time as politically inspired, and by later historians.{{sfn|Wilson}}{{efn|A 2004 [[Britain's Real Monarch|television documentary]] that supported these claims was subsequently discredited.{{sfn|Wilson}}}} Edward and his siblings [[George, Duke of Clarence]], and [[Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy]], were physically very similar, all three being tall and blonde, in contrast to York, who was short and dark.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|pp=173–178}} His youngest brother, who later became [[King Richard III]], closely resembled their father.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=504–505}}{{efn|When [[Richard III]] declared his nephews illegitimate in 1483, he did so on the grounds Edward's marriage to their mother was invalid.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=504–505}}}}

== Early life ==
[[File:Richard of York Talbot Shrewsbury Book.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Drawing of Richard of York, circa 1445]]
Edward grew up amidst a background of economic decline at home, and military defeat abroad, exacerbated by a weak and corrupt central government. Both he and his younger brother [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], were born in Rouen, where their father served as governor of English lands in France until 1445, when he was replaced by [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset]]. Edward and Edmund were probably brought up at [[Ludlow Castle]], in the [[Welsh Marches]], where York was the dominant landowner.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=5,7}} 

In 1447, York was made [[chief governor of Ireland]], although he did not take up the post until 1449. Shortly thereafter, a French offensive recaptured Normandy, leaving [[Calais]] as the last English possession in Northern France; despite responsibility for this defeat, Somerset was appointed King Henry's chief minister.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=9}} English politics became dominated by the struggle between the Yorkists, and supporters of the [[House of Lancaster]], or Lancastrians, notably the Duke of Somerset, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], and Henry's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=9}}

Matters came to a head in August 1453 when Henry collapsed into a catatonic stupor on hearing news of the loss of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascony]], an English possession for over 300 years. York took over government, his chief supporters being [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and his eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=11}} In January 1454, 12 year old Edward rode beside his father when he entered London to attend the [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=14}} 

However, the birth of Henry's son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], in October 1453 created a viable Lancastrian figurehead, and the 1450s was dominated by political conflict between the two factions. By the age of 17, the Earl of March was a political and military leader in his own right; after their defeat at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]] in 1459, his father and brother Edmund fled to Ireland, while the Earls of March, Salisbury and Warwick made their way to Calais. Edward's name appears alongside those of his father, Warwick and Salisbury in widely circulated manifestoes declaring their quarrel was only with Henry's evil counsellors.{{sfn|Gillingham|1981|p=110}}

In 1460, Edward crossed the [[English Channel]] with Warwick and Salisbury, and marched into London. At [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Northampton]] in July, he commanded one of three divisions in a Yorkist victory that led to the capture of Henry VI.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=25-27}} York crossed from Ireland to England; on entering the [[Palace of Westminster]], he declared himself king, a claim greeted by the assembled lords in silence.{{sfn|Gillingham|1981|p=117}} The [[Act of Accord]] agreed a compromise, whereby Henry remained king, but York and his descendants were designated his successors.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=28-29}}

The implications of removing the legally accepted heir to the throne created substantial opposition to the Yorkist administration; in late 1460, Edward was given his first independent command and sent to deal with a Lancastrian insurgency in Wales. Warwick remained in London, while York, Salisbury, and Edmund marched north to suppress another in [[Yorkshire]]; all three were killed following defeat at [[Battle of Wakefield|Wakefield]] on 30 December, leaving Edward as the new head of the Yorkist party.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=29-30}}

==Reign==
===Accession to the throne===
[[File:DacreCross.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A stone post, topped with a cross, stands next to a bush in a field. An inscription on its base reads, &quot;Battle of Towton Palm Sunday 1461&quot;|Towton Cross, commemorating Edward's victory at the [[Battle of Towton]]]]
At this stage of Edward's career, contemporaries like [[Philippe de Commines]] described him as handsome, affable, and energetic.{{sfn|Kleiman|2013|p=83}} Unusually tall for the period at  {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|abbr=off}}, he was an impressive sight in armour, and took care to wear splendid clothes. This was done deliberately to contrast him with Henry, whose physical and mental frailties undermined his position.{{sfn|Seward|1997|p=97}}  

On 2 February 1461,{{efn|Now the generally accepted date, although others suggest it was fought on 3 February}} Edward won a hard-fought victory at [[Mortimer's Cross]]. The battle was preceded by a meteorological phenomenon known as [[parhelion]], or three suns, which he took as his emblem, the &quot;[[Sun in splendour]]&quot;.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=4}} However, this was offset by Warwick's defeat at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] on 17 February, the Lancastrians regaining custody of Henry VI. The two met in London, where Edward was hastily crowned king, before marching north, where the two sides met at the [[Battle of Towton]]. Fought on 29 March in the middle of a snowstorm, it was the bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, and ended in a decisive Yorkist victory.{{sfn|Gravett |2003|pp=85–89|ref=harv}}

Estimates of the dead range from 9,000 to 20,000; figures are uncertain, as most of the mass graves were emptied or moved over the centuries, while corpses were generally stripped of clothing or armour before burial. Nevertheless, casualties among the Lancastrian nobility were enormous, and explains the enduring bitterness among those who survived. Since 1996, excavations have uncovered over 50 skeletons from the battle; an analysis of their injuries shows the brutality of the contest, including extensive post-mortem mutilations.{{sfn|Sutherland|Schmidt|2003|pp=15–25}}

Margaret fled to Scotland with Edward of Westminster, while the new king returned to London for his [[coronation of the English monarch|coronation]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=54–55}} Henry VI remained at large for over a year, but was caught and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. There was little point in killing him while his son remained alive, since this would have transferred the Lancastrian claim from a frail captive to one who was young and free.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=62}}

===1461 to 1470===

Most of the nobility had either remained loyal to Henry or stayed neutral, forcing Edward to rely heavily on the Nevilles. Consolidating the regime initially took precedence, but [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|John Neville]]'s victory at the 1464 [[Battle of Hexham]] seemed to end the Lancastrian threat.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=61}} This exposed internal divisions, some over policy, but more significantly Warwick's encouragement of the perception he was the senior partner.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=60}}

Although Edward preferred [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] as an ally, he allowed Warwick to negotiate a treaty with [[Louis XI of France]]; it included a suggested marriage between Edward and [[Anne of France]] or [[Bona of Savoy]], daughter and sister-in-law of the French king respectively.{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=91}} In October 1464, Warwick was enraged to discover that on 1 May, Edward had secretly married [[Elizabeth Woodville]], a widow with two sons, whose Lancastrian husband, [[John Grey of Groby]], died at Towton.{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=85–86}} If nothing else, it was a clear demonstration he was not in control of Edward, despite suggestions to the contrary.{{sfn|Penn|2019|p=114}}

Edward's motives have been widely discussed by contemporaries and historians alike. Elizabeth's mother, [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], came from the upper nobility, but her father, [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard Woodville]], was a middle ranking provincial knight. Edward's [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] told him with unusual frankness, &quot;she was no wife for a prince such as himself, for she was not the daughter of a duke or earl.&quot;{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=85}}

The marriage was certainly unwise and unusual, although not unheard of; Henry VI's mother, [[Catherine of Valois]], married her chamberlain, [[Owen Tudor]], while Edward's grandson [[Henry VIII]] created the [[Church of England]] to marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. By all accounts, Elizabeth possessed considerable charm of person and intellect, while Edward was used to getting what he wanted.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=112–113}} Historians generally accept the marriage was an impulsive decision, but differ on whether it was also a &quot;calculated political move&quot;. One view is the low status of the Woodvilles was part of the attraction, since unlike the Nevilles, they were reliant on Edward and thus more likely to remain loyal.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1964|p=146}} Others argue if this was his purpose, there were far better options available; all agree it had significant political implications that impacted the rest of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=170}}
[[File:Marriage Edward IV Elizabeth Woodville Wavrin Anciennes Chroniques d'Angleterre Francais 85 f109.jpeg|thumb|left|Edward IV's marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]], from the illuminated manuscript ''Anciennes Chroniques d'Angleterre'', by [[Jean de Wavrin]]. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
Unusually for the period, 12 of the new queen's siblings survived into adulthood, creating a large pool of competitors for offices and estates, as well as in the matrimony market. Her sisters made a series of advantageous unions, including that of [[Catherine Woodville, Duchess of Buckingham|Catherine Woodville]] to [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]; [[Anne Woodville]] to William, heir to [[Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex]]; and Eleanor Woodville with Anthony, heir to [[Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent]].{{sfn|Ross|1974|p=93}}

In 1467, Edward dismissed his [[Lord Chancellor]], Warwick's brother [[George Neville (archbishop)|George Neville, Archbishop of York]]. Warwick responded by building an alliance with Edward's disaffected younger brother and heir, the Duke of Clarence, who held estates adjacent to the Neville heartland in the north. Concerned by this, Edward blocked a proposed marriage between Clarence and Warwick's eldest daughter [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel]].{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=203–205}}

In early July, Clarence travelled to Calais, where he married Isabel in a ceremony conducted by George Neville and overseen by Warwick. The three men issued a 'remonstrance', listing alleged abuses by the Woodvilles and other advisors close to Edward. They returned to London, where they assembled an army to remove these 'evil councillors' and establish good government.{{sfn|Penn|2019|pp=210–211}}

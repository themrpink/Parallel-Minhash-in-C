===Alternative schooling===
Two alternatives to the Palm Beach County Public Schools in Boca Raton are the K-8 Alexander D. Henderson University School (ADHUS) and [[Florida Atlantic University High School|FAU High School]] (FAUHS). Both are on the Florida Atlantic University campus and are organized as a unique and separate school district; they are not part of the Palm Beach County School System. Henderson School is recognized as Florida Atlantic University School District #72, under the College of Education's administrative oversight.

University schools in Florida are authorized to provide instruction for grades K-12 and university students, support university research efforts, and test educational reforms for Florida schools. Both ADHUS and FAUHS are public schools and thus do not charge tuition. And they are open to children who reside in Palm Beach County or [[Broward County]]. ADHUS admission is by lottery, while FAUHS admission is determined by academic ability. Student characteristics of gender, race, family income and student ability are used to match the student population profile to that of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adhus.fau.edu|title=Alexander D. Henderson University School-Florida Center for Environmental Studies|access-date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAU High School is a dual-enrollment program that involves itself primarily in collegiate classes. Students in ninth grade take advanced classes at the ADHUS sister campus, while students in higher grades attend only collegiate classes on Florida Atlantic University's campus, earning dual credit for both high school and college. A student who has successfully completed all four years at FAU High School will graduate having completed three years of university study on a college campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fauhigh.fau.edu/aboutus/|title=Florida Atlantic University High School - About FAU High School|access-date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, several murders at the Town Center Mall gained national attention. In March, a 52-year-old woman was kidnapped and murdered. In December of the same year, a 47-year-old woman and her 7-year-old daughter were also kidnapped, and later found bound and shot in the head in the woman's SUV in the mall parking lot. This case was featured on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' and caused host [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]] to say he believed a serial killer to be in the city. Though there is no forensic evidence to suggest the murders were committed by the same person, the similarities in the cases led police to believe they were related.

===Water===
Long before any settlers arrived, the original 1870 government survey of the area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glorecords.blm.gov/SurveySearch/ Bureau of Land Management, General Land Office Records] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123042359/http://www.glorecords.blm.gov/SurveySearch/ |date=January 23, 2011 }} Florida, Townships 46–48, Range 43&lt;/ref&gt; showed that just west of and parallel to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]'s [[coastal dune]] was the &quot;Boca Ratones Lagoon&quot;, which extended south for {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} measured from just north of the present location of Atlantic Avenue in [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]]. Along the southern half of the lagoon were three wide areas each called a &quot;Lake&quot;, which are now named (north to south) Lake Rogers, Lake Wyman, and Lake Boca Raton. At the southeast end of the lagoon was a short protrusion toward the south which would become the Boca Raton Inlet after a sandbar at its mouth was removed.

[[File:Lake Boca.jpg|thumb|right|Lake Boca Raton]]
The lagoon and lakes were part of a half-mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km) wide swamp, west of which was scrub land a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide (part of the Atlantic coastal ridge) where the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] (1896) and [[Dixie Highway]] (1923) were built. To the west of the scrub was a half mile or wider swamp within which flowed north to south the &quot;Prong of Hillsborough River&quot;, which is now the El Rio Canal. It now forms the eastern border of [[Florida Atlantic University]] and the Old Floresta neighborhood. The prong entered the &quot;Hillsborough River&quot; at the present eastern end of the straight portion of the [[Hillsboro Canal]] (dredged 1911–14), which is the southern city limits. The river flowed southeast in several channels along the western edge of the present Deerfield Island County Park, formerly called Capone Island (named for [[Al Capone]] who owned it during the 1930s), which did not become an island until the Royal Palm Canal was dredged along its northern edge in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalpalm.com/art/pdfs/10_03_04.pdf |title= The Mysterious &quot;Capone Island&quot;: Deerfield Island Park |access-date= March 16, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061019173651/http://www.royalpalm.com/art/pdfs/10_03_04.pdf |archive-date= October 19, 2006 |url-status= dead }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(597KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bocahistory.org/pdf/span_river/SRP%20Winter%201986.pdf |title= Deerfield Island - Spanish River Papers |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802025816/http://www.bocahistory.org/pdf/span_river/SRP%20Winter%201986.pdf |archive-date= August 2, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.47MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowing south from the lagoon to the river along the eastern edge of the 'island' was a &quot;Small boat Pass into Hillsboro' River&quot;, also called the Little Hillsboro. The river continued due south about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} just inland of the coastal dune until it emptied into the Atlantic Ocean at the &quot;Hillsborough Bar&quot;, now the [[Hillsboro Inlet]].

The lagoon was dredged in 1894–95 to form part of the Florida East Coast Canal with a minimum depth of {{convert|5|ft|m}} and a minimum width of {{convert|50|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aicw.org/browardlegacy.pdf |title= A history of Florida's East Coast Canal: The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway from Jacksonville to Miami |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185248/http://www.aicw.org/browardlegacy.pdf |archive-date= May 9, 2008 |df= mdy-all}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.8 MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1895, the lagoon and canal were sometimes called the Spanish River. Between 1930 and 1935 the canal was improved to {{convert|8|x|100|ft|m|abbr=off}} by the federal government and renamed the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. It was improved again between 1960 and 1965 to {{convert|10|x|125|ft|m|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey Parkman, ''[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/misc/nws83-10/toc.htm History of the waterways of the Atlantic coast of the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310153813/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/misc/nws83-10/toc.htm|date=March 10, 2008}}'', National Waterways Study, 1983, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; All three versions were subject to [[shoal]]ing which reduced their depths below the specified minimum. Forming part of the northern city limits is the C-15 canal, connecting the El Rio Canal to the Intracoastal Waterway.

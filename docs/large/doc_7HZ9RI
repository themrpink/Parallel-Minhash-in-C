They also won the Llanfrothen burial case, which established the right of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s to be buried according to their own denominational rites in parish burial grounds, a right given by the [[Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880]] but which had up to then been ignored by the Anglican clergy. On Lloyd George's advice, a Baptist burial party broke open a gate to a cemetery which had been locked against them by the vicar. The vicar sued them for trespass and the local judge misrecorded the jury's verdict and found in his favour, awakening suspicions of bias by the local Tory landowning class. Lloyd George's clients won on appeal to the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench in London, where Lord Chief Justice [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Coleridge]] found in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stevens |first= Catrin |title= The 'Burial Question': Controversy and Conflict c. 1860–1890 |journal= [[The Welsh History Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 2| date =1 December 2002 | publisher= University of Wales Press |pages= 328–356 |doi =10.16922/whr.21.2.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyEducation&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Travis L.|title=The Unknown Lloyd George|year=2014|publisher=I.

In 1889, he became an [[Alderman]] on [[Carnarvonshire]] [[County Council]] which had been created by the [[Local Government Act 1888]], and was to remain so for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyEducation&quot;/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name=&quot;RowlandBackParlour&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|location=London|isbn=0214200493|chapter=From Back Parlour to Back Bench, 1885-1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65–66}} For the same county Lloyd George would also become a [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (1910)&lt;ref name=&quot;kellys&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Kelly's | 1945 | p=1185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chairman of [[Quarter Sessions]] (1929–38),&lt;ref name=bpeerage&gt;{{harvnb | Burke's | 1949 | p=1241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=kellys /&gt;

At that time he appeared to be trying to create a separate Welsh [[Welsh nationalism|national party]] modelled on [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]]'s [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and worked towards a union of the North and South Wales Liberal Federations.

== Member of Parliament ==
Lloyd George was returned as Liberal MP for [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Carnarvon Boroughs]] – by a margin of 18 votes – in the [[1890 Caernarvon Boroughs by-election|by-election on 10 April 1890]], following the death of the Conservative member [[Edmund Swetenham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=David Lloyd George: A Political Life: The Architect of Change 1863–1912|year=1987|publisher=B.

He would remain an MP for the same constituency until 1945, 55 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;HatterNotAGent&quot;/&gt;{{rp|50}}

As backbench members of the House of Commons were not paid at that time, he supported himself and his growing family by continuing to practise as a solicitor, opening an office in London under the name of 'Lloyd George and Co.' and continuing in partnership with William George in [[Criccieth]]. In 1897, he merged his growing London practice with that of Arthur Rhys Roberts (who was to become [[Official Solicitor]]) under the name of 'Lloyd George, Roberts and Co.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins Ltd|location=London|isbn=0214200493|pages=125–126|chapter=M.P. for Caernarvon Boroughs, 1896-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the legal adviser of [[Theodor Herzl]] in his negotiations with the British government regarding the [[Uganda Scheme]], proposed as an alternative homeland for the Jews due to Turkish refusal to grant a charter for Jewish settlement in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jta.org/1931/01/15/archive/mr-lloyd-george-was-legal-adviser-to-dr-herzl-on-uganda-project-and-submitted-dr-herzls-views-to Mr. Lloyd George Was Legal Adviser to Dr. Herzl on Uganda Project and Submitted Dr. Herzl's Views]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issues ===
He was soon speaking on Liberal issues (particularly temperance – the &quot;[[local option]]&quot; – and national as opposed to denominational education) throughout England as well as Wales. During the next decade Lloyd George campaigned in Parliament largely on Welsh issues and in particular for disestablishment and disendowment of the Church of England.  He wrote extensively for Liberal papers such as the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''. When [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] retired in 1894 after the defeat of the [[second Home Rule Bill]], the Welsh Liberal members chose him to serve on a deputation to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] to press for specific assurances on Welsh issues; when those were not provided, they resolved to take independent action if the government did not bring a bill for disestablishment. When that was not forthcoming, he and three other Welsh Liberals ([[D. A. Thomas]], [[Herbert Lewis]] and [[Frank Edwards (British politician)|Frank Edwards]]) refused the [[whip (politics)|whip]] on 14 April 1894, but accepted [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]]'s assurance and rejoined the official Liberals on 29 May. Thereafter he devoted much time to setting up branches of [[Cymru Fydd]] (Young Wales), which, he said, would in time become a force like the [[Irish National Party]]. He abandoned this idea after being criticised in Welsh newspapers for bringing about the defeat of the Liberal Party in the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 election]] and at a meeting in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] on 16 January 1896 of the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by D. A. Thomas, he was shouted down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=David Lloyd George: A Political Life: The Architect of Change 1863–1912|year=1987|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd|location=London|isbn=0713455586|pages=146–147|chapter=The Early Years in Parliament: The Welsh Parnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George also supported the idea of [[Pan-Celticism|Pan-Celtic unity]] and gave a speech at the 1904 [[Pan-Celtic Congress]] in [[Caernarfon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/celts-divided-by-more-than-the-irish-sea-1.3705930|title=Celts divided by more than the Irish Sea|first=Caoimhín De|last=Barra|website=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposes Boer War ===
Lloyd George had been impressed by his journey to Canada in 1899. Although sometimes wrongly supposed – both at the time and subsequently – to be a [[Little Englander]], he was not an opponent of the British Empire ''per se'', but in a speech at Birkenhead (21 November 1901) he stressed that it needed to be based on freedom, including for India, not &quot;racial arrogance&quot;.&lt;ref name=GriggCrisisAtSea&gt;{{cite book|last=Grigg|first=John|author-link=John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|title=Lloyd George: War Leader 1916–1919|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0140284273|chapter=Crisis at Sea and Revolution in Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Consequently, he gained national fame by displaying vehement opposition to the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Hattersley|title=David Lloyd George: The Great Outsider|year=2010|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9781408700976|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976/page/119 119]–144|chapter=Go for Joe|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Rosebery's lead he based his attack firstly on what were supposed to be Britain's war aims – remedying the grievances of the [[Uitlander]]s and in particular the claim that they were wrongly denied the right to vote, saying &quot;I do not believe the war has any connection with the franchise. It is a question of 45% dividends&quot; and that England (which did not then have universal male suffrage) was more in need of franchise reform than the Boer republics. A second attack came on the cost of the war, which, he argued, prevented overdue social reform in England, such as old age pensions and workmen's cottages. As the fighting continued his attacks moved to its conduct by the generals, who, he said (basing his words on reports by [[William Burdett-Coutts]] in ''[[The Times]]''), were not providing for the sick or wounded soldiers and were starving Boer women and children in concentration camps. But his major thrusts were reserved for the Chamberlains, accusing them of [[war profiteering]] through the family company [[Kynoch]] Ltd, of which Chamberlain's brother was chairman. The firm had won tenders to the [[War Office]] though its prices were higher than some of its competitors. After speaking at a meeting in Birmingham Lloyd George had to be smuggled out disguised as a policeman, as his life was in danger from the mob. At this time the Liberal Party was badly split as [[H. H. Asquith]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|R. B. Haldane]] and others were supporters of the war and formed the [[Liberal Imperial League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=Lloyd George: A Political Life: The Architect of Change|year=1987|publisher=B.

=== Opposes the Education Act 1902 ===
Lloyd George was the main spokesman for the Nonconformists, and they made a major issue out of the government's [[Education Act 1902]]. It provided funding for Church of England schools, paid out of local taxation. The bill passed but opposition to it helped reunite the Liberals. His successful amendment that county councils need only fund those schools where the buildings were in good repair served to make the Act a dead letter in Wales, where the counties were able to show that most Church of England schools were in poor repair. Having already gained national recognition for his anti-Boer War campaigns, his leadership of the attacks on the Education Act gave him a strong parliamentary reputation and marked him as a likely future cabinet member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Hattersley|title=David Lloyd George: The Great Outsider|year=2010|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9781408700976|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976/page/145 145]–165|chapter=Noncomformity's Champion|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act served to reunify the Liberals after their divisions over the Boer War, and to increase Nonconformist influence in the party, which then included educational reform as policy in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]], which resulted in a Liberal landslide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daglish1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daglish|first=Neil D.|year=1994|title=Lloyd George's Education Bill?

{{Further|Education Act 1902#The failed Education Bill of 1906}}

In 1905, Lloyd George entered the new Liberal Cabinet of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]].&lt;ref name = &quot;CrosbyWithRadical&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Crosby| first = Travis L. |title=The Unknown Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict|year=2014|chapter = With Radical Intent?|publisher = I.

The first priority on taking office was repeal of the 1902 Education Act. Lloyd George took the lead along with [[Augustine Birrell]], President of the Board of Education. Lloyd George appears to have been the dominant figure on the committee drawing up the bill in its later stages, and insisted that the bill create a separate education committee for Wales. Birrell complained privately that the bill, introduced in the Commons on 9 April 1906, owed more to Lloyd George and that he himself had had little say in its contents.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyIntheCabinet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Travis L.|title=The Unknown Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict|chapter = In the Cabinet|year=2014|publisher=I.

Lloyd George was rebuked by King Edward VII for these speeches: the Prime Minister defended him to the Kings's secretary [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Francis Knollys]], stating that his behaviour in Parliament was more constructive but that in speeches to the public &quot;the combative spirit seems to get the better of him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyIntheCabinet&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74–77}} No compromise was possible and the bill was abandoned, allowing the 1902 Act to continue in effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daglish1994&quot;/&gt; As a result of Lloyd George's lobbying, a separate department for Wales{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Scotland has its own education system, separate from that of England and Wales}} was created within the Board of Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyIntheCabinet&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74–77}}

Nonconformists were bitterly upset by the failure of the Liberal Party to carry through on its most important promise to them, and over time their support for the Liberal Party slowly fell away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards1972&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Noel J.|date=January 1972|title=The Education Bill of 1906 and the Decline of Political Nonconformity|journal=[[The Journal of Ecclesiastical History]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=49–63|doi=10.1017/S0022046900055615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Board of Trade Lloyd George introduced legislation on many topics, from [[Merchant Shipping Act 1906|merchant shipping]] and the [[Port of London Act 1908|Port of London]] to [[Companies Act 1907|companies]] and railway regulation. His main achievement was in stopping a proposed national strike of the railway unions by brokering an agreement between the unions and the railway companies. While almost all the companies refused to recognise the unions, Lloyd George persuaded the companies to recognise elected representatives of the workers who sat with the company representatives on conciliation boards—one for each company. If those boards failed to agree then an arbitrator would be called upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyIntheCabinet&quot;/&gt;{{rp|69–73}}

On Campbell-Bannerman's death he succeeded Asquith, who had become Prime Minister, as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1908 to 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyIntheCabinet&quot; /&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CrosbyRighteousness&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Travis L.|title=The Unknown Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict|year=2014|publisher=I.

The Liberal manifesto at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]] included a commitment to reduce military expenditure. Lloyd George strongly supported this, writing to [[Reginald McKenna]], First Lord of the Admiralty, &quot;the emphatic pledges given by all of us at the last general election to reduce the gigantic expenditure on armaments built up by the recklessness of our predecessors.&quot;  He then proposed the programme be reduced from six to four [[dreadnoughts]]. This was adopted by the government, but there was a public storm when the Conservatives, with covert support from the First Sea Lord, Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], campaigned for more with the slogan &quot;We want eight and we won't wait&quot;. This resulted in Lloyd George's defeat in Cabinet and the adoption of estimates including provision for eight dreadnoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert K. Massie| author-link = Robert K.

=== People's Budget, 1909 ===
{{Further|People's Budget}}
In 1909, Lloyd George introduced his [[People's Budget]], imposing a 20% tax on the unearned increase in value of [[land value tax|land]], payable at death of the owner or sale of the land, and ½ d. on undeveloped land and minerals, increased death duties, a rise in income tax, and the introduction of [[Supertax]] on income over £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | McKinstry | 2005 | pp=504–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were taxes also on luxuries, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and tobacco, so that money could be made available for the new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. The nation's landowners (well represented in the House of Lords) were intensely angry at the new taxes, mostly at the proposed very high tax on [[land value tax|land values]], but also because the instrumental redistribution of wealth could be used to detract from an argument for protective tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Ramsden | 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2018}}

The immediate consequences included the end of the [[Liberal League (United Kingdom)|Liberal League]], and Rosebery breaking friendship with the Liberal Party, which in itself was for Lloyd George a triumph. He had won the case of social reform without losing the debate on Free Trade.&lt;ref name = JenkinsDLG&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Roy|author-link = Roy Jenkins|title=The Chancellors|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333730577|chapter=David Lloyd George}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166}} [[Arthur Balfour]] denounced the budget as &quot;vindictive, inequitable, based on no principles, and injurious to the productive capacity of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name = JenkinsDLG/&gt;{{rp|167}} [[Roy Jenkins]] described it as the most reverberating since Gladstone's in 1860.&lt;ref name = JenkinsDLG/&gt;{{rp|172}}

In the House of Commons Lloyd George gave a brilliant account of the budget, which was attacked by the Conservatives. On the stump, notably at his Limehouse speech in 1909, he denounced the Conservatives and the wealthy classes with all his very considerable oratorical power. The budget was defeated by the Conservative majority in the House of Lords. The elections of 1910 narrowly upheld the Liberal government. The 1909 budget was passed on 28 April 1910 by the Lords, and received the [[Royal Assent]] on the 29th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Bruce|date=Autumn 2009|title=The &quot;People's Budget&quot; a Century On|journal=Journal of Liberal History|publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]]|issue=64|page=12|url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/64_Murray_Peoples_Budget.pdf|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Hattersley|title=David Lloyd George: The Great Outsider|year=2010|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9781408700976|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976/page/278 278]–279|chapter=A Reasonable Way Out|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Parliament Act 1911]] curtailed the veto power of the House of Lords.

Although old-age pensions had already been introduced by Asquith as Chancellor, Lloyd George was largely responsible for the introduction of state financial support for the sick and infirm (known colloquially as &quot;going on the Lloyd George&quot; for decades afterwards)—legislation referred to as the [[Liberal Reforms]]. Lloyd George also succeeded in putting through Parliament his [[National Insurance Act 1911]], making provision for sickness and invalidism, and a system of unemployment insurance. He was helped in his endeavours by forty or so backbenchers who regularly pushed for new social measures, often voted with Labour MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Watts | 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2018}} These social reforms in Britain were the beginnings of a [[welfare state]] and fulfilled the aim of dampening down the demands of the growing working class for rather more radical solutions to their impoverishment.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Mansion House Speech, 1911 ===
Lloyd George was considered an opponent of war until the [[Second Moroccan Crisis|Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, during which he gave a stirring and patriotic speech at Mansion House on 21 July 1911. Grey was aghast and felt that the Chancellor was more qualified to be Foreign Secretary than he was; German opinion recognised that Britain would resist further German aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=i, pp. 224–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane and Lloyd George were among the minority in the Cabinet who were pro-German, on grounds of [[Protestantism|a shared religion]], philosophy, artistic culture and scientific enquiry. Germany blamed Lloyd George for doing &quot;untold harm both with regard to German public opinion and the negotiations...namely, to the despatch of [[SMS Panther|the German warship]] to Agadir&quot;, and citing [[Count Metternich]] &quot;...Mr Lloyd George's speech came upon us like a thunderbolt&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=i, pp. 236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marconi scandal 1913 ===
In 1913, Lloyd George, along with [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the Attorney General, was involved in the [[Marconi scandal]]. Accused of speculating in Marconi shares on the inside information that they were about to be awarded a key government contract (which would have caused them to increase in value), he told the House of Commons that he had not speculated in the shares of &quot;that company&quot;. He had in fact bought shares in the American Marconi Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh1988p59-61&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Pugh (historian)|title=Lloyd George|series=Profiles in Power|year=1988|publisher=Longman|location=London and New York|pages=59–61|chapter=The New Liberalism 1908–1914|isbn = 0-582-55268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Welsh Church Act 1914 ===
The [[Church of England]] no longer had majority adherence in most parts of Wales in preference to Wales-led [[Protestantism]], in particular [[Calvinistic Methodism]]. Lloyd George had long called for disestablishment and was instrumental in introducing the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]] which disestablished the [[Anglican Church]] in Wales (though, upon the outbreak of war, the actual [[coming into force]] of the Act was postponed by the [[Suspensory Act 1914]] until 1920), removing the opportunity of the six Welsh Bishops in the new [[Church in Wales]] to sit in the House of Lords and removing (disendowing) certain pre-1662 property rights.&lt;ref name = &quot;TomJonesMember&quot;/&gt;{{rp|18–20}}&lt;ref name = &quot;TomJonesCabinet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Jones (civil servant)|title=Lloyd George|year=1951|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|chapter=III: Cabinet Minister 1906–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref&gt;K.

=== First World War ===
Lloyd George was as surprised as almost everyone else by the outbreak of the [[British entry into World War I|First World War]]. On 23 July 1914, almost a month after the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] and on the eve of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, he made a speech advocating &quot;economy&quot; in the House of Commons, saying that Britain's relations with Germany were better than for many years.&lt;ref name = JenkinsPlunge&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Jenkins|title=Asquith|edition=Third|year=1986|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=0002177129|chapter=The Plunge to War 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|325–326}} On 27 July he told [[C.

Scott]] of the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' that Britain would keep out of the impending war.{{sfn|Koss|1985|p=156}} With the Cabinet divided, and most ministers reluctant for Britain to get involved, he struck Asquith as &quot;statesmanlike&quot; at the Cabinet meeting on 1 August, favouring keeping Britain's options open. The next day he seemed likely to resign if Britain intervened, but he held back at Cabinet on Monday 3 August, moved by news that Belgium would resist Germany's demand for passage for her army across her soil. He was seen as a key figure whose stance helped to persuade almost the entire Cabinet to support British intervention.{{sfn|Koss|1985|p=157-9}}&lt;ref name = JenkinsPlunge/&gt;{{rp|327–329}} He was able to give the more pacifist members of the cabinet and the Liberal Party a principle – the rights of small nations – which meant they could support the war and maintain united political and popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=Lloyd George: A Political Life: Organizer of Victory 1912–1916|year=1992|publisher=B.

Lloyd George remained in office as Chancellor of the Exchequer for the first year of the Great War. The budget of 17 November 1914 had to allow for lower taxation receipts because of the reduction in world trade. The [[Crimean War|Crimean]] and [[Second Boer War|Boer]] Wars had largely been paid for out of taxation; but Lloyd George raised [[United Kingdom national debt|debt financing]] of £321&amp;nbsp;million. Large (but deferred) increases in Supertax and income tax rates were accompanied by increases in excise duties, and the budget produced a tax increase of £63&amp;nbsp;million in a full year.&lt;ref name = JenkinsDLG/&gt;{{rp|174–175}} His last budget, on 4 May 1915, showed a growing concern for the effects of alcohol on the war effort, with large increases in duties, and a scheme of state control of alcohol sales in specified areas. The excise proposals were opposed by the Irish Nationalists and the Conservatives, and were abandoned.&lt;ref name = JenkinsDLG/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

== Minister of Munitions ==

{{See also|Minister of Munitions | Shell Crisis of 1915}}
Lloyd George gained a heroic reputation with his energetic work as Minister of Munitions, 1915–16, setting the stage for his move up to the height of power. After a long struggle with the War Office, he wrested responsibility for arms production away from the generals, making it a purely industrial department, with considerable expert assistance from [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1975 232–244&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Adams | 1975 | pp=232–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men gained the respect of Liberal cabinet colleagues for improving administrative capabilities, and increasing outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=ii, pp. 242–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] dismayed public opinion with the news that the Army was running short of artillery shells, demands rose for a strong leader to take charge of munitions. In the [[Asquith coalition ministry|first coalition ministry]], formed in May 1915, Lloyd George was made [[Minister of Munitions]], heading a new department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Fraser | 1982 | pp=77–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this position he won great acclaim, which formed the basis for his political ascent.  All historians agree that he boosted national morale and focussed attention on the urgent need for greater output, but many also say the increase in munitions output in 1915–16 was due largely to reforms already underway, though not yet effective, before he had even arrived. The Ministry broke through the cumbersome bureaucracy of the War Office, resolved labour problems, rationalised the supply system and dramatically increased production. Within a year it became the largest buyer, seller, and employer in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1975 232–244&quot; /&gt;

Lloyd George was not at all satisfied with the progress of the war. He wanted to &quot;knock away the props&quot;, by attacking Germany's allies – from early in 1915 he argued for the sending of British troops to the Balkans to assist Serbia and bring Greece and other Balkan countries onto the side of the Allies (this was eventually done – the [[Macedonian front|Salonika expedition]] – although not on the scale that Lloyd George had wanted, and mountain ranges made his suggestions of grand Balkan offensives impractical); in 1916, he wanted to send machine guns to [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] (insufficient amounts were available for this to be feasible). These suggestions began a period of poor relations with the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]], who was &quot;brusque to the point of rudeness&quot; and &quot;barely concealed his contempt for Lloyd George's military opinions&quot;, to which he was in the habit of retorting &quot;I've 'eard different&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George persuaded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], to raise a [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|Welsh Division]], and, despite Kitchener's threat of resignation, to recognise nonconformist chaplains in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | pp=309–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1915, Lloyd George became a strong supporter of general conscription, an issue that divided Liberals, and helped the passage of several [[Military Service Act 1916|conscription acts]] from January 1916 onwards. In spring 1916 [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] hoped Lloyd George could be persuaded to bring down the coalition government by resigning, but this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Jeffery | 2006 | p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretary of State for War ==
[[File:PMLloydGeorge--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpg|thumb|Lloyd George in 1916]]

In June 1916 Lloyd George succeeded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (who died when his ship was sunk) as [[Secretary of State for War]], although he had little control over strategy, as General Robertson had been given direct right of access to the Cabinet so as to bypass Kitchener. He did succeed in securing the appointment of Sir [[Eric Geddes]] to take charge of military railways behind British lines in France, with the honorary rank of major-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lloyd George told a journalist, [[Roy W. Howard]], in late September that &quot;the fight must be to a finish – to a knockout&quot;, a rejection of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s offer to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George was increasingly frustrated at the limited gains of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme Offensive]], criticising [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|General Haig]] to [[Ferdinand Foch]] on a visit to the Western Front in September (British casualty ratios were worse than those of the French, who were more experienced and had more artillery), proposing sending Robertson on a mission to Russia (he refused to go), and demanding that more troops be sent to Salonika to help Romania. Robertson eventually threatened to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the press still argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and [[Siege of Kut|Kut]]. [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], owner of ''[[The Times]]'' stormed into Lloyd George's office and, finding him unavailable, told his secretary &quot;You can tell him that I hear he has been interfering with Strategy, and that if he goes on I will break him&quot;, and the same day (11 October) Lloyd George also received a warning letter from [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|H. A. Gwynne]], editor of the ''[[Morning Post]]''. He was obliged to give his &quot;word of honour&quot; to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable, but he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press (affecting to believe that Robertson had not personally &quot;authorised such a breach of confidence &amp; discipline&quot;). He asserted his right to express his opinions about strategy in November, by which time ministers had taken to holding meetings to which Robertson was not invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=64–65, 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakness of Asquith as a planner and organiser was increasingly apparent to senior officials. After Asquith had refused, then agreed, and then refused again to agree to Lloyd George's demand that he should be allowed to chair a small committee to manage the war, he resigned in December 1916. Grey was among leading Asquithians who had identified Lloyd George's intentions the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=ii, p. 248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George became Prime Minister, with the nation demanding he take vigorous charge of the war. A ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon of the time showed him as &quot;The New Conductor&quot; conducting the orchestra in the &quot;Opening of the 1917 Overture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Bentley Brinkerhoff|title=Lloyd George: A Political Life: Organizer of Victory 1912–1916|year=1992|publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd|location=London|isbn=0713457279|page=plate facing 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although during the political crisis Robertson had advised Lloyd George to &quot;stick to it&quot; and form a small War Council, Lloyd George had planned if necessary to appeal to the country, his Military Secretary Colonel [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Arthur Lee]] having prepared a memo blaming Robertson and the General Staff for the loss of Serbia and Romania. Lloyd George was restricted by his promise to the Unionists to keep Haig as Commander-in-Chief and the press support for the generals, although [[Alfred Milner|Milner]] and [[George Nathaniel Curzon|Curzon]] were also sympathetic to campaigns to increase British power in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Germany's offer (12 December 1916) of a negotiated peace Lloyd George rebuffed President Wilson's request for the belligerents to state their war aims by demanding terms tantamount to German defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forming a government====
The fall of Asquith as Prime Minister split the Liberal Party into two factions: those who supported him and those who supported the coalition government. In his ''War Memoirs'', Lloyd George compared himself with Asquith:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd George|first=David|title=War Memoirs of David Lloyd George|edition=New|volume=1 of 2|year=1938|publisher=Odhams Press|location=London|page=602|chapter=XXXVI Some Personal Sketches}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are certain indispensable qualities essential to the Chief Minister of the Crown in a great war. . . . Such a minister must have courage, composure, and judgment. All this Mr. Asquith possessed in a superlative degree. . . . But a war minister must also have vision, imagination and initiative—he must show untiring assiduity, must exercise constant oversight and supervision of every sphere of war activity, must possess driving force to energize this activity, must be in continuous consultation with experts, official and unofficial, as to the best means of using the resources of the country in conjunction with the Allies for the achievement of victory. If to this can be added a flair for conducting a great fight, then you have an ideal War Minister.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After December 1916 Lloyd George relied on the support of Conservatives and of the press baron [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]] (who owned both ''[[The Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]''). Besides the Prime Minister, the five-member [[War Cabinet]] contained three Conservatives (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons [[Bonar Law]], and Minister without Portfolio [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]]) and [[Arthur Henderson]], unofficially representing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. [[Edward Carson]] was appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], as had been widely touted during the intrigues of the previous month, but excluded from the War Cabinet. Amongst the few Liberal frontbenchers to support Lloyd George were [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] (who had played an important role in drumming up some backbench Liberal support for Lloyd George), [[H. A. L. Fisher]], [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Lord Rhondda]] and [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Sir Albert Stanley]]. [[Edwin Montagu]] and Churchill joined the government in the summer of 1917.{{sfn|Koss|1985|p=224}}

Lloyd George's Secretariat, popularly known as Downing Street's &quot;Garden Suburb&quot;, assisted him in discharging his responsibilities within the constraints of the war cabinet system. Its function was to maintain contact with the numerous departments of government, to collect information, and to report on matters of special concern. Its leading members were [[William George Stewart Adams|George Adams]] and [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Philip Kerr]], and the other secretaries included [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]], [[Joseph Davies (politician)|Joseph Davies]], [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]] and, later, [[Cecil Harmsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blick and George Jones, ''A Century of Policy Advice at No.10'', Part I. [https://history.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/05/a-century-of-policy-advice-at-no-10-part-one/ Official UK government history of policy advice]. See also John Turner, ''Lloyd George's Secretariat'' (Cambridge University Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George wanted to make the destruction of [[Ottoman Empire]] a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of [[Jerusalem]], to impress British public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George was discreetly quiet about plans to take Jerusalem, an object which advanced British interests rather than doing much to win the war. Lloyd George proposed sending heavy guns to Italy with a view to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika, but was unable to obtain the support of the French or Italians, and Robertson talked of resigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nivelle Affair ====
Lloyd George engaged almost constantly in intrigues calculated to reduce the power of the generals, including trying to subordinate British forces in France to the French [[Robert Nivelle|General Nivelle]]. He backed Nivelle because he thought he had 'proved himself to be a Man' by his successful counterattacks at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and because of his promises that he could break the German lines in 48 hours. Nivelle increasingly complained of Haig's dragging his feet rather than co-operating with their plans for the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was to put British forces under Nivelle's direct command for the great 1917 offensive. The British would attack first, thereby tying down the German reserves. Then the French would strike and score an overwhelming victory in two days. It was announced at a War Cabinet meeting on 24 February, to which neither Robertson nor [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] (Secretary of State for War) had been invited.  Ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves more skillful than the British in 1916, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. The Nivelle proposal was then given to Robertson and Haig without warning on 26–27 February at the [[Calais Conference]] (minutes from the War Cabinet meeting were not sent to [[George V|the King]] until 28 February, so that he did not have a prior chance to object). Robertson in particular protested vehemently. Finally a compromise was reached whereby Haig would be under Nivelle's orders but would retain operational control of British forces and keep a right of appeal to London &quot;if he saw good reason&quot;. After further argument the ''status quo'', that Haig was an ally of the French but was expected to defer to their wishes, was largely restored in mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|author-link=Roy Hattersley|title=David Lloyd George: The Great Outsider|year=2010|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9781408700976|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976/page/426 426]–433|chapter=Frontal Assaults|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781408700976|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grigg|first=John|author-link=John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|title=Lloyd George: War Leader 1916–1918|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0140284273|pages=35–44|chapter=Conference at Calais}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grigg|first=John|author-link=John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|title=Lloyd George: War Leader 1916-1918|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0140284273|pages=82–98|chapter=Nivelle's Nemesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

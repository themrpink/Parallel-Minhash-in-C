==Measurements and status of theory==
The theory of BBN gives a detailed mathematical description of the production of the light &quot;elements&quot; deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7. Specifically, the theory yields precise quantitative predictions for the mixture of these elements, that is, the primordial abundances at the end of the big-bang.

In order to test these predictions, it is necessary to reconstruct the primordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing astronomical objects in which very little [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] has taken place (such as certain [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen in a very early stage of their evolution (such as distant [[quasar]]s).

As noted above, in the standard picture of BBN, all of the light element abundances depend on the amount of ordinary matter ([[baryon]]s) relative to radiation ([[photons]]). Since the [[Cosmological Principle|universe is presumed to be homogeneous]], it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against observations one had to ask: can ''all'' of the light element observations be explained with a ''single value'' of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more precisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the observations, one asks: is there some ''range'' of baryon-to-photon values which can account for all of the observations?{{According to whom|date=January 2019}}

More recently, the question has changed: Precision observations of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;David Toback (2009). [http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch12text.pdf &quot;Chapter 12: Cosmic Background Radiation&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706222531/http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch12text.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Toback (2009). [http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch13text.pdf &quot;Unit 4: The Evolution Of The Universe&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706223121/http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch13text.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] give an independent value for the baryon-to-photon ratio. Using this value, are the BBN predictions for the abundances of light elements in agreement with the observations?

The present measurement of helium-4 indicates good agreement, and yet better agreement for helium-3. But for lithium-7, there is a [[cosmological lithium problem|significant discrepancy]] between BBN and WMAP/Planck, and the abundance derived from [[Population II stars]]. The discrepancy is a factor of 2.4―4.3 below the theoretically predicted value and is considered a problem for the original models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Bitter Pill: The Primordial Lithium Problem Worsens |author=R.

==Non-standard scenarios==
In addition to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous non-standard BBN scenarios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Non Standard BBN&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0370-1573(93)90134-Y| title=Probing the early universe: A review of primordial nucleosynthesis beyond the standard big bang| journal=Physics Reports| volume=229| issue=4| pages=145–219| year=1993| last1=Malaney| first1=Robert A.| last2=Mathews| first2=Grant J.| bibcode=1993PhR...229..145M}}&lt;/ref&gt; These should not be confused with [[non-standard cosmology]]: a non-standard BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts additional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances. These pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption of homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Soler, F. J. P., Froggatt, C. D., &amp; Muheim, F., eds., ''Neutrinos in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[CRC Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=mRGThuuYHgsC&amp;pg=PA362 p. 362].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been, and continue to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This has proved to be of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable [[tau neutrino]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. W., ''The Cosmic Compendium: The Big Bang &amp; the Early Universe'' ([[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville, NC]]: [[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]], 2015), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=9U6yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harrison Ford''' (born July 13, 1942) is an American actor, pilot, and environmental activist. {{As of|2019}}, the U.S. domestic box office grosses of [[Harrison Ford filmography|his films]] total over $5.1{{nbsp}}billion, with worldwide grosses surpassing $9.3{{nbsp}}billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=harrisonford.htm|title=Harrison Ford Movie Box Office Results|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing him at No. 4 on the list of highest-grossing domestic box office stars of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;p=.htm|title=People Index|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his box office success, he is also an [[Academy Award]] nominee, a four-time [[Golden Globe]] nominee, a two-time [[Saturn Award]] winner, and the recipient of the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] and the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]].

Following the initial part of his career in bit parts and supporting roles, Ford gained worldwide fame for his starring role as [[Han Solo]] in the epic space opera film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), reprising the role in [[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|four sequels]] over the course of the next 42 years. He is also widely known for his portrayal of [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|titular film franchise]], beginning with the action-adventure film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and for playing other characters in different franchises, most notably [[Rick Deckard]] in the dystopian science fiction films ''[[Blade Runner (film)|Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017) and the [[Tom Clancy]] character [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] in the spy thriller films ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992) and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994). His career spans six decades and includes collaborations with some of the most acclaimed and influential filmmakers of all time such as [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Weir]], [[Roman Polanski|Roman Polański]] and [[Mike Nichols]].

Outside of his franchise roles, Ford has portrayed heroic characters in other films such as the thrillers ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993), and ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), as well as the historical sports drama ''[[42 (film)|42]]'' (2013), in which he played baseball manager [[Branch Rickey]]. In addition to his heroic roles, he played morally ambiguous and darker characters in films such as the coming-of-age comedy drama ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), the conspiracy thriller ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974), the survival drama ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), the legal drama ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990), and the supernatural suspense thriller ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000). Ford has also appeared in several romantic comedies and dramas throughout his career, including ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'' (1988), ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1995), ''[[Six Days, Seven Nights]]'' (1998), ''[[Random Hearts (film)|Random Hearts]]'' (1999), ''[[Morning Glory (2010 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Age of Adaline]]'' (2015).

Ford was a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]], achieving the second-highest rank of Life Scout. He worked at [[Napowan Adventure Base]] Scout Camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director [[Steven Spielberg]] later decided to depict the young [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] as a Life Scout in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989).

==Career==
===1964–1976===
In 1964, after a season of [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] with the [[Belfry Players]] in Wisconsin,&lt;ref&gt;Franzene, Jessica, &quot;Theologians &amp; Thespians,&quot; in Welcome Home, a realtors' guide to property history in the Lake Geneva region, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ford traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-per-week contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]' new talent program, playing [[bit part|bit roles]] in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in ''[[Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or &quot;[[extra (film)|extra]]&quot;) roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor [[Tony Curtis]] delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White |first=Dana |title=Harrison Ford: Imperfect Hero (9780735100893): Garry Jenkins: Books |year=1999 |isbn=0735100896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His speaking roles continued next with ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as &quot;Harrison J. Ford&quot; in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[A Time for Killing]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Inger Stevens]], but the &quot;J&quot; did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|a silent film actor named Harrison Ford]], who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Ford soon dropped the &quot;J&quot; and worked for [[Universal Studios]], playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' as an arrested student protester. French filmmaker [[Jacques Demy]] chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]'' (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had &quot;no future&quot; in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to [[Gary Lockwood]]. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Nichols | first=Peter M. | title=New DVDs; Unknown Harrison Ford With No Future | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 9, 2003 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/movies/new-dvd-s-unknown-harrison-ford-with-no-future.html | access-date=July 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2013/04/08/03002-20130408ARTFIG00281-harrison-ford-demy-avait-foi-en-moi.php Harrison Ford: «Jacques Demy avait foi en moi»], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', April 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional [[carpentry|carpenter]]&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; to support his then-wife and two young sons. Casting director and fledgling producer [[Fred Roos]] championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with [[George Lucas]] for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army officer named &quot;G. Lucas&quot;.

===1977–1997===
Ford's previous work in ''American Graffiti'' eventually landed him his first starring film role when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in Lucas' upcoming epic space-opera film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as [[Han Solo]].&lt;ref&gt;Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' became one of the most successful and groundbreaking films of all time, and brought Ford, and his co-stars [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Carrie Fisher]], widespread recognition. He returned to star in the similarly successful ''Star Wars'' sequels ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), as well as the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to [[kill off]] Han Solo at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'', saying, &quot;That would have given the whole film a bottom,&quot; but Lucas refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|title=Harrison Ford Wanted Han Solo to Die|work=Starpulse|date=March 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506212332/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|archivedate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following ''Star Wars'', Ford began to receive bigger roles in films throughout the late 1970s, including ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978) and ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Ford also co-starred alongside [[Gene Wilder]] in the buddy-comedy western  ''[[The Frisco Kid]]'' (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. 

[[File:Harrison Ford and Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|left|Ford with [[Chandran Rutnam]] on the set of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' in [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]], 1983]]
Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified with ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), an action-adventure collaboration between George Lucas and [[Steven Spielberg]] that gave Ford his second franchise role as the heroic, globe-trotting archaeologist [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]. Like ''Star Wars'', the film was massively successful and became the highest-grossing film of the year. Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, but Lucas was not, having already worked with the actor in ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars''. Lucas eventually relented after [[Tom Selleck]] was unable to accept.&lt;ref&gt;(DVD) Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy. Paramount Pictures. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford went on to reprise the role throughout the rest of the decade in the prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which co-starred Spielberg's future-wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and the sequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), which co-starred [[Sean Connery]] as Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr. During the June 1983 filming of ''Temple of Doom'' in [[London]], Ford herniated a disc in his back. The 40-year-old actor was forced to fly back to Los Angeles for surgery and returned six weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Rinzer, J.

Following his leading-man success as Indiana Jones, he played Rick Deckard in [[Ridley Scott]]'s dystopian science-fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). Compared to his experiences on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, Ford had a difficult time with the production. He recalled to [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], “It was a long slog. I didn’t really find it that physically difficult—I thought it was mentally difficult.” Ford and Scott also had differing views on the nature of his character, Deckard, that persist decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/the-battle-for-blade-runner-harrison-ford-ridley-scott|title=Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, and the Battle for Blade Runner|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not initially a success, ''Blade Runner'' went on to become a cult classic and one of Ford's most highly regarded films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner|title=Blade Runner Reviews|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also proved his versatility throughout the 1980s with dramatic parts in films such as ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), and ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' (1988) as well as the romantic male lead opposite [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the comedy-drama ''[[Working Girl]]'' (1988). ''Witness'' and ''The Mosquito Coast'' in particular allowed Ford to explore his potential as a dramatic actor and both performances were widely acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023854_witness|title=Witness Reviews|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mosquito_coast|title=The Mosquito Coast Reviews|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford would later recall that working with director [[Peter Weir]] on both ''Witness'' and ''The Mosquito Coast''  were two of the best experiences of his career.&lt;ref&gt;(DVD) Between Two Worlds: The Making of Witness. Paramount Pictures. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Ford became the second of five actors to portray [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] in two films of the  [[ Jack Ryan film series|film series]] based on the literary character created by [[Tom Clancy]]: ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992) and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994), both co-starring [[Anne Archer]] and [[James Earl Jones]]. Ford took over the role from [[Alec Baldwin]] who had previously played the character in ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990). This led to a long-lasting resentment from Baldwin who claimed to have wanted to reprise the role but Ford had negotiated with Paramount behind his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alec-baldwin-harrison-ford-feud-2017-4|title=Baldwin and Ford Feud|website=Business Insider|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also played leading roles in other action-based thrillers throughout the decade such as the critically acclaimed ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]] ''(1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1046129_fugitive|title=The Fugitive Reviews|website=RottenTomatoes|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Devil's Own]]'' (1997), and ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997). For his performance in ''The Fugitive'', which also co-starred [[Tommy Lee Jones]], Ford received some of the best reviews of his career, including from [[Roger Ebert]] who concluded that, &quot;Ford is once again the great modern movie everyman. As an actor, nothing he does seems merely for show, and in the face of this melodramatic material he deliberately plays down, lays low, gets on with business instead of trying to exploit the drama in meaningless acting flourishes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-fugitive-1993|title= The Fugitive Review|website=Roger Ebert|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played more straight dramatic roles in ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990) and ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991) as well as another romantic lead in ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1995), a remake of a classic [[Sabrina (1954 film)|1954 film]] with the same name.

Ford established working relationships with many well-regarded directors during this time, including Peter Weir, [[Alan J. Pakula]], [[Mike Nichols]], [[Phillip Noyce]], and [[Sydney Pollack]], collaborating twice with each of them. This was the most lucrative period of Ford's career. From 1977 to 1997, he appeared in fourteen films that reached the top fifteen in the yearly domestic box office rankings, twelve of which reached the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/|title=Top Box Office 1977-Present|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the films he appeared in during this time were also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] amongst numerous other awards: ''Star Wars'', ''Apocalypse Now'', ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', ''Witness'', ''Working Girl'', and ''The Fugitive''.

===1998–2014===
In the late 1990s, Ford started appearing in several critically derided and/or commercially disappointing films that failed to match his earlier successes, including ''[[Six Days, Seven Nights]]'' (1998), ''[[Random Hearts]]'' (1999), ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'' (2002), ''[[Hollywood Homicide]]'' (2003), ''[[Firewall (film)|Firewall]]'' (2006) and ''[[Extraordinary Measures]]'' (2010). One exception was ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000) which grossed over $155{{nbsp}}million in the United States and $291{{nbsp}}million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whatliesbeneath.htm |title=What Lies Beneath (2000) |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford served as an executive producer on ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' and ''Extraordinary Measures'', both of which were based on true events. In the 2001 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', Ford was listed as the richest male actor in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMBD&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Harrison Ford Trivia|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/trivia|accessdate=April 23, 2018|work=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller ''[[Syriana]]'', later commenting that &quot;I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/03/harrison_ford_regrets_passing_on_syriana |title=Harrison Ford Regrets Passing on 'Syriana' |publisher=Starpulse |date=March 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531064559/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/03/harrison_ford_regrets_passing_on_syriana |archivedate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role eventually went to [[George Clooney]], who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Prior to that, Ford had passed on a role in another [[Stephen Gaghan]]-written film, that of Robert Wakefield in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'', which eventually went to [[Michael Douglas]].

[[File:Harrison Ford Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Ford at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', the first Indiana Jones film in nineteen years and another collaboration with Lucas and Spielberg. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2008&amp;p=.htm |title=2008 Worldwide Grosses |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford later said he would like to star in another sequel, &quot;...if it didn't take another 20 years to digest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ied0764c52ea0c6b79e5a439cf257d65d |title=Can you dig it?

Other 2008 work included ''[[Crossing Over (film)|Crossing Over]]'', directed by Wayne Kramer. In the film, Ford plays an ICE/[[Homeland Security Investigations]] Special Agent, working alongside [[Ashley Judd]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. He also narrated a feature documentary film about the [[Dalai Lama]] entitled ''[[Dalai Lama Renaissance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailamafilm.com |title=Dalai Lama Renaissance Documentary Film |publisher=Dalailamafilm.com |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford filmed the medical drama ''[[Extraordinary Measures]]'' in 2009 in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turnquist|first1=Kristi|title='Extraordinary Measures,' filmed in Portland and starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford, opens Friday|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2010/01/extraordinary_measures_filmed.html|accessdate=June 22, 2017|work=OregonLive|issue=The Oregonian|date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released January 22, 2010, the film also starred [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Alan Ruck]].

2013 began a trend that saw Ford accepting more diverse supporting roles. That year, Ford co-starred in the corporate espionage thriller ''[[Paranoia (2013 film)|Paranoia]]'' with [[Liam Hemsworth]] and [[Gary Oldman]], who he had previously worked with in ''Air Force One'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=Corporate Espionage Thriller 'Paranoia' to Star Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Liam Hemsworth|url=https://collider.com/harrison-ford-gary-oldman-liam-hemsworth-paranoia/158997/|website=Collider|date=April 13, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also appeared in ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'', ''[[42 (film)|42]]'' and ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]''.

Ford stepped down as program chairman in 2009 and was replaced by Captain [[Chesley Sullenberger]] and First Officer [[Jeff Skiles]]. He is involved with the EAA chapter in [[Driggs, Idaho]], just over the [[Teton Range]] from Jackson, Wyoming.

===Incidents===
On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a [[Bell 206|Bell 206L4 LongRanger]] helicopter (N36R). The [[NTSB]] accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the [[Lake Piru]] riverbed near [[Santa Clarita, California]], on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an [[autorotation]] with powered recovery, Ford allowed the helicopter's altitude to drop to 150–200 feet&lt;!-- Is this altitude change correct? It's not in the NTSB report, but it says the FAA minimum is 8–10', depending on aircraft type. --&gt; before beginning power-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AirSafe.com, LLC |url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/celebs/ford.htm |title=Helicopter Accident Involving Actor Harrison Ford |publisher=Airsafe.com |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot [[James Lipton]] in an interview on the TV show ''[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]'', Ford replied, &quot;I broke it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19997&amp;key=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030515230949/https://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=20001212X19997&amp;key=1 |archivedate=May 15, 2003 |title=LAX00LA024 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex-selective abortion===
Due to the preference in Rural Chinese society to give birth to a son,&lt;ref&gt;Hardee, Karen, Gu Baochang, and Xie Zhenming. 2000. &quot;Holding up more than half the sky:Fertility control and women's empowerment in China&quot;,paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, 23–25 March, Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; [[prenatal sex discernment]] and [[sex-selective abortions]] are illegal in China.&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, &quot;Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China&quot;, Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Often argued as one of the key factors in the imbalanced sex-ratio in China, as excess female infant mortality and underreporting of female births cannot solely explain this gender disparity.&lt;ref&gt;Hesketh, Therese. Lu, Li. Xing, Zhu Wei, Sept 2005, &quot;The Effect of China's One-Child Family Policy After 25 Years, The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 353, Iss. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that the gender of the firstborn child in rural parts of China impacts whether or not the mother will seek an ultrasound for the second child. 40% of women with a firstborn son seek an [[Pregnancy ultrasound|ultrasound]] for their second pregnancy, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This clearly depicts a desire for women to birth a son if one has not yet been birthed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Junhong, Chu 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Junhong | first1 = Chu | year = 2001 | title = Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 259–81 | doi = 10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00259.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, the Chinese government made sex-selective abortions illegal in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Junhong, Chu 2001&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
The policy is controversial outside China for many reasons, including accusations of human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy, as well as concerns about negative social consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;policy outgrown&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hvistendahl | first1 = Mara |title= Has China Outgrown The One-Child Policy? |journal=Science|pages= 1458–61 |volume= 329 |date= 17 September 2010|doi= 10.1126/science.329.5998.1458|pmid= 20847244|issue= 5998| bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1458H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement of the effect of the policy on birth reduction===
The Chinese government, quoting Zhai Zhenwu, director of Renmin University's School of Sociology and Population in Beijing, estimates that 400{{nbsp}}million births were prevented by the one-child policy as of 2011, while some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level, according to CNN.&lt;ref&gt;Some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhai clarified that the 400{{nbsp}}million estimate referred not just to the one-child policy, but includes births prevented by predecessor policies implemented one decade before, stating that &quot;there are many different numbers out there but it doesn't change the basic fact that the policy prevented a really large number of births&quot;.&lt;ref name=boston.com/&gt;

This claim is disputed by Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy, and Cai Yong from the [[Carolina Population Center]] at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill&lt;ref name=boston.com/&gt; Wang claims that &quot;Thailand and China have had almost identical fertility trajectories since the mid 1980s&quot;, and &quot;Thailand does not have a one-child policy.&quot;&lt;ref name=boston.com&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2011/10/27/chinas_touting_of_1_child_rules_draws_challenges/ | title = Experts challenge China's 1-child population claim | newspaper = Boston.com | date = 27 October 2011 | last1 = Olesen | first1 = Alexa | access-date = 10 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120105095058/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2011/10/27/chinas_touting_of_1_child_rules_draws_challenges/ | archive-date = 5 January 2012 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
China's Health Ministry has also disclosed that at least 336{{nbsp}}million abortions were performed on account of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9933468/336-million-abortions-under-Chinas-one-child-policy.html|title=336 million abortions under China's one-child policy|date=15 March 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|last1=Moore|first1=Malcolm|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124201624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9933468/336-million-abortions-under-Chinas-one-child-policy.html|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the US embassy, scholarship published by Chinese scholars and their presentations at the October 1997 Beijing conference of the [[International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]] seemed to suggest that market-based incentives or increasing voluntariness is not morally better but that it is, in the end, more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218215046/http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 February 2013|publisher=U.S. Embassy in Beijing|date=June 1988|title=PRC Family Planning: The Market Weakens Controls But Encourages Voluntary Limits}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of [[Yale University]] discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the [[Household-responsibility system|contract responsibility system]] in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period.&lt;ref&gt;PRC journal ''Social Sciences in China'' [Zhongguo, January 1988]{{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng contended that the &quot;big cooking pot&quot; system of the [[People's commune|People's Commune]]s had [[Moral hazard|insulated people from the costs]] of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.

A long-term experiment in a county in Shanxi, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that families would not have many more children even if the law were abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT72212&quot;/&gt; A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenhalgh, Susan|year=2003|title=Science, Modernity, and the Making of China's One-Child Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=29|issue=June|pages=163–196|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/cmm2436/china%27s_one-child_policy.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2003.00163.x|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205950/https://webspace.utexas.edu/cmm2436/china%27s_one-child_policy.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unequal enforcement===
Corrupted government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinanews&quot;/&gt; Filmmaker Zhang Yimou had three children and was subsequently fined 7.48{{nbsp}}million yuan ($1.2{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China: Filmmaker Zhang Yimou fined $1M for breach of one-child policy - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/world/asia/filmmaker-one-child-policy-fine/index.html|website = CNN|access-date = 3 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151108021024/http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/world/asia/filmmaker-one-child-policy-fine/index.html|archive-date = 8 November 2015|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in Hunan province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinanews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=[[Xinhua]] | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/08/content_912620.htm | title=Over 1,900 officials breach birth policy in C.

Some of the offending officials did not face penalties,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinanews&quot;/&gt; although the government did respond by raising fines and calling on local officials to &quot;expose the celebrities and high-income people who violate the family planning policy and have more than one child&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinanews&quot;/&gt; Also, people who lived in the rural areas of China were allowed to have two children without punishment, although the family is required to wait a couple of years before having another child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=chan|first1=peggy|title=Cultures of the world China|date=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights violations===
{{Further |Human rights in China}}
The one-child policy has been challenged for violating a [[human right]] to determine the size of one's own proper family. According to a 1968 proclamation of the International Conference on Human Rights, &quot;Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FREEDMAN&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Freedman|first1= Lynn P.|first2= Stephen L.|last2= Isaacs|date= Jan–Feb 1993|title= Human Rights and Reproductive Choice|journal= Studies in Family Planning|volume= 24|issue= 1|pages= 18–30|access-date= 8 December 2007|doi= 10.2307/2939211|jstor= 2939211|pmid= 8475521|url= http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/diana/fulltext/free3.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194753/http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/diana/fulltext/free3.pdf|archive-date= 29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teheran_proc&gt;{{cite web |title= Proclamation of Teheran |publisher= International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968 |url= http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm |access-date= 8 November 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|archive-date= 17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UK newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for [[Huaiji County]], [[Guangdong]] in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy. According to the article local officials were being pressured into purchasing portable ultrasound devices to identify abortion candidates in remote villages. The article also reported that women as far along as 8.5 months pregnant were forced to abort, usually by an [[Instillation abortion|injection of saline solution]].&lt;ref name=abort&gt;{{cite news | title = Chinese region 'must conduct 20,000 abortions' | newspaper = [[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] | date = 8 April 2001 | last1 = McElroy | first1 = Damien | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1336466/Chinese-region-must-conduct-20000-abortions.html | location = London | access-date = 5 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180724062555/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1336466/Chinese-region-must-conduct-20000-abortions.html | archive-date = 24 July 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 book by social scientist and anti-abortion political activist [[Steven W.

According to a 2005 news report by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] correspondent John Taylor, China outlawed the use of physical force to make a woman submit to an abortion or sterilization in 2002 but ineffectively enforces the measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1432717.htm |title=China&amp;nbsp;– One Child Policy |access-date=1 July 2008 |last1=Taylor |first1=John |date=8 February 2005 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612191059/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1432717.htm |archive-date=12 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Forced abortion of Feng Jianmei|Feng Jianmei]], a villager from Shaanxi province was forced into an abortion by local officials after her family refused to pay the fine for having a second child.

In the past, China promoted [[eugenics]] as part of its population planning policies, but the government has backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite journal | title = Implications of China's Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/china/v008/8.1.petersen.html | journal = China: An International Journal | access-date = 12 May 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015140001/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=%2Fjournals%2Fchina%2Fv008%2F8.1.petersen.html | archive-date = 15 October 2014 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent{{when|date=October 2013}} research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of [[informed consent]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleeboom-Faulkner|first1=Margaret Elizabeth |title= Genetic testing, governance, and the family in the People's Republic of China|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=1 June 2011|volume=72|issue=11|pages=1802–9|doi= 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.03.052|pmid=20627498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a premarital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe19d6.pdf | newspaper = Australia: Refugee Review Tribunal | access-date = 10 September 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111209204518/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe19d6.pdf | archive-date = 9 December 2011 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation offered the following summary as to the long term effects of [[sex-selective abortion]] and abandonment of female infants:

{{Quote|Multiple research studies have also found that sex-selective abortion – where a woman undergoes an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby, and then aborts it if it's a girl – was widespread for years, particularly for second or subsequent children. Millions of female fetuses have been aborted since the 1970s. China outlawed sex selective abortions in 2005, but the law is tough to enforce because of the difficulty of proving why a couple decided to have an abortion. The abandonment, and killing, of baby girls has also been reported, though recent research studies say it has become rare, in part due to strict criminal prohibitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc.ca&quot; /&gt;}}

Anthropologist [[G. William Skinner]] at the [[University of California, Davis]] and Chinese researcher Yuan Jianhua have claimed that infanticide was fairly common in China before the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work = San Jose Mercury News | place = [[California|CA]] |date=15 March 2000|title=Experts Allege Infanticide In China — 'Missing' Girls Killed, Abandoned, Pair Say| last1 =Lubman | first1 = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot is sometimes called Fresnel's spot because it is a direct consequence of his work, and Arago's spot because Arago devised the experiment that confirmed its existence.&quot; Katz, Debora M., ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Foundations and Connections, Advance Edition, Volume 2,'' Cengage Learning, 2015. {{ISBN|1305537203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a bright point that appears at the center of a circular object's [[shadow]] due to [[Fresnel diffraction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pedrotti2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walker2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ohanian1989&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hecht2002&quot; /&gt; This spot played an important role in the discovery of the [[wave nature]] of [[light]] and is a common way to demonstrate that light behaves as a wave (for example, in undergraduate physics laboratory exercises).

The basic experimental setup requires a &quot;point source&quot;, such as an illuminated pinhole or a diverging [[laser beam]]. The dimensions of the setup must comply with the requirements for [[Fresnel diffraction]]. Namely, the [[Fresnel number]] must satisfy
: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{d^2}{\ell \lambda} \gtrsim 1,&lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''d'' is the diameter of the circular object,
: ''ℓ'' is the distance between the object and the screen, and
: ''λ'' is the wavelength of the source.

Finally, the edge of the circular object must be sufficiently smooth.

These conditions together explain why the bright spot is not encountered in everyday life. However, with the [[laser|laser sources]] available today, it is undemanding to perform an Arago-spot experiment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/images/Questar/PoissonSpot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the Arago spot can also be observed in the strongly defocussed image of a [[star]] in a [[Newtonian telescope]]. There, the star provides an almost ideal [[point source]] at infinity, and the [[secondary mirror]] of the telescope constitutes the circular obstacle.

When light shines on the circular obstacle, [[Huygens' principle]] says that every point in the plane of the obstacle acts as a new point source of light. The light coming from points on the [[circumference]] of the obstacle and going to the center of the shadow travels exactly the same distance, so all the light passing close by the object arrives at the screen in [[phase (waves)|phase]] and constructively [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]]. This results in a bright spot at the shadow's center, where [[geometrical optics]] and [[particle theory of light|particle theories of light]] predict that there should be no light at all.

==History==

At the beginning of the 19th century, the idea that light does not simply propagate along straight lines gained traction. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] published his [[Young's Double Slit Interferometer|double-slit experiment]] in 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;young1807&quot;/&gt; The original Arago spot experiment was carried out a decade later and was the deciding experiment on the question of whether light is a particle or a wave. It is thus an example of an ''[[experimentum crucis]]''.

At that time, many favored Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory of light, among them the theoretician [[Siméon Denis Poisson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newton1704&quot;/&gt; In 1818 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] launched a competition to explain the properties of light, where Poisson was one of the members of the judging committee. The civil engineer [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] entered this competition by submitting a new [[wave theory of light]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel1868&quot;/&gt;

Poisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and, being a supporter of the particle theory of light, looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel's theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle theory of light. Since the Arago spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, Poisson interpreted it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory.

However, the head of the committee, [[François Arago|Dominique-François-Jean Arago]] (who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France), decided to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2&amp;nbsp;mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.&lt;ref name=&quot;fresnel1868_arago&quot;/&gt; He succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave nature of light and gave Fresnel the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arago|title=Rapport fait par M. Arago à l'Académie des Sciences, au nom de la Commission qui avait été chargée d'examiner les Mémoires envoyés au concours pour le prix de la diffraction.|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1819|volume=11|pages=5–30|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858046217711;view=1up;seq=11|series=2nd series|trans-title=Report made by Mr. Arago to the Academy of Sciences in the name of the commission which had been charged with examining the memoirs submitted to the competition for the diffraction prize.|language=French}}  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858046217711;view=1up;seq=22 From p. 16:]  ''&quot;L'un de vos commissaires, M. Poisson, avait déduit des intégrales rapportées par l'auteur, le résultat singulier que le centre de l'ombre d'un écran circulaire opaque devait, lorsque les rayons y pénétraient sous des incidences peu obliques, être aussi éclairé que si l'écran n'existait pas.  Cette conséquence a été soumise à l'épreuve d'une expérience directe, et l'observation a parfaitement confirmé le calcul (e).&quot;''  (One of your commissioners, Mr. Poisson, had deduced from the integrals [that had been] reported by the author [i.e., Mr. Fresnel], the strange result that the center of the shadow of an opaque circular screen should — when the [light] rays penetrate it [i.e., the shadow] at slightly oblique incidences — also be illuminated as if the screen didn't exist.  This result has been submitted to the test of a direct experiment, and observation has perfectly confirmed the calculation (e).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arago later noted that the phenomenon (later known as &quot;Poisson's spot&quot; or the &quot;spot of Arago&quot;) had already been observed by [[Joseph-Nicolas Delisle|Delisle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;delisle1715&quot;/&gt; and [[Giacomo F. Maraldi|Maraldi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;maraldi1723&quot;/&gt; a century earlier. It only turned out much later (in one of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]]) that light can be equally described as a particle ([[wave–particle duality]] of light).

==Theory==

[[File:huygensfresnelintegral.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Notation for calculating the wave amplitude at point P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from a spherical point source at P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

At the heart of Fresnel's wave theory is the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], which states that every unobstructed point of a wavefront becomes the source of a secondary spherical [[wavelet]] and that the amplitude of the optical field ''E'' at a point on the screen is given by the superposition of all those secondary wavelets taking into account their relative phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;sommerfeld&quot;/&gt; This means that the field at a point P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the screen is given by a surface integral:

:&lt;math&gt;
U(P_1) =  \frac{A e^{\mathbf{i} k r_0}}{r_0}  \int_S \frac{e^{\mathbf{i} k r_1}}{r_1} K(\chi) \, dS,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the inclination factor &lt;math&gt;K(\chi)&lt;/math&gt; which ensures that the secondary wavelets do not propagate backwards is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
K(\chi) = \frac{\mathbf{i}}{2 \lambda} (1 + \cos(\chi))
&lt;/math&gt;

and

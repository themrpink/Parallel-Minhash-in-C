'''Magna Graecia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|ɡ|n|ə|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|s|j|ə|,_|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|ʃ|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|m|æ|ɡ|n|ə|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}; [[Latin]] meaning &quot;Great Greece&quot;, {{lang-grc|Μεγάλη Ἑλλάς}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Megálē Hellás}}'', {{lang-it|Magna Grecia}}) was the name given by the Romans to the coastal areas of [[Southern Italy]] in the present-day regions of [[Campania]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]]; these regions were [[Greek colonisation|extensively populated]] by [[Greeks|Greek]] settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tozer2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Fanshawe Tozer|title=A History of Ancient Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsS0BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-07875-7|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers who began arriving in the 8th century BC brought with them their [[Hellenic civilization]] which left a lasting imprint on Italy such as in the culture of [[ancient Rome]]. They also influenced the native peoples, especially the Sicilian [[Sicels]], who became [[Hellenization|hellenised]] after they adopted the Greek culture as their own.

The term Magna Graecia first appears in [[Polybius]]' ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[wikisource:The_Histories_(Paton_translation)/Book_II#39|ii. 39]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Graham, &quot;The colonial expansion of Greece&quot;, in John Boardman et al., ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol. III, part 3, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Ovid]] notably referred to the south of Italy as such in his poem ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.

==Antiquity==
{{Main|Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies}}
{{further|Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul}}
According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', the colonization of Magna Graecia had already begun by the time of the [[Trojan War]] and lasted for several centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geographica|chapter=I, Section I|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Str.%201.1.3|language=el|volume=VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th and 7th century BC, due to demographic crises (famine, overcrowding, etc.), ''[[Stasis (political history)|stasis]]'', a developing need for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland after wars, Greeks began to settle in southern Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CerchiaiJannelli2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luca Cerchiai|author2=Lorena Jannelli|author3=Fausto Longo|title=The Greek Cities of Magna Graecia and Sicily|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH32nSiCue0C|year=2004|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-751-1|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonies began to be established all over the Mediterranean and Black Seas (with the exception of Northwestern Africa, in the sphere of influence of Carthage), including in Sicily and the southern part of the [[Italian Peninsula]]. The Romans called this area ''Magna Graecia'' (Latin for &quot;Great Greece&quot;) since it was so densely inhabited by the [[Greeks]]. Ancient [[geographer]]s differed on whether the term included Sicily or merely [[Apulia]], [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]], [[Strabo]] being the most prominent advocate of the wider definitions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

With colonization, [[Greek culture]] was exported to Italy in its dialects of the [[Ancient Greek language]], its religious rites and its traditions of the independent ''[[polis]]''. An original [[Hellenic civilization]] soon developed and later interacted with the native [[Italic languages|Italic]] civilisations. The most important cultural transplant was the [[Chalcis|Chalcidean]]/[[Cumaean alphabet|Cumaean]] variety of the [[Greek alphabet]], which was adopted by the [[Etruscans]]; the [[Old Italic alphabet]] subsequently evolved into the [[Latin alphabet]], which became the most widely used alphabet in the world.

These Hellenic colonies became very rich and powerful, and some still stand today such as Neapolis (&quot;New City&quot;, now [[Naples]]), [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], [[Akragas]] (Agrigento), Taras ([[Taranto]]), [[Rhegion]] (Reggio Calabria), or [[Crotone|Kroton]] (Crotone).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The first Greek city to be absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] was Neapolis in 327 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.73366|quote=Roman Republic Neapolis in 327 BC.|title=A Short History of the Roman Republic|last=Heitland|first=William Emerton|date=1911|publisher=The University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.73366/page/n6 72]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Greek cities in Italy followed during the [[Samnite Wars]] and the [[Pyrrhic War]]; Taras was the last to fall in 272.  Sicily was conquered by Rome during the [[First Punic War]].  Only Syracuse remained independent until 212, because its king [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]] was a devoted ally of the Romans. His grandson [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] however made an alliance with [[Hannibal]], which prompted the Romans to [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|besiege the city]], which fell in 212, despite the machines of [[Archimedes]] as Proclus writes in his commentary on Euclid's Elements Archimedes constructed weapons functioning with compressed air, with weights and counterweights as Ctesibius and Hero explain&lt;ref&gt;Proclus Phil., In primum Euclidis elementorum librum commentarii Page 41, line 7, Πρὸς δὴ ταύταις ἡ μηχανικὴ καλουμένη τῆς περὶ τὰ αἰσθητὰ καὶ τὰ ἔνυλα πραγματείας μέρος ὑπάρχουσα, ὑπὸ δὲ ταύτην ἥ τε ὀργανοποιϊκὴ τῶν κατὰ  πόλεμον ἐπιτηδείων ὀργάνων, οἷα δὴ καὶ Ἀρχιμήδης λέγεται κατασκευάσαι τῶν πολεμούντων τὴν Συράκουσαν ἀμυντικὰ ὄργανα, καὶ ἡ θαυματοποιϊκὴ τὰ μὲν διὰ πνῶν φιλοτεχνοῦσα, ὥσπερ καὶ Κτησίβιος καὶ Ἥρων πραγματεύονται, τὰ δὲ διὰ ῥοπῶν, ὧν τῆς μὲν κινήσεως τὴν ἀνισορροπίαν αἰτιατέον, τῆς δὲ στάσεως τὴν ἰσορροπίαν, ὥσπερ καὶ ὁ Τίμαιος διώρισεν, τὰ δὲ διὰ νεύρων καὶ σπάρτων ἐμψύχους ὁλκὰς καὶ  κινήσεις ἀπομιμουμένων&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Middle Ages==
{{History of Greece}}
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], following the disastrous [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]], new waves of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Christian Greeks]] may have come to Southern Italy from [[Greece]] and [[Asia Minor]], as [[Southern Italy]] remained loosely governed by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Although possible, the archaeological evidence shows no trace of new arrivals of Greek peoples, only a division between barbarian newcomers, and Greco-Roman locals. The iconoclast emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] appropriated lands that had been granted to the Papacy in southern Italy and the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire continued to govern the area in the form of the [[Catapanate of Italy]] through the Middle Ages, well after northern Italy fell to the Lombards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=T. S. |date=1979 |title=The Church of Ravenna and the Imperial Administration in the Seventh Century |journal=The English Historical Review |volume= 94|issue= 370|pages=5 |jstor=567155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]]' late medieval conquest of southern Italy and Sicily (in the late 12th century), the [[Salento]] peninsula (the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy) and up to one third of Sicily was still Greek speaking (concentrated in the [[Val Demone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G.

While in Apulia Greeks were in a majority – and indeed present in any numbers at all – only in the Salento peninsula in the extreme south, at the time of the conquest they had an overwhelming preponderance in Lucaina and central and southern Calabria, as well as comprising anything up to a third of the population of Sicily, concentrated especially in the north-east of the island, the Val Demone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the language had evolved into medieval Greek, also known as [[Byzantine Greek]], and its speakers were known as [[Byzantine Greeks]]. The resultant fusion of local Byzantine Greek culture with Norman and Arab culture (from the Arab occupation of Sicily) gave rise to [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture]] on Sicily.

A remnant of this influence can be found in the survival of the Greek language in some villages of the above mentioned Salento peninsula (the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy). This living dialact of Greek, known locally as [[Griko language|Griko]], is found in the Italian regions of [[Calabria]] and [[Apulia]]. ''Griko'' is considered by linguistics to be a descendant of [[Byzantine Greek]], which had been the majority language of Salento through the Middle Ages, combining also some ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and modern [[Italian language|Italian]] elements. There is a rich [[oral history|oral tradition]] and Griko [[folklore]], limited now but once numerous, to around 30,000 people, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. Some scholars, such as [[Gerhard Rohlfs]], argue that the origins of Griko may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohlfs |first1=Gerhard |date=1967 |title=Greek Remnants in Southern Italy |journal=The Classical Journal |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=164–9 |jstor=3295569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Italy==
Although many of the Greek inhabitants of [[Southern Italy]] were entirely [[Linguistic Latinisation|Latinized]] during the Middle Ages, pockets of Greek culture and language remained and survived into modernity partly because of continuous migration between southern Italy and the [[Geography of Greece#Mainland|Greek mainland]]. One example is the [[Griko people]] in [[Apulia]], some of whom still maintain their Greek language and customs. Their working practices have been passed down through generations through storytelling and allowing the observation of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agrifoglio2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Rocco Agrifoglio|title=Knowledge Preservation Through Community of Practice: Theoretical Issues and Empirical Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1t4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|date=29 August 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-22234-9|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian parliament recognizes the Griko people as an ethnolinguistic minority under the official name of ''Minoranze linguistiche Grike dell'Etnia Griko-Calabrese e Salentina''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MolaPennarola2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lapo Mola|author2=Ferdinando Pennarola|author3=Stefano Za|title=From Information to Smart Society: Environment, Politics and Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afzYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-09450-2|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek nobles started taking refuge in Italy following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChatzēdakēCorrer1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nanō Chatzēdakē|author2=Museo Correr|title=From Candia to Venice: Greek icons in Italy, 15th-16th centuries : Museo Correr, Venice, 17 September-30 October, 1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIROAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1993|publisher=Foundation for Hellenic Culture|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks returned to the region in the 16th and 17th centuries in reaction to the conquest of the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Especially after the end of the [[Siege of Coron]] (1534), large numbers of Greeks took refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. Greeks from [[Koroni|Coroni]], the so-called Coronians, were nobles, who brought with them substantial movable property. They were granted special privileges and tax exemptions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Other Greeks who moved to Italy came from the [[Mani Peninsula]] of the Peloponnese.

'''Pope Paschal I''' ({{lang-la|Paschalis I}}; died 824) was the [[bishop of Rome]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 25 January 817 to his death in 824.

Paschal was a member of an aristocratic Roman family. Before his election to the papacy, he was abbot of St. Stephen's monastery, which served pilgrims. In Rome  in 823 he·crowned [[Lothair I]] as [[coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]]. He rebuilt a number of churches in Rome, including three basilicas.

==Early life==
According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', Paschal was a native of [[Rome]] and son of Bonosus and [[Episcopa Theodora]]. The ''[[Liber Censuum]]'' says that Paschal was from the [[Massimo family]], as was his predecessor, [[Pope Stephen IV|Stephen IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g9n13&quot;&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 9 &amp; n.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Leo III]] placed Paschal in charge of the monastery of [[St Stephen of the Abyssinians]], where his responsibilities included the care of pilgrims visiting Rome.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;{{catholic|title=Pope Paschal I|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11514a.htm|last=Kirsch|first=Johann Peter|volume=11|year=1911|access-date=13 September 2017|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to early modern accounts, Leo III may have elevated Paschal as the [[cardinal priest]] of [[Santa Prassede]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g9&quot;&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goodson attributes this account to a &quot;desire to explain the attention that the pope so lavishly and prominently paid to that church later in his career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;g9&quot;/&gt;

==Accession==
Paschal became [[pope]] on 25 January 817, just one day after the sudden death of Stephen IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;g9&quot;/&gt; This decision was made without the sanction of Emperor [[Louis the Pious]]. Paschal began his pontificate apologizing for this slight, stressing that the office had been thrust upon him.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Richard P. |title=Lives of the Popes |date=2000 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-065304-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/132 132-133] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the decision had been made to avoid factional strife in Rome. According to the ''Liber Pontificalis'', Pope Paschal's [[papal legate|legate]] Theodore returned with a document titled ''Pactum cum Pashali pontiff'', in which the emperor congratulated Paschal, recognized his sovereignty over the [[Papal States]], and guaranteed the free election of future pontiffs.&lt;ref name=Kelly1&gt;John N.D. Kelly, ''Gran Dizionario Illustrato dei Papi'', p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; This document has since been challenged by historians as a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Rendina, ''I papi'', p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papacy==

At first, Emperor Louis confirmed the agreement reached in [[Rheims]] with Paschal's predecessor, Stephen IV, and detailed in the document ''[[Pactum Ludovicanum]]'' about free papal elections and noninterference in Church affairs unless officially asked for help. The two worked together to send Archbishop [[Ebbo]] of Rheims to evangelize the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] in 822.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Easter Sunday of 823, Paschal [[coronation|crowned]] and [[anointed]] Louis's son [[Lothair I]]. Lothair was less amenable to cooperating with the Papal Curia than his father. He held a court and declared [[Farfa Abbey]], just north of Rome, exempt from papal taxation. Paschal's aristocratic opponents in the papal palace, especially his former legate, Theodore, and his son-in-law, Leo, who turned to the young leader of the Franks for support in their opposition to Paschal.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; The decision outraged the Roman nobility and led to an uprising against the authority of the Roman Curia in northern Italy led by Theodore and Leo. The revolt was quickly suppressed, and two of its leaders were seized, blinded, and afterwards beheaded by members of the papal household. Paschal denied any involvement, but the Emperor remained suspicious and sent two commissioners to investigate. Paschal refused to submit to the authority of the imperial court, but he did take an oath of purgation before a synod of thirty-four bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;/&gt; The commissioners returned to [[Aachen]], and Emperor Louis let the matter drop.

===Construction projects===
Paschal gave shelter to exiled monks from the [[Byzantine Empire]] who had fled persecution for their opposition to [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclasm]]. He both offered the exiled Byzantine mosaic artists work decorating churches in Rome&lt;ref name=Kelly1/&gt; and wrote to Louis the Pious&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Byzantine emperor [[Leo the Armenian]] in support of those who opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;/&gt;

Paschal rebuilt three basilicas of Rome:  [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Maria in Domnica]], and [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These churches contain mosaics with lifelike portraits of Paschal.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;/&gt; Paschal is credited with finding the body of [[Saint Cecilia]] in the [[Catacomb of Callixtus]] and translating it to the rebuild the basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. Paschal also undertook significant renovations on [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, 2010, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Paschal  added two oratories to [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], SS. Processus et Martinianus and SS. Xistus et Fabianus, which did not survive the 16th century renovation of St. Peter's.&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, 2010, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paschal is also sometimes credited with the renovation of [[Santo Stefano del Cacco]] in early modern sources, but this renovation was actually undertaken by [[Pope Paschal II]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 5 n.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Goodson, Paschal &quot;used church-building to express the authority of the papacy as an independent state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;g14&quot;&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===

[[File:Detailed image of Papal bulla of Paschal I 817-824 (FindID 69063).jpg|thumb| [[Papal bulla]] of Paschal I ]]

Only six known letters written by Paschal remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;&gt;Goodson, 2010, p. 8 &amp; n.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first (Jaffé 2546) confirms the possessions of the [[Territorial Abbey of Farfa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;/&gt;  The second and third (Jaffé 2547 and Jaffee 2548) were written to a Frankish abbot prior to and after his elevation as [[Ancient Diocese of Vienne|archbishop of Vienne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;/&gt;  The fourth (Jaffé 2550) was written to [[Louis the Pious]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;/&gt;  The fifth (Jaffé 2551, preserved in the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]]) confirms the privileges of the church of [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;/&gt;  The last (Jaffé 2553) was written to [[Ebbo]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|archbishop of Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philippus Jaffe|editor=S. Loewenfeld|title=Regesta pontificum romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum post Christum natum MCXCVIII|url=https://archive.org/details/regestapontificu01cath|edition=secunda|year=1885|publisher=Veit|location=Leipzig|language=Latin|pages=[https://archive.org/details/regestapontificu01cath/page/318 318]–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g8n11&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
Paschal died on 11 February 824. The Roman Curia refused him the honour of burial within [[St. Peter's Basilica]] because of his harsh government of the Roman people.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;/&gt; He was instead buried in the Basilica of [[Santa Prassede]], which also contains the famous ''[[Episcopa Theodora]]'' mosaic of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;John N.D. Kelly, ''Gran Dizionario Illustrato dei Papi'', p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Paschal was [[canonization|canonized]] in the late sixteenth-century. His feast day in the Roman calendar prior to 1963 was 14 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien Lives&quot;/&gt; It is currently celebrated on 11 February.

The most significant difference between the plot and the historical events is the scene that replaces an incident where the captain threw almost all the submarine's small arms overboard out of concern about the possibility of a mutiny; the film instead portrays an actual attempt at mutiny.

The {{sclass2-|Hotel|submarine}} ''[[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']]'' was portrayed in the film by the [[Juliett class submarine|''Juliett''-class]] ''[[Soviet submarine K-77|K-77]]'', which was significantly modified for the role. [[HMCS Ojibwa (S72)|HMCS ''Ojibwa'']] portrayed the Soviet {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine}} ''S-270''. {{HMCS|Terra Nova|DDE 259|6}} portrayed {{USS|Decatur|DD-936|6}}. The Canadian [[Halifax Shipyard]] stood in for the [[Sevmash]] shipyard of [[Far North (Russia)|northern Russia]].

[[Klaus Badelt]] wrote the film's late-[[Romantic music|Romantic]]-styled [[Film score|score]].

==Reception==
''K-19: The Widowmaker'' received mixed reviews. It has a 61% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 170 reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 6.09/10. It is summarized as being &quot;A gripping drama even though the filmmakers have taken liberties with the facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=K-19: The Widowmaker (2002) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/k19_the_widowmaker/ |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was premiered in [[Russia]] in October 2002, fifty-two veterans of the ''K-19'' submarine accepted flights to the [[Saint Petersburg]] premiere; despite what they saw as technical as well as historical compromises, they praised the film and, in particular, the performance of Harrison Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Titova, Irina.&quot;K-19 Film Premieres at Mariinsky Theater.&quot; ''The St. Petersburg Times'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' to other classic films of the genre, &quot;Movies involving submarines have the logic of chess: The longer the game goes, the fewer the possible remaining moves. ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' joins a tradition that includes ''[[Das Boot]]'' and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' and goes all the way back to ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]''. The variables are always oxygen, water pressure and the enemy. Can the men breathe, will the sub implode, will depth charges destroy it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger. [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/k-19-the-widowmaker-2002 &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker Movie Review (2002).&quot;] ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', July 19, 2003. Retrieved: July 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote: &quot;Why did movie moguls think that this was the right moment for a tale of unflinching loyalty to the Soviet Union?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/stanley-kauffmann/movies?page=3 Stanley Kauffmann at rottentomatoes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gilmore''' (born 1955) is one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[Cypherpunk]]s mailing list, and [[Cygnus Solutions]]. He created the [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]] in [[Usenet]] and is a major contributor to the [[GNU Project]].

An outspoken [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]], Gilmore has [[lawsuit|sued]] the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and others. He was the plaintiff in the prominent case ''[[Gilmore v. Gonzales]]'', challenging [[secret law|secret travel-restriction laws]]. He is also an advocate for [[drug policy reform]].

He co-authored the [[Bootstrap Protocol]] in 1985, which evolved into [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP), the primary way local networks assign an [[IP address]] to devices.

== Life and career ==

As the fifth employee of [[Sun Microsystems]] and founder of [[Cygnus Solutions|Cygnus Support]], he became wealthy enough to retire early and pursue other interests.

He is a frequent contributor to [[free software]], and worked on several [[GNU]] projects, including maintaining the [[GNU Debugger]] in the early 1990s, initiating [[GNU Radio]] in 1998, starting [[Gnash (software)|Gnash]] media player in December 2005 to create a free software player for [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] movies, and writing the pdtar program which became GNU [[Tar (file format)|tar]].  Outside of the GNU project he founded the [[FreeS/WAN]] project, an implementation of [[IPsec]], to promote the encryption of Internet traffic.  He sponsored the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'s [[EFF DES cracker|Deep Crack]] [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] cracker, sponsored the [[Micropolis (software)|Micropolis]] city building game based on [[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]], and is a proponent of [[opportunistic encryption]].

Gilmore co-authored the [[Bootstrap Protocol]] (RFC 951) with Bill Croft in 1985. The Bootstrap Protocol evolved into [[DHCP]], the method by which Ethernet and wireless networks typically assign devices an [[IP address]].

== Activism ==
Gilmore owns the [[domain name]] toad.com, which is one of the [[List of the oldest currently registered Internet domain names|100 oldest]] active [[.com]] domains. It was registered on August 18, 1987. He runs{{When|date=April 2019}} the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] at toad.com as an [[open mail relay]]. In October 2002, Gilmore's ISP, [[Verio]], cut off his Internet access for running an open relay, a violation of Verio's terms of service. Many people contend that open relays make it too easy to send spam. Gilmore protests that his mail server was programmed to be essentially useless to [[Spamming|spammers]] and other senders of mass email and he argues that Verio's actions constitute censorship. He also notes that his configuration makes it easier for friends who travel to send email, although his critics counter that there are other mechanisms to accommodate people wanting to send email while traveling. The measures Gilmore took to make his server useless to spammers may or may not have helped, considering that in 2002, at least one mass-mailing worm that propagated through open relays&amp;nbsp;— W32.Yaha&amp;nbsp;— had been hard-coded to relay through the toad.com mail server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2002-021514-1810-99&amp;tabid=2 |title=W32.Yaha@mm technical details |author=Douglas Knowles |date=February 13, 2007 |website= |publisher=Symantec |access-date=September 26, 2016 |quote=if it cannot connect to the email server listed in that registry key, it will use one of the following: [...21 domain names snipped...], toad.com, [...2 more...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmore famously stated of [[Internet censorship]] that &quot;The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it&quot;.&lt;ref name=Censorship&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html |title=First Nation in Cyberspace |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= December 6, 1993 |access-date= July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of [[Secret law|secret regulations]] regarding travel security policies in ''[[Gilmore v. Gonzales]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UST 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first = Richard | last = Willing  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-10-10-privacy_x.htm | title = Airline ID requirement faces legal challenge | work = [[USA Today]] | date = October 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFC 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Egelko | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/09/BAGR9G53C01.DTL | title = Judges cool to ID complaint | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmore is also an advocate for the relaxing of [[Prohibition of drugs|drug laws]] and has given financial support to [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]], the [[Marijuana Policy Project]], [[Erowid]], [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|MAPS]], [[Flex Your Rights]], and various other organizations seeking to end the [[war on drugs]]. He is a member of the boards of directors of MAPS, the Marijuana Policy Project, and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.maps.org/about/board/ |title=Board |publisher=[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]] |access-date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliations ==
Following the sale of [[AMPRNet]] address space in mid-2019, Gilmore, under [[amateur radio call signs|amateur radio call sign]] W0GNU, was listed as a board member of [[AMPRNet#Amateur Radio Digital Communications (non-profit)|Amateur Radio Digital Communications, Inc.]], a non-profit involved in the management of the [[AMPRNet|{{IPaddr|44.0.0.0|8}}]] resources on behalf of the [[amateur radio]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMPRNet Address Sale|format=email|url=x|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://dewaynenet.wordpress.com/2019/07/19/amprnet-address-sale/|archivedate=2019-07-19|date=2019-07-18|accessdate=2019-07-20|author={{abbr|ARDC|Amateur Radio Digital Communications, Inc.}} Board of Directors|quote=The sale amounts to some millions of dollars, which will be used in the furtherance of {{abbr|ARDC|Amateur Radio Digital Communications, Inc.}}'s continuing public benefit purpose. … The uppermost 1/4 of the former AMPRNet address space ({{IPaddr|44.192.0.0|10}}) has been … sold to another owner … over 12 million IPv4 addresses remain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amprnet-20190720&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ampr.org/amprnet/|title=AMPRNet|first1=Brian|last1=Kantor|first2=Phil|last2=Karn|authorlink2=Phil Karn|first3=K.

'''Cygnus Solutions''', originally '''Cygnus Support''', was founded in 1989 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and David Henkel-Wallace to provide commercial support for [[free software]].  Its tagline was: ''Making free software affordable''.

For years, employees of Cygnus Solutions were the maintainers of several key [[GNU]] software products, including the [[GNU Debugger]] and [[GNU Binutils]] (which included the [[GNU Assembler]] and [[GNU Linker|Linker]]).  It was also a major contributor to the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] project and drove the change in the project's management from having a single gatekeeper to having an independent committee.  Cygnus developed [[Binary File Descriptor library|BFD]], and used it to help port GNU to many architectures, in a number of cases working under [[Non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]] to produce tools used for initial bringup of [[software]] for a new chip design.

Cygnus was also the original developer of [[Cygwin]], a [[POSIX]] layer and the [[GNU]] toolkit port to the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] family, and of [[eCos]], an embedded [[real-time operating system]].

In the 2001 documentary film ''[[Revolution OS]]'', Tiemann indicates that the name &quot;Cygnus&quot; was chosen from among several names that incorporated the acronym &quot;GNU&quot;. According to [[Stan Kelly-Bootle]], it was recursively defined as ''Cygnus, your GNU Support''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 15, 1999, Cygnus Solutions announced its merger with [[Red Hat]], and it ceased to exist as a separate company in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/press-cygnusacquisition|title=Red Hat To Acquire Cygnus and Create Global Open Source Powerhouse|date=November 15, 1999|publisher=[[Red Hat]]|accessdate=2019-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007}}, a number of Cygnus employees continue to work for Red Hat, including Tiemann, who serves as Red Hat's Vice President of Open Source Affairs, and formerly served as CTO.

'''Johannes Vermeer''' (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA-nl|vərˈmeːr|}}; in English, {{IPAc-en|v|əːr|ˈ|m|ɛər}} or
{{IPAc-en|v|əːr|ˈ|m|ɪər}} {{respell|vur|MEER}}, [[#Pronunciation of name|&lt;small&gt;see below&lt;/small&gt;]]; October 1632 – December 1675), original name '''Jan Vermeer van Delft''', was a Dutch [[Baroque Period]]&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Courtney &amp; Courtney Sanford: &quot;Marvelous To Behold&quot; Classical Conversations (2018)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting|painter]] who specialized in domestic interior scenes of [[middle class]] life. During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial [[Genre works|genre painter]], recognized in [[Delft]] and [[The Hague]]. Nonetheless, he produced relatively few paintings and evidently was not wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death.&lt;ref name=Bulfinch/&gt;

Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive [[pigments]]. He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.&lt;!--What strikes in most of his paintings is a certain love, which easily could be called a [[love sickness]], for the people and the objects in his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Oosthoek's ''Geïllustreerde Encyclopaedie'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=Wadum/&gt;

&quot;Almost all his paintings,&quot; Hans Koningsberger wrote, &quot;are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people, mostly women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Koningsberger, Hans. 1977.

His modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in [[Arnold Houbraken]]'s major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (''Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists'') and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_1Ady0GAuUC&amp;pg=PA199|author=Barker, Emma|title=The Changing Status of the Artist|page= 199|publisher= New Haven: Yale University Press|date=1999|isbn= 0-300-07740-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer was largely unknown to the general public, but his reputation was not totally eclipsed after his death: &quot;While it is true that he did not achieve widespread fame until the 19th century, his work had always been valued and admired by well-informed connoisseurs.&quot; Blankert, Albert, et al. ''Vermeer and his Public'', p. 164. New York: Overlook, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58567-979-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] and [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]], who published an essay attributing 66 pictures to him, although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janson&quot;/&gt; Since that time, Vermeer's reputation has grown, and he is now acknowledged as one of the greatest [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]].

Similar to other major Dutch Golden Age artists such as [[Frans Hals]] and [[Rembrandt]], Vermeer never went abroad. Also, like Rembrandt, he was an avid art collector and dealer.

==Pronunciation of name==
In Dutch, ''Vermeer'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|vərˈmeːr|}}, and ''Johannes Vermeer'' as {{IPA-nl|joːˈɦɑnəs fərˈmeːr|}}, with the {{IPA|/v/}} changed to an {{IPA|/f/}}-sound by the preceding voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}. The usual English pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|v|əːr&lt;!--

Comment-- although from the print transcription it looks as though there may be a distinction between a full vowel /vɜːr/ and a reduced vowel /vər/, the sound files indicate these are the same vowel, and just a different in transcription conventions. Also, the fact that dictionaries differ slightly and some are published in the US and some in the UK does not mean that they reflect a national US-UK difference in pronunciation, rather than random variation or the choices of editors. To claim a US-UK distinction, we need a RS that there *is* a US-UK distinction.

==Life==

Relatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/vermeer_the_man.html |title=Vermeer the Man and Painter |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were some registers, a few official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thoré-Bürger named him &quot;The Sphinx of Delft&quot;.&lt;ref name=Delft /&gt; [[John Michael Montias]] added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his ''Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century'' (1982).

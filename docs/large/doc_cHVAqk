They did not themselves advocate the application of Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BJUIOnC534C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=bannister+social+darwinism The Social Meaning of Modern Biology: From Social Darwinism to Sociobiology]&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of American businessmen rejected the anti-philanthropic implications of the theory. Instead they gave millions to build schools, colleges, hospitals, art institutes, parks and many other institutions.

[[H. G. Wells]] was heavily influenced by Darwinist thoughts, and novelist [[Jack London]] wrote stories of survival that incorporated his views on social Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&lt;cite&gt;Borrowing from Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, social Darwinists believed that societies, as do organisms evolve over time. Nature then determined that the strong survive and the weak perish. In Jack London's case, he thought that certain favored races were destined for survival, mainly those that could preserve themselves while supplanting others, as in the case of the White race.&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Essays/philosophy.html The philosophy of Jack London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027154902/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/London/Essays/philosophy.html |date=2005-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film director]] [[Stanley Kubrick]] has been described as having held social Darwinist opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herr |first1=Michael |title=Kubrick |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0-8021-3818-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/kubrick00herr/page/11 11] |url=https://archive.org/details/kubrick00herr |url-access=registration |access-date=20 February 2016|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{See also|Eugenics in Japan}}
Social Darwinism has influenced political, public health and social movements in Japan since the late 19th and early 20th century. Social Darwinism was originally brought to Japan through the works of Francis Galton and Ernst Haeckel as well as United States, British and French Lamarckian eugenic written studies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eugenics in Japan: some ironies of modernity, 1883–1945 |last1=Otsubo |first1=S. |last2=Bartholomew |first2=J. R. |journal=Sci Context |year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3–4 |pages=545–65 |doi=10.1017/S0269889700003203 |pmid=15168677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenism as a science was hotly debated at the beginning of the 20th century, in ''Jinsei-Der Mensch'', the first eugenics journal in the empire. As Japan sought to close ranks with the west, this practice was adopted wholesale along with colonialism and its justifications.

===China===
Social Darwinism was formally introduced to China through the translation by [[Yan Fu]] of Huxley's ''Evolution and Ethics'', in the course of an extensive series of translations of influential Western thought.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence. ''The Search for Modern China&quot;. W.W. Norton, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;q=social+darwinism#v=snippet&amp;q=social%20darwinism&amp;f=false p. 301].&lt;/ref&gt; Yan's translation strongly impacted Chinese scholars because he added national elements not found in the original. Yan Fu criticized Huxley from the perspective of Spencerian social Darwinism in his own annotations to the translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1017/S0007087418000808|pmid = 30587253|title = Translation and transmutation: The Origin of Species in China|journal = The British Journal for the History of Science|volume = 52|pages = 117–141|year = 2019|last1 = Jin|first1 = Xiaoxing}}&lt;/ref&gt; He understood Spencer's sociology as &quot;not merely analytical and descriptive, but prescriptive as well&quot;, and saw Spencer building on Darwin, whom Yan summarized thus:
::Peoples and living things struggle for survival. At first, species struggle with species; they as [people] gradually progress, there is a struggle between one social group and another. The weak invariably become the prey of the strong, the stupid invariably become subservient to the clever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1920s, social Darwinism found expression in the promotion of eugenics by the Chinese sociologist [[Pan Guangdan]].
When Chiang Kai-shek started the New Life movement in 1934, he

::. . . harked back to theories of Social Darwinism, writing that &quot;only those who readapt themselves to new conditions, day by day, can live properly. When the life of a people is going through this process of readaptation, it has to remedy its own defects, and get rid of those elements which become useless. Then we call it new life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 414–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1860s and 1870s, social Darwinism began to take shape in interaction between Charles Darwin and his German advocates, namely [[August Schleicher]], [[Max Müller]] and Ernst Haeckel. [[Evolutionary linguistics]] was taken as a platform to construe a Darwinian theory of mankind. Since it was thought at the time that the [[orangutan]] and human brain were roughly the same size, Darwin and his colleagues suspected that only the invention of language could account for differentiation between humans and other [[Great Ape]]s. It was suggested that the evolution of language and the mind must go hand in hand. From this perspective, empirical evidence from languages from around the world was interpreted by Haeckel as supporting the idea that nations, despite having rather similar physiology, represented such distinct lines of 'evolution' that mankind should be divided into nine different species. Haeckel constructed an evolutionary and intellectual hierarchy of such species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards_2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=R. J. |year=2013| title=Was Hitler a Darwinian?: Disputed Questions in the History of Evolutionary Theory | publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-05893-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Schleicher regarded languages as different species and sub-species, adopting Darwin's concept of selection through competition to the study of the history and spread of nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronoff_2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronoff|first=Mark |editor-last1=Bowern | editor-last2=Horn | editor-last3=Zanuttini |title=On Looking into Words (and Beyond): Structures, Relations, Analyses|publisher=SUNY Press |year=2017|pages=443–456 |chapter=Darwinism tested by the science of language | url=https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/151| access-date=2020-03-03 |isbn= 978-3-946234-92-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their ideas, including the concept of [[Lebensraum|living space]] were adopted to the Nazi ideology after their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards_2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=R. J. |year=2013| title=Was Hitler a Darwinian?: Disputed Questions in the History of Evolutionary Theory | publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-05893-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social evolution theories in Germany gained large popularity in the 1860s and had a strong antiestablishment connotation first. Social Darwinism allowed people to counter the connection of ''[[Relations between the Catholic Church and the state|Thron und Altar]]'', the intertwined establishment of clergy and nobility, and provided as well the idea of progressive change and evolution of society as a whole. [[Ernst Haeckel]] propagated both Darwinism as a part of natural history and as a suitable base for a modern [[World view|Weltanschauung]], a world view based on scientific reasoning in his Monist League. [[Friedrich von Hellwald]] had a strong role in popularizing it in Austria. Darwin's work served as a catalyst to popularize evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oxc_CwAAQBAJ|title=Sozialdarwinismus als wissenschaftliches Konzept und politisches Programm, in: Gangolf Hübinger (ed.), Europäische Wissenschaftskulturen und politische Ordnungen in der Moderne (1890-1970) (= Schriften des Historischen Kollegs, Kolloquien 77), München 2014, pp. 99–121.|last=Puschner|first=Uwe|date=2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110446784|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sort of aristocratic turn, the use of the struggle for life as a base of social Darwinism ''[[sensu stricto]]'' came up after 1900 with [[Alexander Tille]]'s 1895 work Entwicklungsethik (Ethics of Evolution) which asked to move ''from Darwin till [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]''. Further interpretations moved to ideologies propagating a racist and hierarchical society and provided ground for the later radical versions of social Darwinism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Social Darwinism came to play a major role in the ideology of [[Nazism]], where it was combined with a similarly [[pseudo-scientific]] theory of [[racial hierarchy]] in order to identify the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[master race]].&lt;ref name=Baum2006_156&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce David|year=2006|title=The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian Race: A Political History of Racial Identity|location=New York City/London|publisher=New York University Press|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nazi social Darwinist beliefs led them to retain business competition and private property as economic engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;Barkai, Avaraham 1990.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Multiple incompatible definitions===
Social Darwinism has many definitions, and some of them are incompatible with each other. As such, social Darwinism has been criticized for being an inconsistent philosophy, which does not lead to any clear political conclusions. For example, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Part of the difficulty in establishing sensible and consistent usage is that commitment to the biology of natural selection and to 'survival of the fittest' entailed nothing uniform either for sociological method or for political doctrine. A 'social Darwinist' could just as well be a defender of laissez-faire as a defender of state socialism, just as much an imperialist as a domestic eugenist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Iain|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford University|isbn=9780199207800|pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nazism, eugenics, fascism, imperialism===
Social Darwinism was predominantly found in laissez-faire societies where the prevailing view was that of an individualist order to society. A different form of social Darwinism was part of the ideological foundations of [[Nazism]] and other [[fascism|fascist]] movements. This form did not envision survival of the fittest within an [[individualist]] order of society, but rather advocated a type of racial and national struggle where the state directed human breeding through [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name=&quot; Thomas C. Leonard &quot;&gt;Leonard, Thomas C. (2005) [http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/mistaking.pdf Mistaking Eugenics for Social Darwinism: Why Eugenics is Missing from the History of American Economics] History of Political Economy, Vol. 37 supplement: 200–233&lt;/ref&gt; Names such as &quot;Darwinian collectivism&quot; or &quot;Reform Darwinism&quot; have been suggested to describe these views, in order to differentiate them from the individualist type of social Darwinism.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCL&quot;/&gt;

As mentioned above, social Darwinism has often been linked to [[nationalism]] and imperialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |last2=Chase |first2=Myrna |last3=Jacob |first3=Margaret |last4=Jacob |first4=James |last5=Daly |first5=Jonathan W. |last6=Von Laue |first6=Theodore H. |year=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jy5BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA634 |volume=Volume II: Since 1600 |edition=11th |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |pages=634–635 |isbn=978-1-305-09142-9 |lccn=2014943347 |oclc=898154349 |quote=The most extreme ideological expression of nationalism and imperialism was Social Darwinism. In the popular mind, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation by the 'superior races' of 'lesser breeds without the law.' This language of race and conflict, of superior and inferior people, had wide currency in the Western nations. Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not. To these elitists, all white peoples were more fit than nonwhites to prevail in the struggle for dominance. Even among Europeans, some nations were deemed more fit than others for the competition. Usually, Social Darwinists thought their own nation the best, an attitude that sparked their competitive enthusiasm. ...In the nineteenth century, in contrast to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europeans, except for missionaries, rarely adopted the customs or learned the languages of local people. They had little sense that other cultures and other peoples deserved respect. Many Westerners believed that it was their Christian duty to set an example and to educate others. Missionaries were the first to meet and learn about many peoples and the first to develop writing for those without a written language. Christian missionaries were ardently opposed to slavery.... |access-date =2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the age of New Imperialism, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation of &quot;lesser breeds without the law&quot; by &quot;superior races&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob&quot; /&gt; To elitists, strong nations were composed of white people who were successful at expanding their empires, and as such, these strong nations would survive in the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob&quot; /&gt; With this attitude, Europeans, except for Christian missionaries, seldom adopted the customs and languages of local people under their empires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob&quot; /&gt;

===Peter Kropotkin and mutual aid===
[[Peter Kropotkin]] argued in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' that Darwin did not define the fittest as the strongest, or most clever, but recognized that the fittest could be those who cooperated with each other. In many animal societies, &quot;struggle is replaced by co-operation&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be that at the outset Darwin himself was not fully aware of the generality of the factor which he first invoked for explaining one series only of facts relative to the accumulation of individual variations in incipient species. But he foresaw that the term [evolution] which he was introducing into science would lose its philosophical and its only true meaning if it were to be used in its narrow sense only—that of a struggle between separate individuals for the sheer means of existence. And at the very beginning of his memorable work he insisted upon the term being taken in its &quot;large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny.&quot; [Quoting ''[[Origin of Species]],'' chap. iii, p. 62 of first edition.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While he himself was chiefly using the term in its narrow sense for his own special purpose, he warned his followers against committing the error (which he seems once to have committed himself) of overrating its narrow meaning. In ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' he gave some powerful pages to illustrate its proper, wide sense. He pointed out how, in numberless animal societies, the struggle between separate individuals for the means of existence disappears, how struggle is replaced by co-operation, and how that substitution results in the development of intellectual and moral faculties which secure to the species the best conditions for survival. He intimated that in such cases the fittest are not the physically strongest, nor the cunningest, but those who learn to combine so as mutually to support each other, strong and weak alike, for the welfare of the community. &quot;Those communities&quot;, he wrote, &quot;which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best, and rear the greatest number of offspring&quot; (2nd edit., p. 163). The term, which originated from the narrow Malthusian conception of competition between each and all, thus lost its narrowness in the mind of one who knew Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Noam Chomsky]] discussed briefly Kropotkin's views in an 8 July 2011 YouTube video from Renegade Economist, in which he said Kropotkin argued
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the exact opposite [of social Darwinism]. He argued that on Darwinian grounds, you would expect cooperation and mutual aid to develop leading towards community, [[workers' control]] and so on. Well, you know, he didn't prove his point. It's at least as well argued as [[Herbert Spencer]] is ...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjermDZ1qfI |title=Noam Chomsky – on Darwinism |last=Chomsky| first=Noam| date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''refugee''', generally speaking, is a [[forced displacement|displaced person]] who has been forced to cross national boundaries and who cannot return home safely. Such a person may be called an [[asylum seeker]] until granted [[#Refugee status|refugee status]] by the contracting state or the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR){{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}} if they formally make a claim for [[right of asylum|asylum]].{{sfn|Truth about asylum}}
The lead international agency coordinating refugee protection is the United Nations Office of the UNHCR. The United Nations has a second office for refugees, the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA), which is solely responsible for supporting the large majority of [[Palestinian refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unrwa.org/|title=UNRWA {{!}} United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|website=UNRWA|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
Similar terms in other languages have described an event marking [[human migration|migration]] of a specific population from a place of origin, such as the [[Bible|biblical]] account of [[Israelites]] fleeing from [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] conquest (''circa'' 740 BCE){{citation needed|date=September 2019}}, or the [[Asylum (antiquity)|asylum]] found by the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] and his [[Muhajirun|emigrant companions]] with [[Ansar (Islam)|helpers]] in [[Yathrib]] (later Medina) after they [[Hegira|fled]] from persecution in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=tX3suVDTJz0C&amp;pg=PA16 Militant Islamist Ideology: Understanding the Global Threat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=5u3Ukw7AftwC&amp;pg=PT18 In The Shadow Of The Sword: The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the term ''refugee'' derives from the root word ''refuge'', from [[Old French]] ''refuge'', meaning &quot;hiding place&quot;. It refers to &quot;shelter or protection from danger or distress&quot;, from [[Latin]] ''fugere'', &quot;to flee&quot;, and ''refugium'', &quot;a taking [of] refuge, place to flee back to&quot;. In Western history, the term was first applied to French Protestant [[Huguenots]] looking for a safe place against Catholic persecution after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)|first Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=ZKPFHuiFr6MC&amp;q=refuge La vraye et entière histoire des troubles et guerres civiles advenues de nostre temps, tant en France qu'en Flandres &amp; pays circonvoisins, depuis l'an mil cinq cens soixante, jusques à présent.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://refuge-huguenot.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/histoire.php Base de données du refuge huguenot]&lt;/ref&gt; The word appeared in the English language when French Huguenots fled to Britain in large numbers after the 1685 [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (the revocation of the 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]]) in France and the 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] in England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.historytoday.com/robin-gwynn/englands-first-refugees|title=England's 'First Refugees'|first=Robin|last=Gwynn|journal=History Today|date=May 5, 1985|access-date=January 18, 2019|volume=35|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word meant &quot;one seeking asylum&quot;, until around 1914, when it evolved to mean &quot;one fleeing home&quot;, applied in this instance to civilians in Flanders heading west to escape fighting in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Refugee}}

==Definitions==
[[File:Darfur refugee camp in Chad.jpg|right|thumb|[[Darfur]] refugee camp in [[Chad]], 2005]]

The first modern definition of international refugee status came about under the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 from the Commission for Refugees. Following [[World War II]], and in response to the large numbers of people fleeing Eastern Europe, the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] defined  &quot;refugee&quot; (in Article 1.A.2) as any person who:{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a [[particular social group]] or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.&quot;{{sfn|Convention Protocol relating|1967}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, the definition was basically confirmed by the UN [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]].

The [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]] expanded the 1951 definition, which the [[Organization of African Unity]] adopted in 1969:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality.&quot;{{sfn|Assembly of Heads of State and Government (Sixth Ordinary Session)|1969}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1984 regional, non-binding Latin-American [[Cartagena Declaration on Refugees]] includes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.&quot;{{sfn|Cartagena Declaration}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2011, the UNHCR itself, in addition to the 1951 definition, recognizes persons as refugees:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;who are outside their country of nationality or habitual residence and unable to return there owing to serious and indiscriminate threats to life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order.&quot;{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)|2011|p=19}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

European Union's minimum standards definition of refugee, underlined by Art. 2 (c) of Directive No. 2004/83/EC, essentially reproduces the narrow definition of refugee offered by the UN 1951 Convention; nevertheless, by virtue of articles 2 (e) and 15 of the same Directive, persons who have fled a war-caused generalized violence are, at certain conditions, eligible for a complementary form of protection, called [[subsidiary protection]]. The same form of protection is foreseen for displaced people who, without being refugees, are nevertheless exposed, if returned to their countries of origin, to death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatments.

==History==
{{See also|Right of asylum|Sanctuary}}
[[File:Gysis Nikolaos After the destruction of Psara.jpg|right|thumb|Greeks fleeing the [[Destruction of Psara]] in 1824 (painting by [[Nikolaos Gyzis]]).]]
[[File:Hercegovački begunci, Uroš Predić.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Refugees from Herzegovina&quot;, painting by [[Uroš Predić]] in 1889 made in the aftermath of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)]].]]
The idea that a person who sought sanctuary in a holy place could not be harmed without inviting divine retribution was familiar to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ians. However, the [[right of asylum|right to seek asylum]] in a church or other holy place was first codified in law by King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] in about AD 600. Similar laws were implemented throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. The related concept of political [[exile]] also has a long history: [[Ovid]] was sent to [[Constanța|Tomis]]; [[Voltaire]] was sent to England. By the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], nations recognized each other's [[sovereignty]]. However, it was not until the advent of [[romantic nationalism]] in late 18th-century Europe that [[nationalism]] gained sufficient prevalence for the phrase ''country of nationality'' to become practically meaningful, and for border crossing to require that people provide identification.

[[File:Armenian woman and her children from Geghi, 1899.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|One million [[Armenians]] were forced to leave their homes in Anatolia in 1915, and many either died or were murdered on their way to Syria.]]

The term &quot;refugee&quot; sometime applies to people who might fit the definition outlined by the 1951 Convention, were it applied retroactively. There are many candidates. For example, after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685 outlawed [[Protestantism]] in France, hundreds of thousands of [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, [[South Africa]], Germany and [[Prussia]]. The repeated waves of [[pogrom]]s that swept Eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries prompted mass Jewish emigration (more than 2 million [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] emigrated in the period 1881–1920). Beginning in the 19th century, Muslim people emigrated to Turkey from Europe.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995}} The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913 caused 800,000 people to leave their homes.{{sfn|Greek Turkish refugees}} Various groups of people were officially designated refugees beginning in World War I.

===League of Nations===
[[File:Spanish War Children001.jpg|thumb|Children preparing for evacuation from Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939.]]
The first international co-ordination of refugee affairs came with the creation by the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 of the High Commission for Refugees and the appointment of [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its head. Nansen and the Commission were charged with assisting the approximately 1,500,000 people who fled the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] (1917–1921),{{sfn|Hassell|1991}} p.&amp;nbsp;1. most of them aristocrats fleeing the Communist government. It is estimated that about 800,000 Russian refugees became stateless when [[Lenin]] revoked citizenship for all Russian expatriates in 1921.{{sfn|Humanisten Nansen (in}}

In 1923, the mandate of the Commission was expanded to include the more than one million [[Armenian people|Armenians]] who left [[Turkey (country)|Turkish]] [[Asia Minor]] in 1915 and 1923 due to a series of events now known as the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Over the next several years, the mandate was expanded further to cover [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and Turkish refugees.{{sfn|Nansen International Office}} In all of these cases, a refugee was defined as a person in a group for which the League of Nations had approved a mandate, as opposed to a person to whom a general definition applied.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] involved about two million people (around 1.5 million [[Greeks in Turkey|Anatolian Greeks]] and 500,000 Muslims in Greece) most of whom were forcibly repatriated and denaturalized{{clarify|date=September 2015}} from homelands of centuries or millennia (and guaranteed the nationality of the destination country) by a treaty promoted and overseen by the international community as part of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]].{{efn-ua|The &quot;[[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]&quot; was signed at [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, on 30 January 1923, by the governments of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and Turkey.}}

The U.S. Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially [[Jews]], Italians and [[Slavs]], who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.{{sfn|Old fears over|2006}} Most European refugees (principally Jews and Slavs) fleeing the [[Nazis]] and the [[Soviet Union]] were barred from going to the United States until after World War II.{{sfn|U S Constitution}}

In 1930, the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] (Nansen Office) was established as a successor agency to the Commission. Its most notable achievement was the [[Nansen passport]], a [[refugee travel document]], for which it was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The Nansen Office was plagued by problems of financing, an increase in refugee numbers, and a lack of co-operation from some member states, which led to mixed success overall.

However, the Nansen Office managed to lead fourteen nations to ratify the 1933 Refugee Convention, an early, and relatively modest, attempt at a [[human rights]] charter, and in general assisted around one million refugees worldwide.{{sfn|Nobel Peace Prize}}

===1933 (rise of Nazism) to 1944===
[[File:Czech refugees from the Sudetenland 1.gif|thumb|right|upright|Czech refugees from the [[Sudetenland]], October 1938]]
The rise of [[Nazism]] led to such a very large increase in the number of refugees from Germany that in 1933 the League created a high commission for refugees coming from Germany. Besides other measures by the Nazis which created fear and flight, Jews were stripped of German citizenship {{efn-ua|Bankier, David &quot;Nuremberg Laws&quot; pages 1076–1077 from ''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'' Volume 3 edited by Israel Gutman, New York: Macmillan, 1990 page 1076}} by the ''[[Reich Citizenship Law]]'' of 1935.{{sfn|Reich Citizenship Law}} On 4 July 1936 an agreement was signed under League auspices that defined a refugee coming from Germany as &quot;any person who was settled in that country, who does not possess any nationality other than German nationality, and in respect of whom it is established that in law or in fact he or she does not enjoy the protection of the Government of the Reich&quot; (article 1).{{efn-ua|Text in ''[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1936/158.pdf League of Nations Treaty Series]'', vol. 171, p. 77.}}

The mandate of the High Commission was subsequently expanded to include persons from Austria and [[Sudetenland]], which Germany annexed after 1 October 1938 in accordance with the [[Munich Agreement]]. According to the Institute for Refugee Assistance, the actual count of refugees from [[Czechoslovakia]] on 1 March 1939 stood at almost 150,000.{{sfn|Forced displacement}} Between 1933 and 1939, about 200,000 Jews fleeing Nazism were able to find refuge in France,{{sfn|France}} while at least 55,000 Jews were able to find refuge in Palestine{{sfn|Gelber|1993|pp=323–39}} p.&amp;nbsp;326 n. 6. before the British authorities closed that destination in 1939.

On 31 December 1938, both the Nansen Office and High Commission were dissolved and replaced by the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees under the Protection of the League.{{sfn|Nansen International Office}} This coincided with the flight of several hundred thousand Spanish Republicans to France after their defeat by the Nationalists in 1939 in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Spanish Civil War}}
[[File:Teheran, Iran. Polish woman and her grandchildren shown in an American Red Cross evacuation camp as they await evacuation to new homes.jpeg|thumb|Polish refugees in Teheran, Iran at an American Red Cross evacuation camp, 1943]]
The conflict and political instability during World War II led to massive numbers of refugees (see [[World War II evacuation and expulsion]]). In 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] created the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) to provide aid to areas liberated from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], including parts of Europe and China. By the end of the War, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.{{sfn|Refugees: Save Us!|1979}} UNRRA was involved in returning over seven million refugees, then commonly referred to as [[displaced person]]s or DPs, to their country of origin and setting up [[displaced persons camp]]s for one million refugees who refused to be repatriated. Even two years after the end of War, some 850,000 people still lived in DP camps across Western Europe. [http://www.dpcamps.org/dpcampseurope.html DP Camps in Europe Intro], from: ''DPs Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951'' by Mark Wyman After the establishment of Israel in 1948, Israel accepted more than 650,000 refugees by 1950. By 1953, over 250,000 refugees were still in Europe, most of them old, infirm, crippled, or otherwise disabled.

===Post-World War II population transfers===

After the Soviet armed forces captured eastern Poland from the Germans in 1944, the Soviets unilaterally declared a new frontier between the Soviet Union and Poland approximately at the [[Curzon Line]], despite the protestations from the Polish government-in-exile in London and the western Allies at the [[Teheran Conference]] and the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945. After the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] on 7 May 1945, the Allies occupied the remainder of Germany, and the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin declaration of 5 June 1945]] confirmed the unfortunate help of the second division team of Cruzeiro of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] according to the Yalta Conference, which stipulated the continued existence of the German Reich as a whole, which would include its [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern territories]] as of 31 December 1937. This did not impact on Poland's eastern border, and Stalin refused to be removed from these [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern Polish territories]].

The '''province of Olbia-Tempio''' ({{Lang-it|provincia di Olbia-Tempio}}, {{Lang-sc|provìntzia de Terranòa-Tèmpiu}}) was a [[provinces of Italy|province]] in the autonomous region of [[Sardinia]], Italy. It had two provincial capitals, [[Olbia]] (58,723 inhabitants) and [[Tempio Pausania]] (14,342 inhabitants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/104/|title=Olbia-Tempio|publisher=Comuni Italiani|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tuttitalia&quot;/&gt; As of 2015, the province had a total population of 159,950 inhabitants and covered an area of {{convert|3406.18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=off}}, so had a population density of 46.96 inhabitants per square kilometer. The province contained 26 ''[[comuni]]'' (plural; singular: ''[[comune]]''), see [[list of communes of the Province of Olbia-Tempio|list of communes of the former Province of Olbia-Tempio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tuttitalia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttitalia.it/sardegna/provincia-di-olbia-tempio/|title=Provincia di Olbia-Tempio|publisher=Tutt Italia|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest ''comuni'' in the province were [[Olbia]] (population of 45,366 as of 2001), [[Tempio Pausania]] (13,992 as of 2001), [[Arzachena]] (12,080 as of 2001) and [[La Maddalena]] (11,369 as of 2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;tuttitalia&quot;/&gt; The former province of Olbia-Tempio was formed by a 2001 regional law that became effective in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnaareeindustriali.it/territorio/provincia-di-olbia-tempio|title=Provincia di Olbia-Tempio|publisher=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ital&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/sardinia/olbia-tempio.html|title=Olbia-Tempio|publisher=Italia.it|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained a section of historic [[Gallura]] and was bordered by the provinces of [[Province of Nuoro|Nuoro]] and [[Province of Sassari|Sassari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ital&quot;/&gt;

On 6 May 2012 the regional referendums of Sardinia took place regarding the abolition of certain provinces and a variety of other matters. The suggestion of reforming or abolishing certain provinces in Sardinia was approved by the Regional Council of Sardinia on 24 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.sardegna.it/xml/getpage.php?cat=7874|title=Referendum|publisher=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=4 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508093757/http://www.regione.sardegna.it/xml/getpage.php?cat=7874|archivedate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the former province of Olbia-Tempio was ordered to form a new administrative body or be abolished on 1 March 2013, but this expiry date for constitutional changes was extended to 1 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiopress.it/2012/05/province-in-vita-per-altri-9-mesi-il-consiglio-regionale-approva-la-legge-in-aula-rissa-stochino-manincheddaa/|title=Provinces alive for another nine months, the Council approves the law|publisher=Radio Press|accessdate=4 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526110501/http://www.radiopress.it/2012/05/province-in-vita-per-altri-9-mesi-il-consiglio-regionale-approva-la-legge-in-aula-rissa-stochino-manincheddaa/|archivedate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionesarda.it/Articoli/Articolo/274564|title=Provinces begin the countdown|publisher=L'Unione Sarda|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205083747/http://www.unionesarda.it/Articoli/Articolo/274564|archive-date=5 December 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/491?s=197867&amp;v=2&amp;c=1489&amp;t=1|title=Provinces: all out in nine months|publisher=La Nuova Sardegna|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olbia-Tempio was suppressed as a province by the 2016 Regional Decree.

[[File:Ballston TOD.jpg|thumb|The Ballston neighborhood of [[Arlington, Virginia]] is a [[transit-oriented development]] zone, one example of  the smart growth concept.]]
'''Smart growth''' is an urban [[urban planning|planning]] and [[transportation planning|transportation]] theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]. It also advocates compact, [[transit-oriented development|transit-oriented]], [[pedestrian-friendly|walkable]], [[bicycle-friendly]] land use, including neighborhood schools, [[complete streets]], and [[mixed-use development]] with a range of housing choices. The term &quot;smart growth&quot; is particularly used in North America. In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms &quot;[[compact city]]&quot;, &quot;[[urban densification]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Varma, G. An Analysis on the Concept of Urban Densification and its Implications on Transportation. ''Linkedin'', 2016. [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analysis-concept-urban-densification-its-implications-gautham-varma link].&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;urban intensification&quot; have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries.

Smart growth values long-range, regional considerations of [[sustainability]] over a short-term focus. Its [[sustainable development]] goals are to achieve a unique sense of community and [[Placemaking|place]]; expand the range of transportation, employment, and housing choices; equitably distribute the costs and benefits of development; preserve and enhance natural and cultural resources; and promote public health.

==Basic concept==
[[File:Aerial - Interstate 805 in San Diego, CA 01.jpg|thumb|San Diego, California]]
Smart growth is a theory of [[land development]] that accepts that growth and development will continue to occur, and so seeks to direct that growth in an intentional, comprehensive way. Its proponents include urban planners, architects, developers, community activists, and historic preservationists. The term &quot;smart growth&quot; is an attempt to reframe the conversation from &quot;growth&quot; versus &quot;no growth&quot; (or [[NIMBY]]) to good/smart growth versus bad/dumb growth. Proponents seek to distinguish smart growth from [[urban sprawl]], which they claim causes most of the problems that fuel opposition to urban growth, such as traffic congestion and environmental degradation. Smart growth principles are directed at developing sustainable communities that provide a greater range of transportation and housing choices and prioritize [[infill]] and redevelopment in existing communities rather than development of &quot;[[greenfield land|greenfield]]&quot; farmland or natural lands. Some of the fundamental aims for the benefits of residents and the communities are increasing family income and wealth, providing safe walking routes to schools, fostering livable, safe and healthy places, stimulating economic activity (both locally and regionally), and developing, preserving and investing in built and natural resources.

Smart growth &quot;principles&quot; describe the elements of community that are envisioned and smart growth &quot;regulations&quot; describe the various approaches to implementation, that is, how federal, state, and municipal governments choose to fulfill smart growth principles. Some of these regulatory approaches such as [[Urban growth boundary|urban growth boundaries]] predate the use of the term &quot;smart growth&quot;. One of the earliest efforts to establish smart growth forward as an explicit regulatory framework were put forth by the [[American Planning Association]] (APA). In 1997, the APA introduced a project called Growing Smart and published the &quot;Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Model Statutes for Planning and the Management of Change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/print/ |title=Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook |access-date=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207010535/https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/print/ |archive-date=2013-02-07 |url-status=dead |publisher=American Planning Association |location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines smart growth as “a range of development and conservation strategies that help protect our health and natural environment and make our communities more attractive, economically stronger, and more socially diverse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-about-sg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/about-smart-growth |title=About Smart Growth | date=2019-04-19 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart growth agenda is comprehensive and ambitious, however, its implementation is problematic as control of outward movement means limiting availability of single-family homes and reliance on the automobile, the mainstay of the traditional American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|pages=605}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smart growth is related to, or may be used in combination with, the following concepts:
* [[New Urbanism]]
* [[Growth management]]
* New community design
* [[Sustainable development]]
* Resource [[stewardship]]
* Land preservation
* Preventing [[urban sprawl]]
* Creating [[sense of place]]
* Development [[Best Practices]]
* [[Preservation development]]
* [[Sustainable transport]]
* [[Triple Bottom Line]] (TBL) accounting - people, planet, profit
* The Three Pillars - human, natural, and created capital{{clarification needed|date= May 2020}}

The smart growth approach to development is multifaceted and can encompass a variety of techniques. For example, in the state of [[Massachusetts]] smart growth is enacted by a combination of techniques including increasing housing density along transit nodes, conserving farm land, and mixing residential and commercial use areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/smart-growth-smart-energy-toolkit-information-and-resources |title=Smart Growth / Smart Energy Toolkit Information and Resources |publisher=Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most descriptive term to characterize this concept is [[Traditional Neighborhood Development]], which recognizes that smart growth and related concepts are not necessarily new, but are a response to car culture and sprawl. Many favor the term [[New Urbanism]], which invokes a new, but traditional way of looking at urban planning.

There are a range of best practices associated with smart growth. These include supporting existing communities, redeveloping underutilized sites, enhancing economic competitiveness, providing more transportation choices, developing livability measures and tools, promoting equitable and affordable housing, providing a vision for sustainable growth, enhancing integrated planning and investment, aligning, coordinating, and leveraging government policies, redefining housing affordability and making the development process transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nrdc.org/smartgrowth/ | title=Communities |publisher=Natural Resources Defense Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related, but somewhat different, are the overarching goals of smart growth, and they include: making the community more competitive for new businesses, providing alternative places to shop, work, and play, creating a better &quot;Sense of Place,&quot; providing jobs for residents, increasing property values, improving quality of life, expanding the tax base, preserving open space, controlling growth, and improving safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://smartgrowth.umd.edu/ | title=NCSG – National Center for Smart Growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
There are 11 accepted principles that define smart growth:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/about_sg.htm | title=Smart Growth| date=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Create a range of employment opportunities.
# Mix land uses.
# Take advantage of compact building design. 
# Create walkable neighborhoods and a range of housing opportunities and choices.
# Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place.
# Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas.
# Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities.
# Provide in advance a variety of transportation choices, urban and social infrastructure based on population projections.
# Make development decisions sustainable, predictable, fair, and cost effective.
# Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions.
# Cost effectiveness in decision making.

==History==
Transportation and community planners began to promote the idea of compact cities and communities and adopt many of the regulatory approaches associated with smart growth in the early 1970s. The cost and difficulty of acquiring land (particularly in historic and/or areas designated as conservancies) to build and widen highways caused some politicians to reconsider basing transportation planning on motor vehicles.

The [[Congress for the New Urbanism]], with architect [[Peter Calthorpe]], promoted and popularized the idea of [[urban village]]s that relied on public transportation, bicycling, and walking instead of automobile use. Architect [[Andrés Duany]] promoted changing design codes to promote a sense of community, and to discourage driving. Colin Buchanan and Stephen Plowden helped to lead the debate in the [[United Kingdom]].

The Local Government Commission which presents the annual New Partners for Smart Growth conference adopted the original Ahwahnee Principles in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.lgc.org/about/ahwahnee/principles | title=Ahwahnee Principles for Resource-Efficient Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt; which articulates many of the major principles now generally accepted as part of the smart growth movement such as [[transit oriented development]], a focus on walking distance, greenbelts and wildlife corridors, and infill and redevelopment. The document was co-authored by several of the founders of the New Urbanist movement. The Local Government Commission has been co-sponsoring smart growth-related conferences since 1997. The New Partners for Smart Growth Conference started under that name circa 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;newpartners.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010313/http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event |archive-date=2014-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart Growth America, an organization devoted to promoting smart growth in the United States, was founded in 2002. This organization leads an evolving coalition of national and regional organizations most of which predated its founding such as [[1000 Friends of Oregon]], founded in 1975, and the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]], founded in 1993. The [[EPA]] launched its smart growth program in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;newpartners.org&quot;/&gt;

==Rationale for smart growth==
Smart growth is an alternative to urban sprawl, [[traffic congestion]], disconnected neighborhoods, and [[urban decay]]. Its principles challenge old assumptions in urban planning, such as the value of detached houses and automobile use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crabtree|first1=Paul|title=Principles of Smart Growth and Their Corresponding Rainwater Dos and Dont's|journal=Stormwater|date=March–April 2010|url=http://waterbucket.ca/rm/files/2017/01/1_PaulCrabtree-March-April-2010.pdf|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental protection===
Environmentalists promote smart growth by advocating [[urban-growth boundaries]], or [[Green belt]]s, as they have been termed in England since the 1930s.

===Public health===
Transit-oriented development can improve the quality of life and encourage a healthier, pedestrian-based lifestyle with less pollution. EPA suggests that smart growth can help reduce [[air pollution]], improve [[water quality]], and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-about-sg&quot; /&gt;

===Reaction to existing subsidies===
Smart growth advocates claim that much of the urban sprawl of the 20th century was due to government subsidies for infrastructure that redistribute the true costs of sprawl. Examples include subsidies for highway building, fossil fuels, and electricity.

====Electrical subsidies====
With electricity, there is a cost associated with extending and maintaining the service delivery system, as with water and sewage, but there also is a loss in the commodity being delivered. The farther from the generator, the more power is lost in distribution. According to the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), 9 percent of energy is lost in transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/eh/total.html |title= Energy in the United States: 1635-2000 |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |access-date=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current average cost pricing, where customers pay the same price per unit of power regardless of the true cost of their service, subsidizes sprawl development. With electricity deregulation, some states now charge customers/developers fees for extending distribution to new locations rather than rolling such costs into utility rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/btc/apps/Restructuring/tm2003_152.pdf ornl.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002205001/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/btc/apps/Restructuring/tm2003_152.pdf |date=2006-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey, for example, has implemented a plan that divides the state into five planning areas, some of which are designated for growth, while others are protected. The state is developing a series of incentives to coax local governments into changing [[zoning laws]] that will be compatible with the state plan. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently proposed a revised rule that presents a tiered approach to utility financing. In areas not designated for growth, utilities and their ratepayers are forbidden to cover the costs of extending utility lines to new developments—and developers will be required to pay the full cost of public utility infrastructure. In designated growth areas that have local smart plans endorsed by the State Planning Commission, developers will be refunded the cost of extending utility lines to new developments at two times the rate of the revenue received by developers in smart growth areas that do not have approved plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.gov/dca/osg/ nj.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930205620/http://www.nj.gov/dca/osg/ |date=2006-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==
Growth is &quot;smart growth&quot;, to the extent that it includes the elements listed below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartgrowth.org/about/default.asp smartgrowth.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/about_sg.htm epa.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compact neighborhoods===
Compact, livable urban neighborhoods attract more people and business. Creating such neighborhoods is a critical element of reducing urban sprawl and protecting the climate. Such a tactic includes adopting redevelopment strategies and zoning policies that channel housing and job growth into urban centers and neighborhood business districts, to create compact, walkable, and bike- and transit-friendly hubs. This sometimes requires local governmental bodies to implement code changes that allow increased height and density downtown and regulations that not only eliminate minimum parking requirements for new development but establish a maximum number of allowed spaces. Other topics fall under this concept:

* [[mixed-use development]]
* inclusion of [[affordable housing]]
* restrictions or limitations on suburban design forms (e.g., [[house|detached houses]] on individual lots, [[strip malls]] and surface [[parking]] lots)
* inclusion of [[parks]] and recreation areas

In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|access-date=23 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305215635/http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|archive-date=2018-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s.

===Transit-oriented development===
[[Transit-oriented development]] (TOD) is a residential or commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport, and mixed-use/compact neighborhoods tend to use transit at all times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Challenges and Policy Options for Creating and Preserving Affordable Housing|author=Rick Haughey, Ryan Sherriff|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many cities striving to implement better TOD strategies seek to secure funding to create new public transportation infrastructure and improve existing services. Other measures might include regional cooperation to increase efficiency and expand services, and moving buses and trains more frequently through high-use areas. Other topics fall under this concept:

* [[Transportation demand management]] measures
* road pricing system (tolling)
* commercial parking taxes

===Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly design===
Biking and walking instead of driving can reduce emissions, save money on fuel and maintenance, and foster a healthier population. Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly improvements include bike lanes on main streets, an urban bike-trail system, bike parking, pedestrian crossings, and associated master plans. The most pedestrian- and bike-friendly variant of smart growth and New Urbanism is New Pedestrianism because motor vehicles are on a separate grid.

===Others===
* preserving open space and critical habitat, reusing land, and protecting water supplies and air quality
* [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], predictable, fair and cost-effective rules for development
* [[historic preservation]]
* Setting aside large areas where development is prohibited, nature is able to run its course, providing fresh air and clean water.
* Expansion around already existing areas allows public services to be located where people are living without taking away from the core city neighborhoods in large urban areas.
* Developing around preexisting areas decreases the socioeconomic segregation allowing society to function more equitably, generating a tax base for housing, educational and employment programs.

== Policy tools ==

=== Zoning ordinances ===
The most widely used tool for achieving smart growth is modification of local [[zoning]] laws. Zoning laws are applicable to most cities and counties in the United States. Smart growth advocates often seek to modify zoning ordinances to increase the density of development and redevelopment allowed in or near existing towns and neighborhoods and/or restrict new development in outlying or environmentally sensitive areas. Additional density incentives can be offered for development of [[brownfield land|brownfield]] and [[greyfield land]] or for providing amenities such as parks and open space. Zoning ordinances typically include minimum parking requirements. Reductions in or elimination of parking minimums or imposition of parking maximums can also reduce the amount of parking built with new development increasing land available for parks and other community amenities.

===Urban growth boundaries===
Related to zoning ordinances, an [[urban growth boundary]] (UGB) is a tool that used in some U.S. cities to contain high density development to certain areas. The first urban growth boundary in the United States was established in 1958 in Kentucky. Subsequently, urban growth boundaries were established in Oregon in the 1970s and Florida in the 1980s. Some believe that UGBs contributed to the escalation of housing prices from 2000 to 2006, as they limited the supply of developable land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econjwatch.org/articles/constraints-on-housing-supply-natural-and-regulatory/ Cox, Wendell. &quot;Constraints on Housing Supply: Natural and Regulatory,&quot; ''Econ Journal Watch 8(1)'', 13-27.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not completely substantiated because prices continued to rise even after municipalities expanded their growth boundaries.

===Transfer of development rights===
[[Transfer of development rights]] (TDR) systems are intended to allow property owners in areas deemed desirable for growth (such as infill and brownfield sites) to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in areas deemed undesirable for growth such as environmental lands, farmlands or lands outside of an [[urban growth boundary]]. TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDR Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Arthur C. |last2=Pruetz |first2=Rick |last3=Woodruff |first3=Doug |year=2011 |title=The TDR Handbook: Designing and Implementing Transfer of Development Rights Programs |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Island Press |page=25 |isbn=9781610911597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provision of social infrastructure===
Systematic provision of infrastructure such as schools, libraries, sporting facilities and community facilities is an integral component of smart growth communities. This is commonly known as 'social infrastructure' or 'community infrastructure'. In Australia, for example, most new suburban developments are master planned, and key social infrastructure is planned at the outset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Planning, Funding and Delivering Social Infrastructure in Australia's Outer Suburban Growth Areas|journal=Urban Policy and Research|volume=34|issue=3|pages=284–297|date=16 February 2016|doi=10.1080/08111146.2015.1099523|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/iESRIdipyg6q3MvIyPS3/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact assessments ===
One popular approach to assist in smart growth in democratic countries is for lawmakers to require prospective developers to prepare [[environmental impact assessment]]s of their plans as a condition for state and/or local governments to give them [[building permit|permission]] to build their buildings. These reports often indicate how significant impacts generated by the development will be [[Environmental mitigation|mitigated]], the cost of which is usually paid by the developer. These assessments are frequently controversial. Conservationists, neighborhood advocacy groups and [[NIMBY]]s are often skeptical about such impact reports, even when they are prepared by independent agencies and subsequently approved by the decision makers rather than the promoters. Conversely, developers will sometimes strongly resist being required to implement the mitigation measures required by the local government as they may be quite costly.

In communities practicing these smart growth policies, developers comply with local codes and requirements. Consequently, developer compliance builds communal trust because it demonstrates a genuine interest in the environmental quality of the community.

==Communities implementing smart growth==
{{globalize|section|date=December 2010}}

The United States Environmental Protection Agency&lt;ref name=epa&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/awards.htm epa.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; has recognized these cities for implementing smart growth principles:

In July 2011, ''The Atlantic'' magazine called the [[BeltLine]], a series of housing, trail, and transit projects along a 22-mile (35-km) long disused rail corridor surrounding the core of [[Atlanta]], the United States' &quot;most ambitious smart growth project&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/07/the-countrys-most-ambitious-smart-growth-project/242549/ Kaid Benfield, &quot;The Country's Most Ambitious Smart Growth Project&quot;, ''The Atlantic'', July 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Savannah, Georgia (US) the historic [[Oglethorpe Plan]] has been shown to contain most of the elements of smart growth in its network of wards, each of which has a central civic square. The plan has demonstrated its resilience to changing conditions, and the city is using the plan as a model for growth in newer areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. University of Virginia Press, 2012. chapters 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Melbourne, Australia, almost all new outer-suburban developments are master planned, guided by the principles of smart growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=New Communities in New Suburbs: The Challenge of Effective Infrastructure Provision|url=http://tnpresentations.asnevents.net.au/assets/TN%20Presentations/Wed/103/1100/Wed%20103%201100%20Andrew%20Wear.ppt|access-date=1 December 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smart growth, urban sprawl and automobile dependency==
Whether smart growth (or the &quot;compact City&quot;) does or can reduce problems of [[automobile dependency]] associated with urban sprawl have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. A 2007 meta-study by Keith Barthomomew of the University of Utah found that reductions in driving associated with compact development scenarios averaged 8 percent ranging up to 31.7 percent with the variation being explained by degree of land use mixing and density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Keith|title=Land Use-Transportation Scenario Planning: Promise &amp; Reality|journal=Transportation|date=2007|volume=34|issue=4|pages=397–412|doi=10.1007/s11116-006-9108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Petrol use urban density.svg|Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study has been criticised for its methodology &lt;ref&gt;MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted — although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

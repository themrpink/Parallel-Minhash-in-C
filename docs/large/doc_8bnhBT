Year '''201''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Fabianus and Arrius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 954 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 201 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{History of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], sometimes referred to simply as Bosnia, is a country in Southeastern Europe on the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. It has had permanent settlement since the [[Neolithic Age]]. By the early historical period it was inhabited by [[Illyrians]] and [[Celts]]. Christianity arrived in the 1st century, and by the 4th century the area became part of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Germanic tribes invaded soon after, followed by [[Slav]]s in the 6th Century. In 1136, [[Béla II]] of Hungary invaded Bosnia and created the title &quot;Ban of Bosnia&quot; as an honorary title for his son [[Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. During this time, Bosnia became virtually autonomous, and was eventually proclaimed a kingdom in 1377. The [[Ottoman Empire]] followed in 1463 and lasted over 400 years. They wrought great changes to the political and administrative system, introduced land reforms, and class and religious distinctions. A series of uprisings began 1831, which culminated in the Herzegovinian rebellion, a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration of the country to Austria-Hungary through the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 brought the redrawing of administrative regions into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] which purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, and removed any trace of Bosnian identity. The kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by [[Nazi]] forces in [[World War II]], and Bosnia was ceded to the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), which led to widespread persecution and genocide. Three years of war began in 1992 which caused around 100,000 deaths and 2 million refugees.

==Prehistory and Roman Era==
{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
 [[File:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from 2nd century]]
Bosnia has been inhabited since [[Neolithic]] times. In the late [[Bronze Age]], the Neolithic population was replaced by more warlike [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] tribes known as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th and 3rd century BCE displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;Malcolm, Noel (1994). Bosnia A Short History. New York University Press. {{ISBN|0-8147-5520-8}}.{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

[[Christianity]] had already arrived in the region by the end of the 2nd century, and numerous artefacts and objects from the time testify to this. Following events from the years 337 and 395 when the Empire split, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455, and further exchanged hands between the [[Alans]] and [[Huns]] in the years to follow.

==Middle Ages==
{{anchor|Middle Ages}}
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages}}

By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian]] had re-conquered the area and large parts of the former [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] with its capital in [[Constantinople]]. The Slavs, a migratory people from southeastern Europe, were allied by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Eurasian Avars]] in the 6th century, and together they invaded the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th and 7th centuries, settling in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding lands.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; More South Slavs came in a second wave, and according to some scholars were invited by Emperor [[Heraclius]] to drive the Avars from Dalmatia on the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Around this time the Eastern Romans speaking [[Latin language|Latin]] were evolving into what was called in later centuries as the [[Byzantine Empire]], speaking the [[Greek language|Greek]] (named for the ancient city of [[Byzantium]], now the capital of Constantinople since the 330s, established by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]).&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

Modern knowledge of Bosnia in the western Balkans during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] is patchy. Upon the [[looter]] [[invasions]] by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] from 6th-9th century, bringing Slavic languages, both probably gave way to [[feudalism]] only with the might by the [[Franks|Frankish]] penetrating into the region in the late 9th century (Bosnia probably originated as one such pre-feudal entity). It was also around this time that the [[Bosnians]] were Christianized. Bosnia, due to its geographic position and terrain, was probably one of the last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the [[Dalmatia]]n coast.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

In addition to the Slavic-speaking population, a good number of romanized people remained in south Bosnia by the year 1000. Speaking a [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance language]] (related to Romanian), and having retreated into mountainous areas and adopted a [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] way of life, they became known as ''Vlachs''. With time they assimilated, though maintaining specific customs, and the word Vlach came to indicate any shepherd. Being well-versed with horse breeding, Vlachs came to dominate trade and caravan from coastal merchant town towards the interior, growing prosperous and coming to dominate entire regions of [[Zachlumia|Hum]], thus merging in Bosnia's medieval feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;John V. A. Fine,John Van Antwerp Fine, [https://books.google.be/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century].

===Banate of Bosnia===
{{main|Banate of Bosnia}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Banate of Bosnia.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Banate of Bosnia]]
[[File:Bosna 1373.jpg|thumb|The Banate in 1373, shortly before its elevation to kingdom]]
It is only from the 9th century that Frankish and Byzantine sources begin to mention early Slavic polities in the region. In this regard, the earliest widely acknowledged reference to Bosnia dates from the 10th century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' written by Byzantine emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMalcolm1996|Malcolm 1996]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; during which period [[Bosnia]] is briefly a part of the short-lived Serbian state of [[Časlav of Serbia|Časlav]], after whose death in battle in about 960, much of Bosnia finds itself briefly incorporated into the Croatian state of [[Michael Krešimir II of Croatia|Krešimir II]]. Shortly thereafter, in 997, [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] marches through Bosnia and asserts his over-lordship in parts of it, however, only to be defeated by the Byzantine Empire in 1018 which annexes Bulgaria and asserts its [[suzerainty]] in Bosnia. This lasted until later in the century when some parts of Bosnia are briefly incorporated into Croatia and others into [[Duklja]] from which the latter Bosnia appears to have seceded in about 1101, upon which Bosnia's bans tried to rule for themselves. However, they all too often found themselves in a tug-of-war between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. In the year of 1137, Hungary annexes most of Bosnia, then briefly losing her in 1167 to the Byzantine Empire before regaining her in 1180. Thus, prior to 1180 and the reign of [[Ban Kulin]] parts of Bosnia were briefly found in Serb or Croat units, but neither neighbor had held the Bosnians long enough to acquire their loyalty or to impose any serious claim to Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed.|authors=[[John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|John V.A. Fine]] and Robert J. Donia|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=1994|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded Ban (viceroy) was [[Ban Borić]], vassal to the Hungarian king. However, he was deposed when he backed the loser in a succession crisis over the Hungarian throne. In 1167, Byzantium reconquered Bosnia and eventually emplaced their own vassal as Ban – the native [[Ban Kulin]] ([[Reign|r.]] 1180-1204). However, this vassalage was largely nominal, and Bosnia had for all practical purposes made itself into an independent state under Kulin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC&amp;pg=PA44|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|author=[[John Van Antwerp Fine]]|publisher= University of Michigan press|year=1994|page=44|isbn=0472082604}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ban Kulin]] presided over nearly three decades of peace and stability during which he strengthened the country's economy through treaties with [[Republic of Ragusa|Dubrovnik]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. His rule also marked the start of a controversy with the [[Bosnian Church]], an indigenous [[Christianity|Christian]] sect considered heretical by both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254, which also fostered the schism of the [[Bosnian Church]].

===Kingdom of Bosnia===
{{main|Kingdom of Bosnia}}{{see also|Bosnian Church}}
 [[File:Medieval Bosnian State Expansion-en.svg|thumb|Territorial evolution of the Bosnian Kingdom]]
Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by the power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stjepan II Kotromanić]] became ban. By the time of his death in 1353, he had succeeded in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. Under Tvrtko, Bosnia grew in both size and power, finally becoming an independent kingdom in 1377. Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had already started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, Bosnia officially fell in 1463, while resistance was active and fierce for a few more centuries. [[Duchy of Saint Sava|Southern regions of Bosnia]], nowadays known as &quot;[[Herzegovina]]&quot; would follow in 1483, with a Hungarian-backed reinstated &quot;Bosnian Kingdom&quot; being the last to succumb in 1527.

==Ottoman Era (1463–1878)==
{{main|Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islamization of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

The [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] marked a new era in the country's history and introduced tremendous changes in the political and cultural landscape of the region. Although the kingdom had been crushed and its high nobility executed, the Ottomans nonetheless allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity - a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia-Herzegovina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618040332/http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm |date=2006-06-18 }}. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this [[sandžak]] (and eventual [[vilayet]]) of Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;
 [[File:Tsars Mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Emperor's Mosque]] is the first mosque to be built (1457) after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Bosnia.]]
The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, migrations, and epidemics.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest ethno-religious group&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;By the early 1600s, approximately 450,000 Muslims (67%), 150,000 Catholics (22%) and 75,000 Orthodox Christians (11%) lived Bosnia (Malcolm, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malcolm|1995|p=71}} (mainly as a result of a gradually rising number of conversions to [[Islam]]),&lt;ref name=Imamovic&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. {{ISBN|9958-815-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a significant number of [[Sephardi Jews]] arrived following their [[Spanish Inquisition|expulsion]] from Spain in the late 15th century. The Bosnian Christian communities also experienced major changes. The Bosnian [[Franciscans]] (and the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decree, although on the ground these guarantees were often disregarded and their numbers dwindled.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] community in Bosnia, initially confined to Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia, spread throughout the country during this period and went on to experience relative prosperity until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; Meanwhile, the native [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether.

As the Ottoman Empire thrived and expanded into Central Europe, Bosnia was relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province and experienced a prolonged period of general welfare and prosperity.&lt;ref name=Imamovic/&gt; A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into major regional centers of trade and urban culture. Within these cities, various Sultans and governors financed the construction of many important works of [[Bosnian architecture]] (such as the [[Stari most]] and [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]]). Furthermore, numerous Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and political history during this time.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; Bosnian soldiers formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], two decisive military victories, while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military bureaucracy to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals, generals, and grand viziers.&lt;ref name=Imamovic/&gt; Many Bosnians also made a lasting impression on Ottoman culture, emerging as mystics, scholars, and celebrated poets in the Turkish, Arabic, and Persian languages.&lt;ref name=Imamovic/&gt;
 [[File:Hercegovci u zasedi, Srbadija.jpg|thumb|The [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|Herzegovina Uprising]] of 1875–77]]
By the late 17th century, however, the Ottoman Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 once again made Bosnia the empire's westernmost province. But they allowed some of the [[Bushnak|Bosnian tribes]] to immigrate into the Arabian countries ([[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]]). The following hundred years were marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

According to an Ottoman Muslim account of the [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39)]] translated into English by C. Fraser, Bosnian Muslim women fought in battle since they &quot;acquired the courage of heroes&quot; against the Austrian Germans at the siege of Osterwitch-atyk (Östroviç-i âtık) fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;(Būsnavī)1830&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author='Umar (Būsnavī)|title=History of the War in Bosnia During the Years 1737 - 1739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA17|year=1830|publisher=Oriental Translation-Fund|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fund1830&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Oriental Translation Fund|title=Publications|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|url=https://archive.org/details/publications00thomgoog|year=1830|pages=[https://archive.org/details/publications00thomgoog/page/n45 17]–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Muslim women and men were among the casualties during the Battle of Osterwitchatyk.&lt;ref name=&quot;(Būsnavī)1830 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author='Umar (Būsnavī)|title=History of the War in Bosnia During the Years 1737 - 1739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=1830|publisher=Oriental Translation-Fund|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Muslim women fought in the defense of the fortress of Būzin (Büzin).&lt;ref name=&quot;(Būsnavī)1830 3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author='Umar (Būsnavī)|title=History of the War in Bosnia During the Years 1737 - 1739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA45|year=1830|publisher=Oriental Translation-Fund|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men resisted the Austrians at the Chetin (Çetin) Fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;(Būsnavī)1830 4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author='Umar (Būsnavī)|title=History of the War in Bosnia During the Years 1737 - 1739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YatCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1830|publisher=Oriental Translation-Fund|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women of the Bosnians were deemed to be militaristic according to non-Ottoman records of the war between the Ottomans and Austrians and they played a role in the Bosnian success in battle against the Austrian attackers.

The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]'s efforts at [[Ottoman military reform efforts|modernizing]] the Ottoman state were met with great hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; This, combined with frustrations over [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a famous (albeit ultimately unsuccessful) revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]] in 1831.&lt;ref name=Imamovic/&gt; Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850. A renewed effort at Ottoman reforms occurred in the 1860s under the leadership of the governor Topal Şerif Osman occurred, as he founded a provincial printing press in 1866 that published in both Ottoman Turkish and Bosnian.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amzi-Erdoğdular|first=Leyla|date=2017|title=Alternative Muslim Modernities: Bosnian Intellectuals in the Ottoman and Habsburg Empire|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=59|issue=4|pages=912–943|doi=10.1017/S0010417517000329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, which eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration of the country to [[Austria-Hungary]] through the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; While violent revolt prompted many to disparage Ottoman rule, it was in fact Ottoman reforms in the realm of cultural production and education that &quot;created the conditions for greater intellectual production that continued during the Habsburg era.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

{{main|Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Though an [[Austria-Hungary]] military force quickly subjugated initial armed resistance upon take-over, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly Herzegovina) and a mass emigration of predominantly Muslim dissidents occurred.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model [[colony]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; With the aim of establishing the province as a stable political model that would help dissipate rising South Slav [[nationalism]], Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and generally to provide for modernization.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; The Habsburgs took special care to integrate local Muslims into the fabric of empire, continuing, for example, to publish a provincial yearbook—much like the Ottomans—in Turkish for over a decade after the end of Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Many local officials moreover stayed the same, with the [[Mehmed-beg Kapetanović Ljubušak|Mehmed-Beg Kapetanović Ljubušak]], for example, remaining the mayor of Sarajevo under both polities and, moreover, obtaining the very same level of honor from both the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, with a Third Class Order of Mecidiye and an Order of the Iron Crown Third Class, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; All of this amounted to what one historian has called an &quot;almost seamless transition from one empire to another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Although successful economically, Austro-Hungarian policy - which focused on advocating the ideal of a pluralist and multi-confessional Bosnian [[nation]] (largely favored by the Muslims) - failed to curb the rising tides of nationalism.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; The concept of Croat and Serb nationhood had already spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholics and Orthodox communities from neighboring Croatia and Serbia in the mid 19th century, and was too well-entrenched to allow for the widespread acceptance of a parallel idea of Bosnian nationhood.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; By the latter half of the 1910s, nationalism was an integral factor of Bosnian politics, with national political parties corresponding to the three groups dominating elections.

The idea of a [[Yugoslavia|unified South Slavic state]] (typically expected to be spearheaded by independent Serbia) became a popular political ideology in the region at this time, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; The Austro-Hungarian government's decision to formally annex Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 (the [[Bosnian Crisis]]) added to a sense of urgency among these nationalists.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; The political tensions caused by all this culminated on  28 June 1914, when a [[Young Bosnia]] revolutionary named [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo. The event set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Although 10% of the Bosniak population died serving in the armies or being killed by the various warring states, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt;

Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over the Agrarian Reform of 1918–19 manifested through mass colonization and property confiscation;&lt;ref&gt;An International Symposium &quot;South-Eastern Europe 1918–995&quot; [http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm#top Serbian Land Reform and Colonization in 1918]&lt;/ref&gt; also formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt; The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major ethnic groups and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Internal divisions|banates]] that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration. The famous [[Cvetković-Maček agreement]] that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=Imamovic/&gt; However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]]. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the joining of the [[Tripartite Pact]], and a [[coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by [[Nazi]] forces in [[World War II]], all of Bosnia was ceded to the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH). The NDH rule over Bosnia led to widespread persecution and genocide. The Jewish population was nearly exterminated. Hundreds of thousands of Serbs died either in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|Ustaše concentration camps]] or in widespread mass killings by Ustaše militia. Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the [[Chetniks]], a Serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous '[[Greater Serbia]]n' state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramet| first = Sabrina P.| year = 2006| title = The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005| publisher = Indiana University Press| location = Bloomington| isbn = 978-0-253-34656-8| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC | pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], who fought against Axis, Ustaše, and Chetnik forces. They too, committed numerous atrocities, mainly against political opponents of all ethnicities. Some [[Bosniaks#Yugoslavia and World War II|Bosnian Muslims]] joined the [[Waffen-SS]] and the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|SS &quot;Handschar&quot; division]], an SS division of the Nazis that pledged allegiance to both [[Adolf Hitler]] and NDH leader, [[Ante Pavelić]]. The division was the first SS division which was constituted of non-Germans. On 25 November 1943 the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Ottoman borders. Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans. On 6 April 1945 Sarajevo was captured by the Partisans. The end of the war resulted in the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, with the constitution of 1946 officially making Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.

{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945–1992)|1984 Winter Olympics}}
Because of its central geographic position within the  for much of the 1950s and 1960s, the 1970s saw the ascension of a strong Bosnian political elite. While working within the [[Communism|communist]] system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina &lt;ref name=Stojic&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005). [http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3058&amp;reportid=170 Branko Mikulic - socialist emperor manqué] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014095310/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3058&amp;reportid=170 |date=2017-10-14 }}. BH Dani&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic could not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time unscathed.

The first multi-party parliamentary elections held on 18 and 25 November 1990 &lt;ref name=&quot;phron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701210204/http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a national assembly dominated by three ethnically-based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. Croatia and [[Slovenia]]'s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the Yugoslav federation (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats). A declaration of sovereignty on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and 1 March 1992. The referendum was boycotted by the great majority of Bosnian Serbs, so with a voter turnout of 64%, 98% of which voted in favor of the proposal. Bosnia and Herzegovina became an independent state on 3 March 1992.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

While the first casualty of the war is debated, significant Serbian offensives began in March 1992 in Eastern and Northern Bosnia. Following a tense period of escalating tensions the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosniak villages around [[Čapljina]] on 7 March 1992 and around [[Bosanski Brod]] and [[Goražde]] on 15 March. These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on [[Neum]] on 19 March and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March. The killing of [[Suada Dilberović|a Bosniak civilian woman]] on 5 April 1992 by a sniper, while she was demonstrating in Sarajevo against the raising of barricades by Bosnian Serbs, is widely regarded as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron&quot;/&gt; Open warfare began in Sarajevo on 6 April.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;
International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina meant that the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) officially withdrew from the republic's territory, although their Bosnian Serb members merely joined the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers, Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt; By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the Sarajevo government and the Croat statelet of [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Herzeg-Bosnia]], about 70% of the country was controlled by the Serbs.&lt;ref name=Riedlmayer/&gt;
 [[File:Map Bih entities.png|thumb|200px|right|Administrative division of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina.]]
In March 1994, the signing of the [[Washington Agreement|Washington accords]] between the Bosniak and ethnic-Croatian leaders led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. This, along with international outrage at [[Bosnian Genocide|Serb war crimes and atrocities]] (most notably the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of as many as 8,000 Bosniak males in July 1995&lt;ref&gt;Federal Commission for Missing Persons; &quot;Preliminary List of Missing and Killed in Srebrenica&quot;; 2005 {{cite web|title=[http://www.domovina.net/srebrenica/page_006/Preliminarni_spisak_Srebrenica_1995.pdf] }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(522&amp;nbsp;KB)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) helped turn the tide of war. The signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in [[Paris]] by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Alija Izetbegović]]), Croatia ([[Franjo Tuđman]]), and Yugoslavia ([[Slobodan Milošević]]) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. The three years of war and bloodshed had left between 90,000 and 110,000 people killed and more than 2 million displaced.&lt;ref name=DPA&gt;November. 21, 2005.

{{see also|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Since its 1992 independence and the 1995 Constitutional framework of the [[Dayton Agreement]], Bosnia and Herzegovina has followed a path of state-building, while remaining under final international supervision through the figure of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a federation of two Entities - the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]], as well as the district of [[Brčko District|Brčko]]. Each of the Entities has its own Constitution and extensive legislative powers.

{{main|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|potential candidate country for accession into the EU]]; the EU-BiH [[Stabilization and Association Agreement]] (SAA) was signed in 2008 and entered into force in June 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its formal application for EU membership on 15 February 2016; the EU Council conditioned its consideration to further progress on the implementation of the Reform Agenda, as well as to the adaptation of the SAA to take into account the EU accession of Croatia, and to an agreement on a functioning Coordination Mechanism on EU matters. These conditions were fulfilled by the Summer 2016.

{{main|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO}}
The [[accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO]] is in the negotiation phase, and a [[Membership Action Plan]] was signed in April 2010. It requires Bosnia and Herzegovina to define the issue of property over defence assets before NATO may consider the next steps. Bosnian political parties have different attitudes towards NATO: while Bosniak and Bosnian Croat parties support it, Bosnian Serb parties are more cautious and, while not opposing it in principle, require it to be put to a referendum first.

Bilateral cingulotomy has also been used in the treatment of chronic refractory pain. A systematic review of 11 studies encompassing 224 patients found that anterior cingulotomy led to significant pain relief in greater than 60% of patients post-operatively as well as at one year following the procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pouratian 2016&quot;/&gt; Of the included studies, one clinical study investigated the effect of bilateral cingulotomy for the treatment of [[refractory]] [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name = &quot; Wilkinson&quot;/&gt; In this case, 23 patients who were subject to 28 cingulotomies in total were followed up. The analyses aimed at determining how much the pain of each individual was affected after the procedure with the help of a questionnaire. In addition, the examiners tried to evaluate the impacts on social and family relations of the participants in the study.  Based on the data obtained, cingulotomy for treatment of chronic pain showed promising results. 72% reported improvement in the level of pain experienced, and 50% indicated that they no longer required painkillers after cingulotomy. More than half of the patients also claimed that the surgical procedure was beneficial and contributed to the improvement of their social interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot; Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson et al.

'''70&amp;nbsp;mm film''' (or '''65&amp;nbsp;mm film''') is a wide high-resolution [[film gauge]] for motion picture photography, with negative area nearly 3.5 times larger than the standard [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[List of film formats|motion picture film format]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Celestino2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Inherent Vice’ Will Screen in 70 mm in Select Theaters.

For projection, the original 65&amp;nbsp;mm film is printed on {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} film. The additional 5&amp;nbsp;mm are for four magnetic strips holding six tracks of stereophonic sound. Although later 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints use digital sound encoding (specifically the [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] format), the vast majority of existing and surviving 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints predate this technology. 

Each frame is five [[Film perforations|perforations]] tall, with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.2:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.widescreen.org/aspect_ratios.shtml|title=Widescreen.org|last=John|website=widescreen.org|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] [[Ultra Panavision 70]] lenses squeezes the image into an ultra-wide 2.76:1 aspect ratio. To this day, Ultra Panavision 70 produces the widest picture size in the history of filmmaking; surpassed only by [[Polyvision]], which was only used for 1927's [[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoleon]]. 

With regards to exhibition, 70&amp;nbsp;mm film was always considered a specialty format reserved for epics and spectacle films shot on 65mm and blockbuster films that were released both in [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] and as 70&amp;nbsp;mm blow-ups. While few venues were equipped to screen this special format, at the height of its popularity most major markets and cities had a theater that could screen it.&lt;ref name=&quot;thegate.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=TIFF showcases the rarity and resurgence of 70 mm film |url=https://www.thegate.ca/film/031559/tiff-showcases-rarity-resurgence-70mm-film/ |website=The Gate |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some venues continue to screen 70&amp;nbsp;mm to this day or have even had 70&amp;nbsp;mm projectors permanently or temporarily installed for more recent 70&amp;nbsp;mm releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;DunkirkRelease2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Warner Bros.

== History ==
[[File:70mm-Film.jpg|thumb|Faded vintage 70&amp;nbsp;mm positive film with four magnetic strips containing six-channel stereophonic sound]]
Films formatted with a width of 70&amp;nbsp;mm have existed since the early days of the motion picture industry. The first 70&amp;nbsp;mm format film was most likely footage of the [[Henley Regatta]], which was projected in 1896 and 1897, but may have been filmed as early as 1894. It required a specially built projector built by [[Herman Casler]] in [[Canastota, New York]] and had a ratio similar to full frame, with an aperture of {{convert|2.75|in|mm}} by {{convert|2|in|mm}}. There were also several film formats of various sizes from 50 to 68&amp;nbsp;mm which were developed from 1884 onwards, including [[Cinéorama]] (not to be confused with the entirely distinct &quot;[[Cinerama]]&quot; format), started in 1900 by [[Raoul Grimoin-Sanson]]. In 1914 the Italian [[Filoteo Alberini]] invented a panoramic film system utilising a 70&amp;nbsp;mm wide film called Panoramica.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Preserving Wide Film History&quot; Grant Lobban, Journal of the BKSTS Vol 67 No.4 April 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fox Grandeur===
{{main|70&amp;nbsp;mm Grandeur film}}
In 1928, William Fox of the [[Fox Film Corporation]], in personal partnership with Theodore Case as the Fox-Case Corporation, began working on a wide film format using 70&amp;nbsp;mm film which they named [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur]]. Cameras were ordered by Fox-Case from Mitchell Camera Corp, with the first 70&amp;nbsp;mm production cameras, designated as the Mitchell Model FC camera, delivered to Fox-Case in May 1929. This was one of a number of wide-film processes developed by some of the major film studios at about that time. However, due to the financial strains of the Great Depression, along with strong resistance from movie theater owners, who were in the process of equipping their theaters for sound, none of these systems became commercially successful. Fox dropped Grandeur in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Preserving Wide Film History&quot; Grant Lobban, ''Journal of the BKSTS'' Vol 67 No.4 (April 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Todd-AO===
{{main|Todd-AO process}}
Producer [[Mike Todd]] had been one of the founders of [[Cinerama]], a wide-screen movie process that was launched in 1952. Cinerama employed three 35&amp;nbsp;mm film projectors running in synchronism to project a wide (2.6:1) image onto a deeply curved screen. Although the results were impressive, the system was expensive, cumbersome and had some serious shortcomings due to the need to match up three separate projected images. Todd left the company to develop a system of his own which, he hoped, would be as impressive as Cinerama, yet be simpler and cheaper and avoid the problems associated with three-strip projection; in his own words, he wanted &quot;Cinerama out of one hole&quot;.

In collaboration with the American Optical company, Todd developed a system which was to be called &quot;[[Todd-AO]]&quot;. This uses a single 70&amp;nbsp;mm wide film and was introduced with the film ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' in October 1955. The 70&amp;nbsp;mm film is perforated at the same pitch (0.187 inch, 4.75mm) as standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. With a five-perforation pull-down, the Todd-AO system provides a frame dimension of 1.912 inch (48.56mm) by 0.816 inch (20.73mm) giving an aspect ratio of 2.3:1.

The original version of Todd-AO used a frame rate of 30 per second, 25% faster than the 24 frames per second that was (and is) the standard; this was changed after the second film – ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' - because of the need to produce (24 frame/sec) 35&amp;nbsp;mm reduction prints from the Todd-AO 65mm negative. The Todd-AO format was originally intended to use a deeply curved Cinerama-type screen but this failed to survive beyond the first few films.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the Splendour of 70&amp;nbsp;mm Part 1&quot; Grant Lobban, Journal of the BKSTS Vol68 No.12 December 1986&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1960s and 70s, such films as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (which had been filmed in Todd-AO) and ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (which had been filmed in a copycat process known as Dimension 150) were shown in some Cinerama cinemas, which allowed for deeply curved screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/4784|title=Atlanta Theatre|work=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd-AO adopted a similar multi-channel magnetic sound system to the one developed for [[Cinemascope]] two years earlier, recorded on &quot;stripes&quot; of magnetic oxide deposited on the film. However Todd-AO has six channels instead of the four of Cinemascope and due to the wider stripes and faster film speed provides superior audio quality. Five of these six channels are fed to five speakers spaced behind the screen, and the sixth is fed to surround speakers around the walls of the auditorium.

===Panavision and the 65/70 mm format===
{{main|Super Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision 70}}
Panavision developed their own 65/70&amp;nbsp;mm system that was technically compatible and virtually identical to Todd-AO.  Monikered as [[Super Panavision 70]], it used spherical lenses and the same 2.2:1 aspect ratio at 24 frames per second. Panavision also had another 65mm system, ([[Ultra Panavision 70]]), which sprang from the [[MGM Camera 65]] system they helped develop for MGM that was used to film ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.  Both Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 employed an anamorphic lens with a 1.25x squeeze on a 65mm negative (as opposed to 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[CinemaScope]] which used a 2× compression, or 8-perf, horizontally filmed 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[Technirama]] which used a 1.5× compression).  When projected on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm print, a 1.25× anamorphic projection lens was used to decompress the image to an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest ever used in commercial cinema.

==Decline and resurgence==
Due to the high cost of 70&amp;nbsp;mm film and the expensive projection system and screen required to use the stock, distribution for films using the stock was limited, although this did not always hurt profits. Most 70&amp;nbsp;mm films were also released on [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] for a wider distribution after the initial debut of the film. ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' (1958), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964), and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) are well-known films widely shown in 70&amp;nbsp;mm format with a general release in 35&amp;nbsp;mm format. 70&amp;nbsp;mm film received a brief resurgence in the 1980s when it became popular to make &quot;blow-up&quot; prints of [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] titles. It had another resurgence in the mid-2010s with the release of ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012), ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015) and ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017), with a small number of venues getting temporary or permanent 70&amp;nbsp;mm film projectors in order to be able to screen these titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;DunkirkRelease2017&quot; /&gt; [[Quentin Tarantino]], in particular, led a successful campaign to have the equipment required to show ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (his 8th film) in [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]] installed in 100 cinemas worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-films-shot-70mm|title=10 Great Films Shot in 70 mm|last=Thrift|first=Matthew|date=22 January 2018|website=BFI (British Film Institute)|access-date=24 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blow-ups===
The 35&amp;nbsp;mm to 70&amp;nbsp;mm &quot;blow-up&quot; or process produces 70&amp;nbsp;mm release prints from 35&amp;nbsp;mm negatives, so that films shot on the smaller format could benefit from 70&amp;nbsp;mm image and sound quality. This process began in the 1960s with titles like [[The Cardinal (film)|The Cardinal]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginning of the End |url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/35-70mm.htm |website=in70mm |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues up until the present day, with the height of its popularity being in the 1980s. These enlargements often provided richer colors, and a brighter, steadier and sharper (though often grainier) image, but the main benefit was the ability to provide 6-channel stereophonic sound as most theaters before the mid-70s (before the advent of [[Dolby noise reduction|Dolby A]]) were screening 35&amp;nbsp;mm prints with single channel [[monaural]] sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Celestino2014&quot; /&gt; However these &quot;blow-ups&quot; rarely used the full six channels of the [[Todd-AO]] system and instead used the four-track mixes made for 35&amp;nbsp;mm prints, the additional half-left and half-right speakers of the [[Todd-AO]] layout being fed with a simple mix of the signals intended for the adjacent speakers (known as a &quot;spread&quot;) or simply left blank.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Mixing Dolby Stereo Film Sound&quot; Larry Blake Recording Engineer/Producer Vol12 No.1 Feb 1981&lt;/ref&gt; If a 70&amp;nbsp;mm film was shown in a Cinerama theatre, the [[Cinerama]] sound system was used. From 1976 onwards, many 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints used Dolby noise reduction on the magnetic tracks but Dolby disapproved of the &quot;spread&quot; and instead re-allocated the 6 available tracks to provide for left, center and right screen channels, left and right surround channels plus a &quot;low-frequency enhancement&quot; channel to give more body to low-frequency bass.&lt;ref&gt;The CP200 – A Comprehensive Cinema Theater Audio Processor David Robinson Journal of the SMPTE Sept 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This layout came to be known as &quot;[[5.1 surround sound|5.1]]&quot; (the &quot;point one&quot; is the low-frequency enhancement channel) and was subsequently adopted for digital sound systems used with 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

In the 1980s the use of these &quot;blow-ups&quot; increased with large numbers of 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints being made of some blockbusters of the period such as the 125 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints made of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; However the early 1990s saw the advent of digital sound systems ([[Dolby Digital]], [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] and [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]]) for 35&amp;nbsp;mm prints which meant that 35&amp;nbsp;mm could finally match 70&amp;nbsp;mm for sound quality but at a far lower cost. Coupled with the rise of the multiplex cinema, which meant that audiences were increasingly seeing films on relatively small screens rather than the giant screens of the old &quot;Picture Palaces&quot;, this meant that the expensive 70&amp;nbsp;mm format went out of favour again. The [[DTS (sound system)#DTS 70 mm|DTS]] digital sound-on-disc system was adapted for use with 70&amp;nbsp;mm film, thus saving the significant costs of magnetic striping, but this has not been enough to stop the decline, and 70&amp;nbsp;mm prints were rarely made.

Among some of the more recent 70&amp;nbsp;mm blow-up titles are [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s [[Inherent Vice (film)|''Inherent Vice'']] (2014)&lt;ref name=&quot;Celestino2014&quot; /&gt; and ''[[Phantom Thread]]'' (2017), [[Patty Jenkins]]'s [[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|''Wonder Woman'']] (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70 mm Blow Ups 2017 |url=https://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/2017/index.htm |website=in70mm |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Ready Player One (film)|''Ready Player One'']] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Ready Player One' in 70 mm Film Opens on 22 Screens |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/ready-player-one-70mm-film-opens-22-screens-1098364 |website=Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current use ===
In the late 20th century, the usage of 65&amp;nbsp;mm negative film drastically reduced, in part due to the high cost of 65&amp;nbsp;mm raw stock and processing. Some of the few films since 1990 shot entirely on 65&amp;nbsp;mm stock are [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1996), [[Ron Fricke]]'s ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) and its sequel, ''[[Samsara (2011 film)|Samsara]]'' (2011), [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012), [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015), [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Dunkirk (2017 Film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017) (almost 80 minutes, about 75% of the film was shot on 65&amp;nbsp;mm IMAX film, while the rest was shot on regular 65mm film), [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (2017 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (2017), and ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]'' (2020). Other films used 65&amp;nbsp;mm cameras sparingly, for selected scenes or special effects. Films with limited 65&amp;nbsp;mm footage include
[[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' (2005), the [[Patty Jenkins]] film ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' (2020), [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]]'s ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020) and the Christopher Nolan films ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (featured 28 minutes of IMAX footage), ''[[Inception]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/03/25/director-christopher-nolan-and-producer-emma-thomas-interview-inception-they-talk-3d-what-kind-of-cameras-they-used-pre-viz-wb-and-a-lot-more/ |title=Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas Interview Inception – They Talk 3D, What Kind of Cameras They Used, Pre-Viz, WB, and a Lot More! |work=Collider |first=Steve 'Frosty' |last=Weintraub |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327204348/http://www.collider.com/2010/03/25/director-christopher-nolan-and-producer-emma-thomas-interview-inception-they-talk-3d-what-kind-of-cameras-they-used-pre-viz-wb-and-a-lot-more/ |archive-date=27 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (over an hour in IMAX) and ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''. 

Since the 2010s, most movie theaters have converted to digital projection systems, resulting in the removal of both 35&amp;nbsp;mm (the previous industry standard) projectors and 70&amp;nbsp;mm projectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/digital-cinema-conversion-nears-end-game-1200500975/|title=Digital Cinema Conversion Nears End Game|work=Variety|first=Leo|last=Barraclough|date=23 June 2013|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some venues and organizations remain committed to screening 70&amp;nbsp;mm film, seeing the special format as something that can set them apart and be an audience draw in an industry where most movies are screened digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Film Stays in the Picture: A Guide to 70 mm Film Projection |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/a-guide-to-70mm-projection/ |website=Consequence of Sound |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

70&amp;nbsp;mm film festivals continue to take place regularly at venues such as [[Somerville Theatre|The Somerville Theatre]] in Somerville, MA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scoutsomerville.com/somerville-theatre-70mm-film-festival/|title=70 mm Film Festival Celebrates Cinematic Classics {{!}} Scout Somerville|last=Feedore|first=Elliott|website=scoutsomerville.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Music Box Theatre (Chicago)|Music Box Theatre]] in Chicago, IL,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/70mm-film-festival-the-ultimate-edition-arrives-at-chicagos-music-box-theater|title=&quot;70 mm Film Festival: The Ultimate Edition&quot; Arrives at Chicago's Music Box Theater {{!}} Balder and Dash {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Sobczynski|first=Peter|website=rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Seattle Cinerama|Cinerama]] in Seattle WA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2013/seattle/index.htm|title=Seattle Cinerama Big Screen 70 mm Festival|website=in70mm.com|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Cinematheque]]'s Aero and Egyptian Theaters in Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Return of 70 mm |url=http://americancinematheque.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-return-of-70mm-by-wade-major.html |website=American Cinematheque Blog |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of the Moving Image]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=See it Big! 70 mm |url=http://www.movingimage.us/programs/2017/07/19/detail/see-it-big-70mm/ |website=Museum of the Moving Image - Programs |accessdate=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]] in Toronto,&lt;ref name=&quot;thegate.ca&quot;/&gt; the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in Worcester, MA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lnl.wpi.edu/services/projection.html|title=Lens and Lights &amp;#124; Projection|accessdate=3 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

=== Home media ===
For home theater, VHS and DVD did not offer enough resolution to carry the full image quality captured by 70&amp;nbsp;mm film, and VHS and DVD video transfers were usually prepared from 35&amp;nbsp;mm reduction elements. The high-definition [[Blu-ray]] format, in contrast, can potentially reveal the quality advantage of 70&amp;nbsp;mm productions. Although [[telecine]] machines for 70&amp;nbsp;mm scanning are uncommon, high-resolution transfers from high-quality full-gauge elements can reveal impressive technical quality.

== Uses of 70&amp;nbsp;mm ==
===Ultra Panavision===
{{main|Ultra Panavision 70}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Ben-Hur chariot race.jpg|thumb|380px|The chariot race scene from ''Ben-Hur'', illustrating the extremely wide [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] used.]] --&gt;
An [[anamorphic]] squeeze combined with 65&amp;nbsp;mm film allowed for extremely wide aspect ratios to be used while still preserving quality. This was used in the 1957 film ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'' and to incredible success in the 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and the 2015 film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'', both of which were filmed with the Ultra Panavision 70/MGM Camera 65 process at an aspect ratio of 2.76:1.  It required the use of a 1.25x anamorphic lens to horizontally compress the image, and a corresponding lens on the projector to uncompress it.

===Special effects===
Limited use of 65&amp;nbsp;mm film was revived in the late 1970s for some of the visual effects sequences in films like ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', mainly because the larger negative did a better job than 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative of minimizing visible film grain during optical [[compositing]]. 65mm was the primary film format used at VFX pioneer [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s facility EEG (Entertainment Effects Group), which later became [[Boss Film Studios]], run by former [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] alum [[Richard Edlund]]. Since the 1990s, a handful of films (such as ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'') have used 65mm for this purpose, but the usage of [[digital intermediate]] for compositing has largely negated these issues.  Digital intermediate offers other benefits such as lower cost and a greater range of available lenses and accessories to ensure a consistent look to the footage.

===IMAX===
{{main|IMAX}}
A [[horizontal pulldown|horizontal]] variant of 70&amp;nbsp;mm, with an even bigger picture area, is used for the high-performance IMAX format which uses a frame that is 15 perforations wide on 70&amp;nbsp;mm film. The Dynavision and Astrovision systems each use slightly less film per frame and [[vertical pulldown]] to save print costs while being able to project onto an IMAX screen. Both were rare, with Astrovision largely used in Japanese [[planetarium]]s. In the 2014 movie ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', a significant amount was shot in the IMAX format. Other scenes were shot in either 35&amp;nbsp;mm or in the standard 'vertical' 5-perf 65&amp;nbsp;mm format. IMAX introduced a digital projection system in the late 2000s and most IMAX venues have migrated to digital setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2013/10/film-loses-more-ground-as-imax-switches-flagship-theaters-to-digital/|title=Film Loses More Ground As Imax Switches Flagship Theaters to Digital|work=Studio Daily|first=Bryant|last=Frazer|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===70&amp;nbsp;mm 3D early use===
The first commercial introduction of 70&amp;nbsp;mm single projector 3D was the 1967 release of ''Con la muerte a la espalda'', a Spanish/French/Italian co-production which used a process called Hi-Fi Stereo 70, itself based on a simplified, earlier developed soviet process called Stereo-70. This process captured two anamorphic images, one for each eye, side by side on 65&amp;nbsp;mm film. A special lens on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm projector added polarization and merged the two images on the screen. The 1971 re-release of [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' used the side-by-side StereoVision format and was distributed in both anamorphically squeezed 35&amp;nbsp;mm and deluxe non-anamorphic 70&amp;nbsp;mm form. The system was developed by Allan Silliphant and [[Chris Condon]] of StereoVision International Inc., which handled all technical and marketing aspects on a five-year special-royalty basis with Warner Bros. The big screen 3D image was both bright and clear, with all the former sync and brightness problems of traditional dual 35&amp;nbsp;mm 3D eliminated. Still, it took many years more before IMAX began to test the water for big-screen 3D, and sold the concept to Hollywood executives.

===IMAX 3D===
Hollywood has released films shot on 35&amp;nbsp;mm as IMAX blow-up versions. Many 3D films were shown in the 70&amp;nbsp;mm IMAX format. ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' in IMAX 3D 70&amp;nbsp;mm earned 14 times as much, per screen, as the simultaneous 2D 35&amp;nbsp;mm release of that film in the fall of 2004.

In 2011 IMAX introduced a 3D Digital camera based on two [[Digital cinematography#Vision Research Phantom|Phantom 65]] cores. The camera has been used for documentaries as well as Hollywood films, the first being the 2014 release of ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]''.

==Technical specifications==

===Standard 65&amp;nbsp;mm (5/70) (Todd-AO, Super Panavision)===
* spherical lenses
* 5 perforations/frame (1 perforation = 0.1875&quot;, thus 1 frame of 70&amp;nbsp;mm = 0.9375&quot; or 15/16&quot;)
* 42 frames/meter (12.8 frames/ft)
* 34.29&amp;nbsp;meters/minute (112.5&amp;nbsp;ft/minute)
* [[vertical pulldown]]
* 24 frames/second
* ''camera aperture'': 52.63 by 23.01&amp;nbsp;mm (2.072 by 0.906&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;ref name=&quot;awsm_dimensions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/filmdims.htm|work=The American WideScreen Museum|title=Film Frame Dimensions|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''projection aperture'': 48.56 by 22.10&amp;nbsp;mm (1.912 by 0.870&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;ref name=&quot;awsm_dimensions&quot; /&gt;
* 305&amp;nbsp;m (1000&amp;nbsp;feet), about 9 minutes at 24 frame/s = 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg (10 pounds) in can
* ''aspect ratio'': 2.2:1

===Ultra Panavision 70 (MGM Camera 65)===
{{main|Ultra Panavision 70}}
''Same as Standard 65mm except''
* ''projection aperture'': 48.59 by 22.05&amp;nbsp;mm (1.913 by 0.868&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;ref name=&quot;awsm_dimensions&quot; /&gt;
* MGM Camera 65 lenses built by Panavision employed a square-shaped, double wedge-prism anamorphic attachment in front of a spherical objective lens.  By the time of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)]]'' Panavision had developed a new set of Ultra Panavision 70 lenses that used a high quality cylindrical anamorphic element in front of the objective lens.  These new lenses were far superior to the prism anamorphics—they were lighter, transmitted more light and suffered from less spherical and chromatic aberration.
* 1.25x squeeze factor, projected aspect ratio 2.76:1

===Showscan===
{{main|Showscan}}
''Same as Standard 65&amp;nbsp;mm except''
* 60 frames per second

===[[IMAX]] (15/70)===
* [[spherical lens]]es
* 70&amp;nbsp;mm film, 15 perforations per frame
* horizontal rolling loop movement, from right to left (viewed from emulsion side)
* 24 frames per second
* ''camera aperture:'' {{convert|70.41|x|52.63|mm|in|abbr=on}}
* ''projection aperture:'' at least {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} less than camera aperture on the vertical axis and at least {{convert|0.41|mm|in|abbr=on}} less on the horizontal axis
* ''aspect ratio:'' 1.43:1
* ''DMR aspect ratio'': 1.90:1, 2.39:1

===[[IMAX Dome]] / OMNIMAX===
''Same as IMAX except''
* [[fisheye lens]]
* lens optically centered {{convert|9.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} above film horizontal center line
* projected elliptically on a dome screen, 20° below and 110° above perfectly centered viewers

===Omnivision Cinema 180===
''same as standard 65/70 except:''
* photographed and projected with special fisheye lenses matched to large 180 degree dome screen
* Theatres upgraded from 70&amp;nbsp;mm 6-track analog sound to DTS digital sound in 1995.

Omnivision started in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. Theatres were designed to compete with Omnimax but with much lower startup and operating costs. Most theatres were built in fabric domed structures designed by Seaman Corporation. The last known OmniVision theatres to exist in USA are The Alaska Experience Theatre in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], built in 1981 (closed in 2007, reopened in 2008), and the Hawaii Experience Theatre in  [[Lahaina, Hawaii]] (closed in 2004). [[Rainbow's End (Theme Park)]] in NZ had the only remaining permanent Cinema 180 attraction until May 2015 when it was demolished.
 
One of the few producers of 70&amp;nbsp;mm films for Cinema 180 was the German company Cinevision (today AKPservices GmbH, Paderborn).

===Dynavision (8/70)===
* fisheye or spherical lenses, depending on if projecting for a dome or not
* vertical pulldown
* 24 or 30 frames per second
* ''camera aperture'': 52.83 by 37.59&amp;nbsp;mm (2.080 by 1.480&amp;nbsp;in)

===Astrovision (10/90)===
* vertical pulldown
* normally printed from an Omnimax negative
* projected onto a dome
* almost exclusively in use only by Japanese [[planetarium]]s
* the only 70&amp;nbsp;mm format without sound, hence the only one with perforations next to the edges

The '''Israeli–Palestinian conflict''' is the ongoing struggle between [[Israel]]is and [[Palestinians]] that began in the mid-20th century amidst the greater [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/v3_ip_timeline/html/default.stm|title=A History of Conflict: Introduction|work=A History of Conflict |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]].&lt;ref&gt;Eran, Oded. &quot;Arab-Israel Peacemaking.&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins to the conflict can be traced back to [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] and [[sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine]] between Jews and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=history_honproj The Roots of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: 1882-1914]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been referred to as the world's &quot;most intractable conflict,&quot; with the ongoing [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank]] and the Gaza Strip reaching {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1967}} years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://divinity.duke.edu/about/contact-duke-divinity-school/faculty/staff/chris-rice Chris Rice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206181425/https://divinity.duke.edu/about/contact-duke-divinity-school/faculty/staff/chris-rice |date=6 February 2016 }}, [[Epigraph (literature)|quoted in]] Munayer Salim J, Loden Lisa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSsmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Through My Enemy's Eyes: Envisioning Reconciliation in Israel-Palestine''], quote: &quot;The Palestinian-Israeli divide may be the most intractable conflict of our time.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://polisci.columbia.edu/people/profile/78 Virginia Page Fortna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131022120/http://polisci.columbia.edu/people/profile/78 |date=31 January 2016 }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7MXPOz95A_IC&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Peace Time: Cease-fire Agreements and the Durability of Peace], page 67, &quot;Britain's contradictory promises to Arabs and Jews during World War I sowed the seeds of what would become the international community's most intractable conflict later in the century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avner Falk, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4CNVmZIen3AC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fratricide in the Holy Land: A Psychoanalytic View of the Arab–Israeli Conflict''], Chapter 1, page 8, &quot;Most experts agree that the Arab–Israeli conflict is the most intractable conflict in our world, yet very few scholars have produced any psychological explanation—let alone a satisfactory one—of this conflict's intractability&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. The key issues are mutual recognition and security, borders, water rights, control of [[Jerusalem]], [[Israeli settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/name-anmo/peace_process-processus_paix/canadian_policy-politique_canadienne.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canadian Policy on Key Issues in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] |access-date=13 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218143423/http://www.international.gc.ca/name-anmo/peace_process-processus_paix/canadian_policy-politique_canadienne.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=18 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palestinian freedom of movement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldBankReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf |title=Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency in the Palestinian Economy |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=9 May 2007 |access-date=29 March 2010 |quote=Currently, freedom of movement and access for Palestinians within the West Bank is the exception rather than the norm contrary to the commitments undertaken in a number of Agreements between GOI and the PA.

The violence of the conflict, in a region rich in sites of historic, cultural and religious interest worldwide, has been the subject of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues and human rights, and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright, [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/28/travel/tr-34813 'Tourism Curbed in Palestinians Areas,'] ''Los Angeles Times'', 28 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many attempts have been made to broker a [[two-state solution]], involving the creation of an independent [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] alongside the [[State of Israel]] (after Israel's establishment in 1948). In 2007, the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yaar|first1=Ephraim|last2=Hermann|first2=Tamar|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/just-another-forgotten-peace-summit-1.235013|title=Just another forgotten peace summit|newspaper=Haaretz|date=11 December 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a [[Views of the Arab–Israeli conflict|wide variety of views and opinions]]. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the [[Violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|level of violence witnessed]] for virtually its entire duration.&lt;!-- Long duration also a hallmark, but need a ref. --&gt; Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals. [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict#Fatalities 1948–2011|Casualties]] have not been restricted to the military, with a large number of fatalities in civilian population on both sides. There are prominent international actors involved in the conflict. A majority of [[Jews]] see the Palestinians' demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurtzer|first1=Daniel|url=https://archive.org/details/negotiatingarabi0000kurt/page/79|title=Negotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: American Leadership in the Middle East|last2=Lasensky|first2=Scott|author3=Organization|publisher=United States Institute of Peace Press|year=2008|isbn=9781601270306|page=[https://archive.org/details/negotiatingarabi0000kurt/page/79 79]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Palestinians and Israelis in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] have expressed a preference for a two-state solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Luis Grinberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OdmOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 ''Politics and Violence in Israel/Palestine: Democracy Versus Military Rule,''], Routledge 2009 p.214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dershowitz&quot;&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz|Dershowitz, Alan]].

Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2012}} Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side's commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yaar|Hermann|2007}}: &quot;The source of the Jewish public's skepticism – and even pessimism – is apparently the widespread belief that a peace agreement based on the 'two states for two peoples' formula would not lead the Palestinians to end their conflict with Israel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The two parties currently engaged in direct negotiation are the [[Israeli government]], led by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), headed by [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] (the ''Quartet'') represented by a special [[Diplomatic rank#Multilateral diplomacy|envoy]], that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The [[Arab League]] is another important actor, which has proposed an [[Arab Peace Initiative|alternative peace plan]]. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has [[Foreign relations of Egypt#Relations in the Middle East|historically been a key participant]]. Jordan, having [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|relinquished its claim to the West Bank]] in 1988 and holding a [[Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites|special role]] in the Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem, has also been a key participant.

Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been fractured by [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|conflict between two major factions]]: [[Fatah]], the traditionally dominant party, and its later electoral challenger, [[Hamas]], which also operates as a militant organization. After Hamas's electoral victory in 2006, the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] conditioned future foreign assistance to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PA) on the future government's commitment to non-violence, recognition of the State of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected these demands,&lt;ref&gt;CRS Report for Congress, 27 June 2006, [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/68794.pdf ''U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians'']&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the Quartet's suspension of its foreign assistance program, and the imposition of [[2006–2007 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority|economic sanctions]] by the Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Israel/Palestine Race, Nation, and Human Rights in the Conflict |publisher=Springer |author=Spangler, Eve |year=2015 |pages=161–162 |isbn=978-94-6300-088-8|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-088-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, following Hamas's [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|seizure of the Gaza Strip in June 2007]], the territory officially recognized as the PA was split between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in the [[Gaza Strip]]. The division of governance between the parties had effectively resulted in the collapse of bipartisan governance of the PA. However, in 2014, a [[Palestinian unity government of 2014|Palestinian Unity Government]], composed of both Fatah and Hamas, was formed. [[2013 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks|The latest round of peace negotiations]] began in July 2013 and was suspended in 2014.

[[File:Above West Omaha.jpg|thumb|View from above West Omaha]]
Omaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, [[Boys Town, Nebraska|Boys Town]], Regency, and Gateway areas.&lt;ref name=bydesign /&gt; The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its [[socioeconomic]] diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves,&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.J. (2007) ''American Ethnic History: Themes and Perspectives''.

Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]], [[Dundee, Nebraska|Dundee]] and [[Benson, Nebraska|Benson]]. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the [[Dahlman neighborhood|Dahlman]] and [[Burlington Road neighborhood]]s. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial annexation of [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]], Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.&lt;ref&gt;Daly-Bednarek, J.R.

Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to [[suburbs]] in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as [[white flight]] from racial unrest in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Caldas, S.J. and Bankston, C.L. (2003) ''The End of Desegregation?'' Nova Science Publishers. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are [[gated communities]] or have become [[edge city|edge cities]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, J.

With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Baltensperger, B.H. (1985) ''Nebraska: a geography.'' Westview Press. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused [[Racial Tension in Omaha, Nebraska|racial and ethnic tensions]]. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, D.R., Wunder, S.A. and Wunder, J.R. (2007) ''Nebraska Moments: New Edition.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become [[strikebreakers]]. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the [[Greek Town Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;Laliotou, I.L. (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_WL0HT1_4EC&amp;dq Transatlantic Subjects: Acts of Migration and Cultures of Transnationalism Between Greece and America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115085247/https://books.google.com/books?id=f_WL0HT1_4EC&amp;dq |date=January 15, 2016 }}, University of Chicago Press. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; That mob violence forced the [[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska|Greek]] immigrant population to flee from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Laliotou, I.

Sherman-French Publishers. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, D. (2004) &quot;Omaha, Nebraska&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near [[Scribner, Nebraska|Scribner]], a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. [[Racial profiling]] targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the [[Elkhorn River]], where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.&lt;ref&gt;De La Garza, M. (2004) &quot;The Lynching of Juan Gonzalez&quot;, ''Nebraska History.'' 85. (Spring). p. 24–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1919, following [[Red Summer]], postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching [[Willy Brown]] and the ensuing [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Omaha Race Riot]]. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, [[Edward Parsons Smith]], was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristow 2000&quot; /&gt;

Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Cordes, H.J. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071107070423/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10176422 &quot;Decline in industrial jobs hurts blacks&quot;] ''Omaha World-Herald''. November 5, 2007. Retrieved 9/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.

Despair after the April 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] contributed to [[King assassination riots|riots in North Omaha]], including one at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the [[civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska]] evolved towards [[black nationalism]], as the [[Black Panther Party]] was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the [[Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity]] became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the ''[[cause célèbre]]'' trial of the [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], in which an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.

Omaha's rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including [[Anna Mae Winburn]]'s [[Cotton Club Boys (territory band)|Cotton Club Boys]] and [[Lloyd Hunter]]'s Seranaders. [[Rock and roll]] pioneer [[Wynonie Harris]], jazz great [[Preston Love]], drummer [[Buddy Miles]], and [[Luigi Waites]] are among the city's homegrown talent. [[Doug Ingle]] from the late 1960s band [[Iron Butterfly]] was born in Omaha, as was [[indie folk]] singer-songwriter [[Elliott Smith]], though both were raised elsewhere.

Today, the diverse [[Culture of Omaha, Nebraska|culture of Omaha]] includes a variety of performance venues, museums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene in North Omaha and the modern and influential &quot;[[Omaha Sound]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Otto 2010&quot; /&gt;

Contemporary music groups either in or originally from Omaha include [[Mannheim Steamroller]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[The Faint]], [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[Azure Ray]], [[Tilly and the Wall]] and [[311 (band)|311]]. During the late 1990s, Omaha became nationally known as the birthplace of [[Saddle Creek Records]], and the subsequent &quot;Omaha Sound&quot; was born from their bands' collective style.&lt;ref&gt;Dinova, N.

While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies, O'Ryan countered that &quot;constructive&quot; integration of existing, new, and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies, once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole.

[[File:Disruptivetechnology.png|thumb|upright=2|How low-end disruption occurs over time.{{Clarify|reason=Can someone explain what is depicted here?|date=November 2017}}]]
{{Anchor|Technological_disruption_low-end_vs_new-market}}Christensen distinguishes between &quot;low-end disruption&quot;, which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market, and &quot;new-market disruption&quot;, which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=23-45}}

&quot;Low-end disruption&quot; occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance. Therefore, at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments. At this point, a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments, thereby gaining a foothold in the market.

In low-end disruption, the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer, who is happy with a good enough product. This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality. Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment, it seeks to improve its profit margin. To get higher profit margins, the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality. To ensure this quality in its product, the disruptor needs to innovate. The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment, and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers. After a number of such encounters, the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving. And then, finally, the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market.

&quot;New market disruption&quot; occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry. Some scholars note that the creation of a new market is a defining feature of disruptive innovation, particularly in the way it tend to improve products or services differently in comparison to normal market drivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Butterfly Effect in Competitive Markets: Driving Small Changes for Large Differences|last=Rajagopal|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781349493128|location=Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially caters to a niche market and proceeds on defining the industry over time once it is able to penetrate the market or induce consumers to defect from the existing market into the new market it created.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Disruptive technology==
In 2009, [[Milan Zeleny]] described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted. The answer, according to Zeleny, is the ''support network'' of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeleny|first=Milan|s2cid=34883719|title=High Technology and Barriers to Innovation: From Globalization to Localization|journal=[[International Journal of Information Technology &amp; Decision Making]]|volume=11|issue=2|page=P 441|doi=10.1142/S021962201240010X|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars (network of gas and service stations). Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners. In the long run, high (disruptive) technology bypasses, upgrades, or replaces the outdated support network.
Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology, Haxell (2012) questions how such technologies get named and framed, pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act.&lt;ref&gt;Haxell, A.

Technology, being a form of social relationship,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} always evolves. No technology remains fixed. Technology starts, develops, persists, mutates, stagnates, and declines, just like living [[organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Opening up the innovation process: towards an agenda | first=Oliver | last=Gassmann | journal=R&amp;D Management |date=May 2006  | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=P 223–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00437.x| s2cid=10483066 | url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/29184/1/06_R%26DMgmt_editorial_towards%20an%20agenda.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology. A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing [[technology support net]]s (TSNs), which are thus forced to coevolve with it. New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN, with smaller and smaller high-technology effects. High technology becomes regular technology, with more efficient versions fitting the same support net. Finally, even the efficiency gains diminish, emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes (appearance, style), and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology. This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated, resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation; then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated.

Regarding this evolving process of technology, [[Clayton M. Christensen|Christensen]] said:
{{quote|The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view. They do, however, have two important characteristics: First, they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that, at least at the outset, are not valued by existing customers. Second, the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Disruptive Technologies Catching the Wave | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=January 1995  | page=P 3 | first1=Clayton | last1=Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426 Joseph Bower]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HBS Faculty &amp; Research|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained the process of how disruptive technology, through its requisite support net, dramatically transforms a certain industry.
{{quote|When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges, established companies typically see it as unattractive: it’s not something their mainstream customers want, and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure. As a result, the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers. But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market. Once the disruptive technology becomes established there, smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=9f3ed8e7-4200-4c5d-9d35-c43991bd16ec%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4213&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=bth&amp;AN=6623927 | title=Disruptive Change | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=May 2002  | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=P 95–101 | first1=Joseph | last1=Bower}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage; however, it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable, unchanging TSN. The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of [[electric car]]—whether the energy source is the sun, hydrogen, water, air pressure, or traditional charging outlet. Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile. The [[printing press]] was a development that changed the way that information was stored, transmitted, and replicated. This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted [[censorship]] and [[information overload]] in writing technology.

[[Milan Zeleny]] described the above phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Advanced Management Systems |date=January 2009  | volume=01 | issue=1 | pages=P 8–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that:
{{quote|Implementing high technology is often resisted. This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN. The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines (ATMs) were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers. Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted. Middle management resists [[business process reengineering]] because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net (coordinative hierarchy) they thrive on. Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Acta Mechanica Slovaca |date=September 2009  | volume=36 | issue=1 | pages=P 6–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports. More specifically, the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on T.V., radio, and newspapers. Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports.

==High-technology effects==
[[High technology]] is a technology core that changes the very architecture (structure and organization) of the components of the [[technology support net]]. High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations, as well as their requisite physical, energy, and information flows. It also affects the skills required, the roles played, and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself.

This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core, which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way, but faster, more reliably, in larger quantities, or more efficiently. It is also different from appropriate technology core, which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency, instead of improving the efficiency of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of strategic alliances in high-technology new product development | last=Masaaki | first=Kotabe |author2=Scott Swan  | journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=January 2007  | volume=16 | issue=8 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250160804 | pages=621–636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the difference between high technology and low technology, [[Milan Zeleny]] once said:
{{quote|The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself, therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity. High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost, net present value or return on investment. Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful. For example, you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter, but not a typewriter with a word processor. Therein lies the management challenge of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Milan | last1=Zeleny | title=Knowledge-information autopoietic cycle: towards the wisdom systems | date=2006 | journal=International Journal of Management and Decision Making  | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=P 3–18 | doi=10.1504/IJMDM.2006.008168| citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, not all modern technologies are high technologies. They have to be used as such, function as such, and be embedded in their requisite TSNs. They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge. Not all information technologies have integrative effects. Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN. The administrative model of management, for instance, further aggravates the division of task and labor, further specializes knowledge, separates management from workers, and concentrates information and knowledge in centers.

As knowledge surpasses capital, labor, and raw materials as the dominant economic resource, technologies are also starting to reflect this shift. Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks. Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind, super-book, or super-database, but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action.

==Internal auditor response==

[[Internal audit]] plays a critical role maintaining effective control mitigating emerging risks. Businesses will increase risk or bypass opportunity if auditors do not address disruption-related risks.&lt;ref&gt;Pett, J., Kristall, M., &amp; Mack, D. (2017). Opportunity from disruption. ''Internal Auditor'', 74(3), 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alles has discussed that Big Data is a disruptive innovation that auditors must  incorporate in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Alles (2015) Drivers of the Use and Facilitators and Obstacles of the Evolution of Big Data by the Audit Profession. ''Accounting Horizons'': June 2015 pp. 439-449&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 study, ''Internal Auditors' Response to Disruptive Innovation'', reports on the  evolution of internal audit to react to changes. Disruptions examined include data analytics, agile processes, cloud computing, robotic process automation, continuous auditing, regulatory change, and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Christ, Margaret H.; Marc Eulerich and David A.

== A proactive approach to disruptive innovation ==
A proactive approach to addressing the challenge posited by disruptive innovations has been debated by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jianfeng|last2=Pan|first2=Jiaofeng|last3=Guo|first3=Jianxin|last4=Gu|first4=Fu|last5=Kuusisto|first5=Jari|date=February 2019|title=Measurement framework for assessing disruptive innovations|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040162518306656|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=139|pages=250–265|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2018.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petzold|first=Neele|last2=Landinez|first2=Lina|last3=Baaken|first3=Thomas|date=June 2019|title=Disruptive innovation from a process view: A systematic literature review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/caim.12313|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=157–174|doi=10.1111/caim.12313|issn=0963-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadiq|first=Fawad|last2=Hussain|first2=Tasweer|date=2018-12-10|title=Exploring the Role of Managers in Nurturing Disruptive Innovations|url=http://imsciences.edu.pk/files/journals/dec_2018/5-BER-544.pdf|journal=Business &amp; Economic Review|volume=10|issue=4|pages=103–120|doi=10.22547/BER/10.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petzold criticized the lack of acknowledgment of underlying process of the change to study the disruptive innovation over time from a process view and complexify the concept to support the understanding of its unfolding and advance its manageability. Keeping in view the multidimensional nature of disruptive innovation a measurement framework has been developed by Guo to enable a systemic assessment of disruptive potential of innovations, providing insights for the decisions in product/service launch and resource allocation. [[Middle management|Middle managers]] play an important role in long term sustainability of any firm and thus have been studied to have a proactive role in exploitation of the disruptive innovation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadiq|first=Fawad|last2=Hussain|first2=Tasweer|last3=Naseem|first3=Afshan|date=2020-05-19|title=Managers' disruptive innovation activities: the construct, measurement and validity|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MD-08-2019-1047/full/html|journal=Management Decision|language=en|volume=ahead-of-print|issue=ahead-of-print|doi=10.1108/MD-08-2019-1047|issn=0025-1747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of disruption==
In the practical world, the popularization of [[personal computers]] illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation. The original centralized concept (one computer, many persons) is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing, and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent. The era of personal computing brought powerful computers &quot;on every desk&quot; (one person, one computer). This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment, but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge. Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing (one person, many computers). Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers, databases, and mainframes, as well as production, distribution, and retailing facilities, and the like. For the first time, technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies. It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs: at the [[Locus of control|loci]] of the useful knowledge. Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate, free and empowered individuals do; knowledge, innovation, spontaneity, and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/views_from_the_front_lines_of_the_data_analytics_revolution | title=Views from the front lines of the data-analytics revolution | publisher=McKinsey Quarterly | last=Brown | first=Brad | date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazon Alexa, Airbnb are some other examples of disruption.

Uber is not an example of disruption because it did not originate in a low-end or new market footholds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; One of the conditions for the business to be considered disruptive according to [[Clayton M. Christensen]] is that the business should originate on a) low-end or b) new-market footholds. Instead, Uber was launched in San Francisco, a large urban city with an established taxi service and did not target low-end customers or created a new market (from the consumer perspective). In contrast, UberSELECT, an option that provides luxurious cars such as limousine at a discounted price, is an example of disruption innovation because it originates from low-end customers segment - customers who would not have entered the traditional luxurious market.

==Examples==

&lt;!-- 
PLEASE PROVIDE SOURCES THAT ARGUE THAT THE INNOVATION YOU ARE ADDING IS A DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION. 
To be a disruptive innovation it must have: 
DISRUPTED SOME MARKET BECAUSE NO ONE SAW IT COMING. 
i.e., firms went out of business, there were enormous changes in market share. Otherwise it's just not that disruptive.
People tend to add innovations that are &quot;revolutionary&quot;, but not disruptive. See definitions in the introduction of the article.

| [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[LED display]]s || [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] || The first liquid crystal displays (LCD) were monochromatic and had low resolution. They were used in watches and other handheld devices, but during the early 2000s these (and other planar technologies) largely replaced the dominant cathode ray tube (CRT) technology for computer displays and television sets.

CRT sets were very heavy, and the size and weight of the tube limited the maximum screen size to about 38 inches; in contrast, LCD and other flat-panel TVs are available in 40&quot;, 50&quot;, 60&quot; and even bigger sizes, all of which weigh much less than a CRT set. CRT technologies did improve in the late 1990s with advances like true-flat panels and digital controls; however, these updates were not enough to prevent CRTs from being displaced by flat-panel LCD and LED TVs.

Reduced instruction set computer was mainly used for portables like PDAs, mobile phones, tablets, and smartphones. When Apple started using Intel processors for its Mac computers, they wanted Intel to make the processors for the iPhone but they refused. So Apple made its own processors using ARM architecture. As the technology improved, it eventually overtook Intel processors, which were slow to innovate. In November 2020, the release of the [[Apple M1]] processor for Apple's Mac computers has started to disrupt the market for processors as it uses ARM architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuF9weSkS68&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality and resolution are no longer major issues in the 2010s and shutter lag issues have been largely resolved. The convenience of small memory cards and portable hard drives that hold hundreds or thousands of pictures, as well as the lack of the need to develop these pictures, also helped make digital cameras the market leader. Digital cameras have a high power consumption (but several lightweight battery packs can provide enough power for thousands of pictures).

Cameras for classic photography are stand-alone devices. In the same manner, high-resolution [[digital video]] recording has replaced [[film stock]], except for high-budget motion pictures and fine art.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The rise of digital cameras led [[Eastman Kodak]], one of the largest camera companies for decades, to declare bankruptcy in 2012.

The advantage of rapid setup time, editing in the camera, and nearly-instantaneous review quickly eliminated 16&amp;nbsp;mm high speed film systems. [[CMOS]]-based [[digital cameras]] also require less power (single phase 110 V AC and a few amps for high-performance CMOS, direct current 5V or 3.3V and two or three amps for low-power CMOS,&lt;ref&gt;iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/ref&gt; vs. 240 V single- or three-phase at 20-50 A for film cameras).

| [[Automobile]]s || [[Rail transport]] || At the beginning of the 20th century, rail (including [[streetcars]]) was the fastest and most cost-efficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries. The first cars, buses and trucks were used for local transportation in [[suburb]]an areas, where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks. As highways expanded, medium- and later long-distance transports were relocated to road traffic, and some railways closed down. As rail traffic has a lower [[ton-kilometer]] cost, but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic, rail is still preferred for large-scale bulk cargo (such as minerals). However, [[traffic congestion]] provides a bound on the efficiency of car use, and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport.

| [[High speed rail]] || Short-distance flights || In almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service, the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely. Even in markets with longer rail travel times, airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down. Examples include the [[Barcelona-Madrid high speed railway]], the [[Cologne Frankfurt high speed railway]] (where no direct flights are available as of 2016) or the Paris-London connection after the opening of [[High Speed 1]]. For medium-distance trips, like between Beijing &amp; Shanghai, the high speed rail and airlines often end up in extremely stiff competition.

| [[Private jet]] || [[Supersonic transport]] || The [[Concorde]] aircraft has so far been the only supersonic airliner in extensive commercial traffic. However, it catered to a small customer segment, which could later afford small private sub-sonic jets. The loss of speed was compensated by flexibility and a more direct routing (i.e. no need to go through a [[airline hub|hub]]). Supersonic flight is also banned above inhabited land, due to [[sonic boom]]s. Concorde service ended in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title= Concorde grounded for good |website=BBC News |access-date=4 May 2012 |date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year '''212''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXII]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Asper and Camilius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 965 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 212 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{Anthropology of religion}}
An '''augur''' was a priest and official in the [[ancient Rome|classical Roman]] world. His main role was the practice of [[augury]]: Interpreting the will of the [[List of Roman deities|gods]] by studying the flight of [[bird]]s &amp;ndash; whether they were flying in groups or alone, what noises they made as they flew, direction of flight, and what kind of birds they were. This was known as &quot;''taking the auspices''&quot;.

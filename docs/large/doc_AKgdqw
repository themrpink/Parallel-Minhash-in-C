Among the Berbers who were brought to al-Andalus by [[Almanzor|al-Mansur]] were the Zirid family of Sanhaja Berbers. After the fall of Cordoba, the Zirids took over Granada in 1013, forming the [[Taifa of Granada|Zirid kingdom of Granada]]. The [[Saqaliba]] Khayran, with his own Umayyad figurehead [[Abd ar-Rahman IV|Abd ar-Rahman IV al-Murtada]], attempted to seize Granada from the Zirids in 1018 but failed. Khayran then executed Abd ar-Rahman IV. Khayran's son, Zuhayr, also made war on the Zirid kingdom of Granada, but was killed in 1038.{{r|Collins2014|p=202}}

In Cordoba, conflicts continued between the Berber rulers and those of the citizenry who saw themselves as Arab.{{r|Collins2014|p=202}} After being installed as caliph with Berber support, [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam|Sulayman]] was pressured into distributing southern provinces to his Berber allies. The [[Sanhaja]] departed from Cordoba at this time. The Zenata Berber [[Hammudids]] received the important districts of Ceuta and Algeciras. The Hammudids claimed a family relation to the Idrisids, and thus traced their ancestry to the caliph Ali. In 1016 they rebelled in Ceuta, claiming to be supporting the restoration of [[Hisham II]]. They took control of [[Málaga]], then marched on Cordoba, taking it and executing Sulayman and his family. [[Ali ibn Hammud al-Nasir]] declared himself caliph, a position he held for two years.{{r|Collins2014|p=203}}

For some years, Hammudids and Umayyads fought one another and the caliphate passed between them several times. Hammudids also fought among themselves. The last Hammudid caliph reigned until 1027. The Hammudids were then expelled from Cordoba, where there was still a great deal of anti-Berber sentiment. The Hammudids remained in Malaga until expelled by the Zirids in 1056.{{r|Collins2014|p=203}} The Zirids of Granada controlled Malaga until 1073, after which separate Zirid kings retained control over the taifas of Granada and Malaga until the [[Almoravid]] conquest.&lt;ref name=Reilly1992&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Bernard F.|title=Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain 1031–1157|date=1992|publisher=Blackwell|page=4|edition=1995 Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the taifa period, the [[Aftasid dynasty]] based in [[Badajoz]] controlled a large territory centered on the [[Guadiana River]] valley.&lt;ref name=Reilly1992/&gt; The area of Aftasid control was very large, stretching from the [[Sierra Morena]] and the taifas of [[Mertola]] and [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] to the south, to the [[Campo de Calatrava]] in the west and the [[Montes de Toledo]] in the northwest and nearly as far as [[Oporto]] in the northeast.&lt;ref name=Reilly1992/&gt;

According to Bernard Reilly,{{r|Reilly1992|p=13}} during the taifa period genealogy continued to be an obsession of the upper classes in al-Andalus. Most wanted to trace their lineage back to the Syrian and Yemeni Arabs who accompanied the invasion. In contrast, tracing descent from the Berbers who came with the same invasion &quot;was to be stigmatized as of inferior birth&quot;.{{r|Reilly1992|p=13}} Reilly notes, however, that in practice the two groups had by the 11th century become almost indistinguishable: &quot;both groups gradually ceased to be distinguishable parts of the Muslim population, except when one of them actually ruled a taifa, in which case his origins were well publicized by his rivals. Nevertheless, distinctions between Arab, Berber, and slave were not the stuff of serious politics either within or between the taifas. It was the individual family that was the unit of political activity.&quot;{{r|Reilly1992|p=13}} The Berber that arrived towards the end of the caliphate as mercenary forces, says Reilly, amounted to only about 20 thousand people in a total al-Andalusi population of six million. Their high visibility was due to their foundation of taifa dynasties rather than large numbers.{{r|Reilly1992|p=13}}

In the power hierarchy, Berbers were situated between the Arabic aristocracy and the [[Muladi]] populace. Ethnic rivalry was one of the most important factors driving Andalusi politics. Berbers made up as much as 20% of the population of the occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/spain/5.htm Spain – Al Andalus], ''[[Library of Congress]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Caliphate, the Taifa kingdoms of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Badajoz]], [[Málaga]] and Granada had Berber rulers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} During the [[Reconquista]], Berbers in the areas which became Christian kingdoms were acculturated and lost their ethnic identity, their descendants being among modern Spanish and Portuguese peoples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== In al-Andalus under the Almoravids ====
[[File:Empire almoravide.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Almoravid empire|Almoravid]] realm at its greatest extent, c.&amp;nbsp;1120]]
During the taifa period, the [[Almoravid]] empire developed in northwest Africa. The core of the Almoravid empire was formed by the [[Lamtuna]] branch of the [[Sanhaja]] Berber.{{r|Reilly1992|p=99}} In the mid 11th century, they allied with the [[Godala|Guddala]] and Massufa Berber. At that time, the Almoravid leader [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]] went on a [[hajj]]. On his way back he met [[Malikite]] preachers in [[Kairouan]], and invited them to his land. Malikite disciple [[Abdallah ibn Yasin|Abd Allah ibn Yasin]] accepted the invitation. Traveling to Morocco, he established a military monastery or [[ribat]] where he trained a highly motivated and disciplined fighting force. In 1054 and 1055, employing these specially trained forces, Almoravid leader [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni|Yahya ibn Umar]] defeated the [[Kingdom of Ghana]] and the Zenata Berber. After Yahya ibn Umar died, his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] pursued the expansion of the Almoravids. Forced to resolve a Sanhaja civil war, he left control of the Moroccan conquests to his brother, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin|Yusuf ibn Tashufin]]. Yusuf continued to conquer territory, and following Abu Bakr's death in 1087, Yusuf became the Almoravid leader.{{r|Reilly1992|p=100–101}}

After their loss of Cordoba, the [[Hammudids]] had occupied [[Algeciras]] and [[Ceuta]]. In the mid-11th century, the Hammudids lost control of their Iberian possessions, but retained a small taifa kingdom based in Ceuta. In 1083, Yusuf ibn Tashufin conquered Ceuta. In the same year, [[al-Mutamid]], king of the [[Taifa of Seville]], traveled to Morocco to appeal to Yusuf for help against King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]] of Castile. Earlier, in 1079, the king of [[Taifa of Badajoz|Badajoz]], al-Mutawakkil, had appealed to Yusuf for help against Alfonso. After the fall of [[Taifa of Toledo|Toledo]] to Alfonso VI in 1085, al-Mutamid appealed again to Yusuf. This time, financed by the taifa kings of Iberia, Yusuf crossed to al-Andalus, taking direct personal control of Algeciras in 1086.{{r|Reilly1992|p=102–103}}

The Kabylians were independent of outside control during the period of [[Ottoman Empire]] rule in North Africa. They lived primarily in three states or confederations: the [[Kingdom of Ait Abbas]], [[Kingdom of Kuku]], and the principality of Aït Jubar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brill&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&amp;pg=PA600 ''E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936''], Volume 4, publié par M. Th. Houtsma, Page 600&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kingdom of Ait Abbas]] was a Berber state of North Africa, controlling Lesser [[Kabylie]] and its surroundings from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. It is referred to in the Spanish historiography as {{lang|es|reino de Labes}};&lt;ref&gt;Afrique barbaresque dans la littérature française aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles (l') Par Guy Turbet-Delof page 25&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes more commonly referred to by its ruling family, the Mokrani, in Berber {{lang|ber-Latn|At Muqran}} ({{lang-ar|أولاد مقران}} {{lang|ar-Latn|Ouled Moqrane}}). Its capital was the [[Kalâa of Ait Abbas]], an impregnable citadel in the [[Bibans|Biban]] mountain range.

The most serious [[Mokrani Revolt|native revolt]] against French colonial power in [[French Algeria|Algeria]] since the time of [[Abdelkader al-Jazairi|Abd al-Qadir]] broke out in 1871 in the [[Kabylie]] and spread through much of Algeria. By April 1871, 250 tribes had risen, or nearly a third of Algeria's population.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Droz, «Insurrection de 1871: la révolte de Mokrani», dans Jeannine Verdès-Leroux (dir.), ''L'Algérie et la France'', Paris, Robert Laffont 2009, {{p.|474–475}} {{isbn|978-2-221-10946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the French penetrated the [[Hoggar Mountains]] and defeated [[Kel Ahaggar|Ahaggar Tuareg]] in the battle of [[Tit, Tamanrasset|Tit]].

In July 1921, the Spanish army in north-eastern Morocco under [[Manuel Fernández Silvestre|Manuel Silvestre]] collapsed when defeated by the forces of Abd el-Krim, in what became known in Spain as the [[disaster of Annual]].

During the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] and [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]]'s reorganisation of the country created, for the first time, a unified Kabyle administrative territory, [[Provinces of Algeria#1954-1962|wilaya III]], being as it was at the centre of the anti-colonial struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/a-la-une/article/2004/07/05/veillee-d-armes-en-kabylie_371616_3208.html|title=Veillée d'armes en Kabylie|last=Stora|first=Benjamin|date=2004-07-05|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-03-22|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment of Algerian independence, tensions had developed between Kabyle leaders and the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Émeutes et Mouvements sociaux au Maghreb|last1=Le Saout|first1=Didier|last2=Rollinde|first2=Marguerite|publisher=Karthala|year=1999|isbn=978-2-865-37998-9|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an identity-related debate about the persecution of Berbers by the Arab-dominated regimes of North Africa. Through both exclusivities of [[Pan-Arabism]] and Islamism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kabylia.info/observer/spip.php?page=article_pdf&amp;id_article=123}}{{Dead link|date=October 2020|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; their issue of identity is due to the pan-Arabist ideology of the former Egyptian president, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Some activists have claimed that &quot;[i]t is time—long past overdue—to confront the racist arabization of the Amazigh lands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kabylia.info/arabization|date=2008-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111042413/http://www.kabylia.info/arabization|url-status=dead|title=Arabization|archive-date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after independence in the middle of the twentieth century, the countries of North Africa established Arabic as their [[official language]], replacing French, Spanish and Italian; although the shift from European colonial languages to Arabic for official purposes continues even to this day. As a result, most Berbers had to study and know Arabic, and had no opportunities until the twenty-first century to use their [[mother tongue]] at school or university. This may have accelerated the existing process of Arabization of Berbers, especially in already bilingual areas, such as among the [[Chaoui]]s of Algeria. Tamazight is now taught in Aures since the march led by [[Salim Yezza]] in 2004, which has started to the teaching of Tamazight in the schools in Aures.

While [[Berberism]] had its roots before the independence of these countries, it was limited to the Berber elite. It only began to gain success among the greater populace when North African states replaced their European colonial languages with Arabic and identified exclusively as Arabian nations, downplaying or ignoring the existence and the social specificity of Berbers. However, its distribution remains highly uneven. In response to its demands, Morocco and Algeria have both modified their policies, with Algeria redefining itself constitutionally as an &quot;Arab, Berber, Muslim nation&quot;.

In Morocco, after the constitutional reforms of 2011, Berber has become an official language, and is now taught as a compulsory language in all schools regardless of the area or the ethnicity. In 2016, Algeria followed suit and changed the status of Berber from &quot;national language&quot; to an official language.

Berbers have reached high positions in the social hierarchy across the [[Maghreb]]; good examples are the former president of Algeria, [[Liamine Zeroual]], and the former prime minister of Morocco, [[Driss Jettou]].

Nevertheless, [[Berberists]] who openly show their political orientations rarely reach high hierarchical positions. However, there are some exceptions; for example, [[Khalida Toumi]], a feminist and Berberist militant, has been nominated as head of the Ministry of Communication in Algeria.

The [[Black Spring (Algeria)|Black Spring]] was a series of violent disturbances and political demonstrations by Kabyle activists in the [[Kabylie]] region of Algeria in 2001. In the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Berbers in the [[Nafusa Mountains]] were quick to revolt against the Gaddafi regime. The mountains became a stronghold of the rebel movement, and were a focal point of the conflict, with much [[2011 Nafusa Mountains Campaign|fighting]] occurring between rebels and loyalists for control of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berber speakers&quot;/&gt; The [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|Tuareg Rebellion of 2012]] was waged against the Malian government by rebels with the goal of attaining independence for the northern region of [[Mali]], known as [[Azawad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17635437|title=Mali Tuareg rebels declare independence in the north|date=6 April 2012|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=30 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030104410/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17635437|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since late 2016, [[Hirak Rif|massive riots]] have spread across Moroccan Berber communities in the Rif region.

Prominent Berber groups include the [[Kabyles]] from [[Kabylia]], a historical autonomous region of northern Algeria, who number about six million and have kept, to a large degree, their original language and society; and the [[Shilha people|Shilha]] or Chleuh (French, from Arabic {{lang|ar-Latn|Shalh}} and [[Shilha language|Shilha]] {{lang|ber-Latn|ašəlḥi}}) in High and [[Anti-Atlas]] and [[Souss]] Valley of Morocco, numbering about eight million. Other groups include the [[Riffian people|Riffians]] of northern Morocco, the [[Chaoui people]] of eastern Algeria, the [[Chenouas]] in western Algeria, the Berbers of [[Languages of Libya|Tripolitania]] and the [[Tuaregs]] of the Sahara scattered through several countries.

Though stereotyped in Europe and North America as nomads, most Berbers were in fact traditionally farmers,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} living in mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers, such as the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] of Egypt; but the Tuareg and [[Zenaga people|Zenaga]] of the southern Sahara were almost wholly nomadic. Some groups, such as the [[Chaoui]]s, practiced [[transhumance]].

Political tensions have arisen between some Berber groups (especially the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]], and [[Riffian people|Riffians]]) and North African governments over the past few decades, partly over linguistic and social issues; for instance, in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, giving children Berber names was banned.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The regime of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] (ironically an Arabized Berber by ancestry) in Libya also banned the teaching of Berber languages, and the leader warned Berber leaders in a 2008 diplomatic cable leaked by [[WikiLeaks]]: &quot;You can call yourselves whatever you want inside your homes – Berbers, Children of Satan, whatever – but you are only Libyans when you leave your homes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/small-rebel-victory-big-moment-for-persecuted-berber-tribes/article1995361/|title=Small rebel victory big moment for persecuted Berber tribes|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the persecution suffered under Gaddafi's rule, many Berbers joined the [[Libyan opposition]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/africa/09berbers.html|title=Amid a Berber Reawakening in Libya, Fears of Revenge|publisher=NYTimes|date=8 August 2011|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berber languages]] form a branch of the [[Afroasiatic language family]]. They thus descend from the proto-Afroasiatic language. It is still disputed which branches of Afroasiatic diverged most recently from Berber, but most linguists accept either [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/61465/Berber|title=Berber|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2017}}&lt;!-- not supported by source given --&gt; or [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] (see [[Afroasiatic languages#Classification history|Afro-Asiatic languages]]).

Berber languages are spoken by around thirty to forty million people in Africa (see [[Berber languages#Population|population estimation]]). These Berber speakers are mainly concentrated in Morocco and Algeria, followed by Mali, Niger and Libya. Smaller Berber-speaking communities are also found as far east as Egypt, with a southwestern limit today at Burkina Faso.

{{lang|ber|Tamazight}} is a generic name for all of the Berber languages, which consist of many closely related varieties and dialects. Among these Berber languages are [[Riff language|Riff]], [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], [[Shilha language|Shilha]], [[Siwi language|Siwi]], [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]], [[Sanhaja de Srair language|Sanhaja]], [[Central Atlas Tamazight|Tazayit]] (Central Atlas Tamazight), [[Mozabite language|Tumẓabt]] (Mozabite), [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]], and [[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]], as well as the ancient [[Guanche language]].

The Berber identity is wider than language, religion, and ethnicity and encompasses the entire history and geography of North Africa. Berbers are not an entirely homogeneous ethnicity, and they include a range of societies, ancestries and lifestyles. The unifying forces for the Berber people may be their shared language or a collective identification with Berber heritage and history.

As a legacy of the spread of [[Islam]], the Berbers are now mostly [[Sunni Islam|Muslim]]. The [[Mozabite people|Mozabite]] Berbers of the Saharan [[M'zab|Mozabite Valley]] and Libyan berbers in Nafusis and Zuwara are primarily adherents of the [[Ibadi]] Muslim denomination.

In antiquity, the Berber people adhered to the [[traditional Berber religion]] before the arrival of [[Abrahamic]] faiths into North Africa. This traditional religion heavily emphasized [[ancestor veneration]], [[polytheism]] and [[animism]]. Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally, whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other [[traditional African religion]]s (such as the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]), or borrowed during antiquity from the [[religion in Carthage|Punic religion]], [[Judaism]], [[Spanish mythology|Iberian mythology]], and the [[Hellenistic religion]]. The most recent influence came from [[Islam]] and [[religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arab religion]] during the medieval period. Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still exist today subtly within the Berber popular culture and tradition.

Until the 1960s, there was also a significant [[Berber Jews|Jewish Berber]] minority in Morocco,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondeberbere.com/juifs-amazighs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027062825/http://www.mondeberbere.com/juifs/index-en.htm|url-status=dead|title=Udayen imazighen — Les Juifs amazighs — The Amazigh Jews|archive-date=October 27, 2005|website=Mondeberbere.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but emigration (mostly to Israel and France) dramatically reduced their number to only a few hundred individuals.

== Notable Berbers ==
Some of the best known of the ancient Berbers are the [[Numidia]]n king [[Masinissa]], king [[Jugurtha]], the Berber-Roman author [[Apuleius]], [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], and the Berber-Roman general [[Lusius Quietus]], who was instrumental in defeating the [[Kitos War|major wave of Jewish revolts of 115–117]] in ancient Israel. The Berber queen [[Dihya]], or Kahina, was a religious and political leader who led a military Berber resistance against the Arab-Muslim expansion in Northwest Africa. [[Kusaila]] was a 7th-century leader of the Berber Awerba tribe and King of the [[Sanhadja|Iẓnagen]] confederation and resisted the Arab-Muslim invasion. [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] was a Muslim king of the Berber [[Almoravid dynasty]]. [[Abbas ibn Firnas]] was a Berber-Andalusian [[Inventions of the Islamic Golden Age|prolific inventor]] and early [[Physics in medieval Islam|pioneer in aviation]]. [[Ibn Battuta]] was a [[Geography in medieval Islam|medieval Berber explorer]] who departed from [[Tangiers|Tanja]], Morocco and travelled the longest known distances of his time and chronicled his impressions of hundreds of nations and cultures.

Before the arrival of Islam into the region, most Berber groups were either Christian, Jewish or Animist, and a number of Berber theologians were important figures in the development of western Christianity. In particular, the Berber [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s. The 4th-century Catholic Church viewed the donatists as heretics and the dispute led to a schism in the Church dividing North African Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=History of the Christian Church: Nicene and Post-Nicene Christianity.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (Hippo being the modern Algerian city of [[Annaba]]), Scholars generally agree that Augustine and his family were Berbers, an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic World, Volumes 175–176|publisher=[[Paulist Fathers]]|year=1952|pages=376|language=en|quote=The whole of North Africa was a glory of Christendom with St. Augustine, himself a Berber, its chief ornament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=Maurice|date=1942-07-01|title=A Note on the Berber Background in the Life of Augustine|journal=[[The Journal of Theological Studies]]|language=en|volume=os-XLIII|issue=171–172|doi=10.1093/jts/os-XLIII.171-172.188|issn=0022-5185|pages=188–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCxNjeuYpJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=From Generation to Generation: The Renewal of the Church According to Its Own Theology and Practice|last=Leith|first=John H.|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1990|isbn=9780664251222|location=Louisville, KY|page=24|language=en|quote=Augustine, the North African of Berber descent [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0q3W7jYz7ZsC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Saint Augustine of Hippo: An Intellectual Biography|last=Hollingworth|first=Miles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199861590|location=New York, NY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2020}} but that they were heavily Romanized, speaking only Latin at home as a matter of pride and dignity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of all the fathers of the church, St. Augustine was the most admired and the most influential during the Middle Ages&amp;nbsp;...

He was a genius—an intellectual giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Cantor|author-link=Norman Cantor|title=The Civilization of the Middle Ages|publisher=Harper|year=1993|page=74|isbn=0-06-092553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many believe that [[Arius]], another early Christian theologian who was deemed a heretic by the Christian Church, was of Libyan Berber descent. Another Berber cleric, Saint [[Adrian of Canterbury]], traveled to England and played a significant role in its [[early medieval]] religious history.

[[Lusius Quietus]], was the son of a Christian tribal lord from unconquered Mauretania (modern Morocco). Lusius' father and his warriors had supported the Roman legions in their attempt to subdue Mauretania Tingitana (northern modern Morocco) during Aedemon's revolt in 40.

[[Masuna]] (fl. 508) was a Romano-Moorish Christian king in Mauretania Caesariensis (western Algeria) who is said to have encouraged the Byzantine general Solomon, the Prefect of Africa, to launch an invasion of the Moorish kingdom of Numidia.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale (1980: p. 734)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Dihya]] was a Berber Christian religious and military leader who led indigenous resistance to [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]], the region then known as Numidia, known as the Algeria today. She was born in the early seventh century and died around the end of the seventh century in modern Algeria. According to [[al-Mālikī]] she was said to have been accompanied in her travels by what the Arabs called an &quot;idol&quot;, possibly an icon of the [[Virgin]] or one of the [[Christian saints]].&lt;ref&gt;Modéran (2005) discussing this point also points out that according to the sixth-century historian [[Procopius]], a Berber king carried an idol of the god Gurzil.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian|Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus]] ({{circa|155|240}} AD), known as Tertullian ({{IPA|/tərˈtʌliən/}}), was a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa and was the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of Latin Christian literature. He also was a notable early Christian apologist and a polemicist against heresy, including contemporary Christian Gnosticism. Tertullian has been called &quot;the father of Latin Christianity&quot; and &quot;the founder of Western theology&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Sabellius]], who was a third-century priest and theologian who most likely taught in Rome, may have been of African Berber descent. Basil and others call him a Libyan from Pentapolis, but this seems to rest on the fact that Pentapolis was a place where the teachings of [[Sabellius]] thrived, according to [[Dionysius of Alexandria]], {{circa|260}}. What is known of Sabellius is drawn mostly from the [[polemical]] writings of his opponents.

[[Fadhma Aït Mansour]], born in Tizi Hibel, Algeria, is the mother of writers Jean Amrouche and Taos Amrouche. Fadhma, the illegitimate daughter of a widow, was born in a Kabylie village. Later, when she was with the Sisters at Aït Manguellet hospital, she converted to Roman Catholicism. She met another Kabyle Catholic convert, Antoine-Belkacem Amrouche, whom she married in 1898.

[[Ahmed es-Sikeli]], born in [[Djerba]] to a Berber family of the Sadwikish tribe was baptized a Christian under the name Peter, was a eunuch and kaid of the Diwan of the Kingdom of Sicily during the reign of William I. His story was recorded by his Christian contemporaries, Romuald Guarna and Hugo Falcandus from Sicily, and the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Il Gaito Pietro&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2020}}

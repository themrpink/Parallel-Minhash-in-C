Nonetheless, the Almohads, particularly from the reign of Caliph [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur|Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]] onward, embraced the use of [[Logic|logical]] [[Reason|reasoning]] as a method of validating the more central Almohad concept of ''tawhid''. This effectively provided a religious justification for philosophy and for a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] intellectualism in Almohad religious thought. Al-Mansur's father, [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf]], had also shown some favour towards philosophy and kept the philosopher [[Ibn Tufail|Ibn Tufayl]] as his confidant.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:233&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bennison|first=Amira K.|title=The Almoravid and Almohad Empires|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780748646821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Tufayl in turn introduced Ibn Rush (Averroes) to the Almohad court, to whom Al-Mansur gave patronage and protection. Although Ibn Rushd (who was also an [[Qadi|Islamic judge]]) saw rationalism and philosophy as complimentary to religion and revelation, his views failed to convince the traditional Maliki ''[[Ulama|ulema]]'', with whom the Almohads were already at odds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:233&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|261}} After the decline of Almohadism, Maliki Sunnism ultimately became the dominant official religious doctrine of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Abun-Nasr|first=Jamil|title=A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=0521337674|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the teachings of Ibn Rushd and other philosophers like him were far more influential for Jewish philospohers – including [[Maimonides]], his contempary – and Christian Latin scholars – like [[Thomas Aquinas]] – who later promoted his commentaries on [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:233&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|261}}

Along with the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] period preceding it, the Almohad period is considered one of the most formative stages of [[Moroccan architecture|Moroccan]] and [[Moorish architecture]], establishing many of the forms and motifs that were refined in subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marçais|first=Georges|title=L'architecture musulmane d'Occident|publisher=Arts et métiers graphiques|year=1954|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Salmon|first=Xavier|title=Maroc Almoravide et Almohade: Architecture et décors au temps des conquérants, 1055-1269|publisher=LienArt|year=2018|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bennison|first=Amira K.|title=The Almoravid and Almohad Empires|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Basset|first1=Henri|title=Sanctuaires et forteresses almohades|last2=Terrasse|first2=Henri|publisher=Larose|year=1932|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main sites of Almohad architecture and art include [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]], [[Marrakech|Marrakesh]], [[Rabat]] and [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le muse'', De Agostini, Novara, 1964, Vol. I pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the earlier Almoravid period and the [[Taifa|Taifas]] or [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliphal]] period in [[al-Andalus]], early Almohad architecture was much more restrained in its ornamentation, focusing its attention on overall architectural forms rather than on detailed surface decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|228–231}} In addition to continuing the integration of Moroccan and Andalusi artistic traditions, some currents in Almohad architecture may also reflect influences from [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] ([[Ifriqiya]]). Some Almohad elements, such as [[Multifoil arch|polylobed arches]], have their earliest precedents in [[Fatimid architecture]] in Ifriqiya and [[Egypt]] and had also appeared in Andalusi architecture such as the [[Aljafería|Aljaferia palace]]. In the Almohad period, this type of arch was further refined for decorative functions while [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe arches]] continued to be standard elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|232–234}} The decoration around ''[[mihrab]]'' arches inside mosques also evolved into richer and more monumental forms in the great ceremonial stone gates of Almohad architecture such as [[Bab Agnaou]] in Marrakesh and [[Bab Oudaia]] and [[Bab er-Rouah]] in Rabat. These gates employed varying decorative motifs arranged in concentric semi-circles around the arch of the gate, all of which was in turn framed inside an outer rectangular band with other motifs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|243–244}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; This style remained evident in [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinid]] gateways (e.g. the main gate of [[Chellah]]) and in later Moroccan gateways.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

The Almohad [[Kutubiyya Mosque|Kutubiyya]] and [[Tinmal Mosque|Tinmal]] mosques are often considered the prototypes of later Moroccan and Andalusi mosques,&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; although the [[Great Mosque of Taza]] (later modified by the [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinids]]) is the oldest surviving Almohad mosque (begun in 1142).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bloom|first=Jonathan M.|title=Architecture of the Islamic West: North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, 700–1800|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|121}} Like earlier mosques in the region, Almohad mosques have interiors consisting of large [[hypostyle]] halls divided by rows of arches that create a repetitive visual effect. However, the aisle or &quot;nave&quot; leading towards the ''mihrab'' (niche symbolizing the ''[[qibla]]'' in the southern/southeastern wall) and the aisle running along the qibla wall itself were usually wider than the others and were highlighted with distinctive arches and greater decoration. This layout, already present in Almoravid mosques, is often referred to as the &quot;T-plan&quot; by art historians (because the aisle running parallel to the ''qibla'' wall and the aisle leading to the ''mihrab'', perpendicular to it, form a &quot;T&quot; shape), and became standard in mosques of the region for centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The [[Minaret|minarets]] of Almohad mosques also established the standard form and style of subsequent minarets in the region, with a square base and two-tiered shaft covered in polylobed arch and ''[[darj wa ktaf]]'' motifs. The minaret of the [[Kasbah Mosque (Marrakech)|Kasbah Mosque]] of Marrakesh was particularly influential and set a style that was repeated, with minor elaborations, in the following Marinid period.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Deverdun|first=Gaston|title=Marrakech: Des origines à 1912|publisher=Éditions Techniques Nord-Africaines|year=1959|location=Rabat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; The most famous minarets of this time, however, are the minarets of the Kutubiyya Mosque (begun in 1147 by [[Abd al-Mu'min]] but subsequently rebuilt before 1195&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;), the [[Giralda]] of Seville (part of a Great Mosque begun in 1171 by [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf]]), and the unfinished &quot;[[Hassan Tower]]&quot; of Rabat (part of a huge mosque begun by [[Yaqub, Almohad Caliph|Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]] in 1191 but never completed).&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Almohads were also prolific builders of fortifications and forts across their realm. They were responsible for building (or rebuilding) the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] of Cordoba, [[Walls of Seville|Seville]], [[Fortifications of Fez|Fes]], and [[Taza]], as well as many smaller forts and castles across Morocco and southern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; In Rabat, Abd al-Mu'min built most of the current [[Kasbah of the Udayas]] in 1150–1151 (after having destroyed an earlier Almoravid ''[[ribat]]'' there), while Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur embarked on the construction of a vast new capital and citadel on its south side called ''Ribat al-Fath'' (for which the enormous unfinished mosque of the Hassan Tower was also intended). While never finished, this project created the current outer walls of the historic center of Rabat, along with multiple gates such as Bab er-Rouah and the ceremonial main gate of the Kasbah of the Udayas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bennison|first=Amira K.|title=The Almoravid and Almohad Empires|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016|pages=309–10, 322–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur also created the [[Kasbah of Marrakesh]], a large royal citadel and palace complex to house the caliph's family and administration. The main public entrance of this kasbah was the ornamental gate of Bab Agnaou.&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt; In Seville, the Almohads built the [[Torre del Oro]], a defensive tower on the shores of the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir River]] which dates from 1220–21 and remains a landmark of the city today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt; Likewise, the [[Calahorra Tower]] in Cordoba is believed to be an originally Almohad structure designed to defend the river and the city's [[Roman bridge of Córdoba|old bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|326}}

==Status of non-Muslims==

The Almohads had taken control of the Almoravid Maghribi and Andalusian territories by 1147.&lt;ref name=islamicworldeb&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26925 &quot;Islamic world&quot;] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Retrieved September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Almohads rejected the mainstream Islamic doctrine that established the status of &quot;''[[dhimmi]]''&quot;, a non-Muslim resident of a Muslim country who was allowed to practice his religion on condition of submission to Muslim rule and payment of ''[[jizya]]''.&lt;ref name= Viguera&gt;M.J. Viguera, &quot;Almohads&quot;. In ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'', Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman.

The treatment of Jews under Almohad rule was a drastic change. Prior to Almohad rule during the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], Jewish culture experienced a [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden Age]]. [[María Rosa Menocal]], a specialist in Iberian literature at [[Yale University]], has argued that &quot;tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society&quot;, and that the Jewish ''dhimmi''s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in [[Christian Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;María Rosa Menocal, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ornament-of-the-world-how-muslims-jews-and-christians-created-a-culture-of-tolerance-in-medieval-spain/oclc/473322183?referer=br&amp;ht=edition ''The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jews migrated to ''al-Andalus'', where they were not just tolerated but allowed to practice their faith openly.
Christians had also practiced their religion openly in Córdoba, and both Jews and Christians lived openly in Morocco as well.

The first Almohad leader, Abd al-Mumin, allowed an initial seven-month [[grace period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ugr&quot;&gt;Amira K. Bennison and María Ángeles Gallego. &quot;[http://www.ugr.es/~estsemi/miscelanea/57/3.Gallego.08,33-51.pdf Jewish Trading in Fes On The Eve of the Almohad Conquest].&quot;  MEAH, sección Hebreo 56 (2007), 33–51&lt;/ref&gt; Then he forced most of the urban ''dhimmi'' population in Morocco, both Jewish and Christian, to convert to Islam.&lt;ref name= Viguera/&gt;

Those who converted had to wear identifying clothing since they were not regarded as sincere Muslims.&lt;ref name= Viguera/&gt; Cases of mass [[martyrdom]] of Jews who refused to convert to Islam are recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugr&quot; /&gt;

Many of the conversions were superficial. [[Maimonides]] urged Jews to choose the superficial conversion over martyrdom and argued, &quot;Muslims know very well that we do not mean what we say, and that what we say is only to escape the ruler's punishment and to satisfy him with this simple confession.&quot;&lt;ref name= Viguera/&gt; [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] (1089–1164), who himself fled the persecutions of the Almohads, composed an elegy mourning the destruction of many Jewish communities throughout Spain and the Maghreb under the Almohads.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Brann, ''Power in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Islamic Spain'', Princeton University Press, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ox7L8lO9YnMC&amp;pg=PA123 pp. 121–122.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jews fled from territories ruled by the Almohads to Christian lands, and others, like the family of Maimonides, fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;Frank and Leaman, 2003, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few Jewish traders still working in North Africa are recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugr&quot; /&gt;

The treatment of Christians under Almohad rule was a drastic change. Many Christians were killed, forced to convert or forced to flee. Some Christians fled to the Christian kingdoms in the north and west and helped fuel the [[Reconquista]]. Martyrs under Almohad rule included:
[[File:Martyrdom daniele fasanella.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Saint Daniel]]
*[[Daniel and companions]], d. 1221
*[[John of Perugia and Peter of Sassoferrato]], d. 1231
*Saint [[Serapion of Algiers]], d. 1240

[[Idris al-Ma'mun]], a late Almohad pretender (ruled 1229–1232 in parts of Morocco), renounced much Almohad doctrine, including the identification of Ibn Tumart as the Mahdi, and the denial of ''dhimmi'' status. He allowed Jews to practice their religion openly in Marrakesh and even allowed a Christian church there as part of his alliance with Castile.&lt;ref name= Viguera/&gt; In Iberia, Almohad rule collapsed in the 1200s and was succeeded by several &quot;Taifa&quot; kingdoms, which allowed Jews to practice their religion openly.&lt;ref name= Viguera/&gt;

'''''Eucalyptus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|juː|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|p|t|ə|s}})&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book'', 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[genus]] of over seven hundred species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]]s, shrubs or [[Mallee (habit)|mallees]] in the [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] [[Family (biology)|family]], Myrtaceae. Along with several other genera in the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Eucalypteae]], including ''[[Corymbia]]'', they are commonly known as [[eucalypt]]s.{{r|macphail2016}} Plants in the genus ''Eucalyptus'' have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard or stringy, leaves with oil [[Gland (botany)|glands]], and [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s that are fused to form a &quot;cap&quot; or [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] over the [[stamen]]s. The fruit is a woody [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] commonly referred to as a &quot;gumnut&quot;.

Most species of ''Eucalyptus'' are [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. [[Wildfire]] is a feature of the Australian landscape and many eucalypt species are adapted to fire, and resprout after fire or have seeds which survive fire.

A few species are native to islands north of Australia and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast growing and have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, for honey production or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because they are highly flammable.

==Description==
===Size and habit===
Eucalypts vary in size and [[Habit (biology)|habit]] from shrubs to tall trees. Trees usually have a single main stem or [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] but many eucalypts are mallees that are multistemmed from ground level and rarely taller than {{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. There is no clear distinction between a mallee and a shrub but in eucalypts, a shrub is a mature plant less than {{convert|1|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall and growing in an extreme environment. ''[[Eucalyptus vernicosa|E. vernicosa]]'' in the [[Tasmania]]n highlands, ''[[Eucalyptus yalatensis|E. yalatensis]]'' on the [[Nullarbor Plain|Nullarbor]] and ''[[Eucalyptus surgens|E. surgens]]'' growing on coastal cliffs in [[Western Australia]] are examples of eucalypt shrubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn about eucalypts |url=http://keyserver.lucidcentral.org:8080/euclid/data/02050e02-0108-490e-8900-0e0601070d00/media/Html/learn.htm |publisher=Euclid: Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research |access-date=14 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms &quot;[[Mallet (habit)|mallet]]&quot; and &quot;[[marlock]]&quot; are only applied to [[Western Australia]]n eucalypts. A mallet is a tree with a single thin trunk with a steeply branching habit but lacks both a [[lignotuber]] and [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]]. ''[[Eucalyptus astringens|E. astringens]]'' is an example of a mallet. A marlock is a shrub or small tree with a single, short trunk, that lacks a lignotuber and has spreading, densely leafy branches that often reach almost to the ground. ''[[Eucalyptus platypus|E. platypus]]'' is an example of a marlock.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANBR&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boland&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boland |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Brooker |first2=M. Ian |last3=McDonald |first3=Maurice W. |last4=Chippendale |first4=George M. |title=Forest Trees of Australia |url=https://archive.org/details/foresttreesaustr00bola |url-access=limited |date=2006 |isbn=0643069690 |page=[https://archive.org/details/foresttreesaustr00bola/page/n363 331]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANBG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Habit |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/Euclid/sample/html/habit.htm |publisher=Euclid: Australian National Botanic Gardens |access-date=29 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eucalyptus trees, including mallees and marlocks, are single-stemmed and include ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'', the tallest known flowering plant on Earth.&lt;ref name=tallest-tree&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141222-the-worlds-new-tallest-tree|title=Tasmania's giant ash trees may be world's tallest|first=Jane|last=Palmer|website=www.bbc.com|access-date=Sep 11, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree sizes follow the convention of:
* Small: to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height
* Medium-sized: {{convert|10|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}
* Tall: {{convert|30|-|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}
* Very tall: over {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homeguides.sfgate.com/eucalyptus-tree-information-38193.html|title=Eucalyptus Tree Information|website=Home Guides &amp;#124; SF Gate|access-date=Sep 11, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Bark===
All eucalypts add a layer of bark every year and the outermost layer dies. In about half of the species, the dead bark is shed exposing a new layer of fresh, living bark. The dead bark may be shed in large slabs, in ribbons or in small flakes. These species are known as &quot;smooth barks&quot; and include ''[[Eucalyptus sheathiana|E. sheathiana]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor|E. diversicolor]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus cosmophylla|E. cosmophylla]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus cladocalyx|E. cladocalyx]]''. The remaining species retain the dead bark which dries out and accumulates. In some of these species, the fibres in the bark are loosely intertwined (in stringybarks such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|E. macrorhyncha]]'' or peppermints such as ''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E. radiata]]'') or more tightly adherent (as in the &quot;boxes&quot; such as ''[[Eucalyptus leptophleba|E. leptophleba]]''). In some species (the &quot;ironbarks&quot; such as ''[[Eucalyptus crebra|E. crebra]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus jensenii|E. jensenii]]'') the rough bark is infused with gum resin.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANBR&quot; /&gt;

Many species are ‘half-barks’ or ‘blackbutts’ in which the dead bark is retained in the lower half of the trunks or stems—for example, ''[[Eucalyptus brachycalyx|E. brachycalyx]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus ochrophloia|E. ochrophloia]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus occidentalis|E. occidentalis]]''—or only in a thick, black accumulation at the base, as in ''[[Eucalyptus clelandii|E. clelandii]]''. In some species in this category, for example ''[[Eucalyptus youngiana|E. youngiana]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus viminalis|E. viminalis]]'', the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it gives way to the smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta|E. deglupta]]''.&lt;ref name=FieldGuide/&gt;

''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'' bark cells are able to photosynthesize in the absence of foliage, conferring an &quot;increased capacity to re-fix internal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; following partial defoliation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyles|display-authors=etal|first=A|date=2009|title=Role of corticular photosynthesis following defoliation in Eucalyptus globulus|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1004–1014|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01984.x|pmid=19344333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the tree to grow in less-than-ideal climates, in addition to providing a better chance of recovery from damage sustained to its leaves in an event such as a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saveyn|display-authors=etal|first=A.|date=Summer 2010|title=Woody tissue photosynthesis and its contribution to trunk growth and bud development in young plants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x/asset/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x.pdf;jsessionid=2DF8853EB94016F034D5922B3E11AB6A.f01t04?v=1&amp;t=j335k1pl&amp;s=2bcf5c5de958a434bce7596540f55ee86e269f4e|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|volume=33|issue=11|pages=1949–1958|via=Wiley|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x|pmid=20561249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different commonly recognised types of bark include:
* [[Stringybark]]—consists of long fibres and can be pulled off in long pieces. It is usually thick with a spongy texture.
* [[Ironbark]]—is hard, rough, and deeply furrowed. It is impregnated with dried [[kino (gum)|kino]] (a [[sap (plant)|sap]] exuded by the tree) which gives a dark red or even black colour.
* Tessellated—bark is broken up into many distinct flakes. They are [[cork (material)|corkish]] and can flake off.
* Box—has short fibres. Some also show tessellation.
* Ribbon—has the bark coming off in long, thin pieces, but is still loosely attached in some places. They can be long ribbons, firmer strips, or twisted curls.

===Leaves===

[[File:Eucalyptus tetragona - glaucous leaves close.jpg|thumb|''[[Eucalyptus tetragona|E. tetragona]]'', showing glaucous leaves and stems]]

Nearly all eucalyptus are [[evergreen]], but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season. As in other members of the [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] family, eucalyptus leaves are covered with oil glands. The copious oils produced are an important feature of the genus. Although mature eucalyptus trees may be towering and fully leafed, their shade is characteristically patchy because the leaves usually hang downwards.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}

The leaves on a mature eucalyptus plant are commonly [[lanceolate]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|petiolate]], apparently [[Alternate leaf|alternate]] and waxy or glossy green. In contrast, the leaves of seedlings are often [[Opposite leaf|opposite]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|sessile]] and [[Leaf#Surface of the leaf|glaucous]], but many exceptions to this pattern exist. Many species such as ''[[Eucalyptus melanophloia|E. melanophloia]]'' and ''E. setosa'' retain the juvenile leaf form even when the plant is reproductively mature. Some species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrocarpa|E. macrocarpa]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus rhodantha|E. rhodantha]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus crucis|E. crucis]]'', are sought-after ornamentals due to this lifelong juvenile leaf form. A few species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus petraea|E. petraea]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus dundasii|E. dundasii]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus lansdowneana|E. lansdowneana]]'', have shiny green leaves throughout their life cycle. ''[[Eucalyptus caesia|E. caesia]]'' exhibits the opposite pattern of leaf development to most eucalyptus, with shiny green leaves in the seedling stage and dull, glaucous leaves in mature crowns. The contrast between juvenile and adult leaf phases is valuable in field identification.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}

Four leaf phases are recognised in the development of a eucalyptus plant: the ‘seedling’, ‘juvenile’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘adult’ phases. However, no definite transitional point occurs between the phases. The intermediate phase, when the largest leaves are often formed, links the juvenile and adult phases.&lt;ref name=FieldGuide&gt;Brooker &amp; Kleinig (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all except a few species, the leaves form in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem, consecutive pairs being at right angles to each other (decussate). In some narrow-leaved species, for example ''[[Eucalyptus oleosa|E. oleosa]]'', the seedling leaves after the second leaf pair are often clustered in a detectable [[spiral]] arrangement about a five-sided stem. After the spiral phase, which may last from several to many nodes, the arrangement reverts to decussate by the absorption of some of the leaf-bearing faces of the stem. In those species with opposite adult foliage the leaf pairs, which have been formed opposite at the stem apex, become separated at their bases by unequal elongation of the stem to produce the apparently alternate adult leaves.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}

===Flowers and fruits===
[[File:Yellow Box blossoms and gumnuts.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Eucalyptus melliodora]]'', showing flowers and opercula]]
[[File:Eucalyptus camaldulensis seeds00.jpg|thumb|Seeds of ''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]'']]

The most readily recognisable characteristics of eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruit (capsules or &quot;gumnuts&quot;). Flowers have numerous fluffy [[stamen]]s which may be white, cream, yellow, pink, or red; in bud, the stamens are enclosed in a cap known as an [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] which is composed of the fused sepals or petals, or both. Thus, flowers have no petals, but instead decorate themselves with the many showy stamens. As the stamens expand, the operculum is forced off, splitting away from the cup-like base of the flower; this is one of the features that unites the genus. The woody fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end which open to release the seeds, which are waxy, rod-shaped, about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in length, and yellow-brown in colour. Most species do not flower until adult foliage starts to appear; ''E. cinerea'' and ''E. perriniana'' are notable exceptions.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}

==Taxonomy==
The genus ''Eucalyptus'' was first formally described in 1789 by [[Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle]] who published the description in his book ''Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum'' along with a description of the [[Type (biology)|type species]], ''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]''.&lt;ref name=APNI&gt;{{cite web|title=''Eucalyptus''|url=https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/455721 |publisher=APNI|access-date=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l'Herit.&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=L'Héritier de Brutelle |first1=Charles Louis |title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum |date=1789 |publisher=Petri Francisci Didot |location=Paris |page=11 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43456#page/35/mode/1up |access-date=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Eucalyptus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''eu'' meaning &quot;good&quot;, &quot;well&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;very&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RWB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author-link1=Roland W. Brown|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|title=The Composition of Scientific Words|date=1956|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|373}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|eu){{=}}|εὖ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kalypto'' meaning &quot;(I) cover&quot;, &quot;conceal&quot; or &quot;hide&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RWB&quot; /&gt;{{rp|234}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kalu/ptw|καλύπτω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] covering the flower buds.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANBR&quot; /&gt;

The type specimen was collected in 1777 by [[David Nelson (botanical collector)|David Nelson]], the gardener-botanist on [[James Cook|Cook's]] [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]]. He collected the specimen on [[Bruny Island]] and sent it to de Brutelle who was working in [[London]] at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANBR&quot; /&gt;

==History==
Although eucalypts must have been seen by the very early European explorers and collectors, no botanical collections of them are known to have been made until 1770 when [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]] arrived at [[Botany Bay]] with [[Captain James Cook]]. There they collected specimens of ''E. gummifera'' and later, near the [[Endeavour River]] in northern ''Queensland'', ''E. platyphylla''; neither of these species was named as such at the time.

In 1777, on Cook's third expedition, David Nelson collected a eucalypt on [[Bruny Island]] in southern [[Tasmania]]. This specimen was taken to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and was named ''Eucalyptus obliqua'' by the French botanist [[Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle|L'Héritier]], who was working in London at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last=L'Héritier |first=Charles Louis |author-link=Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle |year=1788 |title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum : imprimis in horto regio Kewensi excoluntur, ab anno 1786 ad annum 1787 observatae |place=Paris |publisher=Petri Francisci Didot |page=11 |language=la |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11832429 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the generic name from the Greek roots ''eu'' and ''calyptos'', meaning &quot;well&quot; and &quot;covered&quot; in reference to the [[operculum (botany)|operculum]] of the flower bud which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging [[stamens]] at flowering. It was most likely an accident that L'Héritier chose a feature common to all eucalypts.

The name ''obliqua'' was derived from the Latin ''obliquus'', meaning &quot;oblique&quot;, which is the [[botany|botanical]] term describing a [[leaf]] base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same place.

''E. obliqua'' was published in 1788–89, which coincided with the first official European settlement of Australia. Between then and the turn of the 19th century, several more species of ''Eucalyptus'' were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist [[James Edward Smith]] and most were, as might be expected, trees of the [[Sydney]] region. These include the economically valuable ''E. pilularis'', ''E. saligna'' and ''E. tereticornis''.

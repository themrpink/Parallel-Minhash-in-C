* The letter [[щ]] denoted different sounds in different dialects and is not shown in the table. In Bulgaria, it represented the sequence {{IPA|/ʃt/}}, and it is normally transliterated as št for that reason. Farther west and north, it was probably {{IPA|/c(ː)/}} or {{IPA|/tɕ/}} like in modern Macedonian, Torlakian and Serbian/Croatian{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}.
* {{IPA|/dz/}} appears mostly in early texts, becoming {{IPA|/z/}} later on.
* The distinction between {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, on one hand, and palatal {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, {{IPA|/nʲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}}, on the other, is not always indicated in writing. When it is, it is shown by a [[palatization mark|palatization diacritic]] over the letter: ⟨ л҄ ⟩ ⟨ н҄ ⟩ ⟨ р҄ ⟩ .

* Accent is not indicated in writing and must be inferred from later languages and from [[Proto-Slavic accent|reconstructions of Proto-Slavic]].
* The pronunciation of [[yat]] ([[yat|ѣ/ě]]) differed by area. In Bulgaria it was a relatively open vowel, commonly reconstructed as {{IPA|/æ/}}, but further north its pronunciation was more closed and it eventually became a diphthong {{IPA|/je/}} (e.g. in modern standard [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], or modern standard Serbian spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) or even {{IPA|/i/}} in many areas (e.g. in [[Chakavian]] Croatian, [[Shtokavian]] [[Ikavian]] Croatian and Bosnian dialects or [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) or {{IPA|/e/}} (modern standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] spoken in Serbia).
* The [[yer]] ([[yer|ь]]) and ([[yer|ъ]]) vowels ĭ and ŭ are often called &quot;ultrashort&quot; and were lower, more centralised and shorter than their counterparts i and y/u. They disappeared in most positions in the word, already sporadically in the earliest texts but more frequently later on. They also tended to merge with other vowels, particularly ĭ with e and ŭ with o, but differently in different areas.
* The exact articulation of the nasal vowels is unclear because different areas tend to merge them with different vowels. ę /ɛ̃/ is occasionally seen to merge with e or ě in South Slavic, but becomes ja early on in East Slavic. ǫ /ɔ̃/ generally merges with u or o, but in Bulgaria, ǫ was apparently unrounded and eventually merged with ŭ.

===Phonotactics===
Several notable constraints on the distribution of the phonemes can be identified, mostly resulting from the tendencies occurring within the [[Common Slavic]] period, such as ''intrasyllabic synharmony'' and the ''law of open syllables''. For consonant and vowel clusters and sequences of a consonant and a vowel, the following constraints can be ascertained:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huntley|1993|pp=127–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two adjacent consonants tend not to share identical features of [[manner of articulation]]
* No syllable ends in a consonant
* Every obstruent agrees in voicing with the following obstruent
* Velars do not occur before front vowels
* Phonetically palatalized consonants do not occur before certain back vowels
* The back vowels /y/ and /ъ/ as well as front vowels other than /i/ do not occur word-initially: the two back vowels take prothetic /v/ and the front vowels prothetic /j/. Initial /a/ may take either prothetic consonant or none at all.
* Vowel sequences are attested in only one lexeme (''paǫčina'' 'spider's web') and in the suffixes /aa/ and /ěa/ of the imperfect
* At morpheme boundaries, the following vowel sequences occur: /ai/, /au/, /ao/, /oi/, /ou/, /oo/, /ěi/, /ěo/

===Morphophonemic alternations===
As a result of the [[Slavic first palatalization|first]] and the [[Slavic second palatalization|second]] Slavic palatalizations, velars alternate with dentals and palatals. In addition, as a result of a process usually termed ''iotation'' (or ''iodization''), velars and dentals alternate with palatals in various inflected forms and in word formation.

In some forms the alternations of /c/ with /č/ and of /dz/ with /ž/ occur, in which the corresponding velar is missing. The dental alternants of velars occur regularly before /ě/ and /i/ in the declension and in the imperative, and somewhat less regularly in various forms after /i/, /ę/, /ь/ and /r&lt;sup&gt;ь&lt;/sup&gt;/.&lt;ref&gt;Syllabic sonorant, written with jer in superscript, as opposed to the regular sequence of /r/ followed by a /ь/.&lt;/ref&gt; The palatal alternants of velars occur before front vowels in all other environments, where dental alternants do not occur, as well as in various places in inflection and word formation described below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntley&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Huntley|1993|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of earlier alternations between short and long vowels in roots in [[Indo-European ablaut|Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Balto-Slavic#Balto-Slavic apophony|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and Proto-Slavic times, and of the fronting of vowels after palatalized consonants, the following vowel alternations are attested in OCS: /ь/ : /i/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /ъ/ : /y/ : /u/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /e/ : /ě/ : /i/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /o/ : /a/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /o/ : /e/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /ě/ : /a/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /ъ/ : /ь/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /y/ : /i/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /ě/ : /i/;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; /y/ : /ę/.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntley&quot; /&gt;

Vowel:∅ alternations sometimes occurred as a result of sporadic loss of [[Havlík's law|weak yer]], which later occurred in almost all Slavic dialects. The phonetic value of the corresponding vocalized strong [[yers|jer]] is dialect-specific.

==Grammar==
{{main|Old Church Slavonic grammar}}
As an ancient Indo-European language, OCS has a highly inflective morphology. Inflected forms are divided in two groups, nominals and verbs. Nominals are further divided into nouns, adjectives and pronouns. Numerals inflect either as nouns or pronouns, with 1-4 showing gender agreement as well.

Nominals can be declined in three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, plural, [[dual grammatical number|dual]]) and seven [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], and [[locative case|locative]]. There are five basic inflectional classes for nouns: ''o/jo''-stems, ''a/ja''-stems, ''i''-stems, ''u''-stems and consonant stems. Forms throughout the inflectional paradigm usually exhibit morphophonemic alternations.

Fronting of vowels after palatals and ''j'' yielded dual inflectional class ''o'' : ''jo'' and ''a'' : ''ja'', whereas palatalizations affected stem as a synchronic process (N sg. ''vlьkъ'', V sg. ''vlьče''; L sg. ''vlьcě''). Productive classes are ''o/jo-'', ''a/ja-'' and ''i''-stems. Sample paradigms are given in the table below:

Adjectives are inflected as ''o/jo''-stems (masculine and neuter) and ''a/ja''-stems (feminine), in three genders. They could have short (indefinite) or long (definite) variants, the latter being formed by suffixing to the indefinite form the anaphoric third-person pronoun ''jь''.

[[Synthetic language|Synthetic]] verbal conjugation is expressed in present, aorist and imperfect tenses while perfect, pluperfect, future and conditional tenses/moods are made by combining auxiliary verbs with participles or synthetic tense forms.

==Basis and local influences==
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar}}
Written evidence of Old Church Slavonic survives in a relatively small body of [[manuscripts]], most of them written in [[First Bulgarian Empire]] during the late 10th and the early 11th centuries. The language has a Southern Slavic basis with an admixture of Western Slavic features inherited during the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] to [[Great Moravia]] (863–885).

The only well-preserved manuscript of the Moravian recension, the [[Kiev Missal|Kiev Folia]], is characterised by the replacement of some Southern Slavic phonetic and lexical features with Western Slavic ones. Manuscripts written in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185-1396) have, on the other hand, few Western Slavic features.

Old Church Slavonic is valuable to historical linguists since it preserves archaic features believed to have once been common to all Slavic languages such as these:

* Most significantly, the [[yer]] ([[extra-short]]) vowels: {{IPA|/ĭ/}} and {{IPA|/ŭ/}}
* [[Nasal vowel]]s: {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}}
* [[Near-open vowel|Near-open]] articulation of the yat vowel ({{IPA|/æ/}})
* [[Palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}} from Proto-Slavic *ň and *ľ
* Proto-Slavic declension system based on stem endings, including those that later disappeared in attested languages (such as ''u''-stems)
* [[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]] as a distinct grammatical number from singular and plural
* [[Aorist]], [[imperfect]], Proto-Slavic paradigms for participles

Old Church Slavonic is also likely to have preserved an extremely archaic type of accentuation (probably{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} close to the [[Chakavian dialect]] of modern Serbo-Croatian), but unfortunately, no accent marks appear in the written manuscripts.

The Southern Slavic nature of the language is evident from the following variations:

* Phonetic:
** ra &gt; {{IPA|/la/}} by means of [[liquid metathesis]] of Proto-Slavic *or, *ol clusters
** sě from Proto-Slavic *xě &lt; *xai
** cv, (d)zv from Proto-Slavic *kvě, *gvě &lt; *kvai, *gvai
*morphosyntactic use of the dative possessive case in personal pronouns and nouns: 'рѫка ти' (''rǫka ti'', &quot;your hand&quot;), 'отъпоущенье грѣхомъ' (''otŭpuštenĭje grěxomŭ'', &quot;remission of sins&quot;); [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] future tense using the verb 'хотѣти' (''xotěti'', &quot;to want&quot;); use of the comparative form 'мьнии' (''mĭniji'', &quot;smaller&quot;) to denote &quot;younger&quot;.
**morphosyntactic use of suffixed demonstrative pronouns 'тъ, та, то' (''tŭ, ta, to''). In Bulgarian and Macedonian these developed into suffixed definite articles.

Old Church Slavonic has some extra features in common with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]:
* Near-open articulation {{IPA|[æ]}} of the ''[[Yat]]'' vowel (ě); still preserved in the Bulgarian dialects of the [[Rhodope mountains]];
* The existence of {{IPA|/ʃt/}} and {{IPA|/ʒd/}} as reflexes of Proto-Slavic *ť (&lt; *tj and *gt, *kt) and *ď (&lt; *dj).
* Use of possessive dative for personal pronouns and nouns, as in 'братъ ми' (''bratŭ mi'', &quot;my brother&quot;), 'рѫка ти' (''rǫka ti'', &quot;your hand&quot;), 'отъпоущенье грѣхомъ' (''otŭpuštenĭje grěxomŭ'', &quot;remission of sins&quot;), 'храмъ молитвѣ' (''xramŭ molitvě'', 'house of prayer'), etc.
* [[Periphrasis|Periphrastic]] compound future tense formed with the auxiliary verb 'хотѣти' (''xotěti'', &quot;to want&quot;), for example 'хоштѫ писати' (''xoštǫ pisati'', &quot;I will write&quot;).

===Great Moravia===
[[File:Zavedeni slovanske liturgie na velke morave.jpg|thumb|''The Introduction of the Slavonic Liturgy'' (1912), by [[Alphonse Mucha]], ''[[The Slav Epic]]'']]
The language was standardized for the first time by the mission of the two apostles to [[Great Moravia]] from 863. The manuscripts of the Moravian recension are therefore the earliest dated of the OCS recensions.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The recension takes its name from the Slavic state of Great Moravia which existed in Central Europe during the 9th century on the territory of today's western Slovakia and Czech Republic.

====Moravian recension====
In the ''Prague fragments'', the only Moravian influence is replacing {{IPA|/ʃt/}} with {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/ʒd/}} with {{IPA|/z/}}. This recension is exemplified by the Kiev Folia. Certain other linguistic characteristics include:

* Confusion between the letters ''Big yus'' (Ѫ) and ''Uk'' (оу) - this occurs once in the Kiev Folia, when the expected form въсоудъ ''vъsudъ'' is spelled въсѫдъ ''vъsǫdъ''
* {{IPA|/ts/}} from Proto-Slavic *tj, use of {{IPA|/dz/}} from *dj, {{IPA|/ʃtʃ/}} *skj
* Use of the words ''mьša'', ''cirky'', ''papežь'', ''prěfacija'', ''klepati'', ''piskati'' etc.
* Preservation of the consonant cluster {{IPA|/dl/}} (e.g. ''modlitvami'')
* Use of the ending&amp;nbsp;–ъmь instead of&amp;nbsp;–omь in the masculine singular [[instrumental case|instrumental]], use of the pronoun čьso

===First Bulgarian Empire===

Old Church Slavonic language is developed in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and was taught in [[Preslav]] (Bulgarian capital between 893 and 972), and in [[Ohrid]] (Bulgarian capital between 991/997 and 1015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&amp;pg=PA436|title=Toward an Understanding of Europe|publisher=|isbn=9781599429830|last1=Ertl|first1=Alan W|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA50|title=Contested Ethnic Identity|publisher=|isbn=9783034301961|last1=Kostov|first1=Chris|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltRWy32dG7oC&amp;pg=PA533 |title=The Poetics of Slavdom: Part III: Njego|publisher=|isbn=9780820481357|last1=Zlatar|first1=Zdenko|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not represent one regional dialect but a generalized form of early [[South Slavic languages#Eastern group of South Slavic languages|eastern South Slavic]], which cannot be localized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Old Church Slavonic, Horace Lunt&quot;/&gt; The existence of two major literary centres in the Empire led in the period from the 9th to the 11th centuries to the emergence of two [[recension]]s (otherwise called &quot;[[redaction]]s&quot;), termed &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vlasto|1970|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpVOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA174 174]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kn5c5dJmNUC&amp;pg=PA431 |title=Indo-European Language and Culture|publisher=|isbn=9781405188968|last1=Fortson|first1=Benjamin W|date=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers do not differentiate between manuscripts of the two recensions, preferring to group them together in a &quot;Macedo-Bulgarian&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pCBRsfJMv8C&amp;pg=PA188|title=Ancient Indo-European Dialects|publisher=|last1=Birnbaum|first1=Henrik|last2=Puhvel|first2=Jaan|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply &quot;Bulgarian&quot; recension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/is_ran/is_ran_4.html|title=Razmyshlenija o makedonskom &quot;sreze&quot;... - I. Kaliganov|website=kroraina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, as [[Horace Lunt]], have changed their opinion with time. In the mid-1970s, Lunt held that the differences in the initial OCS were neither great enough nor consistent enough to grant a distinction between a 'Macedonian' recension and a 'Bulgarian' one. A decade later, however, Lunt argued in favour of such a distinction, illustrating his point with paleographic, phonological and other differences.&lt;ref&gt;See: &quot;American contributions to the Tenth International Congress of Slavists&quot;, Sofia, September 1988, Alexander M. Schenker, Slavica, 1988, {{ISBN|0-89357-190-3}}, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the [[South Slavs]] into neighboring cultures, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylz4fe7757cC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This recension was centred around the [[Preslav Literary School]]. Since the earliest datable [[Cyrillic Script|Cyrillic]] inscriptions were found in the area of [[Preslav]], it is this school which is credited with the development of the Cyrillic alphabet which gradually replaced the Glagolic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curta|2006|p=??}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&amp;pg=PR3-IA34|title=The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire|publisher=|isbn=9780191614880|last1=Hussey|first1=J.

* The Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets were used concurrently.
* In some documents the original supershort vowels ъ and ь merged with one letter taking the place of the other.
* The original ascending reflex (''rь'', ''lь'') of syllabic {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} was sometimes metathesized to ''ьr'', ''ьl''; or a combination of the ordering was used.
* The central vowel ы ''y'' merged with ъи ''ъi''.
* Sometimes the use of letter {{angle bracket|Ѕ}} ({{IPA|/dz/}}) was merged with that of {{angle bracket|З}} ({{IPA|/z/}}).
* The verb forms нарицаѭ, нарицаѥши (''naricajǫ, naricaješi'') were substituted or alternated with наричꙗѭ, наричꙗеши (''naričjajǫ, naričjaješi'').

====Ohrid recension====
The manuscripts of the Ohrid recension or &quot;Western&quot; variant&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stolz|Titunik|Doležel|1984|p=111}}: &quot;Specific phonological and lexical differences led Jagić (and many others after him, notably Vaillant) to distinguish carefully between the Western (or Macedonian) OCS of the glagolitic manuscripts and the Eastern (or Bulgarian) OCS of the Suprasliensis…&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; are among the oldest{{clarify|date=October 2012}} of the Old Church Slavonic language. The recension is sometimes named Macedonian because its literary centre, [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]], lies in the historical [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. At that period, [[Ohrid]] administratively formed part of the province of [[Kutmichevitsa]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|Byzantine conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vlasto|1970|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpVOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 169]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main literary centre of this dialect was the [[Ohrid Literary School]], whose most prominent member and most likely founder, was [[Clement of Ohrid|Saint Clement of Ohrid]] who was commissioned by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavonic language. The language variety that was used in the area started shaping the modern [[Macedonian dialects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Old Church Slavonic, Horace Lunt&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lunt|2001|p=??}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonian, Victor Friedman&quot;&gt;''[http://mahimahi.uchicago.edu/media/faculty/vfriedm/164Friedman01.pdf Macedonian, Victor Friedman], Facts about world's languages, 2001''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} This recension is represented by the [[Codex Zographensis]] and [[Codex Marianus|Marianus]], among others. The main linguistic features of this recension include:

* Continuous usage of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] instead of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]
* A feature called &quot;mixing (confusion) of the nasals&quot; in which {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} became {{IPA|[ɛ̃]}} after {{IPA|/rʲ lʲ nʲ/}}, and in a cluster of a labial consonant and {{IPA|/lʲ/}}. {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} became {{IPA|[ɔ̃]}} after sibilant consonants and {{IPA|/j/}}
* Wide use of the soft consonant clusters {{IPA|/ʃt/}} and {{IPA|/ʒd/}}; in the later stages, these developed into the modern Macedonian phonemes {{IPA|/c/}} {{IPA|/ɟ/}}
* Strict distinction in the articulation of the yers and their vocalisation in strong position (ъ &gt; {{IPA|/o/}} and ь &gt; {{IPA|/e/}}) or deletion in weak position
* Confusion of {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} with yat and yat with {{IPA|/e/}}
* Denasalization in the latter stages: {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} &gt; {{IPA|/a/}}, оу, ъ
* Wider usage and retention of the phoneme {{IPA|/dz/}} (which in most other Slavic languages has dеaffricated to {{IPA|/z/}});

===Later recensions===
{{Main|Church Slavonic}}

Later use of the language in a number of medieval Slavic polities resulted in the adjustment of Old Church Slavonic to the local vernacular, though a number of Southern Slavic, [[Moravia]]n or [[Bulgaria]]n features also survived. Significant later recensions of Old Church Slavonic (referred to as [[Church Slavonic]]) in the present time include: [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. In all cases, denasalization of the [[yus]]es occurred; so that only Old Church Slavonic, modern [[Polish language|Polish]] and some isolated [[Bulgarian dialects]] retained the old Slavonic nasal vowels.

====Serbian recension====
The Serbian recension&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lunt|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was written mostly in Cyrillic, but also in the Glagolitic alphabet (depending on region); by the 12th century the Serbs used exclusively the Cyrillic alphabet (and [[Latin script]] in coastal areas). The 1186 [[Miroslav Gospels]] belong to the Serbian recension. They feature the following linguistic characteristics:

* Nasal vowels were denasalised and in one case closed: *ę &gt; e, *ǫ &gt; u, e.g. OCS rǫka &gt; Sr. ruka (&quot;hand&quot;), OCS językъ &gt; Sr. jezik (&quot;tongue, language&quot;)
* Extensive use of diacritical signs by the [[Manasija|Resava]] dialect
* Use of letters ''i, y'' for the sound {{IPA|/i/}} in other manuscripts of the Serbian recension

Due to the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria in 1396, Serbia saw an influx of educated scribes and clergy who re-introduced a more classical form, closer resembling the Bulgarian recension.
The letter Ꙉ was also created, in place of the sounds *d͡ʑ, *tɕ, *dʑ and d͡ʒ,also used during the Bosnian recession.

====Russian recension====
The Russian recension emerged after the 10th century on the basis of the earlier Bulgarian recension, from which it differed slightly. Its main features are:

* Substitution of {{IPA|[u]}} for the nasal sound {{IPA|/õ/}}  
* Merging of letters ''ę'' and ''ja''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cubberley|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle Bulgarian====
The line between OCS and post-OCS manuscripts is arbitrary, and terminology varies. The common term &quot;Middle Bulgarian&quot; is usually contrasted to &quot;Old Bulgarian&quot; (an alternative name for Old Church Slavonic), and loosely used for manuscripts whose language demonstrates a broad spectrum of regional and temporal dialect features after the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;The definite article in contemporary standard Bulgarian, Gerald L. Mayer, Freie Universität Berlin. Osteuropa-Institut, Otto Harrassowitz, 1988, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bosnian recension====
The Bosnian recension used the [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] alphabet (better known as ''Bosančica'') and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marti|2012|p=[https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/books/9783110288179/9783110288179.269/9783110288179.269.pdf 275]}}: &quot;[T]he first printed book in Cyrillic (or, to be more precise, in ''Bosančica'')…&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=udYWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 | title = Cyrillic books printed before 1701 in British and Irish collections: a union catalogue | first = Ralph | last = Cleminson | publisher = [[British Library]] | year = 2000| isbn = 9780712347099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of letters ''i, y, ě'' for the sound {{IPA|/i/}} in [[Bosnian Cyrillic#Gallery|Bosnian manuscripts]]. The letter [[Щ]] was used in place of the sounds *tɕ *ʃt and *ɕ

====Croatian recension====
The Croatian recension of Old Church Slavonic used only the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] of angular Croatian type. It shows the development of the following characteristics:

* Denasalisation of [[Proto-Slavic|PSl.]] *ę &gt; e, PSl. *ǫ &gt; u, e.g. Cr. ''ruka'' : OCS ''rǫka'' (&quot;hand&quot;), Cr. ''jezik'' : OCS ''językъ'' (&quot;tongue, language&quot;)
* PSl. *y &gt; i, e.g. Cr. ''biti'' : OCS ''byti'' (&quot;to be&quot;)
* PSl. [[Havlík's law|weak-positioned]] [[yers]] *ъ and *ь in merged, probably representing some schwa-like sound, and only one of the letters was used (usually 'ъ'). Evident in earliest documents like [[Baška tablet]].
* PSl. [[Havlík's law|strong-positioned]] [[yers]] *ъ and *ь were vocalized into a in most Štokavian and Čakavian speeches, e.g. Cr. ''pas'' : OCS ''pьsъ'' (&quot;dog&quot;)
* PSl. hard and soft syllabic liquids *r and r′ retained syllabicity and were written as simply r, as opposed to OCS sequences of mostly rь and rъ, e.g. ''krstъ'' and ''trgъ'' as opposed to OCS ''krьstъ'' and ''trъgъ'' (&quot;cross&quot;, &quot;market&quot;)
* PSl. #vьC and #vъC &gt; #uC, e.g. Cr. ''udova'' : OCS. ''vъdova'' (&quot;widow&quot;)

==Canon==
The core corpus of Old Church Slavonic manuscripts is usually referred to as ''canon''. Manuscripts must satisfy certain linguistic, chronological and cultural criteria to be incorporated into the canon: they must not significantly depart from the language and tradition of Saints Cyril and Methodius, usually known as the ''Cyrillo-Methodian tradition''.

For example, the [[Freising Fragments]], dating from the 10th century, show some linguistic and cultural traits of Old Church Slavonic, but they are usually not included in the canon, as some of the phonological features of the writings appear to belong to certain Pannonian Slavic dialect of the period. Similarly, the [[Ostromir Gospels]] exhibits dialectal features that classify it as [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]], rather than South Slavic so it is not included in the canon either. On the other hand, the [[Kiev Missal]] is included in the canon even though it manifests some West Slavic features and contains Western liturgy because of the Bulgarian linguistic layer and connection to the Moravian mission.

Manuscripts are usually classified in two groups, depending on the alphabet used, Cyrillic or Glagolitic. With the exception of the Kiev Missal and Glagolita Clozianus, which exhibit West Slavic and Croatian features respectively, all Glagolitic texts are assumed to be of the Macedonian recension:

* [[Kiev Missal]] (Ki, KM), seven folios, late 10th century
* [[Codex Zographensis]], (Zo), 288 folios, 10th or 11th century
* [[Codex Marianus]] (Mar), 173 folios, early 11th century
* [[Codex Assemanius]] (Ass), 158 folios, early 11th century
* [[Psalterium Sinaiticum]] (Pas, Ps. sin.), 177 folios, 11th century
* [[Euchologium Sinaiticum]] (Eu, Euch), 109 folios, 11th century
* [[Glagolita Clozianus]] (Clo, Cloz), 14 folios, 11th century
* Ohrid Folios (Ohr), 2 folios, 11th century
* Rila Folios (Ri, Ril), 2 folios and 5 fragments, 11th century

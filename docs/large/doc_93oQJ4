[[Washington Metro]] rail service into Washington, D.C. helped breathe life into the region starting in 1978 with the opening of the [[Silver Spring (Washington Metro)|Silver Spring station]]. The Metro [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] was built following the alignment of the [[B&amp;O Metropolitan Branch]], with the Metro tracks centered between the B&amp;O's eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into [[Union Station (WMATA station)|Union Station]].  By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations, [[Forest Glen station|Forest Glen]], [[Wheaton (Washington Metro)|Wheaton]] and [[Glenmont (Washington Metro)|Glenmont]].

Nevertheless, the downtown decline continued in the 1980s, as the [[Hecht Company]] closed in 1987 and opened a new store at Wheaton Plaza; furthermore, Hecht's added a covenant forbidding another department store from renting its old spot. [[City Place Mall|City Place]], a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had trouble attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall, anchored by [[Burlington Coat Factory]] and [[Marshalls]], as well as now-closed anchors [[AMC Theatres]], [[Gold's Gym]], [[Steve and Barry's]], and [[Nordstrom Rack]]. [[JC Penney]] closed its downtown store—downtown's last remaining department store—in 1989, opening several years later at Wheaton Plaza. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, developers considered a shopping mall and office project called Silver Triangle, with possible anchor stores [[Nordstrom]], [[Macy's]], and JC Penney, but no final agreement was reached. Shortly thereafter, in the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream (similar to the [[Mall of America]]) in downtown Silver Spring, but the revitalization plan fell through before any construction began because the developers were unable to secure funding. However, one bright spot for downtown was that the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) consolidated its headquarters in a series of 4 new high-rise office buildings near the Silver Spring Metro station in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Another notable occurrence in Silver Spring during the 1990s was a [[1996 Maryland train collision|1996 train collision]] on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line. On February 16 of that year, during the Friday-evening [[rush hour]], a [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter train bound for [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Washington Union Station]] collided with the [[Amtrak]] ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|Capitol Limited]]'' train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track in Silver Spring, leaving 11 people dead.

The [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] started studies of improvements to the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;

===21st century===
[[File:Veterans Plaza SS MD.JPG|thumb|Civic Building and Veterans Plaza]]
At the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were completely reconstructed to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called &quot;Downtown Silver Spring.&quot; New shops included national retail chains such as [[Whole Foods Market]], a 20-screen [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Theatres]], [[Men's Wearhouse]], [[Ann Taylor Loft]], [[DSW Shoe Warehouse]], [[Office Depot]], and the now-closed [[Pier 1 Imports, Inc.|Pier 1 Imports]], as well as many restaurants, including [[Panera Bread]], [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]], [[Cold Stone Creamery]], [[Fuddruckers]], [[Potbelly Sandwich Works]], [[Nando's|Nando's Peri-Peri]], and [[Chick-fil-A]]. A Borders book store was a popular spot until it closed when the chain went out of business; it was replaced by [[H&amp;M]]. In addition to these chains, Downtown Silver Spring is home to a wide variety of family-owned restaurants representing its vast ethnic diversity. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a PBS documentary entitled ''Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb'', released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095032/|title=Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb (2002)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=May 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405024653/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095032/|archive-date=April 5, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Discovery Communications]] completed the construction of its headquarters and relocated to downtown Silver Spring from nearby [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]]. However, [[Discovery, Inc.]] announced in 2017 that they would be relocating to New York City. The reason for this move, according to Discovery, was to operate close to their &quot;ad partners on Madison Avenue,&quot; &quot;investors and analysts on Wall Street,&quot; and their &quot;creative and production community,&quot; said their CEO, [[David Zaslav]], in an email to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/09/discovery-communications-is-selling-md-headquarters-and-moving-to-new-york/|title=Discovery Communications is selling Md. headquarters and moving to New York|last=https://www.facebook.com/abhabhattarai|website=The Washington Post|access-date=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018043244/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/01/09/discovery-communications-is-selling-md-headquarters-and-moving-to-new-york/|archive-date=October 18, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as [[AFI Silver]], under the auspices of the [[American Film Institute]]. Development continues with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants. In 2015–16, the long-struggling City Place Mall underwent a complete renovation, had its name changed to Ellsworth Place, and brought in new tenants, including [[TJ Maxx]], [[Ross Dress for Less]] (a re-opening original tenant), [[Michaels]], [[Forever 21]], and [[Dave &amp; Buster's]]. The restoration of the old [[Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station|B&amp;O Passenger Station]] was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film ''[[Next Stop: Silver Spring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silverspringtrain.blogspot.com/ |title=Next Stop: Silver Spring |publisher=Silverspringtrain.blogspot.com |date=September 3, 1964 |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827073035/http://silverspringtrain.blogspot.com/ |archivedate=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rKVuyz4Nw |title= Next Stop: Silver Spring – Trailer |date= November 15, 2007 |accessdate= July 17, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130619114510/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rKVuyz4Nw |archive-date= June 19, 2013 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Downtown Silver Spring was awarded the silver medal of the [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruner Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite work|last1=Shibley|first1=Robert|last2=Axelrod|first2=Emily|last3=Farbstein|first3=Jay|last4=Wener|first4=Richard|title=Downtown Silver Spring and Discovery Communications world headquarters.

Beginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the &quot;silver sprung&quot; advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had &quot;sprung&quot; and was ready for business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2004/06/silversprung.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823100637/http://www.takoma.com/archives/copy/2004/06/silversprung.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 23, 2004 |title=Takoma Voice: News |publisher=Takoma.com |accessdate=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that downtown was &quot;enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene L. Meyer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/realestate/commercial/13silver.html &quot;A Dose of Art and Entertainment Revives a Suburb&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920142404/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/realestate/commercial/13silver.html |date=September 20, 2017 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Cos., a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Fisher, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062002354.html &quot;Public or Private Space?

In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, &quot;Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruben Castaneda]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001639.html &quot;County Opinion Rejects Photo Limits&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202205853/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073001639.html |date=December 2, 2016 }}, ''The Washington Post'', July 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.

In 2008, construction of the long-planned [[Intercounty Connector]] (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring, got under way. The highway's first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012.

In July 2010, the [[Silver Spring Civic Building]] and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring.

In May 2019, The Peterson Companies, owners of the Downtown Silver Spring development, announced a $10 Million renovation of the area that will include public art and a new outdoor plaza, featuring green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diegel |first1=Mike |title=Downtown Silver Spring to Get $10 Million Renovation, New Tenants |url=https://www.sourceofthespring.com/silver-spring/downtown-silver-spring-10-million-renovation-new-tenants/ |website=Source of the Spring |accessdate=19 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:American Film Institute Silver Theater.jpg|thumb|left|American Film Institute Silver Theater]]
Downtown Silver Spring hosts several entertainment, musical, and ethnic festivals, the most notable of which are the [[Silverdocs]] documentary film festival held each June and hosted by [[Discovery Communications]] and the [[American Film Institute]], as well as the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade (Saturday before Thanksgiving) for [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]]. The Silver Spring [[Jazz]] Festival has become the biggest event of the year drawing 20,000 people to the free festival held on the second Saturday in September.  Featuring local jazz artists and a battle of high school bands, the Silver Spring Jazz Festival has featured such jazz greats as [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Arturo Sandoval]], [[Sérgio Mendes]], [[Aaron Neville]] and such bands as the [[Mingus Big Band]] and the [[Fred Wesley]] Group.

[[The Fillmore Silver Spring|The Fillmore]] is a live entertainment and music venue with a capacity of 2,000 people. It opened in 2011 in the former JC Penney building on Colesville Road. The venue joins the [[American Film Institute]] and [[Discovery Communications]] as cornerstones of the downtown Silver Spring's arts and entertainment district. It has featured performances by artists [[Prince Royce]], [[Minus the Bear]], [[Tyga]], [[Wale (rapper)]], [[Schoolboy Q]], [[Migos]], and many other hip hop acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jambase.com/venue/the-fillmore-silver-spring/past-shows |website=JamBase |title=The Filmore Silver Spring |publisher=JamBase |accessdate=5 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 R&amp;B singer [[Reesa Renee]] launched her album ''Reelease'' at the Fillmore.

Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the Cultural Arts Center, Montgomery College. The Cultural Arts Center offers a varied set of cultural performances, lectures, films, and conferences. It is a resource for improving cultural literacy, encouraging cross-cultural understanding, and to build bridges between the arts, cultural studies, and all disciplines concerned with the expression of culture.

Dining in Silver Spring is also extremely varied, including [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[African cuisine|African]], [[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]], [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopian]], [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], [[Salvadoran cuisine|Salvadoran]], [[Jamaican cuisine|Jamaican]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Persian cuisine|Persian]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], Greek, and [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] restaurants, as well as many national and regional chains.

Silver Spring has many churches, synagogues, temples, and other religious institutions, including the World Headquarters of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Silver Spring serves as the primary urban area in Montgomery County and its revitalization has ushered in an eclectic mix of people and ideas, evident in the fact that the flagship high school ([[Montgomery Blair High School]]) has no majority group with each major racial and ethnic group claiming a significant percentage.

Silver Spring hosts the [[American Film Institute]] [[AFI Silver|Silver Theatre and Culture Center]], on Colesville Road. The theatre showcases American and foreign films. [[Gandhi Brigade]], a youth development media project, began in Silver Spring out of the Long Branch neighborhood. [[Docs in Progress]], a non-profit media arts center devoted to the promotion of documentary filmmaking is located at the &quot;Documentary House&quot; in downtown Silver Spring.  Silver Spring Stage, an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately {{convert|3|mi|km}} north up Colesville Road from the downtown area.  Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), an agency of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] that includes the [[National Weather Service]]; the [[American Nurses Association]]; and numerous real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies.

[[Stevie Nicks]], of the band [[Fleetwood Mac]] has credited Silver Spring, Maryland as the inspiration for the title of the band's 1977 song &quot;[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]&quot;. In a 1998 interview, Nicks said &quot;I wrote Silver Springs uh, about [[Lindsey_Buckingham|Lindsey [Buckingham]]]. And I ~ we were in Maryland somewhere driving under a freeway sign that said Silver Spring, Maryland. And I loved the name. ...Silver Springs sounded like a pretty fabulous place to me. And uh, 'You could be my silver springs...' that's just a whole symbolic thing of what you could have been to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/silver.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623050203/http://www.inherownwords.com/silver.htm |archive-date=June 23, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver Spring is serviced by the Brunswick Line of the [[MARC Train]], [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Metrorail Red Line]], [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]], [[Ride On (bus)|Ride On]], and the free VanGo. The bus terminal at the [[Silver Spring (Washington Metro)|Silver Spring Rail Station]] is the busiest in the entire Washington Metro Area, and provides connections between several transit services, including those mentioned above. This transit facility serves nearly 60,000 passengers daily.

Construction commenced in October 2008 on the new $91&amp;nbsp;million Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center, which will further expand the station to facilitate the growing demand for public transportation, due to the increase in population in the Silver Spring area.

==Legacy==
On 11 November 1985 Aldington was among 16 Great War poets commemorated in stone at [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poet's Corner]]. The inscription on the stone is a quotation from the work of a fellow Great War poet, [[Wilfred Owen]]. It reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/poets-of-the-first-world-war Westminster Abbey commemoration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and bitterness==
[[Alec Waugh]] described Aldington as having been embittered by the war, but took it that he worked off his spleen in novels like ''The Colonel's Daughter'' (1931) rather than letting it poison his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Waugh]], ''The Early Years'' (1962), p. 182 and p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush describes his work as &quot;a career of disillusioned bitterness.&quot;&lt;ref Name=PF/&gt; His novels contained thinly veiled portraits of some of his friends, including Eliot, Lawrence and Pound; the friendship not always surviving. [[Lyndall Gordon]] characterises the sketch of Eliot in the memoirs ''Life for Life's Sake'' (1941) as 'snide'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndall Gordon]], ''Eliot's Early Years'' (1977), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he was cutting about [[Yeats]], but they remained on good terms.

Aldington's obituary in ''The Times'' in 1962 described him as &quot;an [[Angry young men|angry young man]] of the generation before they became fashionable&quot;, and who &quot;remained something of an angry old man to the end&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter, ''Imagist Poetry'', Penguin Books, London 1972 {{ISBN|0-14-042147-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brighton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən}}) is a constituent part of the [[List of cities in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Brighton and Hove]], a former town situated on the southern coast of [[England]], in the county of [[East Sussex]]. It is best known as a [[seaside resort]] and is positioned {{convert|47|mi}} south of [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;OS Explorer map 122: Brighton and Hove. Scale: 1:25 000. Publisher:Ordnance Survey – Southampton B2 edition. Publishing Date:2009. {{ISBN|978-0319240816}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created from the neighbouring but formerly separately governed towns of Brighton and [[Hove]].

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman]] and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] periods. The ancient settlement of &quot;Brighthelmstone&quot; was documented in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' (1086). The town's importance grew in the [[Middle Ages]] as the Old Town developed, but it languished in the [[early modern period]], affected by foreign attacks, storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for [[sea bathing]] as a purported cure for illnesses.

In the [[Georgian era]], Brighton developed as a highly fashionable seaside resort, encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent, later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]], who spent much time in the town and constructed the [[Royal Pavilion]] in the [[Regency era]]. Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841, becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London. Many of the major attractions were built in the [[Victorian era]], including the [[Grand Brighton Hotel|Grand Hotel]], the [[Hilton Brighton Metropole]], the [[Brighton Palace Pier|Palace Pier]] and the [[West Pier]]. The town continued to grow into the 20th century, expanding to incorporate more areas into the town's boundaries before joining Hove to form the [[unitary authority]] of Brighton and Hove in 1997, which was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/press-release/city-deal-beginning-a-great-city-region|title=City Deal; The beginning of a great city region|publisher=Brighton and Hove City Council|access-date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Brighton and Hove district has a resident population of about {{English district population|GSS=E06000043}} and the wider [[Brighton and Hove built-up area|Brighton and Hove conurbation]] has a population of 474,485 (2011 census).{{NoteTag|For statistical purposes, Brighton and Hove are grouped together.

Brighton's location has made it a popular destination for tourists, renowned for its diverse communities, quirky shopping areas, large and vibrant cultural, music and arts scene and [[LGBT community of Brighton and Hove|its large LGBT population]], leading to its recognition as the &quot;unofficial gay capital of the UK&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/25/sorry-bristol-brighton-is-probably-the-best-city-in-the-uk-4677619/ |title=Sorry Bristol, Brighton is probably the best city in the UK – Metro News |website=Metro|access-date=10 August 2015|date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brighton attracted 7.5&amp;nbsp;million day visitors in 2015/16 and 4.9&amp;nbsp;million overnight visitors,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-37619384 &quot;Drop in Day Visitors to Brighton and Hove&quot;] (Research commissioned by the city council showed a 9% fall in 2015 from 10m the year before, and a 6.4% drop in related expenditure to £318m.)

==Etymology==
The earliest attestation of Brighton's name is ''Bristelmestune'', recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''. Although more than 40 variations have been documented, ''Brighthelmstone'' (or ''Brighthelmston'') was the standard rendering between the 14th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56961&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol7/pp244-263 |title = A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7 – The Rape of Lewes.

&quot;Brighton&quot; was originally an informal shortened form, first seen in 1660; it gradually supplanted the longer name and was in general use from the late 18th century, although ''Brighthelmstone'' remained the town's official name until 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB44&quot;/&gt; The name is of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] origin. Most scholars believe that it derives from ''Beorthelm'' + ''tūn''—the [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] of [[Beorhthelm (disambiguation)|Beorthelm]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, a common Old English name associated with villages elsewhere in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB44&quot;/&gt; The ''tūn'' element is common in Sussex, especially on the coast, although it occurs infrequently in combination with a personal name.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistAtlas32–33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|Short|1999|pp=32–33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative etymology taken from the Old English words for &quot;stony valley&quot; is sometimes given but has less acceptance.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB44&quot;/&gt;  ''Brighthelm'' gives its name to, among other things, a church,&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB39&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pub in Brighton,&lt;ref name=&quot;JDW-Brighthelm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-bright-helm |title=The Bright Helm |year=2009–2013 |publisher=[[J D Wetherspoon]] plc |access-date=23 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105810/http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-bright-helm |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; some halls of residence at the [[University of Sussex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UniSx-Brighthelm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/residences/oncampus/brighthelm |title=Brighthelm |publisher=[[University of Sussex]] |year=2013 |access-date=23 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112400/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/residences/oncampus/brighthelm |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1950, historian Antony Dale noted that unnamed [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] had suggested an Old English word &quot;brist&quot; or &quot;briz&quot;, meaning &quot;divided&quot;, could have contributed the first part of the historic name Brighthelmstone.

==History==
{{Main|History of Brighton}}

[[File:Queens Road - geograph.org.uk - 212549.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Queens Road, one of the oldest streets in Brighton]]

The first settlement in the Brighton area was [[Whitehawk Camp]], a [[Neolithic]] encampment on [[Whitehawk Hill]] which has been dated to between 3500 BC and 2700 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six [[causewayed enclosure]]s in Sussex.

[[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] [[Celts]] arrived in Britain in the 7th century BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot; /&gt; and an important Brythonic settlement existed at [[Hollingbury Castle]] on Hollingbury Hill.  This Celtic [[Iron Age]] encampment dates from the 3rd or 2nd century BC and is circumscribed by substantial earthwork outer walls with a diameter of {{circa}} {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.

Later, there was a [[Roman villa]] at [[Preston Village, Brighton|Preston Village]], a [[London to Brighton Way|Roman road]] from London ran nearby, and much physical evidence of Roman occupation has been discovered locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot;/&gt; From the 1st century AD, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a number of villas in Brighton and [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] Brythonic Celts formed farming settlements in the area.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Archaeology'', 13 March 2014, {{cite web |url = http://www.archaeology.co.uk/digging/fieldwork/rocky-clump-2.htm |title=Archived Document |access-date=27 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115063755/http://www.archaeology.co.uk/digging/fieldwork/rocky-clump-2.htm |archive-date=15 November 2013  }}. Retrieved 27 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Romans left in the early 4th century AD, the Brighton area returned to the control of the native Celts. [[Anglo-Saxons]] then invaded in the late 5th century AD, and the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Sussex]], founded in 477 AD by [[Ælle of Sussex|king Ælle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASC&quot;&gt;''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (Parker MS) ([https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/657 E-text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Seldon]] identified five phases of development in pre-20th century Brighton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon-Ch2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|loc=Ch. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of ''Bristelmestune'' was founded by these Anglo-Saxon invaders, probably in the early Saxon period.  They were attracted by the easy access for boats, sheltered areas of raised land for building and better conditions compared to the damp, cold and misty [[Weald]] to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musgrave21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] in 1086 it was a fishing and agricultural settlement, a rent of 4,000 [[herring]] was established, and its population was about 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56961&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot;/&gt; By the 14th century there was a [[parish church]], a market and rudimentary law enforcement (the first town constable was elected in 1285).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacked and burnt by French invaders in the early 16th century—the earliest depiction of Brighton, a painting of {{circa}} 1520, shows Admiral [[Prégent de Bidoux|Pregent de Bidoux's]] attack of June 1514—the town recovered strongly based on a thriving [[mackerel]]-fishing industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon33&quot;/&gt; The grid of streets in the Old Town (the present [[The Lanes|Lanes]] area) were well developed and the town grew quickly: the population rose from {{circa}} 1,500 in 1600 to {{circa}} 4,000 in the 1640s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot;/&gt;  By that time Brighton was Sussex's most populous and important town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having lost the [[Battle of Worcester]], King Charles II, after hiding for 42 days in various places, fled on the evening of 15 October 1651 in the &quot;Surprise&quot; from Brighthelmstone to his exile in Fécamp, France.

Over the next few decades, though, events severely affected its local and national standing, such that by 1730 &quot;it was a forlorn town decidedly down on its luck&quot;.  More foreign attacks, storms (especially the devastating [[Great Storm of 1703]]), a declining fishing industry, and the emergence of nearby [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] as a significant port caused its economy to suffer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon33&quot; /&gt; By 1708 other parishes in Sussex were charged rates to alleviate poverty in Brighton, and [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote that the expected £8,000 cost of providing sea defences was &quot;more than the whole town was worth&quot;.  The population declined to 2,000 in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB17&quot; /&gt;

From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The contemporary fad for [[Water cure (therapy)|drinking and bathing in seawater]] as a purported cure for illnesses was enthusiastically encouraged by [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Dr Richard Russell]] from nearby [[Lewes]]. He sent many patients to &quot;take the cure&quot; in the sea at Brighton, published a popular treatise{{NoteTag|''De Tabe Glandulari, sive, De usu aquæ marinæ in morbis glandularum dissertatio'' (1750); translated into English in 1753 as ''Glandular Diseases, or a Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Affections of the Glands''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite ODNB |url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56302?docPos=4 |title = Oxford DNB article: Russell, Richard |last=Farrant |first=John H. |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/56302 |access-date=13 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} on the subject, and moved to the town soon afterwards (the [[Royal Albion Hotel|Royal Albion]], one of Brighton's early hotels, occupies the site of his house).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were already visiting the town for recreational purposes before Russell became famous, and his actions coincided with other developments which made Brighton more attractive to visitors. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France; road transport to London was improved&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon34–35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|pp=34–35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the main road via [[Crawley]] was [[Toll road|turnpiked]] in 1770;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gwynne98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gwynne|1990|p=98.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spas and indoor baths were opened by other entrepreneurial physicians such as [[Sake Dean Mahomed]] and [[Anthony Relhan]] (who also wrote the town's first guidebook).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldon34–35&quot; /&gt;

From 1780, development of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian terraces]] had started, and the fishing village developed as the fashionable [[resort]] of Brighton. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]) after his first visit in 1783.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB71&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the [[Royal Pavilion]] during the early part of his [[Regency era|Regency]]. In this period the modern form of the name Brighton came into common use.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlaceNames&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mawer|Stenton|Gover|1930|p=291.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Preston Barracks]] in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__6198.aspx |title=Preston Barracks, Lewes Road|publisher=My Brighton &amp; Hove|access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt in 1830.

The population increased rapidly in the 19th century. In 1801 it was 7,339 and by 1811 had reached 12,012. It was 24,429 in 1821 and by 1831 had reached 40,634. In 1841 it was 46,661.&lt;ref&gt;The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III, (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.&amp;nbsp;809.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brighton aquarium photochrom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Photochrom]] of Brighton aquarium, 1890–1900]]

The arrival of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB127&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 127.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the major attractions were built during the [[Victorian era]], such as the [[Grand Brighton Hotel|Grand Hotel]] (1864), the [[West Pier]] (1866), and the [[Brighton Palace Pier|Palace Pier]] (1899). Prior to either of these structures, the famous Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown. It lasted from 1823 to 1896, and is featured in paintings by both [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[John Constable|Constable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 34.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of boundary changes, the land area of Brighton expanded from &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;1,640&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in 1854 to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;14,347&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(58&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carder|1990|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; New housing estates were established in the acquired areas, including [[Moulsecoomb]], [[Bevendean]], [[Coldean]] and [[Whitehawk]]. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of [[Patcham]], [[Ovingdean]] and [[Rottingdean]], and much council housing was built in parts of [[Woodingdean]] after the Second World War. By the 1970s, the town had acquired a reputation as a retirement destination, with an elderly population.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRH51&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brighton Borough Council|1985|p=51.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was reversed in the 1990s, as [[gentrification]] saw Brighton regain the fashionable status it held in the 18th and 19th centuries, due in no small part to a burgeoning [[LGBT]] population.

In 1997, the town of Brighton and its neighbouring town Hove were joined to form the [[unitary authority]] of [[Brighton and Hove]], which was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as part of the [[millennium]] celebrations in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=73.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the Freedom of Information data there are 4,095 people sleeping rough or in emergency or temporary accommodation in the city, suggesting that one in 69 people in Brighton and Hove was homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14939514.One_in_69_people_in_Brighton_and_Hove_is_homeless|work=The Argus |title=One in 69 people in Brighton and Hove is homeless|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a charity report issued in November 2016, three areas in Brighton &amp; Hove, East Brighton, Queen's Park, and Moulsecoomb &amp; Bevendean ranked in the top ten per cent nationally for deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/politics/levels-of-deprivation-across-sussex-revealed-by-charity-report-1-7672973|work=[[Hastings &amp; St. Leonards Observer]]|title=Levels of deprivation across Sussex revealed by charity report|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although deprivation in Brighton is distributed across the city, it is more concentrated in some areas. The highest concentration is in the Whitehawk, Moulsecoomb, and Hollingbury areas but is also found around the St. James's Street and Eastern Road areas.&lt;ref&gt;Residents slam 'sickening' spread of drugs in Kemp Town (report 28 June 2019) Argus newspaper: https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17736227.residents-slam-sickening-spread-of-drugs-in-kemp-town/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhconnected.org.uk/sites/bhconnected/files/BHC%20(16)%2002%20Briefing%20pack.pdf|title=Conference Survey Statistics|publisher=Brighton and Hove Connected|date=26 April 2016|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 government statistic showed that the area around Brighton's Palace Pier roundabout and to the east towards St James's Street in [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] is the seventh-worst ‘living environment’ in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/13805645.display |work=The Argus|title=New study shows Brighton and Hove has some of the most deprived areas in the country|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 2017, Brighton council announced they were looking at certain initiatives to try to alleviate some of the increasing homelessness seen on Brighton's streets and were hoping to open the first in-house temporary housing for homeless people in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2017/01/19/council-to-open-first-in-house-temporary-housing-for-homeless-people|website=Brighton and Hove News|title=Council to open first in-house temporary housing for homeless people|date=19 January 2017|access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Brighton lies between the [[South Downs]] and the [[English Channel]] to the north and south, respectively. The Sussex coast forms a wide, shallow bay between the [[headland]]s of [[Selsey Bill]] and [[Beachy Head]]; Brighton developed near the centre of this bay around a [[Winterbourne (stream)|seasonal river]], the Wellesbourne (or Whalesbone), which flowed from the South Downs above [[Patcham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56961&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncB15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§. 15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emptied into the English Channel at the beach near the East Cliff, forming &quot;the natural drainage point for Brighton&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB246&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=246.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the estuary was a stagnant pond called the Pool or Poole, so named since the medieval era.{{NoteTag|The name was documented as ''Poole'' in 1296 and 1497.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB246&quot;/&gt;}}  This was built over with houses and shops from 1793, when the Wellesbourne was [[culvert]]ed to prevent flooding,&lt;ref name=&quot;NEB246&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BTBP95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dale|1976|p=95.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only the name of the road (Pool Valley, originally Pool Lane)&lt;ref name=&quot;BTBP8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dale|1976|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; marks its site. [[9 Pool Valley, Brighton|One original house]] survives from the time of the pool's enclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCH56961&quot;/&gt; Behind Pool Valley is [[Old Steine]] (historically ''The Steyne''), originally a flat and marshy area where fishermen dried their nets. The Wellesbourne occasionally reappears during times of prolonged heavy rain; author [[Mark Antony Lower]] referred to an early 19th-century drawing of the [[Royal Pavilion]] showing &quot;quite a pool of water across the Steyne&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lower248&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lower|1864|p=248.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

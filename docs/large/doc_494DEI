==Motorsport==
Pirelli is the only allowed tyre brand in the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] [[World Superbike Championship]] since 2007 (along with its support classes, such as the [[Supersport World Championship]]).
Pirelli has also been awarded the contract for the control tyre supply in the [[British Superbike Championship]] from 2008 until at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishsuperbike.com/html/newsarticle.php?id=1203 British Superbikes 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320074840/http://www.britishsuperbike.com/html/newsarticle.php?id=1203 |date=20 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pirelli were also the official tyre partner of the [[World Rally Championship]] from [[2008 World Rally Championship season|2008]] to [[2010 World Rally Championship season|2010]], until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula 1 commitments. Pirelli returned to the championship in [[2014 World Rally Championship season|2014]], however they only partnering tyres for a few private teams as [[Michelin]] is the major tyre partner. Pirelli was also partnered [[Grand-Am]] [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] from 2008 until 2010 before being replaced by [[Continental AG]] in 2011. The company is the official supplier of the [[GT World Challenge America]] since 2011 and the [[GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup]] since 2013. Pirelli is also a sponsor of rally and gymkhana driver [[Ken Block]]'s [[Hoonigan Racing Division]] since 2010.

Pirelli is the sole global tyre partner in [[Formula One]], following [[Bridgestone]]'s decision to withdraw from the role at the end of {{F1|2010}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Bridgestone to Cease Tire Supply to the FIA Formula One World Championship | url = http://bridgestone.com/corporate/news/2009110201.html | publisher = [[Bridgestone]] | date = 2 November 2009 | access-date = 2 November 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091104223536/http://bridgestone.com/corporate/news/2009110201.html | archive-date = 4 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WMSC230610&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=World Motor Sport Council: 23 June 2010|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_230610.aspx|work=fia.com|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=23 June 2010|access-date=23 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626103652/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_230610.aspx|archive-date=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pirelli return to F1 after 20-year absence|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/06/23/pirelli-return-to-f1-after-20-year-absence/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=23 June 2010|access-date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirelli previously competed in Formula One from {{F1|1950}}–{{F1|1958}}, {{F1|1981}}–{{F1|1986}} and {{F1|1989}}–{{F1|1991}}. Pirelli has also partnering tyres for all [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] and [[GP3 Series]] later [[FIA Formula 3 Championship]] cars since 2011 and 2010 respectively.

The tyre manufacturer introduced a colour coding to recognize tyre compounds used by drivers during the racing weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2011/03/18/pirelli-confirms-colours-tyres/|title=Pirelli confirms six different colours for tyres · F1 Fanatic|date=2011-03-18|website=F1 Fanatic|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the benefit of the spectators at the track and the television audiences each compound has its own colour coding on the Pirelli and P Zero logos which appear on the sidewalls of the tyre. For the 2019 season, Pirelli reverted to using 3 colours to identify the dry weather tyres. However there still were 5 different compounds meaning that the same compound tyre can be represented by different colours throughout the season.

Pirelli were asked to design tyres that degraded rapidly in order to promote more pit stops and closer racing. At the end of the 2011 season, many F1 drivers praised Pirelli's comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/271986/drivers-praise-pirelli-s-comeback-season/|title=Drivers praise Pirelli's comeback season|website=GPUpdate.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131751/https://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/271986/drivers-praise-pirelli-s-comeback-season/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy surrounded Pirelli's [[Formula 1 tyres]] as at the 2013 British Grand Prix seven Pirelli tyres failed: Pérez twice, Alonso, Hamilton, Gutierrez, Vergne, and Massa. Following a safety car period drivers were instructed to stay off the curbs that were later found to be &quot;razor sharp&quot; and may have been the cause, but the president of the British Racing Drivers' Club rejected the idea that the curbs could be at fault, saying that &quot;These curbs have been in since 2009 and we have had thousands and thousands of cars go over these curbs and they have been absolutely fine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23132957|title=BBC Sport – F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone dismisses talk of boycott|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents were described as &quot;unacceptable&quot; by F1 drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23118249|title=BBC Sport – British GP: Lewis Hamilton says Pirelli tyre failures dangerous|author1=Lawrence Barretto  |author2=Andrew Benson |name-list-style=amp |work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later suggested that the cause of the tyre failures could be the teams putting them on the wrong sides of the car. Pirelli then stressed that since the tyres are of asymmetrical construction, as such they are not interchangeable, and if they had been used correctly, they would not have posed a threat to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pirelli.com/tyre/ww/en/news/2013/07/02/pirelli-explanation-on-silverstone-facts-and-next-races/|title=Pirelli, explanation on Silverstone' facts and next races|work=pirelli.com|access-date=21 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711071722/http://www.pirelli.com/tyre/ww/en/news/2013/07/02/pirelli-explanation-on-silverstone-facts-and-next-races/|archive-date=11 July 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Pirelli has since changed the construction of the tyres to prevent further incidents, switching to kevlar belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2013/07/02/pirelli-to-use-prototype-tyres-for-german-grand-prix/|title=Kevlar belt tyres for Germany, new tyres for Hungary · F1 Fanatic|date=2013-07-02|website=F1 Fanatic|access-date=2017-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924140430/http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2013/07/02/pirelli-to-use-prototype-tyres-for-german-grand-prix/|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second practice of the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix, two tyres failed: Vettel and Alonso. One senior figure at Pirelli described the failures as a &quot;big concern&quot;, whilst Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery admitted the tyre failures were &quot;a worry for the sport&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/23816972|title=BBC Sport – Belgian GP: Drivers demand reassurance Pirelli tyres are safe|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these issues, just one day later [[Michelin]] announced that they would replace Pirelli as the tyre supplier for 2014. In October 2013 [[Fernando Alonso]] complained that &quot;the quality of the tyres is very on the limit&quot;, and that they &quot;will not do 5km&quot;. Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery said: &quot;Of course Alonso is one of the great F1 drivers, so to hear such comments is disappointing and below the standards you would expect from such a champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24409735|title=BBC Sport – Fernando Alonso criticises Pirelli tyres after Korean GP qualifying|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Korean Grand Prix Pérez locked a front tyre heavily and then suffered a dramatic failure on the subsequent long straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24420547|title=BBC Sport – Korean GP: perfection from Vettel, less so from the tyres|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirelli also hit controversy at the Indian Grand Prix where they requested the teams run the tyres a limited number of laps due to their fragility. One senior engineer at a top said this was the worst tyre blistering ever experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24690717|title=BBC Sport – Indian GP: Pirelli wants limited tyre running on safety grounds|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-season testing for the 2014 season the tyre on Rosberg's car failed, sending Rosberg into a {{convert|200|mph|0|abbr=on}} spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/25449812|title=BBC Sport – Nico Rosberg suffers tyre failure in Bahrain Pirelli test|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted considerable alarm, and Pirelli stated that the tyre &quot;will not be proposed again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/12472/9080138/pirelli-tyre-which-failed-on-rosbergs-car-was-prototype-that-wont-be-used-again |title=Pirelli: 'Prototype tyre which failed on Nico Rosberg's car won't be used again' | work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Pirelli signed a contract with the FIA to supply tyres to Formula One for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/112150 |title=Pirelli concludes new Formula 1 tyre supply deal| work=Autosport | date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2014 [[Lewis Hamilton]] described the Pirelli wet weather tyres as &quot;They're not great tyres. That's no secret&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/29634110|title=BBC Sport – Lewis Hamilton &amp; Sebastian Vettel call for better wet-weather tyres|author=Andrew Benson|work=BBC Sport|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery reply was that &quot;These are comments by drivers that have not been made in an official way to us. Consequently, if Pirelli was requested by the teams and the FIA to reconsider the technical capability of the wet tyre, Pirelli would do it immediately&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

At the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, during practice, Rosberg suffered a dangerous tyre delamination at {{convert|200|mph|0|abbr=on}}. Rosberg said the incident was &quot;quite a shock&quot;.  During the subsequent drivers' briefing, double world champion Lewis Hamilton raised concerns about tyre safety following the high-speed blow-out suffered by teammate Nico Rosberg. Concerns were also brought up by four-time world champion Vettel, and double world champion Alonso. Pirelli relied on race director, Charlie Whiting, to defend Pirelli's record in the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34021994|title=Nico Rosberg tyre failure: Hamilton and Alonso raise concerns|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the race a tyre on Vettel's car suffered from a blowout at {{convert|200|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The four time world champion described the failure an &quot;unacceptable&quot;, and added that Pirelli's tendency to blame failures either on debris on track or a driver going over a curb for tyre failures was incorrect, confirming that &quot;I didn't go off the track and out of the blue the tyre explodes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34035036|title=Sebastian Vettel says Pirelli tyre failure unacceptable|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the race Rosberg was critical of the poor quality of Pirelli tyres, saying &quot;Vettel exploding his tyre is really poor. It shouldn't happen and the fact that it keeps on happening, in other categories as well as today with us, both of us were just so lucky&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/24182/9962863/vettel-launches-pirelli-attack|title=Sebastian Vettel &amp; Nico Rosberg round on Pirelli after tyre blowouts|author=James Galloway|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] chairman said: &quot;We need to stop the sudden explosions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34063824|title=Belgian Grand Prix: Drivers demand end of blowouts|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the race Pirelli claimed that excessive wear caused the blowout, blaming Ferrari for running the tyre too long. However, following a more detailed analysis Pirelli said that in fact wear was not to blame, but instead a cut had caused the tyre failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120596|title=Pirelli reveals F1 tyre investigation findings from Belgian GP|author=Ian Parkes|date=3 September 2015|work=AUTOSPORT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counteract further problems at the next Grand Prix, Monza, Pirelli wanted to insist that teams run the tyres at high pressure, beyond their design parameters. However, double world champion Lewis Hamilton described these rules as a &quot;disaster&quot; and when double world champion Fernando Alonso also described them as &quot;strange&quot;  Pirelli was forced to backtrack on their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34141910|title=Pirelli relaxes tyre limits after Lewis Hamilton &amp; Alonso complaints|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, after such comments, Pirelli attempted to censor the drivers by asking them to not criticise the tyres in public in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34155703|title=Italian GP: Drivers told to keep worries over Pirelli tyres private|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation did not improve at the next Grand Prix at Monza. Here, Pirelli reported a higher than expected number of cuts forming in the tyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/120670|title=Italian GP: Pirelli reports high number of F1 tyre cuts at Monza|author1=Dieter Rencken  |author2=Lawrence Barretto |name-list-style=amp |date=6 September 2015|work=AUTOSPORT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the race, one of Hamilton's tyres dropped below the regulation pressure dictated by Pirelli, despite the tyre having been prepared by a Pirelli technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/formula1/32543096|title=Lewis Hamilton wins in Italy – reaction – BBC Sport|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Mercedes nor Hamilton were punished for the infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/34168014|title=Lewis Hamilton keeps Italian GP win after stewards' investigation|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016, the necessity to run Pirelli tyres at high pressure was described as a &quot;joke&quot; by triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, world champion Jenson Button, as well as world championship runner-up Felipe Massa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2016/09/pirelli-starting-to-lower-minimum-f1-tyre-pressures-airs-concerns-over-2017-testing/&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of changes to the [[Formula One|Formula 1]] tyres were introduced for the 2017 season. The most obvious visual difference was an increase of width by 25%, both front and rear, increasing from 245 to 305mm at the front and 325 to 405mm at the rear. The actual rim size remained unchanged from the traditional 13 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/125375|title=Formula 1 2017 tyre rules: The key questions and Pirelli's plans|last=Parkes|first=Ian|work=Autosport.com|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721191811/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/125375|archive-date=21 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is part of a package of measures expected to cut lap times by around five seconds relative to 2015: although the improvement might be even bigger.

Most of that extra speed has been found through corners, as the cars have got wider and will generate at least 20% more downforce compared to last year thanks to bigger wings and increased aerodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/38530543|title=2017 season: F1 looks back for its future with faster, wider cars|date=2017-01-09|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These faster cornering speeds—to the extent that some corners have now effectively become straights, already leading to circuit modifications—have imposed significantly increased loads on the tyres, meaning that there is a completely new philosophy behind Pirelli’s 2017 range. Having followed the brief to provide deliberate degradation for the past six seasons, there is now a new directive to make tyres with less degradation that are more resistant to overheating for the latest generation of much faster cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/127693|title=New Formula 1 tyres for 2017 have 'very low degradation'|last=Noble|first=Roberto Chinchero and Jonathan|work=Autosport.com|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113151150/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/127693|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both the tyre structure and their compounds have been updated.

==Overseas investment==
In April 2012, Pirelli &amp; C. SpA signed joint venture agreement with [[Indonesia]]n counterpart PT Astra Autoparts a subsidiary of PT [[Astra International]] for the construction of a motorcycle tyre plant with a total investment of $120 million. 60 percent shares will be held by Pirelli. Pirelli hoped to strengthen its presence in the largest motorcycle market in the world, the [[Southeast Asia]] region which has 250 million motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/25/indonesia-welcomes-pirelli-italian-touch-local-shoes.html |title=Indonesia welcomes Pirelli, Italian touch for local shoes |date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio system==
In July 2018, Pirelli launched a F1 wheel shaped Bluetooth speaker, P Zero Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bruce |first1=Chris |title=Pirelli Design Launches Bluetooth Speaker That Looks Like F1 Wheel |url=https://www.motor1.com/news/258609/pirelli-design-tire-bluetooth-speaker/ |website=Motor1.com |access-date=16 March 2020 |language=en |date=25 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725211919/https://www.motor1.com/news/258609/pirelli-design-tire-bluetooth-speaker/ |archive-date=25 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bluetooth speaker measures 12.9-inches in diameter, weighs 21 pounds and has a 100-watt amplifier, a 100mm midwoofer, a 25mm tweeter and also offers Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX for wireless connectivity.

The wheel shaped speaker costs €2400, which is equivalent to about $2,800.

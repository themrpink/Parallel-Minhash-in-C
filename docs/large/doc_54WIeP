===Pronouns===
[[Pronoun]]s are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include [[personal pronoun]]s, [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronouns]], and some others, mainly [[indefinite pronoun]]s.

====Personal====
{{main|English personal pronouns}}
The personal pronouns of modern standard English, and the corresponding [[possessive]] forms, are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!   !! [[Nominative case|Nominative]] !! [[Objective case|Oblique]] !! [[Reflexive pronoun|Reflexive]] !! [[Possessive determiner]] !! [[Possessive pronoun]]
|-
| 1st pers. sing. || ''I'' || ''me'' || ''myself'' || ''my'' || ''mine''
|-
| 2nd pers. sing./pl. || ''you'' || ''you'' || ''yourself/yourselves'' || ''your'' || ''yours''
|-
| 3rd pers. sing.|| ''she'', ''he'', ''they'', ''it'' || ''her'', ''him'', ''them'', ''it''  || ''herself'', ''himself'', ''themself'', ''itself''  || ''her'', ''his'', ''their'', ''its'' || ''hers'', ''his'', ''theirs'', ''its''
|-
| 1st pers. pl. || ''we'' || ''us'' || ''ourselves'' || ''our'' || ''ours''
|-
| 3rd pers. pl. || ''they'' || ''them'' || ''themselves'' || ''their'' || ''theirs''
|}

The second-person forms such as ''you'' are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, [[y'all]] (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as ''you guys'' are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is ''[[thou]], thee, thyself, thy, thine, ''which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's—in such texts, the  ''you'' set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal [[T–V distinction|V-form]]. ''You'' can also be used as an [[indefinite pronoun]], referring to a person in general (see [[generic you|generic ''you'']]), compared to the more formal alternative, ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (reflexive ''oneself'', possessive ''one's'').

The third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the sex of the referent. For example, ''she'' is used to refer to a female person, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which female characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A male person, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using ''he''. In other cases ''it'' can be used. (See [[Gender in English]].) The word ''it'' can also be used as a [[dummy subject]], in sentences like ''It is going to be sunny this afternoon''.

The third-person plural forms such as ''they'' are sometimes used with singular reference, as a [[gender-neutral pronoun]], as in ''each employee should ensure they tidy their desk''. Despite its long history, this usage is sometimes considered ungrammatical. (See [[Singular they|singular ''they'']].)

The possessive determiners such as ''my'' are used as determiners together with nouns, as in ''my old man'', ''some of his friends''. The second possessive forms like ''mine'' are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in ''mine is bigger than yours'', and as predicates, as in ''this one is mine''. Note also the construction ''a friend of mine'' (meaning &quot;someone who is my friend&quot;). See [[English possessive]] for more details.

====Demonstrative and interrogative====

The [[demonstrative pronoun]]s of English are ''this'' (plural ''these''), and ''that'' (plural ''those''), as in ''these are good, I like that''. Note that all four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in ''those cars''. They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions ''this/that one'', ''these/those ones''.

The [[interrogative pronoun]]s are ''who'', ''what'', and ''which'' (all of them can take the suffix ''[[-ever]]'' for emphasis). The pronoun ''who'' refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form ''[[whom]]'' (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by ''who''), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) ''whose''. The pronoun ''what'' refers to things or abstracts. The word ''which'' is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: ''which (of the books) do you like best?'' (It can also be an interrogative determiner: ''which book?''; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions ''which one'' and ''which ones''.) ''Which'', ''who'', and ''what'' can be either singular or plural, although ''who'' and ''what'' often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see [[Who (pronoun)|''who'']].

All the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns; see below for more details.

====Relative====
{{main|English relative clauses}}
{{for|&quot;who/whom&quot; and related forms|Who (pronoun)}}
The main [[relative pronoun]]s in English are ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' (with its derived forms ''whom'' and ''whose''), ''which'', and ''that''.&lt;ref&gt;Some linguists consider ''that'' in such sentences to be a [[complementizer]] rather than a relative pronoun. See [[English relative clauses#Status of that|English relative clauses: Status of ''that'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative pronoun ''which'' refers to things rather than persons, as in ''the shirt, which used to be red, is faded''. For persons, ''who'' is used (''the man who saw me was tall''). The [[oblique case]] form of ''who'' is ''whom'', as in ''the man whom I saw was tall'', although in informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] ''who'' is commonly used in place of ''whom''.

The possessive form of ''who'' is ''whose'' (''the man whose car is missing ...''); however the use of ''whose'' is not restricted to persons (one can say ''an idea whose time has come'').

The word ''that'' as a relative pronoun is normally found only in [[restrictive relative clause]]s (unlike ''which'' and ''who'', which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say ''the song that'' [or ''which''] ''I listened to yesterday'', but ''the song to which'' [not ''to that''] ''I listened yesterday''. The relative pronoun ''that'' is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel ([[schwa]]), and hence differently from the demonstrative ''that'' (see [[Weak and strong forms in English]]). If ''that'' is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (''the song I listened to yesterday'').

The word ''what'' can be used to form a [[free relative clause]] – one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in ''I like what he likes''. The words ''whatever'' and ''whichever'' can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (''whatever he likes'') or determiners (''whatever book he likes''). When referring to persons, ''who(ever)'' (and ''whom(ever)'') can be used in a similar way (but not as determiners).

===={{Anchor|There as pronoun}}&quot;There&quot;====
The word ''there'' is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a [[dummy subject]], normally of an [[intransitive verb]]. The &quot;logical subject&quot; of the verb then appears as a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] after the verb.

This use of ''there'' occurs most commonly with forms of the verb ''be'' in [[existential clause]]s, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: ''There is a heaven''; ''There are two cups on the table''; ''There have been a lot of problems lately''. It can also be used with other verbs: ''There exist two major variants''; ''There occurred a very strange incident''.

The dummy subject takes the [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] ''there's'' is often used for both singular and plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fowler|2015|p=813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dummy subject can undergo [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], ''Is there a test today?'' and ''Never has there been a man such as this.'' It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and [[question tag]]s: ''There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was.''

The word ''there'' in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an [[adverb]], or as a dummy [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], rather than as a pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;For a treatment of ''there'' as a dummy predicate, based on the analysis of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], see [[Andrea Moro|Moro, A.]], ''The Raising of Predicates. Predicative Noun Phrases and the Theory of Clause Structure'', ''Cambridge Studies in Linguistics'', 80, Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.

Because the word ''there'' can also be a [[Deixis|deictic]] adverb (meaning &quot;at/to that place&quot;), a sentence like ''There is a river'' could have either of two meanings: &quot;a river exists&quot; (with ''there'' as a pronoun), and &quot;a river is in that place&quot; (with ''there'' as an adverb). In the speech, the adverbial ''there'' would be given [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the pronoun would not – in fact, the pronoun is often pronounced as a [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]], {{IPA|/ðə(r)/}}.

====Other====
Other pronouns in English are often identical in form to [[English determiners|determiners]] (especially [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]]), such as ''many'', ''a little'', etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with ''none'' (corresponding to the determiner ''no''), ''nothing'', ''everyone'', ''somebody'', etc. Many examples are listed as [[indefinite pronoun]]s. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is ''[[one (pronoun)|one]]'' (with its reflexive form ''oneself'' and possessive ''one's''), which is a more formal alternative to [[generic you|generic ''you'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/one|title=''One'' Definition|dictionary=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===
{{Main|English verbs}}

The basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as ''-ate'' (''formulate''), ''-fy'' (''electrify''), and ''-ise/ize'' (''realise/realize'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many verbs also contain [[prefix]]es, such ''un-'' (''unmask''), ''out-'' (''outlast''), ''over-'' (''overtake''), and ''under-'' (''undervalue'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301/&gt; Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by [[Conversion (word formation)|zero derivation]], as with the verbs ''snare'', ''nose'', ''dry'', and ''calm''.

Most verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in ''-(e)s'' (''writes'', ''botches''), a [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] form in ''-ing'' (''writing''), a past tense (''wrote''), and – though often identical to the past tense form – a [[past participle]] (''written''). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in ''-ed'', but there are 100 or so [[English irregular verbs|irregular English verbs]] with different forms (see [[List of English irregular verbs|list]]). The verbs ''have'', ''do'' and ''say'' also have irregular third-person present tense forms (''has'', ''does'' {{IPA|/dʌz/}}, ''says'' {{IPA|/sɛz/}}). The verb ''be'' has the largest number of irregular forms (''am, is, are'' in the present tense, ''was, were'' in the past tense, ''been'' for the past participle).

Most of what are often referred to as verb [[grammatical tense|tenses]] (or sometimes [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s) in English are formed using [[auxiliary verb]]s. Apart from what are called the [[simple present (English)|simple present]] (''write'', ''writes'') and [[simple past (English)|simple past]] (''wrote''), there are also [[continuous aspect|continuous]] (progressive) forms (''am/is/are/was/were writing''), [[perfect aspect|perfect]] forms (''have/has/had written'', and the perfect continuous ''have/has/had been writing''), [[future tense|future]] forms (''will write'', ''will be writing'', ''will have written'', ''will have been writing''), and [[conditional tense|conditionals]] (also called &quot;future in the past&quot;) with ''would'' in place of ''will''. The auxiliaries [[shall and will|''shall'' and ''should'']] sometimes replace ''will'' and ''would'' in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see [[English verbs]] and [[English clause syntax]].

The basic form of the verb (''be, write, play'') is used as the [[infinitive]], although there is also a &quot;to-infinitive&quot; (''to be'', ''to write'', ''to play'') used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: ''(to) have written'', ''(to) be writing'', ''(to) have been writing''. The second-person [[imperative mood|imperative]] is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with ''let'' (''let us go'', or ''let's go''; ''let them eat cake'').

A form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present [[subjunctive]] in certain contexts: ''It is important that he '''follow''' them'' or ''... that he '''be''' committed to the cause''. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of ''were'' instead of ''was''), used in some conditional sentences and similar: ''if I were'' (or ''was'') ''rich ...''; ''were he to arrive now ...''; ''I wish she were'' (or ''was'') ''here''. For details see [[English subjunctive]].

The [[passive voice]] is formed using the verb ''be'' (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: ''cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered'', etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with ''by'' (as in ''they were killed by the invaders'').

The [[English modal verbs]] consist of the core modals ''can'', ''could'', ''may'', ''might'', ''must'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''would'', as well as ''ought (to''), ''had better'', and in some uses ''dare'' and ''need''.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not inflect for person or number,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p303/&gt; do not occur alone, and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with ''be/being/been able (to'') for the modals ''can/could''). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (''I can swim, he may be killed'', ''we dare not move'', ''need they go?''), except for ''ought'', which takes ''to'' (''you ought to go''). Modals can indicate the condition, probability, possibility, necessity, obligation and ability exposed by the speaker's or writer's attitude or expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Modal verbs and modality - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/modal-verbs-and-modality|access-date=2020-09-24|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'', along with the modal verbs and the other [[English auxiliary verbs|auxiliaries]], form a distinct class, sometimes called &quot;[[special verbs]]&quot; or simply &quot;auxiliaries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;C.D. Sidhu, ''An Intensive Course in English'', Orient Blackswan, 1976, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; These have different syntax from ordinary [[lexical verb]]s, especially in that they make their [[interrogative]] forms by plain [[subject–auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with the subject, and their [[negation|negative]] forms by adding ''not'' after the verb (''could I ...? I could not ...''). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include ''used to'' (although the forms ''did he use to?'' and ''he didn't use to'' are also found), and sometimes ''have'' even when not an auxiliary (forms like ''have you a sister?'' and ''he hadn't a clue'' are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary ''do'' (''does'', ''did''); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the &quot;special verbs&quot; class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (''do I like you?''; ''he doesn't speak English''; ''we did close the fridge''). For more details of this, see [[do-support|''do''-support]].

Some forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s, as in ''I'm'' for ''I am'', ''you'd'' for ''you would'' or ''you had'', and ''John's'' for ''John is''. Their negated forms with following ''not'' are also often contracted (see {{slink||Negation}} below). For detail see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]].

====Phrases====
A verb together with its dependents, excluding its [[subject (grammar)|subject]], may be identified as a [[verb phrase]] (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar&lt;ref&gt;[[Dependency grammar]]s reject the concept of finite verb phrases as clause constituents, regarding the subject as a dependent of the verb as well. See the [[verb phrase]] article for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;). A verb phrase headed by a [[finite verb]] may also be called a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The dependents may be [[object (grammar)|object]]s, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or [[adverbial phrase]]s). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a [[direct object]] precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an [[indirect object]] as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: ''give me the book'', but ''give the book to me''. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under {{slink||Adverbs}} below). Certain verb–modifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as ''take on'' and ''get up''), are known as &quot;[[phrasal verb]]s&quot;.

For details of possible patterns, see [[English clause syntax]]. See the [[English clause syntax#Non-finite clauses|Non-finite clauses]] section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.


===Adjectives===
English [[adjective]]s, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p308&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as ''-al'' (''habitual''), ''-ful'' (''blissful''), ''-ic'' (''atomic''), ''-ish'' (''impish'', ''youngish''), ''-ous'' (''hazardous''), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: ''disloyal'', ''irredeemable'', ''unforeseen'', ''overtired''.

Adjectives may be used [[attributive adjective|attributively]], as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see [[postpositive adjective]]), as in ''the big house'', or [[predicate adjective|predicatively]], as in ''the house is big''. Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, ''drunken'' is attributive (''a drunken sailor''), while ''drunk'' is usually predicative (''the sailor was drunk'').

====Comparison====
Many adjectives have [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms in ''-er'' and ''-est'',&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p309&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''faster'' and ''fastest'' (from the positive form ''fast''). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of [[English verbs#Past tense|regular past tense formation]]; these cover consonant doubling (as in ''bigger'' and ''biggest'', from ''big'') and the change of ''y'' to ''i'' after consonants (as in ''happier'' and ''happiest'', from ''happy'').

The adjectives ''good'' and ''bad'' have the irregular forms ''better, best'' and ''worse, worst''; also ''far'' becomes ''farther, farthest'' or ''further, furthest''. The adjective ''old'' (for which the regular ''older'' and ''oldest'' are usual) also has the irregular forms ''elder'' and ''eldest'', these generally being restricted to use in comparing [[sibling]]s and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see [[#Adverbs|Adverbs]] below.

Many adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with ''more'' and ''most'', as in ''beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful'' (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).

Certain adjectives are classed as [[ungradable adjective|ungradable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carter-mccarthy-p309&quot;/&gt; These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with ''pregnant'', ''dead'', ''unique''. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as ''very'' and ''fairly'', although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as ''completely''. Another type of adjective sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as ''delicious'' and ''terrified''.

====Phrases====
An [[adjective phrase]] is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its [[head (linguistics)|head]], to which [[modifier (linguistics)|modifier]]s and [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]s may be added.&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p310&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in ''very warm'', ''truly imposing'', ''more than a little excited''. Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in ''fat-free'', ''two-meter-long''.

Complements following the adjective may include:
* [[prepositional phrase]]s: ''proud of him'', ''angry at the screen'', ''keen on breeding toads'';
* [[infinitive]] phrases: ''anxious to solve the problem'', ''easy to pick up'';
* [[content clause]]s, i.e. ''that'' clauses and certain others: ''certain that he was right'', ''unsure where they are'';
* after comparatives, phrases or clauses with ''than'': ''better than you'', ''smaller than I had imagined''.

An adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in ''very difficult to put away''.

Adjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives ''before'' a noun. Sometimes they are used [[postpositive adjective|attributively after the noun]], as in ''a woman proud of being a midwife'' (where they may be converted into relative clauses: ''a woman who is proud of being a midwife''), but it is wrong to say *''a proud of being a midwife woman''. Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as ''easy-to-use''. (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in ''a better man than you'', ''a hard nut to crack''.)

Certain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in ''a two-bedroom house'', ''a no-jeans policy''.

===Adverbs===
[[Adverb]]s perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases).&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases ('''''only''' the boss''; '''''quite''' a lovely place''), pronouns and determiners ('''''almost''' all''), prepositional phrases ('''''halfway''' through the movie''), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude ('''''Frankly''', I don't believe you'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (''He died, and '''consequently''' I inherited the estate'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p313/&gt;

Many English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending ''-ly'', as in ''hopefully'', ''widely'', ''theoretically'' (for details of spelling and etymology, see ''[[-ly]]''). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as ''fast'', ''straight'', and ''hard''; these are [[flat adverb]]s.  In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (''That's just '''plain''' ugly.'')  Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (''The streaker ran '''naked''''', not **''The streaker ran nakedly''.)  The adverb corresponding to the adjective ''good'' is ''well'' (note that ''bad'' forms the regular ''badly'', although ''ill'' is occasionally used in some phrases).

There are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives,&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p311/&gt; including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place,  of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are ''-ward[s]'' (as in ''homeward[s]'') and ''-wise'' (as in ''lengthwise'').

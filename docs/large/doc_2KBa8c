Under Harun al-Rashid, Baghdad was renowned for its bookstores, which proliferated after the making of paper was introduced. Chinese papermakers had been among those taken prisoner by the Arabs at the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751. As prisoners of war, they were dispatched to [[Samarkand]], where they helped set up the first Arab paper mill. In time, paper substituted parchment as the medium for writing, and the production of books greatly increased. These events had an academic and societal impact that could be broadly compared to the introduction of the [[printing press]] in the West. Paper aided in communication and record-keeping, it also brought a new sophistication and complexity to businesses, banking, and the civil service. In 794, Jafa al-Barmak built the first paper mill in Baghdad, and from there the technology circulated. Harun required that paper be employed in government dealings, since something recorded on paper could not easily be changed or removed, and eventually, an entire street in Baghdad's business district was dedicated to selling paper and books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bobrick |first1=Benson |title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad |date=2012 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1416567622 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{Main |Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy}}
{{Further |Logic in Islamic philosophy|Kalam|Avicennism|Averroism|Illuminationist philosophy|Transcendent Theosophy}}
One of the common definitions for &quot;Islamic philosophy&quot; is &quot;the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RoutledgeEoP&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leaman|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoutledgeEoP&quot; /&gt; Their works on [[Aristotle]] were a key step in the transmission of learning from ancient Greeks to the Islamic world and the West. They often corrected the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]]. They also wrote influential original philosophical works, and their thinking was incorporated into [[Christian philosophy]] during the Middle Ages, notably by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-islamic-scholar-who-gave-us-modern-philosophy|title=The Islamic Scholar Who Gave Us Modern Philosophy|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three speculative thinkers, [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]], and [[Avicenna]], combined [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through Islam, and [[Avicennism]] was later established as a result. Other influential Abbasid philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], and [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen).

===Architecture===
[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|[[Zumurrud Khatun Mosque|Zumurrud Khatun Tomb]] (1200 CE), in cemetery at [[Baghdad]]]]
As power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids, the architectural styles changed also. The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the [[Sasanian Empire]], utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco.&lt;ref name=wil&gt;{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire, beginning with the creation of Baghdad in 762, which was planned as a walled city with four gates, and a mosque and palace in the center. Al-Mansur, who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad, also planned the city of [[Raqqa]], along the [[Euphrates]]. Finally, in 836, al-Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the [[Tigris]], called [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This city saw 60 years of work, with race-courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=wil/&gt; Due to the dry remote nature of the environment, some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens. [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] is a fine example of this type of building, which has stables, living quarters, and a mosque, all surrounding inner courtyards.&lt;ref name=wil/&gt; Other mosques of this era, such as the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], in [[Cairo]], and the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]], while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty, were substantially renovated in the 9th century. These renovations, so extensive as to ostensibly be rebuilds, were in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world, in an area that the [[Aghlabids]] controlled; however, the styles utilized were mainly Abbasid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilmer|1969|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesopotamia only has one surviving [[mausoleum]] from this era, in Samarra. This octagonal dome is the final resting place of [[al-Muntasir]].&lt;ref name=wil2&gt;{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other architectural innovations and styles were few, such as the [[four-centred arch|four-centered arch]], and a dome erected on [[squinch]]es. Unfortunately, much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles.&lt;ref name=wil2/&gt;

==== Foundation of Baghdad ====
The Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the epicenter of the empire, [[Baghdad]], in 762 CE, as a means of disassociating his dynasty from that of the preceding [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] (centered at Damascus) and the rebellious cities of Kufa and Basrah. Mesopotamia was an ideal locale for a capital city due to its high agricultural output, access to the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers (allowing for trade and communication across the region), central locale between the corners of the vast empire (stretching from Egypt to [[Afghanistan]]) and access to the Silk Road and Indian Ocean trade routes, all key reasons as to why the region has hosted important capital cities such as [[Ur]], [[Babylon]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Ctesiphon]] and was later desired by the British Empire as an outpost by which to maintain access to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/iraq.htm|title=Iraq Mandate|website=www.britishempire.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was organized in a circular fashion next to the Tigris River, with massive brick walls being constructed in successive rings around the core by a workforce of 100,000 with four huge gates (named Kufa, Basrah, Khorasan and Syria). The central enclosure of the city contained Mansur's palace of {{convert|360000|sqft|m2}} in area and the great mosque of Baghdad, encompassing {{convert|90000|sqft|m2}}. Travel across the Tigris and the network of waterways allowing the drainage of the Euphrates into the Tigris was facilitated by bridges and canals servicing the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Marozzi|first=Justin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/16/story-cities-day-3-baghdad-iraq-world-civilisation|title=Story of cities #3: the birth of Baghdad was a landmark for world civilisation|date=2016-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass and crystal===
The Near East has, since Roman times, been recognized as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th-century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups intended for domestic use, with decorations including molded flutes, honeycomb patterns, and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=dim&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other styles seen that may not have come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or [[Kufic]] inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, has been found in [[Nishapur]], along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:British Museum Harem wall painting fragments 2.jpg|thumb|9th-century [[harem]] wall painting fragments found in [[Samarra]]]]
Early Abbasid painting has not survived in great quantities, and is sometimes harder to differentiate; however, Samarra provides good examples, as it was built by the Abbasids and abandoned 56 years later. The walls of the principal rooms of the palace that have been excavated show wall paintings and lively carved stucco [[Dado (architecture)|dadoes]]. The style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, bearing not only similar styles, with harems, animals, and dancing people, all enclosed in scrollwork, but the garments are also Persian.&lt;ref name=dim2&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969a|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nishapur]] had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show both monochromatic and polychromatic artwork from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous piece of art consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies them as [[Tahirid]], which was, again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four-foot high dedo.&lt;ref name=dim2/&gt;

===Pottery===
[[File:Bowl with Kufic Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bowl with [[Kufic]] Inscription, 9th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Whereas painting and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery was a different story. Islamic culture as a whole, and the Abbasids in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries has been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, and humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from [[Samarra]] exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These predominantly being made for the Caliphs use. Tiles were also made using this same technique to create both monochromatic and polychromatic [[lusterware]] tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textiles===
Egypt being a center of the textile industry was part of Abbasid cultural advancement. [[Copt]]s were employed in the textile industry and produced linens and silks. [[Tinnis]] was famous for its factories and had over 5,000 looms. Examples of textiles were ''kasab'', a fine linen for turbans, and ''badana'' for upper-class garments. The [[kiswah]] for the [[kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] was made in a town named [[Tuna (Egypt)|Tuna]] near Tinnis. Fine silk was also made in [[Dabik]] and [[Damietta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest are stamped and inscribed fabrics, which used not only inks but also liquid gold. Some of the finer pieces were colored in such a manner as to require six separate stamps to achieve the proper design and color. This technology spread to Europe eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|pp=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{Main |Inventions in medieval Islam|Arab Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of Islamic science and technology}}
[[File:Wasseruhr Harun al Raschid.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing a [[water clock]] given to [[Charlemagne]] by [[Harun al-Rashid]]]]
In technology, the Abbasids adopted [[papermaking]] from China.&lt;ref name= Lucas/&gt; The use of paper spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in [[al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) and then the rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than [[parchment]], less likely to crack than [[papyrus]], and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and copies of the Qur'an. &quot;Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cotter|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the Abbasids that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunn|2003|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure [[potassium nitrate]] and an [[explosive]] gunpowder effect were first developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary [[sextant]] (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Abbasid sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large three masted merchant vessels to the [[Mediterranean]]. The name [[caravel]] may derive from an earlier Arab ship known as the ''qārib''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the [[Mediterranean]], along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]] or [[Genoa]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through the Abbasid caliphate between China and Europe.

[[File:Bruges Belgium Windmill-Bonne-Chiere-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Windmills]] were among Abbasid inventions in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFhGW3MxgPMC&amp;q=abbasid+windmill&amp;pg=PA35|title=Syria|last1=Phillips|first1=Douglas A.|last2=Gritzner|first2=Charles F.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438132389|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|left]]

Engineers in the Abbasid caliphate made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]], [[wind power]], and petroleum (notably by distillation into [[kerosene]]). The industrial uses of [[watermill]]s in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-[[Water wheel|wheeled]] and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from [[al-Andalus]] and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating [[crankshaft]]s, employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by [[manual labour]] in [[ancient times]] to be [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of waterpower had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded for the first time in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of industries were generated during the [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]], including early industries for textiles, sugar, rope-making, matting, silk, and paper. [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] passed on knowledge of chemistry and instrument making in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural and [[handicraft]] industries also experienced high levels of growth during this period.&lt;ref name = Labib&gt;{{harvnb|Labib|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
In contrast to the earlier era, women in Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community's central affairs.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=112–115}} While their Muslim forbears led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the [[Hadith]] literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim conquest. Gorgias Press LLC, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] upper classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, Nabia 1946&quot;&gt;Abbott, Nabia. Two queens of Baghdad: mother and wife of Hārūn al Rashīd. University of Chicago Press, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[Nabia Abbott]], preeminent historian of elite women of the Abbasid Caliphate, describes the lives of harem women as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The choicest women were imprisoned behind heavy curtains and locked doors, the strings and keys of which were entrusted into the hands of that pitiable creature – the [[eunuch]]. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott, Nabia 1946&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.

Elite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:

{{poemquote|To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.
At times of disaster and catastrophe
God multiplies rewards for the patient.
To be patient in misery
Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.
Among the blessings of God undoubtedly
Is the preservation of sons
And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}}}

Even so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic [[Rabia Basri|Raabi'a al-Adwiyya]] (714–801 CE), the princess and poet [['Ulayya bint al-Mahdi]] (777–825 CE), and the singing-girls [[Shāriyah]] ({{circa|815}}–870 CE), [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871 CE) and [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (797–890 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Qutbuddin |first=Tahera |editor=Josef W.

=== Treatment of Jews and Christians ===
The status and treatment of Jews, Christians, and non-Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate was a complex and continually changing issue. Non-Muslims were called [[dhimmi]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimmis did not have all of the privileges that Muslims had and commonly had to pay [[jizya]], a tax for not being a Muslim. One of the common aspects of the treatment of the dhimmis is that their treatment depended on who the Caliph was at the time. Some Abbasid rulers, like [[Al-Mutawakkil]] (822–861 CE) imposed strict restrictions on what dhimmis could wear in public, often yellow garments that distinguished them from Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=102–103|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other restrictions al-Mutawakkil imposed included limiting the role of the dhimmis in government, seizing dhimmi housing and making it harder for dhimmis to become educated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Most other Abbasid caliphs were not as strict as al-Mutawakkil, though. During the reign of [[Al-Mansur]] (714–775 CE), it was common for Jews and Christians to influence the overall culture in the [[Caliphate]], specifically in [[Baghdad]]. Jews and Christians did this by participating in scholarly work and Christians even influenced Islamic funeral service traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

It was common that laws that were imposed against dhimmis during one caliph's rule were either discarded or not practiced during future caliphs' reigns. Al-Mansur and al-Mutawakkil both instituted laws that forbade non-Muslims from participating in public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Muslims in the Early Islamic Empire|last=Levy-Rubin|first=Milka|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108449618|location=Cambridge|pages=108–110|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur did not follow his own law very closely, bringing dhimmis back to the Caliphate's treasury due to the needed expertise of dhimmis in the area of finance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirry|first=Mun'im|date=2011|title=The public role of Dhimmīs during ʿAbbāsid times|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=74|issue=2|pages=187–204|jstor=41287947|doi=10.1017/S0041977X11000024|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mutawakkil followed the law banning dhimmis from public office more seriously, although, soon after his reign, many of the laws concerning dhimmis participating in government were completely unobserved or at least less strictly observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Even [[Al-Muqtadir]] ({{r.|908|932|era=CE}}), who held a similar stance as al-Mutawakkil on barring non-Muslims from public office, himself had multiple Christian secretaries, indicating that non-Muslims still had access to many of the most important figures within the Caliphate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Past having a casual association or just being a secretary to high-ranking Islamic officials, many Caliphs like Al-Mansur would personally appoint dhimmis to important positions of power, like collector of revenue.

Jews and Christians may have had a lower overall status compared to Muslims in the Abbasid Caliphate, but dhimmis were often allowed to hold respectable and even prestigious occupations in some cases, such as doctors and public officeholders. Jews and Christians were also allowed to be rich even if they were taxed for being a dhimmi.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Dhimmis were capable of moving up and down the social ladder, though this largely depended on the particular caliph. An indication as to the social standing of Jews and Christians at the time was their ability to live next to Muslim people. While al-Mansur was ruling the Caliphate, for instance, it was not uncommon for dhimmis to live in the same neighborhoods as Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; One of the biggest reasons why dhimmis were allowed to hold prestigious jobs and positions in government is that they were generally important to the well-being of the state and were proficient to excellent with the work at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Muslims, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East|last=Sharkey|first=Heather|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780521186872|location=Cambridge|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims in the Caliphate took offense to the idea that there were dhimmis in public offices who were in a way ruling over them although it was an Islamic state, while other Muslims were at time jealous of some dhimmis for having a level of wealth or prestige greater than other Muslims, even if Muslims were still the majority of the ruling class.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In general, Muslims, Jews, and Christians had close relations that could be considered positive at times, especially for Jews, in contrast to how Jews were being treated in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Many of the laws and restrictions that were imposed on dhimmis often resembled other laws that previous states had used to discriminate against a minority religion, specifically Jewish people. Romans in the fourth century banned Jewish people from holding public offices, banned Roman citizens from converting to Judaism, and often demoted Jews who were serving in the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate|last=Nicholls|first=William|publisher=Haddon Craftsmen|year=1993|isbn=9780876683989|location=Scranton|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In direct contrast, there was an event in which two [[vizier]]s, Ibn al-Furat and [[Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah]], argued about Ibn al-Furat's decision to make a Christian the head of the military. A previous vizier, Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Bazuri, had done so. These laws predated al-Mansur's laws against dhimmis and often had similar restrictions, although Roman emperors were often much more strict on enforcing these laws than many Abbasid caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism Before the Holocaust|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Pearson Educated Limited|year=2000|isbn=9780582369641|location=Harlow|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Baghdad's Jews were incorporated into the Arab community and regarded [[Arabic]] their native language. Some Jews studied Hebrew in their schools and Jewish religious education flourished. The united Muslim empire allowed Jews to reconstruct links between their dispersed communities throughout the Middle East. The city's Talmudic institute helped spread the rabbinical tradition to [[Europe]], and the Jewish community in Baghdad went on to establish ten rabbinical schools and twenty-three synagogues. Baghdad not only contained the tombs of Muslim saints and martyrs, but also the tomb of the Hebrew prophet [[Joshua]], whose corpse had been brought to Iraq during the first migration of the Jews out of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bobrick |first1=Benson |title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad |date=2012 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1416567622 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabization===
While the Abbasids originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized, particularly in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region (namely [[Mesopotamia]] and [[the Levant]]) as had begun under Umayyad rule. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, many people from different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ochsenwald|Fisher|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holidays===
There were large feasts on certain days, as the Muslims of the empire celebrated Christian holidays as well as their own. There were two main Islamic feasts: [[Eid al-Fitr|one marked by the end of Ramadan]]; the other, [[Eid al-Adha|&quot;the Feast of Sacrifice&quot;]]. The former was especially joyful because children would purchase decorations and sweetmeats; people prepared the best food and bought new clothes. At midmorning, the caliph, wearing the Prophet's thobe, would guide officials, accompanied by armed soldiers to the [[Great Mosque of al-Mansur|Great Mosque]], where he led prayers. After the prayer, all those in attendance would exchange the best wishes and hug their kin and companions. The festivities lasted for three days. During those limited number of nights, the palaces were lit up and boats on the [[Tigris]] hung lights. It was said that Baghdad “glittered ‘like a bride.&quot; During [[Eid al-Adha|“the Feast of Sacrifice.”]], sheep were butchered in public arenas and the caliph participated in a large-scale sacrifice in the palace courtyard. Afterward, the meat would be divided and given to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these two holidays, [[Shia]]s celebrated the birthdays of [[Fatimah]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. Matrimonies and births in the royal family were observed by all in the empire. The announcement that one of the caliph’s sons could [[Qira'at|recite the Koran]] smoothly was greeted by communal jubilation. When Harun developed this holy talent, the people lit torches and decorated the streets with wreaths of flowers, and his father, [[Al-Mahdi]], freed 500 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the holidays imported from other cultures and religions, the one most celebrated in Baghdad (a city with many Persians) was [[Nowruz]], which celebrated the arrival of spring. In a ceremonial ablution introduced by Persian troops, residents sprinkled themselves with water and ate almond cakes. The palaces of the imperial family were lit up for six days and nights. The Abbasids also celebrated the Persian holiday of Mihraj, which marked the onset of winter (signified with pounding drums), and Sadar, when homes burned incense and the masses would congregate along the Tigris to witness princes and viziers pass by.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In Baghdad there were many Abbasid military leaders who were or said they were of [[Arabs|Arab]] descent. However, it is clear that most of the ranks were of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, the vast majority being from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]], not from western Iran or Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baghdad-iranian-connection-1-pr-Mongol |title=BAGHDAD i.

The standing army of the Muslims in Khorosan was overwhelmingly Arab. The unit organization of the Abbasids was designed with the goal of ethnic and racial equality among supporters. When Abu Muslim recruited officers along the Silk Road, he registered them based not on their tribal or ethno-national affiliations but on their current places of residence.&lt;ref name=ira62&gt;[[The Cambridge History of Iran]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=umayyad+abbasid+non+muslim+support&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AaqOU-33NoKyyASR1oGoDw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=umayyad%20abbasid%20non%20muslim%20support&amp;f=false p. 62].

He abolished the old ''jund'' system created by Umar and diverted the salaries of the original Arab military descendants to the Turkic slave soldiers. The Turkic soldiers transformed the style of warfare, as they were known as capable horse archers, trained from childhood to ride. This military was now drafted from the ethnic groups of the faraway borderlands, and were completely separate from the rest of society. Some could not speak Arabic properly. This led to the decline of the Caliphate starting with the Anarchy at Samarra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=HUGH KENNEDY |title=THE PROPHET AND THE AGE OF THE CALIPHATES |date=2004 |publisher=Pearson Education Limited |isbn=0-582-40525-4 |pages=156–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Abbasids never retained a substantial regular army, the caliph could recruit a considerable number of soldiers in a short time when needed from levies. There were also cohorts of regular troops who received steady pay and a special forces unit. At any moment, 125,000 Muslim soldiers could be assembled along the Byzantine frontier, [[Baghdad]], [[Medina]], [[Damascus]], [[Rayy]], and other geostrategic locations in order to quell any unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bobrick |first1=Benson |title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad |date=2012 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1416567622 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavalry was entirely covered in iron, with helmets. Similar to medieval knights, their only exposed spots were the end of their noses and small openings in front of their eyes. Their foot soldiers were issued spears, swords, and pikes, and (in line with Persian fashion) trained to stand so solidly that, one contemporary wrote &quot;you would have thought them held fast by clamps of bronze.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bobrick |first1=Benson |title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad |date=2012 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1416567622 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbasid army amassed an array of siege equipment, such as [[catapult]]s, [[mangonel]]s, [[battering ram]]s, ladders, grappling irons, and hooks. All such weaponry was operated by military engineers. However, the primary siege weapon was the manjaniq, a type of siege weapon that was comparable to the [[trebuchet]] employed in Western medieval times. From the seventh century onward, it had largely replaced [[Torsion siege engine|torsion artillery]]. By Harun al-Rashid's time, the Abbasid army employed fire [[grenade]]s. The Abbasids also utilized [[field hospital]]s and ambulances drawn by camels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil Administration==
As a result of such a vast empire, the caliphate was decentralized and divided into 24 provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with Persian tradition, Harun's vizier enjoyed close to unchecked powers. Under Harun, a special &quot;bureau of confiscation&quot; was created. This governmental wing made it possible for the vizier to seize the property and riches of any corrupt governor or civil servant. In addition, it allowed governors to confiscate the estates of lower-ranking officials. Finally, the caliph could impose the same penalty on a vizier who fell from grace. As one later caliph put it: &quot;The vizier is our representative throughout the land and amongst our subjects. Therefore, he who obeys him obeys us; and he who obeys us obeys God, and God shall cause him who obeys Him to enter paradise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every regional metropolis had a post office and hundreds of roads were paved in order to link the imperial capital with other cities and towns. The empire employed a system of relays to deliver mail. The central post office in Baghdad even had a map with directions that noted the distances between each town. The roads were provided with roadside inns, hospices, and wells and could reach eastward through Persia and [[Central Asia]], to as far as [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post office not only enhanced civil services but also served as intelligence for the caliph. Mailmen were employed as spies who kept an eye on local affairs. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the days of the caliphate, the Barmakids took the responsibility of shaping the [[civil service]]. The family had roots in a [[Buddhist]] monastery in northern [[Afghanistan]]. In the early 8th century, the family converted to Islam and began to take on a sizable part of the civil administration for the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital poured into the caliphate's treasury from a variety of taxes, including a real estate tax; a levy on cattle, gold and silver, and commercial wares; a special tax on non-Muslims; and customs dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade==
Under Harun, maritime trade through the [[Persian Gulf]] thrived, with Arab vessels trading as far south as [[Madagascar]] and as far east as [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]. The growing economy of Baghdad and other cities inevitably led to the demand for luxury items and formed a class of entrepreneurs who organized long-range caravans for the trade and then the distribution of their goods. A whole section in the East Baghdad suq was dedicated to Chinese goods. Arabs traded with the [[Baltic region]] and made it as far north as the [[British Isles]]. Tens of thousands of Arab coins have been discovered in parts of [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]], which bear witness to the comprehensive trade networks set up by the Abbasids. [[Offa of Mercia|King Offa of Mercia (in England)]] minted gold coins similar to those of the Abbasids in the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim merchants employed ports in [[Bandar Siraf]], [[Basra]], and [[Aden]] and some [[Red Sea]] ports to travel and trade with [[India]] and [[South East Asia]]. Land routes were also utilized through [[Central Asia]]. Arab businessmen were present in China as early as the eighth century. Arab merchants sailed the Caspian Sea to reach and trade with [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many caravans and goods never made it to their intended destinations. Some Chinese exports perished in fires, while other ships sank. It was said that anybody who made it to China and back unharmed was blessed by God. Common sea routes were also plagued by pirates who built and manned vessels that were faster than most merchant ships. It is said that many of the adventures at sea in the [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad tales]] were based on historical fiction of mariners of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabs also established overland trade with Africa, largely for gold and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]]. When trade with Europe seized due to [[Arab–Byzantine wars|hostilities]], Jews served as a link between the two hostile worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bobrick|2012|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the empire==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}
Abbasids found themselves at odds with the [[Shia]] Muslims, most of whom had supported their war against the Umayyads, since the Abbasids and the Shias claimed legitimacy by their familial connection to Prophet Muhammad; once in power, the Abbasids disavowed any support for Shia beliefs in favor of [[Sunni]] Islam. Shortly thereafter, Berber [[Kharijite]]s set up an independent state in North Africa in 801. Within 50 years the [[Idrisid]]s in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Aghlabid]]s of [[Ifriqiya]] and a little later the [[Tulunid]]s and [[Ikshidid]]s of [[History of Muslim Egypt|Misr]] were effectively independent in Africa. The Abbasid authority began to deteriorate during the reign of [[al-Radi]] when their Turkic Army generals, who already had de facto independence, stopped paying the Caliphate. Even provinces close to Baghdad began to seek local dynastic rule. Also, the Abbasids found themselves to often be at conflict with the Umayyads in Spain. The Abbasid financial position weakened as well, with tax revenues from the [[Sawād]] decreasing in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12137429|title=State, Land Tax and Agriculture in Iraq from the Arab Conquest to the Crisis of the Abbasid Caliphate (Seventh-Tenth Centuries)|first=Campopiano|last=Michele|journal=Studia Islamica|volume=107|issue=1|pages=1–37|access-date=19 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913114643/http://www.academia.edu/12137429/_State_Land_Tax_and_Agriculture_in_Iraq_from_the_Arab_Conquest_to_the_Crisis_of_the_Abbasid_Caliphate_Seventh-Tenth_Centuries_in_Studia_Islamica_3_2012_35-80|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separatist dynasties and their successors==
The Abbasid Caliphate differed from others in that it did not have the same borders and extent as Islam. Particularly, in the west of the Caliphate, there were multiple smaller caliphates that existed in relative peace with them.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} This list represents the succession of Islamic dynasties that emerged from the fractured Abbasid empire by their general geographic location. Dynasties often overlap, where a vassal emir revolted from and later conquered his lord. Gaps appear during periods of contest where the dominating power was unclear. Except for the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in Egypt, recognizing a Shia succession through [[Ali]], and the Andalusian Caliphates of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Umayyads]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], every Muslim dynasty at least acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of the Abbasids as Caliph and Commander of the Faithful.

==Dynasties claiming Abbasid descent==
Centuries after the ''Abbasids'' fall, several dynasties have claimed descent from them, as &quot;claiming kinship relation with the Prophet Muhammad, that is, claiming an affiliation to the 'People of the House' or the status of a sayyid or sharif, has arguably been the most widespread way in Muslim societies of supporting one's moral or material objectives with genealogical credentials.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ecommons.aku.edu&quot;&gt;https://ecommons.aku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=uk_ismc_series_emc&lt;/ref&gt; Such claims of continuity with Muhammad or his Hashemite kin such as the Abbasids foster a sense of &quot;political viability&quot; for a candidate dynasty, with the intention of &quot;serving an internal audience&quot; (or in other words, gaining legitimacy in the view of the masses).&lt;ref name=&quot;ecommons.aku.edu&quot;/&gt; The final ruler of the [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] Indian princely state was particularly so. In Bahawalpur, Pakistan, and the subcontinent, he was an Arab of the Abbasids and a conqueror, a man drawing his wealth from the country but not part of it.
Among the most notable of these dynasties claiming Abbasid descent are the [[Wadai Empire]] which ruled parts of modern-day Sudan, Bahawalpur in Pakistan, and the Khanate of [[Bastak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AglDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Blood and Water: The Indus River Basin in Modern History|last=Gilmartin|first=David|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520285293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nachtigal, G.

A common trope among Abbasid claimant dynasties is that they are descended from Abbasid princes of Baghdad, &quot;dispersed&quot; by the Mongol invasion in 1258 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moMjWocXWYYC&amp;pg=PA156 |title = Islam Related Naipaul|isbn = 9788176256933|last1 = Sarkar|first1 = R. N.|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surviving princes would leave Baghdad for a safe haven not controlled by the Mongols, assimilate to their new societies, and their descendants would grow to establish their own dynasties with their Abbasid 'credentials' centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|Van Donzel|Lewis|Pellat|1983|p=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is highlighted by the origin myth of the Bastak khanate which relates that in 656 AH/1258 CE, the year of the fall of Baghdad, and following the sack of the city, a few surviving members of the Abbasid dynastic family led by the eldest amongst them, Ismail II son of Hamza son of Ahmed son of Mohamed migrated to Southern Iran, in the village of Khonj and later to [[Bastak]] where their khanate was established in the 17th century CE.{{refn|group=nb|For his full genealogy all the way back to Al-Abbas bin Abdulmuttalib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet Mohamed, please see: Al-Abbasi's book ''Nader al-Bayan fi Dhikr Ansab Baniabbassian''&lt;ref name=Alabb&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Abbasi|1986}}{{Page needed | date = January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;محمد أعظم؛ (العباسي)بني عباسيان بستكي (1993م). أحداث و وقائع و مشايخ بستك و خنج و لنجة و لار.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Wadai Empire]] related a similar origin story, claiming descent from a man by the name of Salih ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas, whose father Abdullah was an Abbasid prince who fled Baghdad for [[Hijaz]] upon the Mongol invasion. He had a son named Salih who would grow to become an &quot;able jurist&quot; and a &quot;very devout man&quot;. The Muslim [[ulama]] on pilgrimage in Mecca met him and, impressed by his knowledge, invited him to return with him to [[Sennar]]. Seeing the population's deviation from Islam, he &quot;pushed further&quot; until he found the Abu Sinun mountain in [[Ouaddaï highlands|Wadai]] where he converted the local people to Islam and taught them its rules, after which they made him [[sultan]], thus laying the foundations of the Wadai Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2pKwQX16BAC&amp;pg=PA206 |title = Sahara and Sudan|isbn = 9780900966538|last1 = Nachtigal|first1 = Gustav|year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the Bastak khanate, Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki was the first Abbasid ruler of Bastak to hold the title of &quot;Khan&quot; after the local people accepted him as a ruler ([[Persian language|Persian]]: خان, [[Arabic]]: الحاكم), meaning &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;king&quot;, a title which was reportedly bestowed upon him by [[Karim Khan Zand]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, C.; Van Donzel, E.; Lewis, B.; Pellat, Ch. (1983). EncyclopeÌ die de l'Islam [The Encyclopedia of Islam] (in French). V (New ed.). Leiden, Netherlands: E.J. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; The title then became that of all the subsequent Abbasid rulers of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh, and also collectively refers in plural form – i.e., &quot;Khans&quot; ([[Persian language|Persian]]: خوانين) – to the descendants of Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki. The last Abbasid ruler of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh was Mohamed A’zam Khan Baniabbassian son of Mohamed Reza Khan &quot;Satvat al-Mamalek&quot; Baniabbasi. He authored the book ''Tarikh-e Jahangiriyeh va Baniabbassian-e Bastak'' (1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which is recounted the history of the region and the Abbasid family that ruled it. Mohamed A’zam Khan Baniabbassian died in 1967, regarded as the end of the Abbasid reign in Bastak.

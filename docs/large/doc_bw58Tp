It is rarely used alone, but primarily used in [[explosive booster|booster]] and [[burst charge|bursting charges]] of small [[caliber]] [[ammunition]], in upper charges of [[detonator]]s in some [[land mine]]s and shells, and as the explosive core of [[detonation cord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.dynonobel.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynonobel.com/files/2010/04/Primacord.pdf |title=Primacord Technical Information |publisher=Dyno Nobel |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160725/http://www.dynonobel.com/files/2010/04/Primacord.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PETN is the least stable of the common military explosives, but can be stored without significant deterioration for longer than [[nitroglycerin]] or [[nitrocellulose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454067/PETN PETN (chemical compound)]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved February 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], PETN was most importantly used in [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s for the atomic bombs. These exploding-bridgewire detonators gave more precise detonation, compared with [[primacord]]. PETN was used for these detonators because it was safer than primary explosives like [[lead azide]]: while it was sensitive, it would not detonate below a threshold amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Technical History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years, 1943–1945 |author1=Lillian Hoddeson |author2=Paul W.

In spark detonators, PETN is used to avoid the need for primary explosives; the energy needed for a successful direct initiation of PETN by an [[electric spark]] ranges between 10–60 mJ.

Its basic explosion characteristics are:
* Explosion energy: 5810 kJ/kg (1390 kcal/kg), so 1&amp;nbsp;kg of PETN has the energy of 1.24&amp;nbsp;kg TNT.
* [[Detonation velocity]]: 8350&amp;nbsp;m/s (1.73 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 7910&amp;nbsp;m/s (1.62 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 7420&amp;nbsp;m/s (1.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 8500&amp;nbsp;m/s (pressed in a steel tube)
* Volume of gases produced: 790 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/kg (other value: 768 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/kg)
* Explosion temperature: 4230&amp;nbsp;°C
* [[Oxygen balance]]: −6.31 atom -g/kg
* [[Melting point]]: 141.3&amp;nbsp;°C (pure), 140–141&amp;nbsp;°C (technical)
* [[Trauzl lead block test]]: 523&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (other values: 500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; when sealed with sand, or 560&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; when sealed with water)
* Critical diameter (minimal diameter of a rod that can sustain detonation propagation): 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm for PETN at 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, smaller for higher densities (other value: 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm)

===In mixtures===
PETN is used in a number of compositions. It is a major ingredient of the [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]]. It is also used as a component of [[pentolite]], a 50/50 blend with TNT. The XTX8003 extrudable explosive, used in the [[W68]] and [[W76]] nuclear warheads, is a mixture of 80% PETN and 20% of Sylgard 182, a [[silicone rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/650196-rV1bU0/webviewable/650196.pdf Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information – Sponsored by OSTI]. Osti.gov (November 23, 2009). Retrieved 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often [[phlegmatized]] by addition of 5–40% of [[wax]], or by polymers (producing [[polymer-bonded explosive]]s); in this form it is used in some cannon shells up to [[30 mm caliber]], though it is unsuitable for higher calibers. &lt;!-- why? --&gt; It is also used as a component of some gun [[propellant]]s and [[solid rocket propellant]]s. Nonphlegmatized PETN is stored and handled with approximately 10% water content. PETN alone cannot be [[casting|cast]] as it explosively decomposes slightly above its melting point,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}{{clarify|date=September 2016}} but it can be mixed with other explosives to form castable mixtures.

PETN can be initiated by a [[laser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarzhanov | first1 = V. I. | last2 = Zinchenko | first2 = A. D. | last3 = Sdobnov | first3 = V.

===Detection===
In the wake of terrorist PETN bomb plots, an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' noted PETN is difficult to detect because it does not readily vaporize into the surrounding air.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificamerican1&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted in November 2010 that PETN's low [[vapor pressure]] makes it difficult for bomb-sniffing dogs to detect.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Many technologies can be used to detect PETN, including chemical sensors, X-rays, infrared, microwaves&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Review of Existing and Potential Standoff Explosives Detection Techniques, National Research Council (2004) [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10998&amp;page=1 Existing and Potential Standoff Explosives Detection Techniques], National Academies Press, Washington, D.C. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and terahertz &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.2197442|chapter=Discrimination and identification of RDX/PETN explosives by chemometrics applied to terahertz time-domain spectral imaging|title=Millimetre Wave and Terahertz Sensors and Technology VIII|volume=9651|pages=965109|year=2015|last1=Bou-Sleiman|first1=J.|last2=Perraud|first2=J.-B.|last3=Bousquet|first3=B.|last4=Guillet|first4=J.-P.|last5=Palka|first5=N.|last6=Mounaix|first6=P.|editor1-last=Salmon|editor1-first=Neil A|editor2-last=Jacobs|editor2-first=Eddie L}}&lt;/ref&gt;, some of which have been implemented in public screening applications, primarily for air travel. PETN is one of the explosive chemicals typically of interest in that area, and it belongs to a family of common [[Nitro compound|nitrate-based explosive chemicals]] which can often be detected by the same tests.

One detection system in use at airports involves analysis of swab samples obtained from passengers and their baggage. Whole-body imaging scanners that use radio-frequency [[electromagnetic wave]]s, low-intensity [[X-rays]], or T-rays of terahertz frequency that can detect objects hidden under clothing are not widely used because of cost, concerns about the resulting traveler delays, and privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/27/AR2009122702021.html &quot;Equipment to detect explosives is available&quot;].

      <text bytes="13714" xml:space="preserve">The '''Kirkendall effect''' is the motion of the interface between two metals that occurs as a consequence of the difference in [[diffusion]] rates of the metal atoms. The effect can be observed for example by placing insoluble markers at the interface between a pure [[metal]] and an [[alloy]] containing that metal, and heating to a temperature where [[atomic diffusion]] is possible; the boundary will move relative to the markers.

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:KirkendallScheme1.png|right|200px|schematic illustration of the Kirkendall effect]] --&gt;
This process was named after [[Ernest Kirkendall]] (1914–2005), assistant professor of [[chemical engineering]] at [[Wayne State University]] from 1941 to 1946.  The paper describing the discovery of the effect was published in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;original journal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. D. |last1=Smigelskas |first2=E. O. |last2=Kirkendall |title=Zinc Diffusion in Alpha Brass |journal=Trans. AIME |volume=171 |year=1947 |pages=130–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kirkendall effect has important practical consequences.  One of these is the prevention or suppression of voids formed at the boundary interface in various kinds of alloy to metal bonding.  These are referred to as '''Kirkendall voids'''.

==History==
The Kirkendall effect was discovered by Ernest Kirkendall and Alice Smigelskas in 1947, in the course of Kirkendall's ongoing research into diffusion in [[brass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JOM history&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakajima|first=Hideo|title=The Discovery and Acceptance of the Kirkendall Effect: The Result of a Short Research Career|journal=JOM|year=1997|volume=49|issue=6|pages=15–19|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9706/nakajima-9706.html|accessdate=28 April 2013|doi=10.1007/bf02914706|s2cid=55941759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper in which he discovered the famous effect was the third in his series of papers on brass diffusion, the first being his thesis. His second paper revealed that [[zinc]] diffused more quickly than [[copper]] in alpha-brass, which led to the research producing his revolutionary theory. Until this point, substitutional and ring methods were the dominant ideas for diffusional motion. Kirkendall's experiment produced evidence of a vacancy diffusion mechanism, which is the accepted mechanism to this day. At the time it was submitted, the paper and Kirkendall's ideas were rejected from publication by [[Robert Franklin Mehl]], director of the Metals Research Laboratory at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]). Mehl refused to accept Kirkendall's evidence of this new diffusion mechanism, and denied publication for over six months, only relenting after a conference was held and several other researchers confirmed Kirkendall's results.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOM history&quot;/&gt;

===Kirkendall's experiment===
A bar of brass (70% Cu, 30% Zn) was used as a core, with [[molybdenum]] wires stretched along its length, and then coated in a layer of pure copper. Molybdenum was chosen as the marker material due to it being very insoluble in brass, eliminating any error due to the markers diffusing themselves. Diffusion was allowed to take place at 785&amp;nbsp;°C over the course of 56 days, with cross-sections being taken at six times throughout the span of the experiment. Over time, it was observed that the wire markers moved closer together as the zinc diffused out of the brass and into the copper. A difference in location of the interface was visible in cross sections of different times. Compositional change of the material from diffusion was confirmed by [[x-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;original journal&quot;/&gt;

==Diffusion mechanism==
Early diffusion models postulated that atomic motion in substitutional alloys occurs via a direct exchange mechanism, in which atoms migrate by switching positions with atoms on adjacent lattice sites.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhadeshia|first=H.K.D.H.|title=The Kirkendall Effect|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/kirkendall.html|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a mechanism implies that the atomic [[flux]]es of two different materials across an interface must be equal, as each atom moving across the interface causes another atom to move across in the other direction.

Another possible diffusion mechanism involves lattice [[Vacancy defect|vacancies]]. An atom can move into a vacant lattice site, effectively causing the atom and the vacancy to switch places. If large-scale diffusion takes place in a material, there will be a flux of atoms in one direction and a flux of vacancies in the other.[[File:Kirkendall effect diffusion example.jpg|thumbnail|Demonstration of atomic fluxes in vacancy diffusion]]

The Kirkendall effect arises when two distinct materials are placed next to each other and diffusion is allowed to take place between them. In general, the [[diffusion coefficient]]s of the two materials in each other are not the same. This is only possible if diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism; if the atoms instead diffused by an exchange mechanism, they would cross the interface in pairs, so the diffusion rates would be identical, contrary to observation. By [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's 1st law of diffusion]], the flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient will be larger, so there will be a net flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient into the material with the lower diffusion coefficient. To balance this flux of atoms, there will be a flux of vacancies in the opposite direction—from the material with the lower diffusion coefficient into the material with the higher diffusion coefficient—resulting in an overall translation of the lattice relative to the environment in the direction of the material with the lower diffusion constant.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;

Macroscopic evidence for the Kirkendall effect can be gathered by placing inert markers at the initial interface between the two materials, such as molybdenum markers at an interface between copper and brass. The diffusion coefficient of zinc is higher than the diffusion coefficient of copper in this case. Since zinc atoms leave the brass at a higher rate than copper atoms enter, the size of the brass region decreases as diffusion progresses. Relative to the molybdenum markers, the copper-brass interface moves toward the brass at an experimentally measurable rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;original journal&quot;/&gt;

===Darken's equations===
{{main|Darken's equations}}
Shortly after the publication of Kirkendall's paper, L.S. Darken published an analysis of diffusion in binary systems much like the one studied by Smigelskas and Kirkendall. By separating the actual diffusive flux of the materials from the movement of the interface relative to the markers, Darken found the marker velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to be&lt;ref name=Darken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darken|first=L.S.|title=Diffusion, Mobility, and Their Interrelation through Free Energy in Binary Metallic Systems|journal=Trans. AIME|date=February 1948|volume=175|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = (D_1-D_2)\frac{dN_1}{dx},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt; are the diffusion coefficients of the two materials and &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt; is an atomic fraction.
One consequence of this equation is that the movement of an interface varies linearly with the square root of time, which is exactly the experimental relationship discovered by Smigelskas and Kirkendall.&lt;ref name=&quot;original journal&quot; /&gt;

Darken also developed a second equation that defines a combined chemical diffusion coefficient &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the diffusion coefficients of the two interfacing materials:&lt;ref name=Darken /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;D = N_1 D_2 + N_2 D_1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This chemical diffusion coefficient can be used to mathematically analyze Kirkendall effect diffusion via the [[Boltzmann-Matano analysis|Boltzmann-Matano method]].

==Kirkendall porosity==
One important consideration deriving from Kirkendall's work is the presence of [[Porosity|pores]] formed during diffusion. These voids act as sinks for vacancies, and when enough accumulate they can become substantial and expand in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Porosity occurs due to the difference in diffusion rate of the two species.&lt;ref name=porosity&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seitz|first=F.|title=On the porosity observed in the Kirkendall effect|journal=Acta Metallurgica|date=May 1953|volume=1|issue=3|pages=355–369|doi=10.1016/0001-6160(53)90112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pores in metals have ramifications for mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, and thus control over their formation is often desired. The equation&lt;ref name=equation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Son|first=Yoon-Ho|author2=J.E. Morral |title=The Effect of Composition on Marker Movement and Kirkendall Porosity in Ternary Alloys|journal=Metallurgical Transactions A|date=November 1989|volume=20A|issue=11|pages=2299–2303|doi=10.1007/BF02666665|s2cid=137088474}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;X^K = (a_1 \Delta C_1^\circ + a_2 \Delta C_2^\circ + \dots + a_{n-1} \Delta C_{n-1}^\circ)\sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;X^K&lt;/math&gt; is the distance moved by a marker, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient determined by intrinsic diffusivities of the materials, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta C^\circ&lt;/math&gt; is a concentration difference between components, has proven to be an effective model for mitigating Kirkendall porosity. Controlling annealing temperature is another method of reducing or eliminating porosity. Kirkendall porosity typically occurs at a set temperature in a system, so [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] can be performed at lower temperatures for longer times to avoid formation of pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cogan|first=S.F. |author2=S.

==Nanotechnology applications==
The [[Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology]] in [[Bellaterra]], Spain has developed a chemical process creating hollows in nano-particles and forming double-walled boxes and multi-chambered tubes. The results of the study have appeared in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16101495 | work=BBC News | title=Nanoparticle hollowing method promises medical advances | date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minute silver cubes were treated with cationic gold which at room temperatures led to a loss of electrons from the silver atoms which were taken up by an electrolytic solution. The gaining of electrons transformed the cationic gold into metallic gold which then attached to the surface of the silver cube. This covering protects the underlying silver, confining the reaction to the uncoated parts. Finally, there remains only a single hole on the surface through which the reaction enters the cube. A secondary effect then takes place when silver atoms from inside the cube begin to migrate through the hole to the gold on the surface, creating a void inside the cube.

The process will have a wide range of applications. Small changes in the chemical environment will allow control of reaction and diffusion at room temperatures, permitting manufacture of diverse polymetallic hollow nanoparticles through galvanic replacement and the Kirkendall effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1212822|pmid = 22158813| title=Carving at the Nanoscale: Sequential Galvanic Exchange and Kirkendall Growth at Room Temperature| journal=Science| volume=334| issue=6061| pages=1377–1380| year=2011| last1=Gonzalez| first1=E.| last2=Arbiol| first2=J.| last3=Puntes| first3=V.

In 1972, C.W. Horsting of the [[RCA Corporation]] published a paper which reported test results on the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of [[semiconductor devices]] in which the connections were made using [[aluminium]] wires bonded [[ultrasonic welding|ultrasonically]] to [[gold]] plated posts. His paper demonstrated the importance of the Kirkendall effect in [[wire bonding]] technology, but also showed the significant contribution of any impurities present to the rate at which [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] occurred at the wire bonds.  Two of the important contaminants that have this effect, known as '''Horsting effect''' ('''Horsting voids''') are [[fluorine]] and [[chlorine]]. Both Kirkendall voids and Horsting voids are known causes of wire bond fractures, though historically this cause is often confused with the purple colored appearance of one of the five different [[gold-aluminium intermetallics]], commonly referred to as &quot;purple plague&quot; and less often &quot;white plague&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contamination-Enhanced Growth of Au/Al Intermetallic and Horsting Voids|url=https://nepp.nasa.gov/index.cfm/20987|work=NASA|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

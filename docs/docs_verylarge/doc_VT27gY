The word &quot;chariot&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] term '''''carrus''''', a loanword from [[Gaulish]]. A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a [[car]]. In [[ancient Rome]] and some other [[Ancient history#Europe and Mediterranean|ancient Mediterranean civilizations]], a ''[[Biga (chariot)|biga]]'' required two horses, a ''[[Triga (chariot)|triga]]'' three, and a ''[[quadriga]]'' four.

The chariot was a fast, light, open, two-[[wheel]]ed conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for [[ancient warfare]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for [[travel]], in [[Parade|processions]], for [[game]]s, and in [[Chariot racing|races]].

The critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the [[spoke]]d [[wheel]]. The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to c. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC. Many notable conflicts were waged using chariots, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD, but continued to be popular for racing and military ceremonies.

== History ==
A necessary precursor to the invention of the chariot is the [[domestication of animals]], specifically [[domestication of the horse|horses]] – a major step in the development of civilization. Despite the large impact horse domestication has had in transport and communication, tracing its origins has been challenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking|last1=Ak|first1=Outram|last2=Na|first2=Stear|date=2009-03-06|language=en|pmid=19265018|last3=R|first3=Bendrey|last4=S|first4=Olsen|last5=A|first5=Kasparov|last6=V|first6=Zaibert|last7=N|first7=Thorpe|last8=Rp|first8=Evershed|journal = Science|volume = 323|issue = 5919|pages = 1332–5|doi = 10.1126/science.1168594|bibcode=2009Sci...323.1332O|s2cid=5126719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supports horses having been domesticated in the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s, with studies suggesting the [[Botai culture]] in modern day [[Kazakhstan]] being the first, about 3500 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The origins of chariots and their use in warfare are obscure.

The spread of spoke-wheeled chariots has been closely attributed to the [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic Steppe]]s. The earliest known chariots have been found in [[Sintashta culture]] burial sites, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the [[Old World]] and played an important role in [[ancient warfare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuznetsov&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuznetsov|first=P.F.|date=2006-09-01|title=The emergence of Bronze Age chariots in eastern Europe|journal=Antiquity|volume=80|issue=309|pages=638–645|doi=10.1017/s0003598x00094096|issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These self designated [[Aryan]] people migrated southward into South Asia, ushering in the [[Vedic period]] around 1750 BC.

==Eurasian Steppes==
The invention of the [[wheel]] used in [[transportation]] most likely took place in [[Mesopotamia]] or the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s in modern-day Russia
. Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the mid [[4th millennium BC]] near-simultaneously in the Northern [[Caucasus]] ([[Maykop culture]]), and in Central Europe. These earliest depicted vehicles may have been [[Bullock cart|ox carts]].&lt;ref&gt;David W.

As [[David W. Anthony]] writes in his book ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'', in Eastern Europe, the earliest well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (a wagon with two axles and four wheels) is on the [[Bronocice pot]] (c. 3500 BC).

Nomadic tribes of the Pontic steppes, like [[Scythians]] such as [[Hamaxobii]], would travel in wagons, carts, and chariots during their migrations.

In ''Rigveda'', [[Indra]] is described as strong willed, armed with a thunderbolt, riding a chariot:&lt;blockquote&gt;May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, for thou art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses. So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us, strong-willed, thunder armed, in battle.

[[Ushas]] (the dawn) rides in a chariot, as well as [[Agni]] in his function as a messenger between gods and men.

There are some depictions of chariots among the [[petroglyphs]] in the sandstone of the [[Vindhya]] range. Two depictions of chariots are found in Morhana Pahar, [[Mirzapur]] district. One depicts a biga and the head of the driver. The second depicts a quadriga, with six-spoked wheels, and a driver standing up in a large chariot box. This chariot is being attacked. One figure, who is armed with a shield and a mace, stands in the chariot's path; another figure, who is armed with bow and arrow, threatens the right flank. It has been suggested (speculated) that the drawings record a story, most probably dating to the early centuries BC, from some center in the area of the [[Ganges]]–[[Yamuna]] plain into the territory of still Neolithic hunting tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Sparreboom 1985:87&lt;/ref&gt; The very realistic chariots carved into the [[Sanchi]] [[stupa]]s are dated to roughly the 1st century.

Bronze-age chariots, which have been estimated to date back to about 2000–1800 BC, were discovered in burials at Sanauli, Uttar Pradesh in June 2018 as part of excavations undertaken by SK Manjul of the Archaeological Survey of India. But the age is not confirmed yet; it can be confirmed after carbon-dating.

[[Scythed chariot]]s, called r''athamusala,'' were introduced by the King of [[Magadha]], [[Ajatashatru]] around 475 BC. He used these chariots against the [[Licchavi (republic)|Licchavis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roy, Kaushik, 1971-|title=Military manpower, armies and warfare in South Asia|isbn=978-1-315-65517-8|location=London|oclc=1082214357}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[scythe]]d war chariot had a sharp, sickle-shaped blade or blades mounted on each end of the [[axle]]. These blades, used as weapons, extended horizontally for a metre on each side of the chariot. There is a chariot displayed at the [[AP State Archaeology Museum]], [[Hyderabad, Telangana]].

== Ancient Asia Minor ==
Some scholars argue that the horse chariot was most likely a product of the ancient Near East early in the 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Raulwing 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Joost Crouwel writes that &quot;Chariots were not sudden inventions, but developed out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels. This development can best be traced in the Near East, where spoke-wheeled and horse-drawn chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BC...&quot; and were illustrated on a Syrian cylinder seal dated to either the 18th or 17th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crouwel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joost Crouwel|title=Chasing Chariots: Proceedings of the First International Chariot Conference (Cairo 2012)|date=2013|publisher=Sidestone Press|isbn=978-9088902093|editor1-last=Veldmeijer|editor1-first=Andre J.|page=74|chapter=Studying the Six Chariots from the Tomb of Tutankhamun – An Update|editor2-last=Ikram|editor2-first=Salima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early wheeled vehicles in the Near East===
[[File:Standard of Ur - War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8&lt;!--low aspect image--&gt;|Relief of early [[war wagon]]s on the [[Standard of Ur]], c. 2500 BC]]

According to [[Christoph Baumer]], the earliest discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia come from the first half of the third millennium BC – more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region. At the same time, in Mesopotamia, some intriguing early pictograms of a sled that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found. They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel.&lt;ref name=&quot;asianreviewofbooks.com&quot; /&gt;

The earliest fully developed spoke-wheeled horse chariots are from the [[chariot burial]]s of the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] (Timber-Grave) sites of the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] [[Proto-Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] culture in modern Russia and [[Kazakhstan]] from around 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuznetsov&quot; /&gt; This culture is at least partially derived from the earlier [[Yamna culture]]. It built heavily fortified settlements, engaged in [[Bronze Age|bronze]] metallurgy on an industrial scale, and practiced complex burial rituals reminiscent of [[Hindu]] rituals known from the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the ''[[Avesta]]''.

Over the next few centuries, the [[Andronovo culture]] spread across the steppes from the [[Urals]] to the [[Tien Shan]], likely corresponding to the time of early [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian cultures]].

Chariots figure prominently in Indo-Iranian mythology. Chariots are also an important part of both [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Persian mythology]], with most of the gods in their [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] portrayed as riding them. The [[Sanskrit]] word for a chariot is ''rátha-'' ([[Masculine gender|m.]]), which is cognate with [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''raθa-'' (also m.), and in origin a substantiation of the adjective [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*rot-h₂-ó-}}'' meaning &quot;having wheels&quot;, with the characteristic accent shift found in Indo-Iranian substantivisations. This adjective is in turn derived from the collective noun ''{{PIE|*rot-eh₂-}}'' &quot;wheels&quot;, continued in Latin ''rota'', which belongs to the noun ''{{PIE|*rót-o-}}'' for &quot;wheel&quot; (from ''{{PIE|*ret-}}'' &quot;to run&quot;) that is also found in Germanic, Celtic and Baltic ([[Old High German]] ''rad'' n., [[Old Irish]] ''roth'' m., [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''rãtas'' m.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rix|first1=Helmut|title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben|last2=Kümmel|first2=Martin|last3=Zehnder|first3=Thomas|last4=Lipp|first4=Reiner|last5=Schirmer|first5=Brigitte|date=2001|publisher=Ludwig Reichert|isbn=3-89500-219-4|edition=2nd|location=Wiesbaden|page=[https://archive.org/details/livlexikonderind00rixh/page/n256 507]|language=German|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest depiction of vehicles in the context of warfare is on the [[Standard of Ur]] in southern Mesopotamia, c. 2500 BC. These are more properly called [[wagons]] or [[carts]] and were double-axled and pulled by oxen or a hybrid of a [[donkey]] and a female [[onager]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elena Efimovna Kuzʹmina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5J9rn8p2-IC&amp;pg=PA134|title=The Origin of the Indo-Iranians|year=2007|page=134|isbn = 9789004160545}}&lt;/ref&gt; named Kunga in the city of [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Nagar]] which was famous for breeding them.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunga1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Paolo Matthiae, Nicoló Marchetti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaZg0ypYrnQC&amp;pg=PA436|title=Ebla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East|year=2013|page=436|isbn = 9781611322286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrids were used by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite]],&lt;ref name=&quot;kunga1&quot; /&gt; [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|early Sumerian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Ur III]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David W.

The Sumerians had a lighter, two-wheeled type of cart, pulled by four asses, and with solid wheels. The spoked wheel did not appear in Mesopotamia until the mid-2000s BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subscriptions.teachtci.com/shared/sections/6398?program_id=13|title=History Alive!

Chariots are frequently mentioned in the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] and the [[Greek Old Testament]], respectively, particularly by the prophets, as instruments of war or as symbols of power or glory. First mentioned in the story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 50:9), &quot;Iron chariots&quot; are mentioned also in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (17:16,18) and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] (1:19,4:3,13) as weapons of the [[Canaan]]ites and [[Israelites]]. [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 13:5 mentions chariots of the [[Philistines]], who are sometimes identified with the [[Sea Peoples]] or [[Mycenaean Greece|early Greeks]].

The chariot and horse were used extensively in [[Egypt]] by the [[Hyksos]] invaders from the 16th century BC onwards, though discoveries announced in 2013 potentially place the earliest chariot use as early as Egypt's [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nevine |last=El-Aref |title=Old Kingdom leather fragments reveal how ancient Egyptians built their chariots |work=English Ahra |date=22 April 2013 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/69897/Heritage/Ancient-Egypt/Old%20Kingdom-leather-fragments-reveal-how-ancient-E.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the remains of [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Assyria]]n art, there are numerous representations of chariots, which display rich ornamentation. The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BC. As a general rule, the Egyptians used chariots as mobile archery platforms; chariots always had two men, with the driver steering the chariot with his reins while the main archer aimed his bow and arrow at any targets within range. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]. Chariots can be carried by two or more horses.

===Hittites===
[[File:Hittite Chariot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] chariot (drawing of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] relief)]]

The oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the [[Hittite language|Old Hittite]] [[Anitta text]] (18th century BC), which mentions 40 teams of horses (in the original [[cuneiform]] spelling: 40 ''ṢÍ-IM-TI'' ANŠE.KUR.RA&lt;sup&gt;ḪI.A&lt;/sup&gt;) at the siege of [[Salatiwara]]. Since the text mentions ''teams'' rather than ''chariots'', the existence of chariots in the 18th century BC is uncertain. The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BC ([[Hattusili I]]). A Hittite horse-training text is attributed to [[Kikkuli the Mitanni]] (15th century BC).

The [[Hittites]] were renowned charioteers. They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels, with four spokes rather than eight, and that held three rather than two warriors. It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots. Typically one Hittite warrior steered the chariot while the second man was usually the main archer; the third warrior would either wield a spear or sword when charging at enemies or hold up a large shield to protect himself and the others from enemy arrows.

Hittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources, specifically metals. As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia, tensions flared among the neighboring [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hurrian]]s, and [[Egyptians]]. Under [[Suppiluliuma I]], the Hittites conquered [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and, eventually, the whole of [[Syria]]. The [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving over 5,000 chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aaron |last=Ralby |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb |title=Atlas of Military History |publisher=Parragon |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1 |pages=54–55 |chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BC: Clash of Empires|chapter-url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] succeeded [[Elam]] in the mid 1st millennium. They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots. They also used [[scythed chariot]]s. [[Cyrus the Younger]] employed these chariots in large numbers at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].

[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Libya]]n and the [[Ancient India]]n ([[Sattagydia]], [[Gandhara]] and [[Hindush]]) [[satrapies]] supplied cavalry and chariots to [[Xerxes the Great]]'s army. However, by this time, [[cavalry]] was far more effective and agile than the chariot, and the defeat of [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC), where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind, marked the end of the era of chariot warfare (barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers, India, China, and the Celtic peoples).

=== Greece ===
[[File:Delphi charioteer front DSC06255.JPG|left|thumb|upright=.75|The ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]'' was dedicated to the god [[Apollo]] in 474 BC by the tyrant of [[Gela#Ancient era|Gela]] in commemoration of a [[Pythian games|Pythian racing victory]] at [[Delphi]].]]

The later [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the first millennium BC had a (still not very effective) [[cavalry]] arm (indeed, it has been argued that these early horseback riding soldiers may have given rise to the development of the later, heavily armed foot-soldiers known as hoplites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BABESCH Annual Papers on Mediterranean Archaeology |url=https://www.babesch.org/82brouwers.html |website=From Horsemen to Hoplites |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the rocky terrain of the [[Geography of Greece|Greek mainland]] was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in [[epic poetry]]. [[Linear B]] tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Panathenaic Games]] and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in ''[[hippodrome]]s'' and in contests called ''[[agon]]s''. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a ''[[paranymph]]'', or friend of a bridegroom, went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.

[[Herodotus]] (''Histories'', 5. 9) Reports that chariots were widely used in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]]–[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] steppe by the [[Sigynnae]].

Greek chariots were made to be drawn by two [[horse]]s attached to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or ''trace'' fastened to the front or ''prow'' of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize [[vase]]s in the [[British Museum]] from the [[Panathenaic Games]] at [[Athens, Greece]], in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.

The body or ''basket'' of the chariot rested directly on the [[axle]] (called ''beam'') connecting the two wheels. There was no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3&amp;nbsp;ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, making it easy to mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.

The reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through rings attached to the [[horse collar|collar]] bands or yoke, and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense.

The wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron. The wheels had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=J. E.|title=Structures, or Why Things Don't Fall Down|year=1978|publisher=Pelican|location=London|isbn=9780140219616|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other nations of this time had chariots of similar design to the Greeks, the chief differences being the mountings.

According to Greek mythology, the chariot was invented by [[Erichthonius of Athens]] to conceal his feet, which were those of a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/3390.html Brewer, E.

The most notable appearance of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when [[Phaethon|Phaëton]], the son of [[Helios]], in an attempt to drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a ''phaeton'' as one who drives a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Chariot Allegory]]'', depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.

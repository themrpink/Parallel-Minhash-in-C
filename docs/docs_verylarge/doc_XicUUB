=== French method ===
[[File:Flower Festival 01.jpg|thumb|upright]]
The French method is the basis of all ballet training. When Louis XIV created the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was particularly revitalized under [[Rudolf Nureyev]], in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|title=Ballet Methods: What Are They? {{!}} TutuTix|date=2016-05-09|work=[[TutuTix]]|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202705/https://www.tututix.com/ballet-methods-what-are-they/|archive-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school. The French method is often characterized by technical precision, fluidity and gracefulness, and elegant, clean lines. For this style, fast footwork is often utilized in order to give the impression that the performers are drifting lightly across the stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawaballetschool.com/Ballet-Methods.html|title=Different Ballet Methods|website=www.ottawaballetschool.com|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711192342/http://www.ottawaballetschool.com/Ballet-Methods.html|archive-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two important trademarks of this technique are the specific way in which the port de bras and the épaulement are performed, more rounded than when dancing in a Russian style, but not as rounded as the Danish style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/the_paris_opara_ballet_school-2326043328.html|title=The Paris Opéra Ballet School|date=2010-01-01|work=[[Dance Spirit]]|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202705/http://www.dancespirit.com/the_paris_opara_ballet_school-2326043328.html|archive-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaganova method ===
[[File:Agrippina Vaganova -Esmeralda 1910.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Agrippina Vaganova, &quot;Esmeralda&quot; 1910]]
The [[Vaganova method]] is a style of ballet training that emerged from [[Russian ballet]], created by [[Agrippina Vaganova]]. After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized and her book, ''The Fundamentals of Classical Dance'' (1934), is a classic reference. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt; She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book ''Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance'' (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.

The method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and greater expression to the body as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|title=Vaganova Method|language=ru|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111202706/http://ibtacademy.org/content/Vaganova-at-IBT|publisher=[[International Ballet Theater Academy]] ibtacademy.org|archive-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cecchetti method ===
[[File:Cecchetti jpg.gif|thumb|upright|Enrico Cecchetti with Anna Pavlova]]
Developed by [[Enrico Cecchetti]] (1850-1928), this method is one known internationally for its intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, [[Ballon (ballet)|ballon]], poise, and strength.

This method espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to  create beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de bras that are utilized.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== Bournonville method ===
[[File:August Bournonville by E. Lange.jpg|left|thumb|upright|August Bournonville]]
The Bournonville method is a Danish method first devised by [[August Bournonville]]. Bournonville was heavily influenced by the early French ballet method due to his training with his father, [[Antoine Bournonville]] and other important French ballet masters. This method has many style differences that differentiate it from other ballet methods taught today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|title=Bournonville.com|website=www.bournonville.com|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025043/http://bournonville.com/bournonville46.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key component is the use of diagonal  épaulements, with the upper body turning towards the working foot typically. This method also incorporates very basic use of arms, pirouettes from a low développé position into seconde, and use of fifth position bras en bas for the beginning and end of movements.

The Bournonville method produces dancers who have beautiful ''ballon'' (&quot;the illusion of imponderable lightness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|title=Bournonville: The Danish Way of Dancing - Ballet Position|date=2016-06-17|work=Ballet Position|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910191614/http://www.balletposition.com/blog/the-danish-way-of-dancing-it-all-started-with-bournonville|archive-date=2018-09-10|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD) ===
The [[Royal Academy of Dance|Royal Academy of Dance method]], also referred to as the English style of ballet, was established in 1920 by Genee, Karsavina, Bedells, E Espinosa, and Richardson. The goal of this method is to promote academic training in classical ballet throughout Great Britain. This style also spread to the United States, and is widely utilized still today. There are specific grade levels which a student must move through in order to complete training in this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|title=Ballet Training Techniques - The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) - DANCE VILLAGE - dance portal and online community|website=www.dancevillage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227063431/http://www.dancevillage.com/en/dance-methods/royal-academy-dance.php|archive-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key principle behind this method of instruction is that basic ballet technique must be taught at a slow pace, with difficulty progression often much slower than the rest of the methods. The idea behind this is if a student is to put in a large amount of effort into perfecting the basic steps, the technique learned in these steps allow a student to utilize harder ones at a much easier rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

=== Balanchine method ===
[[File:Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Suzanne Farrell]] and [[George Balanchine]] dancing in a segment of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; at New York State Theater]]
Developed by [[George Balanchine]] at the [[New York City Ballet]]. His method draws heavily on his own training as a dancer in Russia. The technique is known for extreme speed throughout routines, emphasis on lines, and deep pliés. Perhaps one of the most well known differences of this style is the unorthodox positioning of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt; Dancers of this style often have flexed hands and even feet, and are placed in off-balance positions. Important ballet studios teaching this method are the [[Miami City Ballet]], Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the [[School of American Ballet]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|title=History of Ballet Dance - Dance History Articles|website=dancelessons.net|access-date=2017-07-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222002745/http://dancelessons.net/dancehistory/HistoryofBalletDance.html|archive-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costumes ==
[[File:Anna Pavlova 1912.jpg|alt=Prima Ballerina, Anna Pavlova|thumb|upright|Anna Pavlova (prima ballerina); Early materials for ballet costumes were heavy, hindering the dancer's movements]]
Ballet costumes play an important role in the ballet community. They are often the only survival of a production, representing a living imaginary picture of the scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tutuetoile.com/ballet-costume-history/|title=Ballet Costume History - Tutu Étoile|newspaper=[[Tutu Étoile]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114160803/http://www.tutuetoile.com/ballet-costume-history/|archive-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance and Baroque ===
The roots of ballet go back to the Renaissance in France and Italy when court wear was the beginning of ballet costumes. Ballet costumes have been around since the early fifteenth century. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax, woven into semitransparent gauze&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;/&gt; to create exquisite ballet costumes.

=== Seventeenth century ===
During the seventeenth century, different types of fabrics and designs were used to make costumes more spectacular and eye catching. Court dress still remained for women during this century. Silks, satins and fabrics embroidered with real gold and precious stones increased the level of spectacular decoration associated with ballet costumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;/&gt; Women's costumes also consisted of heavy garments and knee-long skirts which made it difficult for them to create much movement and gesture.

=== Eighteenth century ===
During the eighteenth century, stage costumes were still very similar to court wear but progressed over time, mostly due to the French dancer and ballet-master [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727–1810) whose proposals to modernize ballet are contained in his revolutionary ''Lettres sur la danse et les ballets'' (1760). Noverre's book altered the emphasis in a production away from the costumes towards the physical movements and emotions of the dancers.

European ballet was centered in the [[Paris Opera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;/&gt; During this era, skirts were raised a few inches off the ground.  Flowers, flounces, ribbons, and lace emphasized this opulent feminine style, as soft pastel tones in citron, peach, pink and pistachio dominated the color range.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;/&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Olga Spessiva in Swan Lake costume, 1934 photographer Sydney Fox Studio, 3rd Floor, 88 King St, Sydney.jpg|thumb|upright|Olga Spessiva; Swan Lake Costume in the twentieth century]]
During the early nineteenth century, close-fitting body costumes, floral crowns, corsages and jewels were used. Ideals of Romanticism were reflected through female movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutuetoile.com&quot;/&gt;

Costumes became much tighter as corsets started to come into use, to show off the curves on a ballerina. Jewels and bedazzled costumes became much more popular.

=== Twentieth century ===
During the twentieth century, ballet costumes transitioned back to the influence of Russian ballet. Ballerina skirts became knee-length tutus, later on in order to show off their precise pointe work. Colors used on stage costumes also became much more vibrant. Designers used colors such as red, orange, yellow, etc. to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.

==Ballet as a career==
Professional dancers are generally not well paid.  As of 2017, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$14.25 per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/dancers-and-choreographers.htm|title=Dancers and Choreographers: Occupational Outlook Handbook|date=13 April 2018|publisher=[[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105170620/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/dancers-and-choreographers.htm|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job outlook is not strong, and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the number of job openings.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Some dancers earn money by participating in dancing competitions and are awarded with money or high paying contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; [[Choreography|Choreographer]]s were paid nearly twice the amount of dancers in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Health effects ==
Teenage girl ballet dancers are prone to [[stress fracture]]s in the [[first rib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kiel|first=John|title=Stress Reaction and Fractures|date=2018|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507835/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29939612|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Kaiser|first2=Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eating disorder]]s are a common stereotype associated with ballet. In addition, some researchers have noted that intensive training in ballet results in lower [[bone mineral density]] in the arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wewege|first=Michael A.|last2=Ward|first2=Rachel E.|date=August 2018|title=Bone mineral density in pre-professional female ballet dancers: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=[[Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport]]|volume=21|issue=8|pages=783–788|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2018.02.006|issn=1878-1861|pmid=29526411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most ballet choreography is written so that it can only be performed by a relatively young dancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellenoconnellwhittet/ballet-me-too-nycb-women-gender-injuries-sexism|title=Is There Such A Thing As Ballet That Doesn't Hurt Women?|last=O'Connell Whittet|first=Ellen|date=11 October 2018|work=[[BuzzFeed News]]|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105160602/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellenoconnellwhittet/ballet-me-too-nycb-women-gender-injuries-sexism|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure of ballet – in which a (usually) male choreographer or director uses (mostly) women's bodies to express his artistic vision, while ignoring, objectifying, or silencing the women involved – has been criticized as harming women.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Jennifer|date=2007|title=Tulle as Tool: Embracing the Conflict of the Ballerina as Powerhouse|journal=[[Dance Research Journal]]|volume=39|issue=1|pages=2–24|doi=10.1017/S0149767700000048|jstor=20444681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trade credit''' is the loan extended by one trader to another when the goods and services are bought on credit. Trade credit facilitates the purchase of supplies without immediate payment. Trade credit is commonly used by business organisations as a source of short-term financing. It is granted to those customers who have a reasonable amount of financial standing and goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/business-finance/types-finance/trade-credit.html|title=Trade credit|website=ACCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kuveya, 2020)

There are many forms of trade credit in common use.  Various [[industry (economics)|industries]] use various specialized forms.  They all have, in common, the collaboration of businesses to make efficient use of capital to accomplish various business objectives.

Trade credit is the largest use of capital for a majority of business-to-business (B2B) sellers in the United States and is a critical source of capital for a majority of all businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-credit.asp|title=Trade Credit|website=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has used trade credit as a larger source of capital than bank borrowings; trade credit for Wal-Mart is 8 times the amount of capital invested by shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;(Trade credit is the second largest source of capital for Wal-Mart; retained earnings is the largest.){{Verify source|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/02cd/a578f28badfb36817da063a8382dc1755bde.pdf|title=The Implicit Costs of Trade Credit Borrowing by Large Firms|last=Justin Murfin, Ken Njoroge|date=March 2014|website=pdfs.semanticscholar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The operator of an [[ice cream]] stand may sign a [[franchising]] agreement, under which the [[distributor]] agrees to provide ice cream stock under the terms &quot;Net 60&quot; with a ten percent discount on payment within 30 days, and a 20% discount on payment within 10 days. This means that the operator has 60 days to pay the invoice in full. If sales are good within the first week, the operator may be able to send a cheque for all or part of the invoice, and make an extra 20% on the ice cream sold. However, if sales are slow, leading to a month of low cash flow, then the operator may decide to pay within 30 days, obtaining a 10% discount, or use the money for another 30 days and pay the full invoice amount within 60 days.

The ice cream distributor can do the same thing. Receiving trade credit from [[milk]] and [[sugar]] suppliers on terms of [[Net 30]], 2% discount if paid within ten days, means they are apparently taking a loss or disadvantageous position in this web of trade credit balances. Why would they do this? First, they have a substantial [[Markup (business)|markup]] on the ingredients and other costs of production of the ice cream they sell to the operator. There are many reasons and ways to manage trade credit terms for the benefit of a business. The ice cream distributor may be well-capitalized either from the owners' investment or from accumulated [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], and may be looking to expand his [[Market (economics)|market]]s. They may be aggressive in attempting to locate new customers or to help them get established. It is not in their best interests for customers to go out of business from cash flow instabilities, so their financial terms aim to accomplish two things:

# Allow startup ice cream parlors the ability to mismanage their investment in [[inventory]] for a while, while learning their markets, without having a dramatic negative balance in their bank account which could put them out of business. This is in effect, a short term business [[loan]] made to help expand the distributor's market and customer base.
# By tracking who pays, and when, the distributor can see potential problems developing and take steps to reduce or increase the allowed amount of trade credit he extends to prospering or exposure to losses from customers going [[bankrupt]] who would never pay for the ice cream delivered.

==Alternatives==
One alternative to straightforward trade credit is when a supplier offers to give product on [[consignment]] to a trader e.g. a gift shop. The terms of the arrangement mean that the original supplier retains ownership of the goods until the shop sells them.
Trade credit has been identified as a critical source of short-term financing for listed manufacturing companies. A trade credit contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties that allows a buyer to purchase goods or services on account and pay the supplier at a later date&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weerawickrama|first=V.L.|last2=Perera|first2=H.A.P.L.|date=2018|title=The Impact of Trade Credit Usage on Firm's Profitability of Listed Manufacturing Companies in Sri Lanka|url=http://repository.kln.ac.lk/handle/123456789/19657|journal=International Conference for Accounting Researchers and Educators|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: B|Other names of Bern]]}}
The etymology of the name &quot;Bern&quot; is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on [[folk etymology]], [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen|Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen]], the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of [[Verona]], which at the time was known as ''Bern'' in [[Middle High German]]. The city was sometimes referred to as ''Bern im [[Üechtland]]'' to distinguish it from Verona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/008562/2013-11-13/ |title=Üchtland |last1=Müller |first1=Wulf |last2=Tremp |first2=Ernst |date=13 November 2013 |website=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]] |access-date=5 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the finding of the [[Bern zinc tablet]] in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly ''*berna'' &quot;cleft&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Andres Kristol (ed.): Lexikon der schweizerischen Gemeindenamen. Huber, Frauenfeld 2005, {{ISBN|3-7193-1308-5}}, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The bear was the heraldic animal of the [[Coat of arms of Bern|seal and coat of arms of Bern]] from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the ''[[Bärengraben]]'' dates to the 1440s.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bern|Timeline of Bern}}

===Early history===
[[File:Untertorbrücke Tschachtlanchronik.jpg|thumb|upright|Construction of the [[Untertorbrücke]] (Lower Gate Bridge) in Bern, [[Tschachtlanchronik]], late 15th century]]

No [[archaeological]] evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a [[Celts|Celtic]] ''[[oppidum]]'' stood on the ''Engehalbinsel'' (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late [[La Tène period]]), thought to be one of the 12 ''oppida'' of the [[Helvetii]] mentioned by [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Caesar]]. During the [[Germania Superior|Roman era]], a [[Gallo-Roman]] ''[[vicus]]'' was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name ''Brenodor'' (&quot;dwelling of Breno&quot;). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in [[Bümpliz]], now a city district of Bern, was some {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} from the medieval city.

The medieval city is a foundation of the [[Zähringer]] ruling family, which rose to power in [[Upper Burgundy]] in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (''Cronica de Berno'', 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen]].

In 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a [[free imperial city]] by the ''[[Goldene Handfeste]]'' of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

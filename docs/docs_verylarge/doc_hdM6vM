In 1801, the astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered an object which he initially believed to be a [[comet]]. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the [[Franz Xaver von Zach|Baron von Zach]] and [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth√§us Olbers|Heinrich W. M. Olbers]] after a preliminary orbit was computed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. This object came to be named [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and was the first asteroid to be discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-5&quot;/&gt;

A few months later, Olbers was again attempting to locate Ceres when he noticed another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that there should be a planet in the gap between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;serendipity&quot;/&gt; When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-6&quot;/&gt; Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-7&quot;/&gt;

The orbit of Pallas was determined by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years was similar to the period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital [[inclination]] to the plane of the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;serendipity&quot; /&gt;

=== Later observations ===
[[File:Pallas - Potw2008a.jpg|thumb|300px|High-resolution images of the north (at left) and south (at right) hemispheres of Pallas, made possible by the Adaptive-Optics (AO)-fed SPHERE imager on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf Ball World|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw2008a/|accessdate=24 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large impact basins could have been created by [[asteroid family]]‚Äìforming impacts. The bright spot in the southern hemisphere is reminiscent of the salt deposits on Ceres.]]
In 1917, the Japanese astronomer [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] began to study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination, and eccentricity of a set of asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the [[Pallas family]], after the largest member of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-8&quot;/&gt; Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been identified, with semi-major axes between 2.50‚Äì2.82&amp;nbsp; AU and inclinations of 33‚Äì38¬∞.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-9&quot;/&gt; The validity of the family was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-10&quot;/&gt;

Pallas has been observed [[occultation|occulting]] [[star]]s several times, including the best-observed of all asteroid occultation events, by 140 observers on 29 May 1983. These measurements resulted in the first accurate calculation of its diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drummond1989&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunham1990&quot;/&gt;
After an occultation on 29 May 1979, the discovery of a possible tiny [[natural satellite|satellite]] with a diameter of about 1&amp;nbsp; km was reported, which was never confirmed. 

Radio signals from spacecraft in orbit around [[Mars]] and/or on its surface have been used to estimate the mass of Pallas from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva2004&quot;/&gt;

The [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'']] team was granted viewing time on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in September 2007 for a once-in-twenty-year opportunity to view Pallas at closest approach, to obtain comparative data for Ceres and Vesta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubble&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-12&quot;/&gt;

=== Naming ===
2 Pallas is named after [[Athena|Pallas Athena]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Œ†Œ±ŒªŒªŒ¨œÇ ·ºàŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩ·æ∂}}), an alternate name for the goddess Athena.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-14&quot;/&gt;
In some versions of the myth, Athena killed [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]], then adopted her friend's name out of mourning.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-15&quot;/&gt;

The adjectival form of the name is ''Palladian.''&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot; /&gt; The ''d'' is part of the [[oblique stem]] of the Greek name, which appears before a vowel but disappears before the [[nominative case|nominative]] ending ''-s''. The oblique form is seen in the Italian and Russian names for the asteroid, ''Pallade'' and –ü–∞–ª–ª–∞–¥–∞ ''Pallada''.&lt;ref&gt;The one exception internationally to the use of Pallas/Pallad- as the name of the asteroid is Chinese, where it is known as Êô∫Á•ûÊòü ''Zh√¨sh√©nxƒ´ng'', the 'wisdom-god star'&lt;/ref&gt;

(There are several male characters with a similar same name in Greek mythology, ''[[Pallas (disambiguation)#Mythology|P√°llas]]'' rather than ''Pall√°s'', but the first asteroids were invariably given female names. Because the oblique stem is different, the male name would have been ''Pallante'' in Italian and –ü–∞–ª–ª–∞–Ω—Ç ''Pallant'' in Russian.)

The stony-iron [[Pallasite]] [[meteorite]]s are not Palladian, being named instead after the German naturalist [[Peter Simon Pallas]]. The chemical element [[palladium]], on the other hand, was named after the asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-16&quot;/&gt;

As with other asteroids, the [[astronomical symbols|astronomical symbol]] for Pallas is a disk with its discovery number, ‚ë°. It also has an older, more iconic symbol, ‚ö¥ ([[File:Pallas symbol.svg|22px]]) or sometimes üúç ([[File:2 Pallas.svg|10px|Variant of Pallas symbol]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-17&quot; group=lower-alpha&gt;Unicode value U+26B4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbit and rotation ==
[[File:2 Pallas orbit Jan2018.png|thumb|right|Pallas has a high eccentricity and a highly inclined orbit]]
Pallas has unusual dynamic parameters for such a large body. Its [[orbit]] is highly [[inclination|inclined]] and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]], despite being at the same distance from the Sun as the central part of the [[asteroid belt]]. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high [[axial tilt]] of 84¬∞, with its north pole pointing towards [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] (Œ≤,&amp;nbsp;Œª) = (30¬∞,&amp;nbsp;‚àí16¬∞) with a 5¬∞ uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carry2009&quot;/&gt; This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.&lt;ref name=Carry2009/&gt;

=== Near resonances ===
Pallas is in a, likely coincidental, [[Orbital resonance#Coincidental 'near' ratios of mean motion|near]]-1:1 orbital resonance with Ceres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffin2001&quot;/&gt; Pallas also has a near-18:7 resonance (91,000-year period) and an approximate 5:2 resonance (83-year period) with [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1982&quot;/&gt;

|An animation of Pallas's near-18:7 resonance with [[Jupiter]]. The orbit of Pallas is green when above the ecliptic and red when below. It only marches clockwise: it never halts or reverses course (i.e. no [[libration]]). The motion of Pallas is shown in a reference frame that rotates about the [[Sun]] (the center dot) with a period equal to Jupiter's orbital period. Accordingly, Jupiter's orbit appears almost stationary as the pink ellipse at top left. [[Mars]]'s motion is orange, and the Earth‚ÄìMoon system is blue and white.

=== Transits of planets from Pallas ===
From Pallas, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Earth can occasionally appear to [[Astronomical transit|transit]], or pass in front of, the Sun. Earth last did so in 1968 and 1998, and will next transit in 2224. Mercury did in October 2009. The last and next by Venus are in 1677 and 2123, and for Mars they are in 1597 and 2759.&lt;ref name=&quot;solex&quot;/&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:The Four Largest Asteroids.jpg|thumb|350px|Relative sizes of the four largest asteroids. Pallas is second from right.]]

Both Vesta and Pallas have assumed the title of second-largest asteroid from time to time.&lt;ref name=&quot;notable_asteroids&quot;/&gt; At {{val|513|3|u=km}} in diameter,&lt;ref name=Marsset2020/&gt; Pallas is slightly smaller than Vesta ({{val|525.4|0.2|u=km}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2012&quot;/&gt;). The mass of Pallas is {{val|79|1|u=%}} that of Vesta, {{val|22|u=%}} that of Ceres, and a quarter of one percent that of the [[Moon]].

Pallas is farther from Earth and has a much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller asteroid [[7 Iris]] marginally exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-18&quot;/&gt; Pallas's mean opposition [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] is +8.0, which is well within the range of 10√ó50 [[binoculars]], but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small [[elongation (astronomy)|elongations]], when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasachoff1983&quot; /&gt; During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;opp2014&quot;/&gt;

Pallas is a [[B-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carry2009&quot;/&gt; Based on spectroscopic observations, the primary component of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]], which are found in [[chondrule|CM chondrules]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-19&quot;/&gt; The surface composition of Pallas is very similar to the Renazzo [[carbonaceous chondrite]] (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato1997&quot;/&gt; The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 and is one of the most primitive meteorites known.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-20&quot;/&gt; [update -- Marsset 2020 finds it closer to CM meteorites] Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carry2009&quot;/&gt;

Pallas's surface is most likely composed of a [[silicate]] material; its spectrum and calculated density ({{val|2.89|0.08|u=g/cm3}}) correspond to [[CM chondrite]] meteorites ({{val|2.90|0.08|u=g/cm3}}), suggesting a mineral composition similar to that of Ceres, but significantly less hydrated. 

To within observational limits, Pallas appears to be saturated with craters. Its high inclination and eccentricity means that average impacts are much more energetic than on Vesta or Ceres (with on average twice their velocity), meaning that smaller (and thus more common) impactors can create equivalently sized craters. Indeed, Pallas appears to have many more large craters than either Vesta or Ceres, with craters larger than 40 km covering at least 9% of its surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsset2020&quot;/&gt; 

Pallas' shape departs significantly from the dimensions of an equilibrium body at its current rotational period, indicating that it is not a dwarf planet.&lt;ref name=Carry2009 /&gt; It's possible that a suspected large impact basin at the south pole, which ejected {{val|6|1|u=%}} of the volume of Pallas (twice the volume of the Rhea Sylvia basin on Vesta), may have increased its inclination and slowed its rotation; the shape of Pallas without such a basin would be close to an equilibrium shape for a 6.2-hour rotational period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsset2020&quot;/&gt; A smaller crater near the equator is associated with the [[Palladian family]] of asterods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsset2020&quot;/&gt;

Pallas probably has a quite homogeneous interior. The close match between Pallas and CM chondrites suggests that they formed in the same era and that the interior of Pallas never reached the temperature (‚âà820 K) needed to dehydrate silicates, which would be necessary to differentiate a dry silicate core beneath a hydrated mantle. Thus Pallas should be rather homogeneous in composition, though some upward flow of water could have occurred since. Such a migration of water to the surface would have left salt deposits, potentially explaining Pallas's relatively high albedo. Indeed, one bright spot is reminiscent of those found on Ceres. Although other explanations for the bright spot are possible (e.g. a recent ejecta blanket), if the near-Earth asteroid [[3200 Phaethon]] is an ejected piece of Pallas, as some have theorized, then a Palladian surface enriched in salts would explain the sodium abundance in the [[Geminid meteor shower]] caused by Phaeton.&lt;ref name=Marsset2020/&gt;

===Surface features===
Besides one bright spot in the southern hemisphere, the only surface features identified on Pallas are craters. As of 2020, 36 craters have been identified, 34 of which are larger than 40 km in diameter. Provisional names have been provided for some of them. The craters are named after ancient weapons,&lt;ref name=Marsset2020/&gt;

== Satellites ==
A small moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from 29 May 1978. In 1980, [[speckle interferometry]] suggested a much larger satellite, whose existence was later refuted a few years later with occultation data.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-11&quot;/&gt;

== Exploration ==
Pallas has not been visited by spacecraft. A flyby after the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' probe's visits to [[4 Vesta]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]] was discussed but was not possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCB-22&quot;/&gt; The proposed [[Athena (spacecraft)|''Athena'']] SmallSat mission would have been launched in 2022 as a secondary payload of the [[Psyche (spacecraft)|''Psyche'' mission]] and travel on separate trajectory to a [[Flyby (spaceflight)|flyby]] encounter with 2 Pallas,&lt;ref name=&quot;FRB-20190310&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Dorminey |first=Bruce |title=Proposed NASA SmallSat Mission Could Be First To Visit Pallas, Our Third Largest Asteroid |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2019/03/10/proposed-nasa-smallsat-mission-could-be-first-to-visit-pallas-our-third-largest-asteroid |date=10 March 2019 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=10 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Rourke LPSC 2019'&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/2225.pdf Athena: the first-ever encounter of (2) Pallas with a Smallsat.] J.

The [[1999 Estonian parliamentary election|1999 Parliamentary election]], with a 5% threshold and no electoral cartel allowed, resulted in a disaster for the Coalition Party, which achieved only seven seats together with two of its smaller allies. Estonian Ruralfolk Party, which participated the election on its own list, obtained seven seats as well.

The programme of Mart Laar's government was signed by Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, the Moderates, and the People's Party. The latter two merged soon after, so Mart Laar's second government is widely known as ''Kolmikliit'', or the Tripartite coalition. Notwithstanding the different political orientation of the ruling parties, the coalition stayed united until Laar resigned in December 2001, after the Reform Party had broken up the same coalition in Tallinn municipality, making opposition leader [[Edgar Savisaar]] the new mayor of Tallinn. After the resignation of Laar, the Reform Party and Estonian Centre Party formed a coalition that lasted until the next parliamentary election, in 2003.

The Moderates joined with the People's Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People's Party Moderates.

=== Rüütel presidency and Siim Kallas government (2001–2002) ===
In fall 2001 [[Arnold Rüütel]] became the President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down. On 28 January 2002, the new government was formed from a coalition of the centre-right Estonian Reform Party and the more left wing Centre Party, with [[Siim Kallas]] from the [[Reform Party of Estonia]] as [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name=deadlock&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2812233.stm | title = Deadlock in Estonia election | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | date = 3 March 2003 | work = [[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Estonia joined the [[NATO]] defense alliance.

=== Juhan Parts government (2003) ===
Following [[2003 Estonian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in 2003, the seats were allocated as follows (the [[Estonian United People's Party|United People's Party]] failed to meet the 5% threshold):
*[[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]] 28,
*[[Union for the Republic - Res Publica|Res Publica]] 28,
*[[Estonian Reform Party|Reform Party]] 19,
*[[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] 13,
*[[Pro Patria Union]] 7,
*[[People's Party Moderates]] 6

[[Voter turnout]] was higher than expected at 58%.&lt;ref name=popular&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/3/3/latest/10540Centerlef&amp;sec=latest | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604015542/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2003%2F3%2F3%2Flatest%2F10540Centerlef&amp;sec=latest | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | title = Center-left party wins popular vote in Estonia | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | date = 3 March 2003 | work = [[TheStar.com]] | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party.&lt;ref name=hung&gt;{{cite news | title = Election leaves hung parliament | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | page = 9 | date = 3 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats.&lt;ref name=reeling&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/world/world-briefing-europe-estonia-leftists-reeling-after-election.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FE%2FElections | title = World Briefing Europe: Estonia: Leftists Reeling After Election | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | date = 4 March 2003 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | first=Michael | last=Wines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government.&lt;ref name=deadlock/&gt;&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite news | title = The World This Week | newspaper = [[The Economist]] | page = 8 | date = 8 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that they should get the chance to try and form the next government,&lt;ref name=close&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rferl.org/Content/Article/1102385.html | title = Estonia: Two Parties Want To Form Government After Close Election | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | date = 3 March 2003 | publisher = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090217002511/http://www.rferl.org/content/Article/1102385.html | archivedate = 17 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ruling out any deal between themselves.&lt;ref name=quandary&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2815367.stm | title = Estonia quandary after split vote | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | date = 3 March 2003 | work = [[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Rüütel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government.&lt;ref name=quandary/&gt; On 2 April he invited the leader of the Res Publica party, [[Juhan Parts]], to form a government,&lt;ref name=riigikogu&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2105_03.htm | title = Estonia: parliamentary elections Riigikogu, 2003 | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after negotiations a coalition government composed of Res Publica, the Reform Party and the [[People's Union of Estonia]] was formed on 10 April.&lt;ref name=riigikogu/&gt;

On 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the [[European Union]]. With 64% of the electorate turning out, the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.

In February 2004 the People's Party Moderates renamed themselves the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party of Estonia]].

On 8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists' &quot;no&quot; stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in the Riigikogu. Social-liberals had eight seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties.

===Andrus Ansip government (2004)===
On 24 March Prime Minister [[Juhan Parts]] announced his resignation following a vote of [[no confidence]] in the Riigikogu against [[Ministry of Justice (Estonia)|Minister of Justice]] [[Ken-Marti Vaher]], which was held on 21 March. The result was 54 pro (Social Democrats, Social Liberals, People's Union, Pro Patria Union and Reform Party) with no against or neutral MPs. 32 MPs (Res Publica and Centre Party) did not take part.

On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel nominated Reform party leader [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister designate and asked him to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new [[Andrus Ansip's cabinet|cabinet]], on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the [[Russian Federation]] in Moscow. The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because the Riigikogu had attached a preambule to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is the focus of European-level discussions.

On 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on 4 June by both parties in Pärnu. The joined party name is Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit ([[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]]).

=== 2007 elections ===
The [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] have shown an improvement in the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]] lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, at the expense of the agrarian [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] which lost 6. The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn [[Edgar Savisaar]], has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s [[United Russia]] party, real estate scandals in Tallinn,&lt;ref name=&quot;savisaarrealestate&quot;&gt;[https://archive.today/20120728210611/http://www.delfi.ee/archive/article.php?id=11378593 Savisaar's and Kruuda's mutual gifts]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bronze Soldier]] controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;splitter&quot;&gt;[http://postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php Lõhestaja number üks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120354/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php |date=6 October 2007 }} Postimees&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.&lt;ref name=presseurop/&gt;

=== Estonia and the European Union ===
On 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the [[European Union]]. With 64% of the electorate turning out the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.

In its [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|first European Parliament elections in 2004]], [[Estonia (European Parliament constituency)|Estonia]] elected three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] (PES), while the governing [[Res Publica Party]] and [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] polled poorly, not being able to gain any of the other three MEP posts. The [[voter turnout]] in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries, at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.

The [[2009 European Parliament election|European Parliament election of 2009 in Estonia]] scored a 43.9% turnout – about 17.1% higher than during the [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|previous election]], and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: two of them were won by the [[Estonian Centre Party]]. [[Estonian Reform Party]], [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]], [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] and an independent candidate [[Indrek Tarand]] (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.

On 1 January 2011 Estonia adopted the [[euro]]. The enlargement of the [[eurozone]] was hailed as a good sign in a period of global financial crisis. However, the government cut down public service salaries; the only opposition, in the absence of organised unions, came from Estonian teachers, whose salary cuts were therefore limited.&lt;ref name=presseurop&gt;[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/478531-most-soviet-western-state PressEurope] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129204200/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/478531-most-soviet-western-state |date=29 January 2011 }}, 26 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The 150th Jubilee of the Estonian Song Festival — Laulipidu 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Estonian Song Festival]] in Tallinn in 2019]]
[[Estonian euro coins]] entered circulation on 1 January 2011. Estonia was the fifth of ten states that joined the EU in 2004, and the first ex-Soviet republic to join the [[eurozone]]. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design. It originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply when [[Slovenia]] did, and officially changed its target date to 1 January 2008, and later, to 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Alcohol and tobacco tax to rise in Estonia next year| url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Alcohol+and+tobacco+tax+to+rise+in+Estonia+next+year/1135227499218| newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat| date=25 May 2007| accessdate=1 January 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615201438/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Alcohol+and+tobacco+tax+to+rise+in+Estonia+next+year/1135227499218| archivedate=15 June 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2010 the [[European Commission]] announced that Estonia had met all criteria to join the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Estonia ready for euro| url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/economy/100512_1_en.htm| publisher=European Commission| date=12 May 2010| accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June 2010, the EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ Estonia to Join Euro 1 January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611052826/http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ |date=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2010, Estonia received the final approval from the ECOFIN to adopt the euro as from 1 January 2011. On the same date the exchange rate at which the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]] would be exchanged for the euro (€1 = 15.6466 krooni) was also announced. On 20 July 2010, mass production of Estonian euro coins began in the [[Mint of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eurocollection.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a member of the eurozone, NATO and the European Union, Estonia is the most integrated in Western European organizations of all [[Nordic states]].

[[Estonia–Russia relations]] remain tense. According to the [[Estonian Internal Security Service]], [[Russian influence operations in Estonia]] form a complex system of financial, political, economic and espionage activities in the [[Republic of Estonia]] for the purposes of influencing Estonia's political and economic decisions in ways considered favourable to the [[Russian Federation]] and conducted under the sphere-of-influence doctrine known as ''[[near abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kapo.ee/yearbook_2006_ENG.pdf| publisher=[[Estonian Security Police]]| title=Ninth Annual (2006) of the Security Police Board}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centre for Geopolitical Studies]], the Russian information campaign, which the centre characterises as a &quot;real mud-throwing&quot; exercise, had provoked a split in Estonian society amongst Russian speakers, inciting some to riot over the relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier of Tallinn]], a [[cenotaph]] commemorating the soldiers killed in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Denisenko | first=Viktor | title=Information War: Invention or a current reality? | url=http://www.geopolitika.lt/?artc=877 | date=13 June 2007 | publisher=Centre for Geopolitical Studies | accessdate=2009-08-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150617/http://www.geopolitika.lt/?artc=877 | archive-date=22 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia regarded the [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia]] as an information operation intended to influence the decisions and actions of the Estonian government. While Russia denied any direct involvement in the attacks, hostile rhetoric in the media from the political elite influenced people to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Rain Ottis, ''Analysis of the 2007 Cyber Attacks Against Estonia from the Information Warfare Perpectve'', Proceedings of the 7th European Conference on Information Warfare, Academic Conferences Limited&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2007 cyber-attacks, the [[NATO]] Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence ([[CCDCOE]]) was established in Tallinn.

Year '''380''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLXXX]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Augustus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1133 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 380 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

__NOTOC__
Year '''377''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLXXVII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Merobaudes''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1130 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 377 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==== Roman Empire ====
* [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic War]]: [[Famine]] in [[Moesia|Lower Moesia]] (occupied by the [[Goths]]) takes a fearsome toll. [[Fritigern]] and his followers appeal for help, but the governors [[Lupicinus (Roman)|Lupicinus]] and [[Maximus of Moesia|Maximus]] regard them as second-class citizens. Little help is forthcoming, and thousands [[Starvation|starve]] to death. The pressure on the Roman frontier is still severe, with the [[Taifals|Taifali]] and other hostile bands of [[Goths]] on the [[Danube]]. In addition, groups of [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] have also moved up to the river.
* Emperor [[Valens]] requests his nephew [[Gratian]] to send Roman troops against the Goths. He responds by sending the ageing General [[Frigeridus (general)|Frigeridus]] with elite reinforcements that [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] calls ‘Pannonian and Transalpine [[auxiliaries]] (''Pannonicis et Transalpinis auxiliis'').’ Gratian sends also [[Richomeres]], his Frankish commander of household troops (''[[Comes|comes domesticorum]]''), at the head of a number of troops drawn from the Gallic field army. 
* [[Battle of the Willows]]: The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] abandon the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] strategy and are attacked by the Goths. The battle is indecisive but both sides suffer heavy casualties. The only [[Late Roman army|Roman army]] available to face the Goths is no longer a fighting force. Richomeres withdraws his troops south of [[Marcianopolis|Marcianople]] ([[Bulgaria]]).
* Valens sends [[Saturninus (consul 383)|Saturninus]] (''[[Master of the horse]]'') to the [[Balkan Mountains]] to block the passes. These efforts are possibly supported by units of ''[[limitanei]]'' ([[light infantry]]) withdrawn from areas under Goth control. Split into small bands and unable to join the [[Thervingi|Tervingi]] in sufficient strength to overcome the Roman cordon, the Goths grow increasingly desperate.
* The Goths (possibly [[Greuthungi]]) make an alliance with some of the Huns and Alans along the Danube, and entice them across the river. With the balance of power now shifted Saturninus concentrates his forces to avoid his outposts being overrun. This opens the passes, allowing the Goths, Huns and Alans to break out into the lowlands of southern [[Thrace]].
* Autumn &amp;ndash; Bands of predatory &quot;barbarians&quot; spread throughout the province in search of [[food]], supplies and booty. Most Roman troops are bottled up in the towns. Some elite units remain in the field and [[Skirmisher|skirmish]] with the Goths. One such action takes place outside the town of [[Burgas|Dibaltum]]. The Scutarii heavy cavalry is destroyed in a mad charge against the Goths.
* The Goths, now seeking a military victory to force the Empire to make terms, aim to dislodge the army of Frigeridus from [[Stara Zagora|Beroea]]. He withdraws over the Succi ([[Ihtiman]]) Pass back to [[Diocese of Pannonia|Illyrium]], and reports to Gratian that an expedition by the main imperial armies is required to repulse the Goths in Thrace. 
* Valens concludes a peace with the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]] and leaves enough troops to defend the eastern frontier. The [[Saracen]]s  under Queen [[Mavia (queen)|Mavia]] revolt and devastate a swath of territory stretching from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as far as the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] ([[Egypt]]). Valens successfully brings the uprising under control.
* Gratian declares [[Heresy|heretics]] to be enemies of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==== Persia ====
* Persian king [[Shapur II]] pushes the Huns back across the [[Caucasus]].

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* [[November 17]] &amp;ndash; Emperor [[Valentinian I]] concludes an enduring peace with the [[Alamanni]] in [[Germany]], then marches into [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] to repel an invasion of the [[Quadi]] and the [[Sarmatians]] on the  [[Danube]] frontier. While negotiating with the Quadi, Valentinian, age 54, becomes so [[Rage (emotion)|enraged]] that he dies in a fit of [[apoplexy]] at [[Szőny|Brigetio]] ([[Hungary]]). Extreme cruelty has marked his 11-year reign, but he has also founded schools and provided [[physician]]s to serve the poor of [[Constantinople]]. 
* The Quadi accept an uneasy peace from [[Merobaudes (magister peditum)|Merobaudes]] (''[[Magister militum]]''), which gives them land to settle on the Danube.
* [[Gratian]], age 16, takes over the government at ''[[Augusta Treverorum]]'' (modern [[Trier]]), but ministers wishing to retain the loyalty of the Illyrian army fear a [[Roman usurper|usurper]]. They proclaim Valentinian's 4-year-old son [[Valentinian II]] co-emperor with his mother, [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], as [[regent]]. Gratian reserves for himself the administration of the Gallic [[Roman province|provinces]], and hands over [[Italy]], Illyrium, [[Hispania]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] to his stepmother, who makes ''[[Mediolanum]]'' ([[Milan]]) her residence.
* Gratian, advised by his chief advisor [[Ambrose|Ambrosius]], begins a systematic persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]]. He confiscates the fortunes of the [[Roman temple|temples]] and adds the money to the [[Imperial treasury, Rome|Imperial Treasury]]. He proscribes [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].
* In Africa, the dissident [[Berber people|Berber]] prince [[Firmus (4th century usurper)|Firmus]] is delivered to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] by his brother Gildon.

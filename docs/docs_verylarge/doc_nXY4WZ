====Canada====

The second generation Hyundai Pony was available for sale in Canada starting with the 1984 model year. The Canadian Pony differed from its European counterparts by having 8&amp;nbsp;km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps, and slightly different instrumentation and interor trim. Sales projections for 1984 called for 5,000 Ponys, but actual sales were closer to 25,000, making the Pony one of Canada's best selling cars that year. A lesser known model, also sold in Canada, was the Hyundai Stellar. Both models were available until 1987, when they were replaced by the Excel.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In 1989, '''Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.''' opened a stamping and assembly plant in [[Bromont, Quebec]], employing 800. The plant cost $387.7&amp;nbsp;million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt01&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Hyundai Motor México entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the [[Hyundai Grand i10]], the [[Hyundai Elantra]], and the [[Hyundai ix35]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.autocosmos.com.mx/2014/04/25/hyundai-llega-a-mexico-te-decimos-todo-lo-que-hay-que-saber|title=Hyundai llega a México, te decimos todo lo que hay que saber|author=Rubén Hoyo|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the [[Hyundai Sonata]] joined the lineup.

According to the newspaper ''The Chosun Ilbo'', the reason for Hyundai's failure in the car market was due to the company's inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor [[Bae Yong-joon]] was hired to endorse the mid-sized [[Hyundai Sonata|Sonata]] in Japan to appeal to the mature housewives who watch ''[[Winter Sonata]]''. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars. In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;english.chosun.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/11/27/2006112761009.html |title=Why Hyundai Failed to Conquer Japan |newspaper=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2019-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====

Hyundai entered the country in the early 1990s, selling the [[Hyundai Grace]] van and the [[Hyundai Excel]] for the Filipino market.

Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc. (HARI), is currently the official distributor of Hyundai passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the Philippines, they were appointed by Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea in August 2001 as the official distributor of Hyundai vehicles in the Philippines. It has earned its spot as the third top player in the Philippine automotive industry. There are currently 42 dealerships around the country. Locally assembled Hyundai models consist of the [[Hyundai H350]] and the [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] vans, all undergo final assembly at Hyundai's Assembly Center (HAC), located at [[Santa Rosa, Laguna]].

Light commercial vehicles remain one of HARI's key sources of growth, growing by 50.2% from 5,119 units sold last year to 7,690 units this year. This growth has been attributed to the sales of the Kona, Santa Fe, and the H100. HARI sold a total of 3,163 units in December 2019 from 3,074-unit sales in the same month in 2018. The overall growth was supported by the 8.51-percent increase in sales of passenger cars last month, selling a total of 1,645 units compared to December 2018's sales of 1,516 units. Hyundai's sales of passenger cars in the Philippine market declined by 33 percent to 967 units in January 2020 from 1,443 units a year ago. Light commercial vehicle sales likewise fell by 19.9 percent to 1,053 units last January from 1,315 units sold in the same month of 2019. This is due to the [[2020 Taal Volcano eruption]] and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

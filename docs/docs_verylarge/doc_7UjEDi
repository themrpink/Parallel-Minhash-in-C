Ford is vice-chair of [[Conservation International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/29/harrison-ford-environmentalist/ |title=Harrison Ford: There are no great movies on global environmental issues |work=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502021322/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/29/harrison-ford-environmentalist/ |archivedate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American nonprofit [[environmental organization]] headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].

In September 2013, Ford, while filming an [[Environmentalism|environmental]] documentary in [[Indonesia]], interviewed the Indonesian [[Forestry]] Minister, [[Zulkifli Hasan]]. After the interview, Ford and his crew were accused of &quot;harassing state institutions&quot; and publicly threatened with [[deportation]]. Questions within the interview concerned the [[Tesso Nilo National Park]], [[Sumatra]]. It was alleged the Minister of Forestry was given no prior warning of questions nor the chance to explain the challenges of catching people with [[illegal logging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/indonesian-minister-shocked-at-harrison-ford-climate-interview/4949316 |title=Harrison Ford Shocks Indonesian Minister with Heated Climate Interview |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/harrison-ford-upsets-indonesian-minister-with-rude-interview-20130911-2tiwc.html |title=Harrison Ford Upsets Indonesian Minister with 'Rude' Interview |authorlink1=Michael Bachelard|first=Michael |last=Bachelard |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 11, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/09/fm-bemoans-harrison-ford-s-attitude.html |title=FM Bemoans Harrison Ford's Attitude |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=September 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/10/harrison-ford-environment-indonesia_n_3899141.html |title=Harrison Ford's Environment Documentary Questions 'Shocked' Indonesian Forestry Minister |website=Huffington Post |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was provided an audience with the Indonesian President, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], during which he expressed concerns regarding Indonesia's environmental degradation and the government efforts to address climate change. In response, the President explained Indonesia's commitment to preserving its oceans and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/10/harrison-ford-interview-indonesia-president_n_3900670.html |title=Harrison Ford Interviews Indonesia President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono On Environment |date=September 10, 2013 |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912045640/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/10/harrison-ford-interview-indonesia-president_n_3900670.html |archivedate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/sep/10/harrison-ford-indonesia-president-discuss-climate/ |title=Harrison Ford, Indonesia President Discuss Climate |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[arachnology|arachnologist]] Norman Platnick named a new species of spider ''[[Calponia harrisonfordi]]'', and in 2002, the [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Edward O. Wilson]] named a new [[ant]] species ''[[Pheidole harrisonfordi]]'' (in recognition of Harrison's work as Vice Chairman of [[Conservation International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.ourplanet.com/imgversn/142/ford.html|title=Harrison Ford|publisher=Our Planet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905144851/http://www.ourplanet.com/imgversn/142/ford.html|archive-date=September 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, Ford has lent his voice to a series of public service messages promoting environmental involvement for EarthShare, an American federation of environmental and conservation charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 27, 2017|url=http://www.earthshare.org/2008/10/earthshare-psa.html|title=EarthShare PSA: &quot;Promises&quot;|work=Earthshare |date=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has acted as a spokesperson for [[Restore Hetch Hetchy]], a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring [[Yosemite National Park]]'s [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] to its original condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 16, 2013 |url=http://www.hetchhetchy.org/educational-activities/46-discover-hetch-hetchy |title=Discover Hetch Hetchy with Harrison Ford Preview |publisher=Restore Hetch Hetchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119055037/http://www.hetchhetchy.org/educational-activities/46-discover-hetch-hetchy |archivedate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford also appears in the documentary series ''[[Years of Living Dangerously]]'', which reports on people affected by and seeking solutions to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/ |title=Years Of Living Dangerously |work=yearsoflivingdangerously.com |year=2015 |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, on behalf of Conservation International, Ford gave an impassioned speech during the United Nations' Climate Action Summit in New York on the destruction of the [[Amazon rainforest]] and its effect on climate change for the rest of the world. Ford urged his audience to listen to 'angry young people' trying to make a difference in the situation, emphasizing, &quot;The most important thing we can do for them is to get the hell out of their way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plantbasednews.org/news/harrison-ford-angry-young-people-save-planet|title=Ford at 2019 UN Climate Summit|website=plantbasednews.org|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Like his parents, Ford is a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.newsmeat.com/ |title=2008 Presidential Donor Watch |publisher=Newsmeat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205031655/http://newsmeat.com/ |archivedate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1995, Ford testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] in support of the [[Dalai Lama]] and an independent [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalailamafilm.com/celebrities-and-others-banned-from-entering-tibet-or-china-109 |author=Khashyar Darvich | title = Celebrities and others banned from entering Tibet or China |publisher=Dalailamafilm.com |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Caracalla, ''Harrison Ford'', Silverback Books, 2007 p.93&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he narrated the documentary ''[[Dalai Lama Renaissance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dalailamafilm.com/ &quot;Official Site of Dalai Lama Renaissance&quot;], ''dalailamafilm.com'', Retrieved November 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he publicly condemned the [[Iraq War]] and called for &quot;regime change&quot; in the [[United States]]. He also criticized [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for making movies which were &quot;more akin to video games than stories about human life and relationships&quot;, and he called for more [[gun control]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/27/1061663852052.html|title=Harrison Ford blasts US Iraq policy|work=The Age |date=August 27, 2003 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] said his favorite role of Ford's was ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' because he &quot;stood up for America&quot;, Ford reasoned that it was just a film and made critical statements against [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Trump's presidential bid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/entertainment/harrison-ford-donald-trump-air-force-one-feat/|title=Harrison Ford has a fan in Trump|date=December 11, 2015|first=Melonyce|last=McAfee|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/harrison-ford-reminds-donald-trump-air-force-one-was-only-t61036|title=Harrison Ford reminds Donald Trump that 'Air Force One' was only a movie|first=Randee|last=Dawn|date=December 11, 2015|publisher=today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Following on his success portraying the archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]], Ford also plays a part in supporting the work of professional [[archaeologists]]. He serves as a General Trustee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 7, 2010|url=http://www.archaeological.org/about/governance|title=About the AIA|publisher=[[Archaeological Institute of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Governing Board of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (AIA), North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archaeology. Ford assists them in their mission of increasing public awareness of archaeology and preventing looting and the [[Antiquities trade#Illicit trade|illegal antiquities trade]].

===''Star Wars'': Force for Change===
Ford participated in a ''Star Wars'' promotion geared toward fans who donated to [[Star Wars: Force for Change|''Star Wars'': Force for Change]] on [[video call]] which offered them the opportunity to purchase tickets to the premiere of ''The Force Awakens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/11/19/harrison-ford-force-change-charity-video/|title=Harrison Ford surprises 'Star Wars' fans in new Force For Change charity video|date=November 19, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-harrison-ford-force-change-video/|title=Star Wars: Harrison Ford Surprises Fans in New Force for Change Video|date=November 19, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a rather shallow [[Continental shelf|shelf]] sea, with an average depth of {{convert|230|m|ft}}, and it is an important site for both [[fishing]] and [[hydrocarbon exploration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;O. G. Austvik, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Barents Sea is bordered by the [[Kola Peninsula]] to the south, the shelf edge towards the [[Norwegian Sea]] to the west, and the [[archipelago]]s of [[Svalbard]] to the northwest, [[Franz Josef Land]] to the northeast and [[Novaya Zemlya]] to the east. The islands of Novaya Zemlya, an extension of the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]], separate the Barents Sea from the [[Kara Sea]].

Although part of the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea has been characterised as &quot;turning into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]&quot; because of its status as &quot;the Arctic warming hot spot.&quot; Hydrologic changes due to [[global warming]] have led to a reduction in sea ice and in stratification of the water column, which could produce major changes in weather in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/06/26/a-huge-stretch-of-the-arctic-ocean-is-turning-into-the-atlantic-right-before-our-eyes/|title=A huge stretch of the Arctic Ocean is rapidly turning into the Atlantic.

==Geography==
[[Image:Tabularussiae.jpg|thumb|250px|Shores of the Barents (''Murman'') Sea. From &quot;Tabula Russiae&quot;, Joan Blaeu's, Amsterdam, 1614.]]
The southern half of the Barents Sea, including the ports of [[Murmansk]] (Russia) and [[Vardø (town)|Vardø]] (Norway) remain [[ice]]-free year round due to the warm [[North Atlantic drift]].  In September, the entire Barents Sea is more or less completely ice-free.  Until the [[Winter War]] (1939–40), [[Finland]]'s territory also reached to the Barents Sea. Its harbor at [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] was Finland's only ice-free winter harbor.

There are three main types of [[water mass]]es in the Barents Sea: Warm, salty [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] water (temperature &gt;3&amp;nbsp;°C, [[salinity]] &gt;35) from the [[North Atlantic drift]]; cold Arctic water (temperature &lt;0&amp;nbsp;°C, salinity &lt;35) from the north; and warm, but not very salty, coastal water (temperature &gt;3&amp;nbsp;°C, salinity &lt;34.7). Between the Atlantic and Polar waters, a front called the Polar Front is formed.  In the western parts of the sea (close to [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]]), this front is determined by the bottom topography and is therefore relatively sharp and stable from year to year, while in the east (towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]), it can be quite diffuse and its position can vary markedly between years.

==Geology==
{{see also|White Sea Rift System}}
The Barents Sea was originally formed from two major continental collisions: the [[Caledonian orogeny]], in which the [[Baltica]] and [[Laurentia]] collided to form [[Laurasia]], and a subsequent collision between Laurasia and Western Siberia.  Most of its geological history is dominated by [[extensional tectonics]], caused by the collapse of the Caledonian and Uralian orogenic belts and the break-up of [[Pangaea]].&lt;ref name=Dore1995&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher= [[Arctic Institute of North America]] | url= http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-207.pdf | title = Barents Sea Geology, Petroleum Resources and Commercial Potential | issue = 3 | volume = 48 | author = Doré, A.G. | date = Sep 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events created the major rift basins that dominate the Barents Shelf, along with various [[Platform (geology)|platforms]] and structural highs.  The later geological history of the Barents Sea is dominated by Late Cenozoic [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]], particularly that caused by [[Quaternary glaciation]], which has resulted in erosion and deposition of significant sediment.&lt;ref name=Dore1996&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher= [[Global and Planetary Change]] | title = Impact of Glaciations on Basin Evolution: Data and Models from the Norwegian Margin and Adjacent Areas | issue = 1–4 | volume = 12 | author = Doré, A.G. | date = March 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[Image:Barents Sea in Bloom.jpg|thumb|Phytoplankton bloom in the Barents Sea. The milky-blue colour that dominates the bloom suggests that it contains large numbers of [[coccolithophores]].]]
Due to the [[North Atlantic drift]], the Barents Sea has a high biological production compared to other oceans of similar latitude.  The [[spring bloom]] of [[phytoplankton]] can start quite early near the ice edge, because the fresh water from the melting ice makes up a stable water layer on top of the sea water. The [[phytoplankton]] bloom feeds [[zooplankton]] such as ''Calanus finmarchicus'', ''Calanus glacialis'', ''Calanus hyperboreus'', ''Oithona'' spp., and [[krill]]. The [[zooplankton]] feeders include young [[Atlantic cod|cod]], [[capelin]], [[polar cod]], [[whales]], and [[little auk]]. The capelin is a key food for top predators such as the north-east Arctic [[Atlantic cod|cod]], [[harp seal]]s, and seabirds such as [[common guillemot]] and [[Brunnich's guillemot]].  The fisheries of the Barents Sea, in particular the [[Atlantic cod|cod]] fisheries, are of great importance for both Norway and Russia.

SIZEX-89 was an international winter experiment in 1989 for which the main objectives were to perform sensor signature studies of different ice types in order to develop SAR algorithms for ice variables, such as ice types, ice concentrations and ice kinematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;''Sea ice modeling in the Barents Sea during SIZEX 89'' (Haugan, P.M., Johannessen, O.M. and Sandven, S., IGARSS´90 symposium, Washington D.C., 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Although previous research suggested that predation by whales may be the cause of depleting fish stocks, more recent research suggests that marine mammal consumption has only a trivial influence on fisheries. A model assessing the effects of fisheries and climate was far more accurate at describing trends in fish abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Corkeron | first = Peter J. | date = April 23, 2009 | title = Marine mammals' influence on ecosystem processes affecting fisheries in the Barents Sea is trivial | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 204–206 | publisher = [[Royal Society|The Royal Society]] | issn = 1744-957X | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2008.0628 | pmid = 19126534 | pmc = 2665811}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a genetically distinct [[polar bear]] population associated with the Barents Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_d&quot;&gt;C.M.

==History==
[[File:Walvisvangst bij de kust van Spitsbergen - Dutch whalers near Spitsbergen (Abraham Storck, 1690).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch whalers near [[Svalbard]], 1690]]

===Name===
The Barents Sea was formerly known to Russians as '''Murmanskoye More''', or the &quot;Sea of Murmans&quot; (i.e., their term for Norwegians). It appears with this name in sixteenth-century maps, including [[Gerard Mercator]]'s ''Map of the Arctic'' published in his 1595 atlas. Its eastern corner, in the region of the [[Pechora River]]'s estuary, has been known as '''Pechorskoye Morye''', that is, [[Pechora Sea]].

This sea was given its present name by Europeans in honor of [[Willem Barentsz]], a Dutch navigator and explorer. Barentsz was the leader of early expeditions to the far north, at the end of the sixteenth century.

The Barents Sea has been called by sailors &quot;''The Devil's Dance Floor''&quot; due to its unpredictability and difficulty level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/warming-to-cap-art-4559364|title=Warming to cap art|last=Administrator|first=journallive|date=2006-08-15|work=journallive|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ocean rowers call it &quot;''Devil's Jaw''&quot;. In 2017, after the first recorded complete man-powered crossing of the Barents Sea from [[Tromsø]] to [[Longyearbyen]] in a row boat by Polar Row expedition, captain [[Fiann Paul]] was asked by [[TV 2 (Norway)|Norwegian TV2]] how a rower would name the Barents Sea. Fiann responded that he would name it &quot;Devil's Jaw&quot;, adding that the winds you constantly battle are like breath from the devil's nostrils while he holds you in his jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tv2.no/a/9269125/|title=Tor (36) nådde Svalbard på supertid, this is the link to the news summary, full video news was broadcast on 29 July in the News section, available on youtube|last=AS|first=TV 2|work=TV 2|access-date=2017-10-05|language=no-nb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
Seabed mapping was completed in 1933; the first full map was produced by Russian marine geologist [[Maria Klenova]].

The Barents Sea was the site of a notable [[World War II]] engagement, a German surface raiding attack on a British merchant convoy, which later became known as the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]]. Under the command of [[Oskar Kummetz]], the German warships sank minelayer HMS ''Bramble'' and destroyer {{HMS|Achates|H12|6}}, but lost destroyer {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, and {{Ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} was severely damaged by British gunfire. The Germans later retreated and the British convoy arrived safely at Murmansk shortly afterwards.

During the [[Cold War]], the [[Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet]] used the southern reaches of the sea as a ballistic missile submarine [[bastion (naval)|bastion]], a strategy that [[Russia]] continues. [[Nuclear waste|Nuclear contamination]] from dumped Russian naval [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] is an [[natural environment|environmental]] concern in the Barents Sea.

===Political status===
{{further|Norway–Russia border}}
[[File:Signing of the Russian-Norwegian Treaty on Maritime Delimitation and Cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean..jpeg|thumb|Signing of the Russian-Norwegian Treaty, 15 September 2010]]
For decades there was a boundary dispute between Norway and Russia regarding the position of the boundary between their respective claims to the Barents Sea.  The Norwegians favoured a [[Equidistance principle|median line]], based on the [[Convention on the High Seas|Geneva Convention of 1958]], whereas the Russians favoured a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]- based sector line, based on a Soviet decision of 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dore1995&quot;/&gt;  A neutral &quot;grey&quot; zone between the competing claims had an area of 175,000 sq.km, which is approximately 12% of the total area of the Barents Sea.  The two countries started negotiations on the location of the boundary in 1974, and agreed to a moratorium on hydrocarbon exploration in 1976.

Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2010 Norway and Russia signed an agreement that placed the boundary equidistant from their competing claims. This was ratified and went into force on 7 July 2011, opening the grey zone for [[hydrocarbon exploration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mt20110707&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/arctic-treaty-with-norway-opens-fields/440178.html |title= Arctic Treaty With Norway Opens Fields |first=Howard |last=Amos |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=7 July 2011 |access-date=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas===
{{further|List of oil and gas fields of the Barents Sea}}

Encouraged by the success of oil exploration and production in the [[North Sea oil|North Sea in the 1960s]], Norway began [[hydrocarbon exploration]] in the Barents Sea in 1969.  They acquired seismic reflection surveys through the following years, which were analysed to understand the location of the main [[sedimentary basin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dore1995&quot;/&gt; [[Statoil|NorskHydro]] drilled the first [[Oil well|well]] in 1980, which was a dry hole, and the first discoveries were made the following year: the Alke and Askeladden gas fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dore1995&quot;/&gt;  Several more discoveries were made on the Norwegian side of the Barents Sea throughout the 1980s, including the important [[Snøhvit|Snøhvit field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OT1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Snøhvit Gas Field, Norway | publisher = Offshore Technology| url = http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/snohvit-field/ | access-date = 2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

But, interest in the area began to wane due to a succession of dry holes, wells containing only gas (which was cheap at the time), and the prohibitive costs of developing wells in such a remote area.  Interest in the area was reignited in the late 2000s, after the Snovhit field was finally brought into production&lt;ref name=&quot;Statoil1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Snøhvit |publisher = Statoil Website |url = http://www.statoil.com/en/ouroperations/explorationprod/ncs/snoehvit/pages/default.aspx |access-date = 2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two new large discoveries were made.&lt;ref name=tb20120110&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway Makes Its Second Huge Oil Discovery In The Past Year|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/norway-makes-its-second-huge-offshore-oil-discovery-of-the-year-2012-1|agency=Associated Press|date=January 9, 2012|quote=a well drilled in the Havis prospect in the Barents Sea proved both oil and gas at an estimated volume of between 200 million and 300 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

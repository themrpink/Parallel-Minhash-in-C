Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the [[Institute for Jazz, Graz|Institute for Jazz]] in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granda&quot;/&gt; For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]] archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granda&quot;/&gt;

A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the [[Graz Lyzeum|Lyzeum of Graz]] in July 1811 on the initiative of {{Interlanguage link multi|Janez Nepomuk Primic|sl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.srl.si/arhiv/2002-01/pdf/sumrada.pdf |title=Janez Nepomuk Primic in ustanovitev stolice za slovenski jezik na liceju v Gradcu 1811 |language=sl |trans-title=Janez Nepomuk Primic and the Establishment of the Chair of Slovene at the ''Lyzeum'' in Graz in 1811 |journal=Slavistična revija [Journal of Slavic Linguistics] |volume=50 |date=January–March 2002 |issue=1 |issn=1855-7570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of lectures on the topic was published.

For the year that Graz was [[Cultural Capital of Europe]], new structures were erected. The [[Kunsthaus Graz|Graz Museum of Contemporary Art]] (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]] and [[Colin Fournier]] and is situated next to the Mur river. The [[Murinsel|Island in the Mur]] is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect [[Vito Acconci]] and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.

=== Historic city centre ===
{{main|Innere Stadt (Graz)}}
[[File:Grazer Schlossberg Kriegssteig.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg hill]] with clock tower]]
The historic centre was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] in 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;graz-sh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/|title=A Short History of the City|website=www.graz.at|publisher=Stadt Graz – Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit.|location=Graz|accessdate=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209042512/http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/|archive-date=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.

The most important sights in the historic centre are:
* Town Hall (Rathaus).
* The [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Castle hill]] (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre ({{convert|475|m|2|abbr=on}} high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.
* The Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.
* The New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.
* The [[Schloßbergbahn (Graz)|Castle hill funicular]] (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.
* The seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect [[Domenico dell'Allio]] between 1557 and 1565.
* The [[Landeszeughaus|Armoury]] (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.
* The [[Graz Opera|Graz Opera House]] (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.
* The Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.
* The [[Graz Cathedral|Cathedral]] (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the ''Landplagenbild'' (&quot;picture of plagues&quot;) painted in 1485, presumably by [[Thomas von Villach]]. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.
* The mausoleum of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] next to the cathedral, the most important building of [[Mannerism]] in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.
* The Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.
* The Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).
* The [[Kunsthaus Graz|Museum of Contemporary Art Graz]] (Kunsthaus)
* The [[Murinsel|Island in the Mur]] (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.
* Buildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the ''Former House of Teutonic Knights'' in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.

=== Outside the historic city centre ===
[[File:Graz Schloss Eggenberg front facade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Eggenberg Palace]]]]
* [[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Eggenberg Palace]] (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.
* The [[Mariatrost Basilica]] (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.
* The [[Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Graz)|Jesus's Heart Church]] (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style.
* The Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the Gösting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.
* The Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in [[Austria]]. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.
* Best viewpoints for vistas of the city are the [[Gösting Castle|Gösting Ruin]] (Ruine Gösting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/Fürstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower, as well as [[Buchkogel (Plabutsch)|Buchkogel]]/Kronprinz-Rudolf-Warte.

=== Greater Graz area ===
* '''Österreichisches Freilichtmuseum Stübing''', an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.
* '''[[Lurgrotte]]''', the most extensive cave system in Austria.
* '''[[Piber_Federal_Stud|Lipizzanergestüt Piber]]''', [[Lipizzaner]] stud at [[Piber]] where the famous horses are bred.
* The '''Steirische Weinstraße''' is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the &quot;Styrian Tuscany&quot;.
* '''Thermenregion''', spa region east of Graz.
* '''[[Riegersburg Castle]]''', a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions

==Politics==
[[File:Gemeindesrat of Graz elections, 1945-2017.png|thumb|400px|Elections from 1945 to 2017.]]
For much of its post-war history Graz was a stronghold of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ), but since the late 1990s the party has lost most of its support on a local level. It was overtaken by the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) in 2003, which has been the largest party in the city council (''Gemeindesrat'') ever since. With the decline of the SPÖ, the [[Communist Party of Austria]] (KPÖ) has become highly popular in Graz, despite its negligible presence on a national level. The party placed third with 20.8% of votes in the 2003 local election, which has been attributed to the popularity of local leader Ernest Kaltenegger. The party fell to 11.2% in 2008, but recovered under new leader Elke Kahr, becoming the second most popular party in Graz with 19.9% in 2012 and 20.3% in 2017. The KPÖ's popularity in Graz allowed them to enter to the Styrian state parliament in the [[2005 Styrian state election|2005 election]], marking their first appearance in a state parliament in 35 years; they have retained their seats in the subsequent 2010, 2015, and 2019 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/oesterreich-wuerschtl-statt-weltrevolution-12892839.html|title=Klutz instead of World Revolution|date=19 April 2014|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current mayor of Graz is [[Siegfried Nagl]] (ÖVP), who first took office in 2003.

===Sports===
[[SK Sturm Graz]] is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships and five runner-up seasons. The [[Grazer AK]] also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.

In ice hockey, the [[ATSE Graz]] was the [[Austrian Hockey League]] champion in 1975 and 1978. The [[EC Graz]] was runner-up in 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94. The [[Graz 99ers]] plays in first division since 2000.

[[UBSC Raiffeisen Graz]] plays in the [[Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga|Austrian Basketball League]].

The [[Graz Giants]] play in the [[Austrian Football League]] (American Football).

The city bid for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in 1995, but lost the election to [[Salt Lake City]]. Nowadays there is a plan to bid for the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] with some venues in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] to cut costs with using existing venues around national borders. It's still facing referendum, meaning usually the end for many former olympic bids in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] since 1970 -century.

=== Styriarte ===
Graz hosts the annual festival of classical music [[Styriarte]], founded in 1985 to tie conductor [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.

=== Dialect ===
Referred to as ''Steirisch'' by locals, Graz belongs to the [[Austro-Bavarian]] region of dialects, more specifically a mix of [[Central Bavarian]] in the western part of [[Styria]] and [[Southern Bavarian]] in the eastern part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steirische Sprache |url=https://www.steiermark.com/de/urlaub/kultur-in-stadt-und-land/volkskultur-brauchtum/steirische-sprache |website=Steiermark: Das offizielle Tourismusportal der Steiermark |publisher=Medieninhaber und Herausgeber sowie Dienstanbieter Steirische Tourismus GmbH |accessdate=July 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grazer [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called ''Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt'' in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with [[Standard German]]: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jontes |first1=Günther |title=Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt |url=http://static2.orf.at/vietnam2/files/stmkmagazin/200831/scho_wieda_steirisch_gredt_16997.pdf |website=ORF St Radio Steiermark |publisher=ORF Steiermark |accessdate=July 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
[[File:Tramway graz23.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Jakominiplatz]]]]
An extensive [[public transport]] network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the [[Trams in Graz|Graz tram network]] consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.

The [[Schlossbergbahn (Graz)|Schlossbergbahn]], a [[funicular railway]], and the [[Schlossberg lift]], a vertical lift, link the city centre to the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]].

From the central railway station ([[Graz Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]]), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] in [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] in [[Croatia]], [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Zürich]] in [[Switzerland]], as well as [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]]. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the &quot;S-Bahn Graz&quot;, a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.

[[Graz Airport|Graz airport]] is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, [[Düsseldorf]], Frankfurt, Munich, [[Stuttgart]], Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flughafen-graz.at/en/flug/flug-reiseinfo/destinationen.html|title=Flughafen Graz :: Destinations|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (''NEF – Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug''), two NAWs (''Notarztwagen'' – ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (''Rettungswagen'' – regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (''KTW – Krankentransportwagen'') and a [[Intensive care unit#Mobile intensive care unit|Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU)]] are operated by the [[Red Cross]] to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs), the Austrian organisation of the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (''Grünes Kreuz'') operate ambulances (''KTW'') for non-emergency patient transport.

The population of the [[Communes of France|commune]] of Grenoble was 158,180 at the 2016 census, while the population of the [[Grenoble metropolitan area]] (French: ''[[Urban area (France)|aire urbaine]] de Grenoble'' or &quot;agglomération grenobloise&quot;) was 687,985  which makes it the largest metropolis in the Alps, ahead of [[Innsbruck]] and [[Bolzano]]. The residents of the city are called &quot;Grenoblois&quot;. The many suburb communes that make up the rest of the metropolitan area include three with populations exceeding 20,000: [[Saint-Martin-d'Hères]], [[Échirolles]], [[Fontaine, Isère|Fontaine]] and [[Voiron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pop2017&quot;&gt;[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/fichier/4265429/ensemble.pdf Téléchargement du fichier d'ensemble des populations légales en 2017], [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/cog/aire-urbaine/AU2010010-grenoble Aire urbaine de Grenoble (010)], INSEE&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenoble's history goes back over 2,000 years, to a time when it was a small [[Gaul|Gallic]] village. It became the capital of the [[Dauphiné]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; This status, consolidated by the annexation to [[France]], allowed it to develop its economy. Grenoble then became a parliamentary and military city, close to the border with [[Savoy]].  Industrial development increased the prominence of Grenoble through several periods of economic expansion over the last three centuries. This started with a booming [[glove]] industry in the 18th and 19th centuries, continued with the development of a strong [[hydropower]] industry in the late 19th to early 20th centuries and ended with a post-[[World War II]] economic boom symbolized by the holding of the [[1968 Winter Olympics|X&amp;nbsp;Olympic Winter Games]] in 1968.

The city has grown to be one of Europe's most important research, technology and innovation centres, with one in five inhabitants working directly in these fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pentland&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya5M3mJzRFA|title=Université Grenoble Alpes : &quot;1 out of 5&quot; (english version)|last=Communauté Université Grenoble Alpes|date=23 April 2015|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grenoble is classified as a [[global city]] with the ranking of &quot;sufficiency&quot; by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Grenoble}}
{{for|the ecclesiastical history|Roman Catholic Diocese of Grenoble-Vienne}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Vestiges enceinte Cularo.JPG|thumb|left|Remnants of the Roman Walls]]
The first references to what is now Grenoble date back to 43&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Cularo]] was at that time a small [[Gallia|Gallic]] village of the [[Allobroges]] tribe, near a bridge across the Isère. Three centuries later and with insecurity rising in the late [[Roman empire]], a strong [[Defensive wall|wall]] was built around the small town in 286&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné '', Félix Vernay, 1933, p18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Gratian]] visited Cularo and, touched by the people's welcome, made the village a Roman city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Louis|first1=Jaucourt de chevalier|date=1757|page=942|title=Grenoble|hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.365}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of this, Cularo was renamed '''Gratianopolis''' (&quot;city of Gratian&quot;) in 381 (leading to Graignovol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metrodoc.la-metro.org/Riches_heures/msdphns/index.htm |title=Musée Dauphinois |publisher=Metrodoc.la-metro.org |accessdate=12 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012010144/http://metrodoc.la-metro.org/Riches_heures/msdphns/index.htm |archivedate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Middle Age and then Grenoble).

Christianity spread to the region during the 4th century, and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Grenoble-Vienne|diocese]] of Grenoble was founded in 377&amp;nbsp;AD. From that time on, the bishops exercised significant political power over the city. Until the [[French Revolution]], they styled themselves the &quot;bishops and princes of Grenoble&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

After the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], the city was part of the first [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian kingdom]] in the 5th century and the second Burgundian [[Kingdom of Arles]] until 1032, when it was integrated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Arletian rule was interrupted between 942 and 970 due to Arab rule based in [[Fraxinet]].

Grenoble grew significantly in the 11th century when the [[List of Counts of Albon and Dauphins of Viennois|Counts of Albon]] chose the city as the capital of their territories. At the time, their possessions were a patchwork of several territories sprawled across the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The central position of Grenoble allowed the Counts to strengthen their authority. When they later took the title of &quot;[[Dauphin of France|Dauphins]]&quot;, Grenoble became the capital of the State of [[Dauphiné]].

Despite their status, the Counts had to share authority over the city with the Bishop of Grenoble. One of the most famous of those was [[Hugh of Châteauneuf|Saint Hugh]]. Under his rule, the city's bridge was rebuilt, and a regular and [[leper]] hospital were built.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arms of the Dauphin of France.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Coat of arms of the Dauphiné after becoming a province of France]]

The inhabitants of Grenoble took advantage of the conflicts between the Counts and the bishops and obtained the recognition of a Charter of Customs that guaranteed their rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; That charter was confirmed by Kings [[Louis XI]] in 1447 and [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]] in 1541.

In 1336 the last Dauphin [[Humbert II of Viennois|Humbert&amp;nbsp;II]] founded a court of justice, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Conseil delphinal|fr}}, which settled at Grenoble in 1340. He also established the [[University of Grenoble]] in 1339. Without an heir, Humbert sold his state to France in 1349, on the condition that the heir to the [[List of French monarchs|French crown]] used the title of ''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]].'' The first one, the future [[Charles V of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;V]], spent nine months in Grenoble. The city remained the capital of the Dauphiné,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Grenoble |volume=12 |pages=579–580 |first=William Augustus Brevoort |last=Coolidge |authorlink=W. A. B. Coolidge}}&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth a [[Provinces of France|province of France]], and the [[States Provincial (France)|Estates of Dauphiné]] were created.

The only Dauphin who really governed his province was the future [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XI]], whose &quot;reign&quot; lasted from 1447 to 1456. It was only under his rule that Dauphiné properly joined the Kingdom of France. The Old Conseil Delphinal became a [[Parlement]] (the third in France after the Parliaments of Paris and Toulouse), strengthening the status of Grenoble as a Provincial capital. He also ordered the construction of the Palais du Parlement (finished under [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]]) and ensured that the Bishop pledged allegiance, thus forging the political union of the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Grenoble was a crossroads between [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], Geneva, Italy, and [[Savoy]]. It was the industrial centre of the Dauphiné and the biggest city of the province, but nonetheless a rather small one.

===Renaissance===
[[File:Francois-de-bonne-duc-de-le.jpg|thumb|François de Bonne, duc de Lesdiguières]]
Owing to Grenoble's geographical situation, French troops were garrisoned in the city and its region during the [[Italian Wars]]. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;VIII]], [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XII]], and [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]] went several times to Grenoble. Its people consequently had to suffer from the exactions of the soldiers.

The nobility of the region took part in various battles ([[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]], [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]) and in doing so gained significant prestige.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p78&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of its members was [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]], &quot;the knight without fear and beyond reproach&quot;.

Grenoble suffered as a result of the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Dauphiné was indeed an important settlement for Protestants and therefore experienced several conflicts. The [[François de Beaumont, baron des Adrets|baron des Adrets]], the leader of the [[Huguenots]], pillaged the [[Grenoble Cathedral|Cathedral of Grenoble]] and destroyed the tombs of the former Dauphins.

In August 1575, [[François de Bonne, duc de Lesdiguières|Lesdiguières]] became the new leader of the Protestants and, thanks to the accession of [[Henry IV of France|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] to the throne of France, allied himself with the governor and the lieutenant general of the Dauphiné. But this alliance did not bring an end to the conflicts. Indeed, a Catholic movement, the ''Ligue'', which took Grenoble in December 1590, refused to make peace. After months of assaults, Lesdiguières defeated the Ligue and took back Grenoble. He became the leader of the entire province.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite Histoire du Dauphiné '', Félix Vernay, 1933, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesdiguières became the lieutenant-general of the Dauphiné and administered the Province from 1591 to 1626. He began the construction of the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] in order to protect the city and ordered the construction of new walls, increasing the city's size. He also constructed the Hôtel Lesdiguières, built new fountains, and dug sewers.&lt;ref&gt;Histoire de Grenoble, Vidal Chaumel, Editions Privat, p.68,123,126,223&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689, the bishop [[Étienne Le Camus]] launched the construction of [[Saint-Louis Church, Grenoble|Saint-Louis Church]].

===From Louis XIV to the French Revolution===
[[File:Grenoble serré - plan-relief 1848.jpg|thumb|Grenoble [[plan-relief]] (1848).]] 
[[File:Journée des Tuiles (Alexandre Debelle), Musée de la Révolution française - Vizille.jpg|thumb|''[[Day of the Tiles]]'', 1890 painting by [[Alexandre Debelle]],&lt;br/&gt; ([[Musée de la Révolution française]]).]]

The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] caused the departure of 2,000 Protestants from Grenoble, weakening the city's economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p97&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also weakened the competing glove industry of [[Grasse]], leaving the glove factories of Grenoble without any competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dauphiné 1933, p98&quot;&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné '', Félix Vernay, 1933, p98&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed a stronger economic development for the city during the 18th century. At the beginning of that century, only 12 glovers made 15,000 dozen gloves each year; by 1787, 64 glovers made 160,000 dozen gloves each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dauphiné 1933, p98&quot;/&gt;

The city gained some notoriety on 7 June 1788 when the townspeople assaulted troops of [[Louis XVI]] in the &quot;[[Day of the Tiles]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The people attacked the royal troops to prevent an expulsion of the notables of the city, which would have seriously endangered the economic prosperity of Grenoble. Following these events, the [[Assembly of Vizille]] took place. Its members organized the meeting of the old [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], thus beginning the [[French Revolution]]. During the Revolution, Grenoble was represented in Paris by two illustrious notables, [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and [[Antoine Barnave]].

In 1790, the Dauphiné was divided into three [[Departments of France|departments]], and Grenoble became the ''chef-lieu'' of the [[Isère|Isère department]]. Only two [[Refractory clergy|refractory priests]] were executed at Grenoble during the [[Reign of Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uqmp-grenoble.asso.fr/3_quartier/pdf/joseph_chanrion.pdf|title=Il y a 250 ans naissait Joseph Chanrion (1756–1830)|publisher=Union de Quartier Mutualité-Préfecture|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502085231/http://www.uqmp-grenoble.asso.fr/3_quartier/pdf/joseph_chanrion.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope]] [[Pius&amp;nbsp;VI]], prisoner of France, spent two days at Grenoble in 1799&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Diocese of Grenoble |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; before going to [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] where he died.

===19th century===
[[File:Fortifications Bastille - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|Ramparts close to the Porte Saint Laurent]]

The establishment of the [[First French Empire|Empire]] was overwhelmingly approved (in Isère, the results showed 82,084 yes and only 12 no).&lt;ref&gt;''Petite Histoire du Dauphiné'', Félix Vernay, 1933, p115&lt;/ref&gt; Grenoble welcomed for the second time a prisoner Pope in 1809. [[Pius&amp;nbsp;VII]] spent 10&amp;nbsp;days in the city en route to his exile in [[Fontainebleau]].

In 1813 Grenoble was under threat from the Austrian army, which invaded Switzerland and [[Savoy]]. The well-defended city contained the Austrian attacks, and the French army defeated the Austrians, forcing them to withdraw at [[Geneva]]. However, the later [[Six Days Campaign|invasion of France]] in 1814 resulted in the capitulation of the troops and the occupation of the city.

During his [[Hundred Days|return]] from the island of [[Elba]] in 1815, Napoleon took a [[Route Napoleon|road]] that led him near Grenoble at [[Laffrey]]. There he met the royalist fifth Infantry Regiment of [[Louis&amp;nbsp;XVIII]]. Napoleon stepped towards the soldiers and said these famous words: &quot;If there is among you a soldier who wants to kill his Emperor, here I am.&quot; The soldiers all joined his cause. After that, Napoleon was acclaimed at Grenoble and General [[Jean Gabriel Marchand]] could not prevent Napoleon from entering the city through the Bonne gate. He said later: &quot;From [[Cannes]] to Grenoble, I still was an adventurer; in that last city, I came back a sovereign&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Petite histoire du Dauphiné '', Félix Vernay, 1933, p120&lt;/ref&gt; But after the defeat of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], the region suffered from a new invasion of Austrian and Sardinian troops.
[[File:Fontaine trois ordres - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|Fountain of the Three Orders (1897)]]

The 19th century saw significant industrial development of Grenoble. The glove factories reached their Golden Age, and their products were exported to the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;''L’histoire de l'Isère en BD'', Tome&amp;nbsp;5, Gilbert Bouchard, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Nicolas Benoît, Baron Haxo|General Haxo]] transformed the [[Bastille (Grenoble)|Bastille]] fortress, which took on its present aspect between 1824 and 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] saw the construction of the French railway network, and the first trains arrived at Grenoble in 1858. Shortly thereafter Grenoble experienced widespread destruction by [[Grenoble Flood 1859|extensive flooding]] in 1859,.

In 1869 engineer [[Aristide Bergès]] played a major role in industrializing hydroelectricity production. With the development of his paper mills, he accelerated the economic development of the Grésivaudan valley and Grenoble.

On 4 August 1897, a stone and bronze fountain was inaugurated in Grenoble to commemorate the pre-revolutionary events of June 1788. Built by the sculptor [[Henri Ding]], the Fountain of the Three Orders, which represents three characters, is located on the Place Notre-Dame. People in Grenoble interpret these characters as follows: &quot;Is it raining?&quot; inquires the [[The third estate|third estate]]; &quot;Please heaven it had rained&quot;, lament the [[clergy]]; and &quot;It will rain&quot;, proclaims the [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Grenoble, cœur de pierre, Françoise Goyet, Edi Loire, 1996, ({{ISBN|2840840464}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] accelerated Grenoble's economic development.&lt;ref&gt;''L’histoire de l'Isère en BD'', Tome 5, Gilbert Bouchard, 2004, p40&lt;/ref&gt; In order to sustain the war effort, new hydroelectric industries developed along the various rivers of the region, and several existing companies moved into the armaments industry (for example in [[Livet-et-Gavet]]). Electro-chemical factories were also established in the area surrounding Grenoble, initially to produce chemical weapons. This development resulted in significant immigration to Grenoble, particularly from Italian workers who settled in the Saint-Laurent neighborhood.
[[File:Entrée exposition H.B. - Grenoble.jpg|thumb|Gate of the exposition in 1925]]

The economic development of the city was highlighted by the organization of the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] in 1925, which was visited by more than 1&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Exposition internationale de la houille blanche#Les chiffres]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{circular reference|date=August 2020}} The organization of this exhibition forced the military to remove the old city walls and allowed expansion of the city to the south. This exhibition also highlighted the city's hydropower industry and the region's tourist attractions.

The site of the exhibition became an urban park in 1926, named [[Parc Paul Mistral]] after the death of the mayor in 1932. The only building of this exhibition remaining in the park is the crumbling [[Perret tower (Grenoble)|Tour Perret]], which has been closed to the public since 1960 due to its very poor state of maintenance.

During World War II, at the [[Battle of the Alps]], the Nazi invasion was stopped near Grenoble at [[Voreppe]] by the forces of [[General Cartier]] in June 1940. The French forces resisted until the armistice. Grenoble was then part of the [[French State]], before an Italian occupation from 1942 to 1943. The relative mercy of the Italian occupiers towards the Jewish populations resulted in a significant number moving to the region from the German-occupied parts of France.&lt;ref&gt;''L’histoire...'', Tome 5, Gilbert Bouchard, 2004, p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenoble was extremely active in the [[French Resistance|Résistance]] against the occupation. Its action was symbolized by figures such as [[Eugène Chavant]], Léon Martin, and Marie Reynoard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ordredelaliberation.fr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/us_ville/grenoble.html  |title=Order of the Liberation |accessdate=12 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020031540/http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/us_ville/grenoble.html |archivedate = 20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Grenoble supported the clandestine operations and provided false documentation for young people to prevent them from being assigned to [[Service du Travail Obligatoire|STO]].

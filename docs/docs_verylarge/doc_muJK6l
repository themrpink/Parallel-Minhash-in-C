===Airports===
[[Sacramento International Airport]] is a major, full-service airport with passenger flights. It is owned by the County of Sacramento. The County also owns [[Sacramento Mather Airport]] in [[Rancho Cordova]] and [[Sacramento Executive Airport]], both of which are general aviation airports. Sacramento McClellan Airport, formerly McClellan Air Force Base, is a privately owned airport between North Highlands and Rio Linda. There are also privately owned public use airports located in Elk Grove and Rio Linda.

===Public roadways===
The  Sacramento County Department of Transportation (SACDOT)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacdot.com Sacramento County Department of Transportation (SACDOT)]&lt;/ref&gt; maintains approximately 2200 miles of roadway within the unincorporated area. The roads range from six lane thoroughfares to rural roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacdot.com/Pages/MileageofMaintainedRoadways.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former townships===
[[File:Map of Sacramento County 1885.jpg|thumb|1885 map showing the boundaries of the county's 14 civil townships]]
In February 1851, the county was divided into eight [[civil township]]s: the seven marked by asterisks below, plus Sacramento township. In July of that year, the American township was divided off from Sacramento township. In 1856, the Board of Supervisors realigned the divisions into the 14 civil townships below, plus the city of Sacramento.

A '''ruby''' is a pink to blood-red coloured [[gemstone]], a variety of the [[mineral]] [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]). Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. Ruby is one of the traditional [[cardinal gem]]s, together with [[amethyst]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], and [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218182752/https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=December 18, 2017 }}, Max Bauer, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ruby'' comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. The color of a ruby is due to the element [[chromium]].

Some gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the [[Black Prince's Ruby]] in the British [[Imperial State Crown]], are actually [[spinel]]s. These were once known as &quot;Balas rubies&quot;.

The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with [[carat (mass)|carat]] weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional [[birthstone]] for July and is usually [[pink]]er than [[garnet]], although some [[rhodolite]] garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby to be sold at auction is the [[Sunrise Ruby]].

==Physical properties==
[[Image:Corundum.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure of rubies]]
Rubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are α-alumina, the most stable form of Al{{sub|2}}O{{sub|3}}, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium [[ion]] to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O{{sup|2−}} ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.

[[Image: Ruby model.jpg|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby showing the substitution of Al{{sup|3+}} ions (blue) with Cr{{sup|3+}} (red).  The substitution density of Cr{{sup|3+}} ions in this model is approximately 2%, approximating the maximum doping normally encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.miramodus.com/images.shtml Images of molecular models from Miramodus]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

When a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium{{sup|3+}} ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al{{sub|2}}O{{sub|3}} crystal.  However, the Cr{{sup|3+}} ions are larger and have [[Electron configuration#Ionization of the transition metals|electron orbitals]] in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O{{sup|2−}} ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr{{sup|3+}} ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O{{sup|2−}} ions.&lt;ref name=causes&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | title= Ruby: causes of color | accessdate= 28 Mar 2016 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160321193313/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html | archivedate= March 21, 2016 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.

[[Image:Ruby transmittance.svg |thumb|Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad violet and yellow-green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band at the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser.]]

If one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem.&lt;ref name=causes/&gt;  Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].

After absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass  emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a [[ruby laser]] in this way produces a very high intensity of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] red light.

All natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as &quot;silk&quot;. Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.

Some rubies show a three-point or six-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or &quot;star&quot;. These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the &quot;silk&quot; (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes—though this occurs very rarely—as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the &quot;cat's eye&quot; effect.

===Ruby vs. pink sapphire===
Generally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies.&lt;ref name=&quot;matlins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|title=Colored Gemstones|year=2010|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=978-0-943763-72-9|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502140108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Peter|title=Gemmology|year=1991|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-6449-5|page=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102012607/https://books.google.com/books?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a [[sapphire|pink sapphire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;matlins&quot; /&gt;  Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century. Often, the distinction between ruby and pink sapphire is not clear and can be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Richard G|title=Gemstone Connoisseurship; The Finer Points, Part II|url=http://www.secretsofthegemtrade.com/articles_5_2.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082627/http://www.secretsofthegemtrade.com/articles_5_2.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the difficulty and subjectiveness of such distinctions, trade organizations such as the [[International Colored Gemstone Association]] (ICGA) have adopted the broader definition for ruby which encompasses its lighter shades, including pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Richard W.|title=Walking the line in ruby &amp; sapphire|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/ruby_sapphire_borders.htm|publisher=ruby-sapphire.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113084826/http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/ruby_sapphire_borders.htm|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Federman|first=David|title=Pink Sapphire|url=http://www.modernjeweler.com/web/online/Colored-Gemstone-Gem-Profiles/Pink-Sapphire/1$530|publisher=Modern Jeweler|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131101220/http://www.modernjeweler.com/web/online/Colored-Gemstone-Gem-Profiles/Pink-Sapphire/1$530|archivedate=January 31, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and mining==
Historically, rubies have been mined in Thailand, in the [[Pailin]] and [[Samlout District]] of [[Cambodia]], as well as in [[Afghanistan]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], India,  [[Namibia]], [[Japan]], and Scotland; after the [[Second World War]] ruby deposits were found in [[Madagascar]], Nepal, Pakistan, [[Tajikistan]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/ruby-sapphire-identifying-origin-understanding-value-rarity-gem-corundum/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230213525/http://www.gemsociety.org/article/ruby-sapphire-identifying-origin-understanding-value-rarity-gem-corundum/ |archivedate=December 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Republic of North Macedonia]] is the only country in mainland Europe to have naturally occurring rubies. They can mainly be found around the city of [[Prilep]]. Macedonian rubies have a unique raspberry color. The ruby is also included on the Macedonian coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This is the New Coat of Arms of Republic of Macedonia |url=http://www.independent.mk/articles/12107/This+is+the+New+Coat+of+Arms+of+Republic+of+Macedonia|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Independent.mk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330175849/http://www.independent.mk/articles/12107/This+is+the+New+Coat+of+Arms+of+Republic+of+Macedonia|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few rubies have been found in the U.S. states of [[Montana]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Wyoming]].

[[Spinel]], another red gemstone, is sometimes found along with rubies in the same gem gravel or marble. Red spinels may be mistaken for rubies by those lacking experience with gems. However, the finest red spinels can have values approaching that of an average ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Wenk, Hans-Rudolf |author2=Bulakh, A.

The [[Mogok]] Valley in Upper [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was for centuries the world's main source for rubies. That region has produced some exceptional rubies, however in recent years few good rubies have been found. In central Myanmar, the area of Mong Hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the world's main ruby mining area. The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].

In [[Azad Kashmir|Pakistani Kashmir]] there are vast proven reserves of millions of rubies, worth up to half a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20171015-rubies-buried-treasures-pakistani-kashmir|publisher=[[France24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017 there was only one mine (at Chitta Katha) due to lack of investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Caroline Nelly Perrot|title=Rubies, the buried treasures of Pakistani Kashmir |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-10-rubies-treasures-pakistani-kashmir.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Afghanistan]], rubies are mined at Jegdalek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The dangerous world of Pakistan's gem trade |url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/world/pakistans-blood-stones/|magazine=[[Maclean's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting value==
Rubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.

'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the ''pure spectral hues'' of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W. |title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones |pages=18–22 |isbn=0-9728223-8-0 |year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.

==Treatments and enhancements==
Improving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.

Improvements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.

The most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800&amp;nbsp;°C (3300&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=&quot;ThemelisRubyHeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0940965100|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|place=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300&amp;nbsp;°C (2400&amp;nbsp;°F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.

Another treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is &lt;!-- to avoid false positives for 'is led/lead' typo--&gt;[[lead glass]] filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831062843/http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf |date=August 31, 2011 }}.

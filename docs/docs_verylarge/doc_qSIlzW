Prince George's County is serviced by multiple [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]]. The [[Prince George's County Police Department]] is the primary police service for county residents residing in [[unincorporated area]]s of the county. In addition, the [[Prince George's County Sheriff's Office]] acts as the enforcement arm of the [[court|county court]], and also shares some patrol responsibility with the county police. County parks are serviced by the Prince George's County Division of the [[Maryland-National Capital Park Police]].
Besides the county-level services, all but one of the 27 local municipalities maintain police departments that share jurisdiction with the county police services.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, the [[Maryland State Police]] enforces the law on state highways which pass through the county with the exception of [[Maryland Route 200]] where the [[Maryland Transportation Authority Police]] is the primary law enforcement agency and the [[Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police]] patrol the state parks and navigable waterways located within the county.

Along with the state and local law enforcement agencies, the federal government also maintains several departments that service citizens of the county such as the [[United States Park Police|US Park Police]], [[United States Postal Inspection Service|US Postal Police]], [[Andrews Air Force Base]] [[Security Police]], and other [[federal police]] located on various federal property within the county.

The career firefighters and paramedics are represented by [[International Association of Fire Fighters|IAFF]] 1619. Prince George's County Fire/Rescue Operations consists of 45 Fire/EMS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/259/Fire-Rescue-Operations |title=Fire / Rescue Operations |access-date=July 1, 2017 |publisher=Prince George's County, Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George's County became the first jurisdiction in [[Maryland]] to implement the [[9-1-1]] Emergency Reporting System in 1973. Advanced life support services began for citizens of the county in 1977.

===Future transit===
Because of its location north and east of Washington, D.C., several future transit technology projects look to be routed partially through Prince George's County. The first stage of  [[The Boring Company]]'s proposed Washington-to-New York [[hyperloop]] will travel beneath the Baltimore–Washington Parkway through Prince George's en route to Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/17/washington-hyperloop-station/ |title=Washington, D.C., Has Given the Boring Company a Permit for a Possible Hyperloop Station |last=Morris |first=David Z. |date=February 17, 2018 |magazine=Fortune |access-date=15 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dc.curbed.com/2018/3/26/17164088/hyperloop-dc-baltimore-route-map |title=Elon Musk’s D.C.–Baltimore hyperloop route, mapped |last=Goldchain |first=Michelle |date=March 26, 2018 |website=Curbed: Washington DC |access-date=15 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No hyperloop stops within the county are projected. Similarly, Maryland Governor [[Larry Hogan]] has supported efforts to trial a 40-mile [[SCMaglev|superconducting maglev]] (SCMaglev) train route connecting Washington to Baltimore. Proposed routes would run through Prince George's parallel to the Baltimore–Washington Parkway or along the Amtrak Penn Line corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wamu.org/story/17/10/19/maryland-eyes-three-possible-routes-high-speed-maglev-d-c-baltimore/ |title=Maryland Eyes Three Possible Routes For High-Speed Maglev Between D.C.

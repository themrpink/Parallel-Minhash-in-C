Olivine is an abundant mineral, but gem-quality peridot is rather rare due to its [[chemical stability|chemical instability]] on Earth's surface. Olivine is usually found as small grains and tends to exist in a heavily weathered state, unsuitable for decorative use. Large crystals of [[forsterite]], the variety most often used to cut peridot gems, are rare; as a result olivine is considered to be [[precious stone|precious]].

In the ancient world, mining of peridot, called ''topazios'' then, on [[Zabargad Island|St. John's Island in the Red Sea]] began about 300 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/loc-6423.html St. John's Island peridot information and history] at [[Mindat.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal source of peridot olivine today is the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although some good olive-colored crystals are found in a few other places, like Burma, China, Zambia, and Pakistan, ninety percent of all known peridots are found in just one place. It is a Native American reservation, and it is located in a little-visited corner of the United States. San Carlos&quot; Finlay, Victoria. Jewels: A Secret History (Kindle Locations 2543-2546). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mined at another location in [[Arizona]], and in [[Arkansas]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[New Mexico]] at [[Kilbourne Hole]], in the US; and in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma), [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Tanzania]].

===In meteorites===
[[File:NHM - Pallasit Fukang.jpg|thumb|right|Pallasite meteorite with olive-green peridot crystals, found in Fukang, China.]]
Peridot crystals have been collected from some [[pallasite]] [[meteorite]]s. The most commonly studied pallasitic peridot belongs to the Indonesian Jeppara meteorite, but others exist such as the Brenham, Esquel, Fukang, and Imilac meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Leelawatanasuk|first1=Thanong|last2=Atichat|first2=Wilawan|last3=Thye Sun|first3=Tay|last4=Sriprasert|first4=Boontawee|last5=Jakkawanvibul|first5=Jirapit|date=2014|title=Some Characteristics of Taaffeite from Myanmar|journal=The Journal of Gemmology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=144–148|doi=10.15506/jog.2014.34.2.144|issn=1355-4565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemology==
Refractive index readings of faceted gems contain indices α = 1.653, β = 1.670, and γ = 1.689 with a corresponding bi-axial birefringence of 0.036. Study of Chinese peridot gem samples determined the specific gravity hydro-statically to be 3.36. The visible-light spectroscopy of the same Chinese peridot samples showed light bands between 493.0 and 481.0 nm, the strongest absorption at 492.0 nm.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koivula|first1=John I.|last2=Fryer|first2=C. W.|date=1986-04-01|title=The Gemological Characteristics of Chinese Peridot|url=http://www.gia.edu/gems-gemology/spring-1986-china-peridot-koivula|journal=Gems &amp; Gemology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=38–40|doi=10.5741/GEMS.22.1.38|issn=0016-626X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusions are common in peridot crystals but the variety depend on the location it is found at. Stones from Pakistan contain silk and rod like inclusions as well as black chromite crystal inclusions surrounded bi-circular cleavage discs resembling lily pads, and finger print inclusions. Brown Mica flakes are more evident in Arizona gems.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The largest cut peridot olivine is a 310 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] (62 g) specimen in the [[Smithsonian Museum]] in Washington, D.C.

== Cultural history ==
Peridot has been prized since the earliest civilizations for its protective powers to drive away fears and nightmares. It's believed to carry the gift of inner radiance, sharpening the mind and opening it to new levels of awareness and growth, helping one to recognize and realize one’s destiny and spiritual purpose.

Ancient Egyptians believed that Peridot was sent to Earth by the explosion of a star and carried its healing powers. Peridot is the national gem of Egypt known to locals as the Gem of the Sun.

Peridot is sometimes mistaken for [[Emerald|emeralds]] and other green gems. Notable [[gemologist]] [[George Frederick Kunz]] discussed the confusion between [[Emerald|emeralds]] and peridot in many [[Church (building)|church]] [[Treasure|treasures]], notably the &quot;[[Shrine of the Three Kings|Three Magi]]&quot; treasure in the [[Cologne Cathedral|Dom]] of [[Cologne]], Germany.

Peridot olivine is the [[birthstone]] for the month of August and the 16th wedding anniversary gemstone.

'''Orthoclase,''' or '''orthoclase feldspar''' ([[endmember]] formula [[potassium|K]][[aluminium|Al]][[silicon|Si]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), is an important [[Silicate minerals#Tectosilicates|tectosilicate]] [[mineral]] which forms [[igneous rock]]. The name is from the [[Ancient Greek]] for &quot;straight fracture,&quot; because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other. It is a type of '''potassium feldspar''', also known as '''K-feldspar'''. The gem known as [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] (see below) is largely composed of orthoclase.

==Formation and subtypes==
Orthoclase is a common constituent of most [[granite]]s and other [[felsic]] [[igneous rock]]s and often forms huge crystals and masses in [[pegmatite]].

Typically, the pure potassium [[endmember]] of orthoclase forms a [[solid solution]] with [[albite]], the sodium endmember (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), of [[plagioclase]]. While slowly cooling within the earth, sodium-rich albite [[Lamella (materials)|lamellae]] form by [[exsolution]], enriching the remaining orthoclase with potassium. The resulting intergrowth of the two feldspars is called [[perthite]].

[[Image:Adularia with Pyrite mg 7940.jpg|thumb|left|Adularia with [[pyrite]] incrustations]]
The higher-temperature [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is [[sanidine]]. Sanidine is common in rapidly cooled volcanic rocks such as [[obsidian]] and felsic [[pyroclastic]] rocks, and is notably found in [[trachyte]]s of the [[Drachenfels (Siebengebirge)|Drachenfels]], Germany. The lower-temperature polymorph of KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is [[microcline]].

Adularia is a low temperature form of either microcline or orthoclase originally reported from the low temperature [[hydrothermal]] deposits in the [[Adula Alps]] of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-28.html|title=Adularia: Adularia mineral information and data.|author=|date=|website=www.mindat.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described by [[Ermenegildo Pini]] in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Axis | volume=2| issue=3| pages=1–10 | year=2006| title=The early history of Tremolite| author=Roth, Philippe|url=http://www.mineralogicalrecord.com/pdfs/TREMOLITE%20Edited.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optical effect of [[adularescence]] in [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] is typically due to adularia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/moonstone-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/|title=Moonstone Value, Price, and Jewelry Information|author=|date=|website=gemsociety.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest documented single crystal of orthoclase was found in the [[Ural mountains]] in Russia. It measured ~10×10×0.4 m and weighed ~100 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Together with the other potassium [[feldspar]]s, orthoclase is a common raw material for the manufacture of some [[glass]]es and some [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and as a constituent of scouring powder.

Some intergrowths of orthoclase and [[albite]] have an attractive pale [[luster (mineralogy)|luster]] and are called [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] when used in jewellery. Most moonstones are translucent and white, although grey and peach-colored varieties also occur. In gemology, their luster is called [[adularescence]] and is typically described as creamy or silvery white with a &quot;billowy&quot; quality. It is the [[state gem]] of [[Florida]].

The gemstone commonly called ''rainbow moonstone'' is more properly a colorless form of [[labradorite]] and can be distinguished from &quot;true&quot; moonstone by its greater transparency and play of color, although their value and durability do not greatly differ.

Orthoclase is one of the ten defining minerals of the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], on which it is listed as having a hardness of 6.

[[NASA]]'s [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity Rover]] discovery of high levels of orthoclase in Martian sandstones suggested that some Martian rocks may have experienced complex geological processing, such as repeated melting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/june/nasa-s-mars-curiosity-rover-marks-first-martian-year-with-mission-successes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microcline'''  (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important [[igneous rocks|igneous rock]]-forming [[Silicate minerals|tectosilicate]] [[mineral]]. It is a [[potassium]]-rich [[alkali feldspar]]. Microcline typically contains minor amounts of [[sodium]]. It is common in [[granite]] and [[pegmatite]]s. Microcline forms during slow cooling of [[orthoclase]]; it is more stable at lower temperatures than orthoclase. [[Sanidine]] is a [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of alkali feldspar stable at yet higher temperature. Microcline may be clear, white, pale-yellow, brick-red, or green; it is generally characterized by cross-hatch twinning that forms as a result of the transformation of [[monoclinic]] orthoclase into [[triclinic]] microcline.

The chemical compound name is potassium aluminium silicate, and it is known as [[E number]] reference '''E555'''.

==Geology==

Microcline may be chemically the same as [[monoclinic]] [[orthoclase]], but because it belongs to the [[triclinic]] crystal system, the prism angle is slightly less than right angles; hence the name &quot;microcline&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;small slope.&quot; It is a fully ordered [[triclinic]] modification of [[potassium]] [[feldspar]] and is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|dimorphous]] with [[orthoclase]]. Microcline is identical to orthoclase in many physical properties, and can be distinguished by x-ray or optical examination. When viewed under a [[Petrographic microscope|polarizing microscope]], microcline exhibits a minute multiple [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] which forms a grating-like structure that is unmistakable.
[[Image:Amazonita1.jpeg|left|thumb|Feldspar (Amazonite)]]
[[Perthite]] is either microcline or orthoclase with thin lamellae of exsolved albite.

Amazon stone, or [[amazonite]], is a green variety of microcline. It is not found anywhere in the [[Amazon Basin]], however. The [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers who named it apparently confused it with another green mineral from that region.

The largest documented single crystals of microcline were found in Devils Hole Beryl Mine, [[Colorado]], US and measured ~50x36x14 m. This could be one of the largest crystals of any material found so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microcline is commonly used for the manufacturing of porcelain. 

==As food additive==
The chemical compound name is potassium aluminium silicate, and it is known as [[E number]] reference '''E555'''. It was the subject in 2018 of a Call for technical and toxicological data from the [[EFSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Call for technical and toxicological data on sodium aluminium silicate (E 554) and potassium aluminium silicate (E 555) authorised as food additives in the EU |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/consultations/call/181107 |publisher=EFSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it (along with other Aluminum compounds) was the subject of 
a Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Food Contact Materials from the EFSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=F. Aguilar, H. Autrup, S. Barlow, L.

The mineral '''anorthoclase''' ((Na,K)AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a crystalline [[solid solution]] in the [[alkali feldspar]] series, in which the sodium-aluminium silicate member exists in larger proportion. It typically consists of between 10 and 36 percent of KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and between 64 and 90 percent of NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Deere, Howie and Zussman, ''Rock Forming Minerals,'' Vol. 4 ''Framework Silicates,'' Wiley, pp. 2 - 5,  Fig. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and stability==
Anorthoclase is an intermediate member of the high [[albite]] – [[sanidine]] alkali feldspar [[solid solution]] series. Intermediate members of this series, high albite, anorthoclase and high sodium sanidine are stable at temperatures of {{convert|600|C}} and above. Below 400 to 600&amp;nbsp;°C only very limited solution exists (less than about 5% on both the low albite and [[microcline]] ends).&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S. Hurlbut, Jr. ''Handbook of Mineralogy,'' Wiley, pp. 446-449 (Fig. 11-95 {{ISBN|0-471-80580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anorthoclase and high albite exhibit triclinic symmetry, whereas sanidine and the low temperature [[orthoclase]] have [[monoclinic]] symmetry.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; If the high temperature intermediate composition alkali feldspars are allowed to cool slowly, [[exsolution]] occurs and a [[perthite]] structure results.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

==Occurrence==

Anorthoclase occurs in high temperature sodium rich [[volcanic]] and [[hypabyssal]] (shallow intrusive) rocks. The mineral is typically found as a constituent of the fine grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] or as small phenocrysts which may occur as loose crystals in a weathered rock.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

It was first described in 1885 for an occurrence on [[Pantelleria Island]], [[Trapani Province]], [[Sicily]]. The name is from the Greek αν, ορθός and κλάσις (not cleaving at right-angles), for its oblique cleavage.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

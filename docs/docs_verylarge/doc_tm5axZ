In 1970, ''All About Eve'' was the inspiration for the [[musical theatre|stage musical]] ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]],'' with book by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], lyrics by [[Lee Adams]], and music by [[Charles Strouse]]. The original production starred [[Lauren Bacall]] as Margo Channing, and it won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] that season. It ran for four previews and 896 performances at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. After Bacall left the production, she was replaced by Anne Baxter in the role of Margo Channing.

In 2019, a stage adaptation of ''All About Eve'' premiered at the [[Noël Coward Theatre]] in London, directed by [[Ivo van Hove]] and starring [[Gillian Anderson]] as Margo Channing and [[Lily James]] as Eve Harrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All About Eve in London to star Gillian Anderson and Lily James: details confirmed|url=https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/theatre-news/news/all-about-eve-in-london-to-star-gillian-anderson-and-lily-james-details-confirmed|date=September 21, 2018|work=LondonTheatre.co.uk|accessdate=February 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The plot of the film has been used numerous times, frequently as an outright homage to the film, with one notable example being a 1974 episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' titled &quot;A New Sue Ann&quot;.  In the episode, the character of [[Sue Ann Nivens]] ([[Betty White]]), hostess of a popular local cooking show, hires a young, pretty and very eager fan ([[Linda Kelsey]]) as her apprentice and assistant, but the neophyte quickly begins to sabotage her mentor, in an attempt to replace her as host of the show. Sue Ann, however, unlike Margo Channing, prevails in the end, countering the young woman's attempts to steal her success and sending her on her way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/movie/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show%3A_A_New_Sue_Ann/V269407/0/2/ &quot;A New Sue Ann&quot;] Starpulse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 2008 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled &quot;[[All About Lisa]]&quot; is influenced by this film. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes [[Krusty the Clown]]'s assistant, eventually taking his place on television and receiving an entertainment award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100521&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=7723638 The Simpsons on Fox] TVGuide.com. Retrieved 18 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s 1999 [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Spanish-language]] film ''[[Todo sobre mi madre]]'' (''[[All About My Mother]]'') has elements similar to those found in ''All About Eve''. The title of the film itself is an homage to the 1950 film. In the first scene, the character of Manuela and her son, Esteban, are watching a dubbed version of the film on television when the film is introduced as &quot;Eve Unveiled&quot;. Esteban comments that the film should be called &quot;Todo Sobre Eva&quot; (&quot;All About Eva&quot;). Later in the scene, he begins writing about his mother in his notebook and calls the piece &quot;Todo sobre Eva&quot;. Additionally, Manuela replaces Nina Cruz as Stella for a night in a production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', leading a furious Nina to accuse her of learning the part &quot;just like Eve Harrington!&quot;
* In a season 3 episode of ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', titled &quot;Enough About Eve&quot;, [[Blair Waldorf]] has a dream where she is Margo Channing.
* In the fifth season of ''[[The L Word]]'', a fan becomes Jenny Schecter's assistant while she is directing a movie; later the fan blackmails the movie studio into letting her direct and she proceeds to take over Jenny's life.
* In the second season of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', [[Kurt Hummel]] calls his fellow glee club member [[Santana Lopez]] &quot;a Latina Eve Harrington,&quot; after learning she is blackmailing a closeted jock into becoming her &quot;beard&quot; and running mate for Prom Queen and King.
* In the first season of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', Grace becomes dependent on a maid to give her a confidence boost during a design competition. This prompts her drunken assistant Karen to suspect a plot and she confronts the maid, exclaiming &quot;I've seen 'All About Eve.' Poooor Eve!&quot;
* In the pilot episode of ''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]],'' when Susan suspects Georgia, a fellow reporter, has a crush on her boyfriend and is attempting to outshine her at the newspaper, she says, &quot;If Eve Harrington were an actual person today, she would look like Georgia. She would bake cupcakes, and she would have a blog.&quot;
* In the third season of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', the episode &quot;All About Eva&quot; concerns a character coming on the island and taking over Ginger's persona, with both roles played by actress [[Tina Louise]].
* In the fifth season of ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', the plot of the episode &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean&quot; mirrors that of ''All About Eve''. In it, Sam Beckett leaps into [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s chauffeur and finds himself pitted against an aspiring actress who is trying to steal Monroe's part for the film ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]].'' Sam succeeds in stopping Monroe's rival, and she rightfully takes her place as [[Clark Gable]]'s leading lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Vito |first1=John |last2=Tropea |first2=Frank |date=2007|title=The Immortal Marilyn |url=https://archive.org/details/immortalmarilynd00devi |url-access=registration |location=United States |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/immortalmarilynd00devi/page/45 45] |isbn=978-0-8108-5866-4 |access-date=March 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/quantum-leap/goodbye-norma-jean-60571  |title=Quantum Leap Season 5 Episode 18 Goodbye Norma Jean |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=TV.com |publisher=TV Guide |access-date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:std188 jewel.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|Cover of CHQ’s commercial reprint of the MIL-STD-188 Military Standards series]]
'''MIL-STD-188''' is a series of [[U.S. military standard]]s relating to [[telecommunication]]s.
 
==Purpose==
Faced with &quot;past technical deficiencies in telecommunications systems and equipment and software…that were traced to basic inadequacies in the application of telecommunication standards and to the lack of a well defined…program for their review, control and implementation&quot;, the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] looked to develop a series of standards that would alleviate the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://neds.daps.dla.mil/Directives/02000%20Telecommunications%20and%20Digital%20Systems%20Support/02-00%20General%20Telecommunications%20and%20Digital%20Support%20Services/2000.31.pdf |date= April 10, 1989 |title= Mandatory Use Of Military Telecommunications Standards In the Mil-Std-188 Series |accessdate= January 12, 2007 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070317011219/http://neds.daps.dla.mil/Directives/02000%20Telecommunications%20and%20Digital%20Systems%20Support/02-00%20General%20Telecommunications%20and%20Digital%20Support%20Services/2000.31.pdf |archivedate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) issued Instruction 4630.8 (reissued in 1992, 2002, 2004) stating its policy that &quot;all forces for joint and combined operations be supported through compatible, [[interoperability|interoperable]], and integrated Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence systems. …[and that all such] systems developed for use by U.S. forces are considered to be for joint use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interface&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://militarycomms.tripod.com/mil-std-188-141-b/index.htm|title=Department of Defense Interface Standards|date=September 15, 1988 |accessdate=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve this the director of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA) is charged with &quot;developing information technology standards to achieve interoperability and compatibility…[and ensure that all] systems and equipment shall conform to technical and procedural standards for interface, interoperability, and compatibility&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interface&quot;/&gt;

The MIL-STD-188 standards were created to &quot;address telecommunication design parameters based on proven technologies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interface&quot;/&gt; To ensure interoperability, DISA made these standards mandatory for use in all new DoD systems and equipment, or major upgrades.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mandatory use of these standards will aid significantly in achieving standardization and result in improvements in availability, maintainability, reliability, and supportability. This, in turn, will enhance lifecycle configuration management and logistic support with subsequent reductions in life cycle costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evolution==
When first developed Military Standard 188 (MIL-STD-188) covered technical standards for tactical and [[long-haul communications]], but as it was revised (MIL-STD-188A, MIL-STD-188B) it became a document applicable to [[tactical communications]] only (MIL-STD-188C 24 Nov 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MIL-STD-188C |url=https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=35567 |website=ASSIST Quicksearch |publisher=DoD |accessdate=20 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;June, 1988&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/defense/MS188146.htm|title=Military Standard: Interoperability And Performance Standards For Satellite Communications|date=June 15, 1988 |accessdate=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] published circulars which announced both standards and engineering criteria relating to the long-haul Defense Communications System and to the technical support of the [[Worldwide Military Command and Control System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;June, 1988&quot;/&gt; In line with a decision by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], these standards are published in the MIL-STD-188 series of documents. This series is subdivided into &quot;a MIL-STD-188-100 series covering common standards for tactical and long-haul communications, a MIL-STD-188-200 series covering standards for tactical communications only, and a MIL-STD-188-300 series covering standards for long-haul communications only.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;June, 1988&quot;/&gt;

The MIL-STD-188 series standards are encompassed by the DoD’s [[Joint Technical Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| pages=31 note 2|url= http://www.fas.org/irp/program/core/rr.pdf|title=Roles and Responsibilities Panel Report|date=November 17, 1997 |accessdate=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deviations and waivers==
For any manufacturer seeking to deviate from the MIL–STD-188 series standards (prior to the manufacture of an item) they must request to do so with the Joint Steering Committee (JSC) which is constituted under the Defense Communications Agency. For any DoD Agency to get a waiver to receive an item that deviates from the standards they also must apply to the JSC.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;/&gt;

==Relation to other systems of standards==
According to DoD documents, &quot;The MIL-STD-188 series may be based on, or make reference to, Joint Technical Architecture, [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) standards, [[International Telecommunications Union]] - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendations, [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAG), and other standards wherever applicable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interface&quot;/&gt;

==Current development emphasis==
Currently the DoD is placing its emphasis &quot;on the development of common standards for tactical and long-haul communications (the MIL-STD-188-100 series).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interface&quot;/&gt;

The '''Weser''' ({{IPA-de|ˈveːzɐ|}}) is a [[river]] of [[Lower Saxony]] in north-west [[Germany]]. It begins at [[Hann. Münden|Hannoversch Münden]] through the [[confluence]] of the [[Werra]] and [[Fulda (river)|Fulda]]. It passes through the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of [[Bremen]]. Its mouth is {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} further north against the ports of [[Bremerhaven]] and [[Nordenham]]. The latter is on the [[Butjadingen|Butjadingen Peninsula]]. It then merges into the [[North Sea]] via two highly saline, estuarine mouths.  

It connects to the canal network running east-west across the [[North German Plain]].

The river combined with the Werra &amp;ndash; a dialectal form of '''Weser''' &amp;ndash; runs {{convert|744|km|mi|abbr=on}}. This makes up the longest river wholly in Germany. The Weser itself is {{convert|452|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.  The Werra rises in [[Thuringia]], the [[States of Germany|German State]] south of the main projection (tongue) of Lower Saxony.

==Etymology==
The Weser and the Werra were the same words in different dialects. The difference reflects the old [[isogloss|linguistic border]] between [[Central German|Central]] and [[Low German]], passing through Hannoversch Münden.

The name is cognate with the [[River Wear|Wear]] in England and [[Vistula]] in Poland, derived from the root *''weis-'' &quot;to flow&quot;, which gave Old English/Old Frisian ''wāse'' &quot;mud, ooze&quot;, Old Norse ''veisa'' &quot;slime, stagnant pool&quot;, Dutch ''waas'' &quot;haze; soggy land&quot; (see [[Waasland]]), Old Saxon ''waso'' &quot;wet ground, mire&quot;, Old High German ''wasal'' &quot;rain&quot;, and French ''vase'' &quot;mud, sludge&quot;.

==Course==
The Weser-Werra is the longest river solely in Germany.

The Weser starts at the confluence of the Fulda and the Werra. It then runs down to the [[Porta Westfalica (gorge)]] between two high hill ranges, the [[Wiehengebirge]], west and the [[Weserbergland]] in the east.

Between [[Minden]] and the North Sea, humans have [[river engineering|largely canalised the river]] up to a limit of 1,200-ton ships. Eight hydroelectric dams stand at the ends of adjacent weirstreams that make up the river. The navigation is linked west to the [[Dortmund–Ems Canal]] via the [[Coastal Canal]]. It is linked east at [[Bremerhaven]] to the [[Elbe River|Elbe]]. 

A large reservoir, the [[Edersee]], on the [[Eder]], the main tributary of the Fulda, is used to allow enough water depth for shipping year-round. The dam, built in 1914, was [[Operation Chastise|bombed and severely damaged by British aircraft]] in May 1943, great destruction and about 70 deaths downstream. It was rebuilt within four months. The reservoir is a major summer resort area. Turbines driven by its [[hydroelectricity|sluices provide electricity]].

The Weser enters the North Sea in the southernmost part of the [[German Bight]]. In the sea it splits into two arms &amp;ndash; the riverbed at the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. These sea arms are called ''Alte Weser'' (old Weser) and ''Neue Weser'' (new Weser). They are the waterways for ships heading for the ports of Bremerhaven, [[Nordenham]], and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. The [[Alte Weser Lighthouse]] marks the northernmost point of the Weser. This replaced the [[Roter Sand Lighthouse]] in 1964.

==Tributaries==
The largest tributary of the Weser is the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]], which joins south of Bremen. Tributaries of the Weser and the Werra (from source to mouth) are:

'''Modes of the list:'''
* Listed upstream, but sides seen with the flow
* Distances (&quot;km …&quot;) from the hydrographical limit towards the sea
** &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;and &quot;IV&quot; mark distances of secondary/tertiary tributaries from the confluence with the Weser etc.
* After the names, lengths and basin sizes are given.
* Lengths with longer affluents are given behind the slash, lengths including an upper course with another name with &quot;or&quot;

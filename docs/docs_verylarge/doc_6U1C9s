In recent years Carabinieri units have been dispatched on [[peacekeeping]] missions, including [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2003, 12 Carabinieri [[2003 Nasiriyah bombing|were killed in a suicide bombing]] on their base in [[Nasiriyah]], near [[Basra]] in southern Iraq, in the largest Italian military loss of life in a single action since the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/ieri/storia/vista-da-2015/fascicolo-43/la-strage-di-nassiriya |title=Arma dei Carabinieri – La strage di Nassiriya |publisher=Carabinieri.it |date= |accessdate=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent projects (as of April 2018) include training and assisting the Afghan National Security Forces, the Afghan National Police, and the Afghan National Civil Order Police. In Iraq, Carabinieri have trained 13,000 police officers; during the ISIS destruction of historic sites, Italy dispatched troops from the Carabinieri's Command to protect cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Braw | first=Elisabeth | title=For Not-Quite-Wars, Italy Has a Useful Alternative to Traditional Troops | website=Defense One | date=2018-04-16 | url=https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/04/todays-not-quite-wars-italy-has-alternative-traditional-troops/147457/ | access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Sea Island Conference of the [[G8]] in 2004, Carabinieri were given a mandate to establish a [[Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units]] to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Carabinieri - Specialized and Mobile Units Command - Organization July 2020.png|thumb|Structure of the Specialist &amp; Mobile Units Command]]
The corps is headed by the ''{{lang|it|Comando}}'', consisting of the ''[[List of Commanding Generals of the Carabinieri|Comandante Generale]]'' (a [[General]]), the ''{{lang|it|Vice-Comandante Generale}}'' ( a [[Lieutenant General]]) and the Chief of Staff, all located in [[Rome]]. The Chief of Staff directs, coordinates and supervises all activities of the force. It directly supervises the Directors of Administration, Health, Engineering, the motor pool and the Veterinary Commission. On the Deputy Chiefs of Staff depend the National Center for Recruitment and Selection, the Administration National Center and the Legislation Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Oggi/Reparti/Organizzazione+Centrale/ |title=Organizzazione Centrale |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227104549/http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Oggi/Reparti/Organizzazione%2BCentrale/ |archivedate=February 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Territorial Organization ===
The Carabinieri are organised on a territorial basis for law-enforcement missions. The territorial organization represents the core of the institution; it contains 80 percent of the force and is organized hierarchically in five inter-regional commands, 19 regional commands and 102 provincial commands, 504 Company Commands and
4,672 Station Commands and lieutenancies.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

The territorial organization includes four heliborne units:

* [[Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Calabria&quot;]], responsible for operations in [[Calabria]]
* [[Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Sicilia&quot;]], responsible for operations on [[Sicily]]
* [[Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Sardegna&quot;]], responsible for operations on [[Sardinia]]
* [[Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron   &quot;Cacciatori di Puglia&quot;]], responsible for operations on [[Puglia]]

=== Specialist and Mobile Units Command Organization ===
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--only last sentence has a citation--&gt;
Outside the territorial organisation, the Specialist and Mobile Units Command ''Palidoro'' ({{lang|it|Comando delle Unità Mobili e Specializzate &quot;Palidoro&quot;}}, based in Rome) controls the [[Carabinieri Mobile Units Division]], the [[Carabinieri Specialist Units Division]] and the [[Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale|ROS]].

==== Carabinieri Specialist Units Division ====
{{See also|Carabinieri Specialist Units Division}}
The [[Carabinieri Specialist Units Division]] is the Carabinieri formation, established in 2001, dedicated to the performance of specialist police activities and the support to the Territorial Organizations. The Division directs, controls, and coordinates its own units, which carry out tasks related to the protection of Italian artistic heritage, to the currency protection, to the protection of Italian embassies abroad, to the health protection, to the labour policing, to Bank of Italy needs, to the Carabinieri forensics police services. In addition, the Division provides Carabinieri air support.

==== Mobile Units Division ====
{{See also|Carabinieri Mobile Units Division}}
The [[Carabinieri Mobile Units Division]] is located in [[Rome]] and has two brigades tasked with mass manoeuvres during emergencies, defending the nation and participating in military operations abroad. It supports [[public order]] and territorial control in urban areas, and contributes to the operations of civil authorities in terms of public safety. 1st Mobile Brigade, whose headquarter is located in Rome and includes six Regiments and four Battalions mainly employed in public order tasks. 2nd Mobile Brigade headquartered in Livorno includes the [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]]  special forces group, the [[1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment &quot;Tuscania&quot;]], and the 7th &quot;Trentino-Alto Adige&quot; and 13th &quot;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&quot; regiments, which, together with the [[Multinational Specialized Unit]], are mainly engaged in international missions.

==== Special forces ====
{{See also|Gruppo di Intervento Speciale}}
The [[Gruppo di Intervento Speciale]] in one of the six [[Italian special forces]].

==== ROS ====
The ROS (''[[Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale]]'' or Special Operational Group) is an elite unit founded in 1990 to deal with [[organised crime]] ([[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] and others), subversive activities, [[terrorism]] and more complex types of crime. An anti-crime section is found in every city and district public prosecutor's office.

==== Special Tasks Departments ====
[[File:2june2006 374.jpg|thumb|Corazzieri]]
Special Tasks Departments are outside the ordinary organisational framework and are used for special missions:
''[[Corazzieri]]'' ([[Cuirassier]]s) are an elite corps and honour guard of the [[President of the Italian Republic]], located in the [[Quirinal Palace]]. They are distinguished by their uniforms and height (the minimum height for admission is {{convert|1.9|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=or}}). They have almost no other everyday duties, although they may be seen patrolling occasionally. Other departments are in service to constitutional bodies such as the Presidency of the Republic, the Senate, Parliament, the Judiciary, the [[Prime Minister]] and the National Council of Economy and Labour. Carabinieri also perform [[military police]] and security duties for the Ministry of Defence, military high commands, the offices of the military judiciary and allied military organisations in Italy and abroad. They also have personnel attached to the [[Polizia di Stato|Department of Public Security]] in various departments, as well as anti-Mafia and anti-drug investigative task forces. ''Carabinieri'' officers are charged with surveillance and security at Italian embassies and consulates abroad, performing the same services entrusted to the [[Marine Corps Embassy Security Group]] in United States diplomatic and consular offices.

Together with the [[Polizia di Stato]] and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], the Carabinieri is also responsible for [[border control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/List%20of%20national%20services%20responsible%20for%20border%20control.pdf|title=List of national services responsible for border control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Command Unit for environmental, agri-food and forestry protection ====
The specialized [[Comando unità per la tutela forestale, ambientale e agroalimentare]] has headquarter located in Rome and organized in 15 regional command and approximately 700 Station Commands on the territory. It counts 7,000 personnel involved in contrast of illicit agri-foodstuffs, environmental and biodiversity protection, contrast to poaching, contrast to all criminal organizations that, with their activity, affect the environment. In the Unit there are also 29 NOE (Nucleo Operativo Ecologico), nucleus highly specialized in complex investigations in environmental matters against organized crime.

== War service ==
[[File:2june2006 134.jpg|thumb|1st Paratroopers [[Carabinieri Regiment &quot;Tuscania&quot;]]]]
The main battles in which the Carabinieri took part before World War I are:

* Grenoble, July 5, 1815 (baptism of fire)
* [[Battle of Pastrengo]], 30 April 1848 –  the Carabinieri Corps was awarded its first [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]]
* [[Battle of Santa Lucia]], 6 May 1848 –  the Carabinieri Corps was awarded its first [[Bronze Medal of Military Valor]]
* [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]], 24–25 July 1848
* [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]], 24 June 1866
* [[Capture of Rome]], 20 September 1870 (together with the [[Bersaglieri]])

For its contributions during the First World War, the Corps was awarded its first [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]]

In World War II, Carabinieri fought in the following battles:&lt;ref name=&quot;milhist&quot; /&gt;
* Battle of Klisoura on the Greek-Albanian front from 16 to 30 December 1940 [[Bronze Medal of Military Valor]]
* Battle at Cafe Struga on the Albanian-Yugoslav front on 18 April 1941
* [[Battle of Culqualber]] (Ethiopia), 6 August-21 November 1941 –  Corps was awarded its second [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]]

From 1943 to 1945, the Carabinieri were accountable to the Control Commission of the [[Allied Military Government]] (AMGOT). Their reorganization and reform was organized by Colonel [[Arthur Young (police officer)|Arthur Young]], a British [[police officer]] seconded as Director of Public Safety and Director of Security.

== Vehicles and equipment ==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2020}}
Until very recently the Italian police (including the ''Carabinieri'') operated only Italian-made vehicles, but that changed with the introduction of [[Land Rover Defender]]s and [[Subaru]]s into service. Normal ''Carabinieri'' patrol vehicles are dark blue with a white roof, with a red stripe along the side. Carabinieri license plates begin with &quot;CC&quot; or previously with &quot;EI&quot; (formerly Esercito Italiano, Italian Army), and a Carabinieri car is traditionally called a ''Gazzella'' ([[gazelle]]). Small or medium-sized cars are used for ordinary patrol work, with larger and more powerful vehicles being used for emergency response, highway patrol, and special services. The vehicles of the ''Carabinieri'' military police and mobile units are painted in NATO camouflage scheme as done with the other Italian Armed Forces vehicles.

{{Negative binomial distribution}}

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''negative binomial distribution''' is a [[discrete probability distribution]] that models the number of successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed [[Bernoulli trial]]s before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted ''r'') occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weisstein |first1=Eric |title=Negative Binomial Distribution |url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NegativeBinomialDistribution.html |website=Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Wolfram Research |accessdate=11 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we can define rolling a 6 on a die as a failure, and rolling any other number as a success, and ask how many successful rolls will occur before we see the third failure (''r'' = 3).  In such a case, the probability distribution of the number of non-6s that appear will be a negative binomial distribution.

The '''Pascal distribution''' (after [[Blaise Pascal]]) and '''Polya distribution''' (for [[George Pólya]]) are special cases of the negative binomial distribution. A convention among engineers, climatologists, and others is to use &quot;negative binomial&quot; or &quot;Pascal&quot; for the case of an integer-valued stopping-time parameter ''r'', and use &quot;Polya&quot; for the real-valued case.

For occurrences of associated discrete events, like tornado outbreaks, the Polya distributions can be used to give more accurate models than the [[Poisson distribution]] by allowing the mean and variance to be different, unlike the Poisson. The negative binomial distribution has a variance &lt;math&gt;\mu (1 + \mu / r)&lt;/math&gt;, with the distribution becoming identical to Poisson in the limit &lt;math&gt;r\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; for a given mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  This can make the distribution a useful [[overdispersion|overdispersed]] alternative to the Poisson distribution, for example for a [[robust regression|robust]] modification of [[Poisson regression]]. In epidemiology it has been used to model disease transmission for infectious diseases where the likely number of onward infections may vary considerably from individual to individual and from setting to setting.&lt;ref&gt;eg: J.O. Lloyd-Smith, S.J. Schreiber, P.E. Kopp, and W.M. Getz (2005), [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04153 Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', '''438''', 355–359. {{doi|10.1038/nature04153}}&lt;br&gt;The overdispersion parameter is usually denoted by the letter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in epidemiology, rather than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as here.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally it may be appropriate where events have positively correlated occurrences causing a larger [[variance]] than if the occurrences were independent, due to a positive [[covariance]] term.

The term &quot;negative binomial&quot; is likely due to the fact that a certain [[binomial coefficient]] that appears in the formula for the [[probability mass function]] of the distribution can be written more simply with negative numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Casella |first1=George |last2=Berger |first2=Roger L. |title=Statistical inference |year=2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/statisticalinfer00case_045 |url-access=limited |publisher=Thomson Learning |isbn=0-534-24312-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/statisticalinfer00case_045/page/n59 95] |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Suppose there is a sequence of independent [[Bernoulli trial]]s. Thus, each trial has two potential outcomes called &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. In each trial the probability of success is ''p'' and of failure is (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''). We are observing this sequence until a predefined number ''r'' of successes have occurred. Then the random number of failures we have seen, ''X'', will have the '''negative binomial''' (or '''Pascal''') distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;
    X\sim\operatorname{NB}(r, p)
  &lt;/math&gt;

When applied to real-world problems, outcomes of ''success'' and ''failure'' may or may not be outcomes we ordinarily view as good and bad, respectively. Suppose we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of days a certain machine works before it breaks down. In this case &quot;failure&quot; would be the result on a day when the machine worked properly, whereas a breakdown would be a &quot;success&quot;. If we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of goal attempts an athlete makes before scoring ''r'' goals, though, then each unsuccessful attempt would be a &quot;failure&quot;, and scoring a goal would be &quot;success&quot;. If we are tossing a coin, then the negative binomial distribution can give the number of tails (&quot;failures&quot;) we are likely to encounter before we encounter a certain number of heads (&quot;successes&quot;). In the probability mass function below, ''p'' is the probability of success, and (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'') is the probability of failure.

===Probability mass function===
The [[probability mass function]] of the negative binomial distribution is
:&lt;math&gt;
    f(k; r, p) \equiv \Pr(X = k) = \binom{k+r-1}{r-1} (1-p)^kp^r
  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the number of successes, ''k'' is the number of failures, and ''p'' is the probability of success.  Here the quantity in parentheses is the [[binomial coefficient]], and is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
    \binom{k+r-1}{r-1} = \frac{(k+r-1)!}{(r-1)!\,(k)!} = \frac{(k+r-1)(k+r-2)\dotsm(r)}{(k)!}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
There are ''k'' failures chosen from ''k+r-1'' samples rather than ''k+r'' because the last of the ''k+r'' samples is by definition a success.

This quantity can alternatively be written in the following manner, explaining the name &quot;negative binomial&quot;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{(k+r-1)\dotsm(r)}{(k)!} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; (-1)^k \frac{(-r)(-r-1)(-r-2)\dotsm(-r-k+1)}{(k)!} = (-1)^k\binom{-r}{k}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

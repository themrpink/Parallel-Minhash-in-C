===Religious buildings===
Toulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.

[[Saint-Sernin Basilica]], part of the [[Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France|Way of Saint James]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], is the largest remaining [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.

[[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Stephen]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the first example of [[Southern French Gothic]], at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.

The [[Church of the Jacobins|convent of the Jacobins]] (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of [[Southern French Gothic]] architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic [[fan vault]]s. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the [[Dominican order]], for not having obtained the relics of [[Saint Dominic]] kept in Bologna, [[Pope Urban V]] made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.

===Civilian buildings===
[[File:Vx-raisin_(2).jpg|thumb|Renaissance windows at the [[Hôtel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th C.)]]

The [[Capitole de Toulouse]] (mainly 18th century) houses the Hôtel de Ville (city hall) and the [[Théâtre du Capitole]] (opera house). It is located on the [[Place du Capitole]], a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (''place royale''). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called «the keep» (''le donjon''), which housed the archives of the [[Capitouls]]; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...

Toulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called ''[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'') or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the [[Hôtel d'Assézat]], the [[Hôtel de Bernuy]], the [[Hôtel du Vieux-Raisin]], the [[Hôtel de Bagis]]... {{see also|Renaissance architecture of Toulouse}}

=== Some other sights ===
[[File:Le_pont_Neuf_à_Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] bridge (16th-17th c.)]]

The banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]], it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the [[Hôpital de La Grave]]. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.

Built at the end of the 17th century, the [[Canal du Midi]] bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.

The ''[[Jardin des Plantes, Toulouse|Jardin des Plantes]]'' is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, cafés, activities for children and a [[botanical garden]] (early 19th century).

The [[Cité de l'espace]] (Space City) is a [[theme park]] of space exploration.

The [[University of Toulouse]] (''Université de Toulouse''), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in [[Oxford]] and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology—inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts—as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

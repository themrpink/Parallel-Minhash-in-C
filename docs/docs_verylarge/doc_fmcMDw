In common with most [[Caribbean]] countries, slavery in the British Virgin Islands forms a major part of the history of the Territory.  One commentator has gone so far as to say: &quot;One of the most important aspects of the History of the British Virgin Islands is slavery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Tortola]], and to a lesser extent [[Virgin Gorda]], came to be settled by [[plantation]] owners, slave labour became economically essential, and there was an exponential growth in the slave population during the 18th century.  In 1717 there were 547 black people in the Territory (all of whom were assumed to be slaves); by 1724, there were 1,430; and 1756, there were 6,121.  The increase in slaves held in the Territory is, to a large degree, consistent with development of the economy of the British Virgin Islands at the time.

===Slave revolts===

Uprisings in the Territory were common, as they were elsewhere in the Caribbean.  The first notable uprising in the British Virgin Islands occurred in 1790, and centred on the estates of Isaac Pickering.  It was quickly put down, and the [[Leadership|ring leader]]s were [[capital punishment|executed]].  The revolt was sparked by the rumour that freedom had been granted to slaves in England, but that the planters were withholding knowledge of it.  The same rumour would also later spark subsequent revolts.

Subsequent rebellions also occurred in 1823, 1827, and 1830, although in each case they were quickly put down.

Probably the most significant slave insurrection occurred in 1831 when a plot was uncovered to kill all of the white males in the Territory and to escape to [[Haiti]] (which was at the time the only free black republic in the world) by boat with all of the white females.  Although the plot does not appear to have been especially well formulated, it caused widespread panic, and military assistance was drafted in from St. Thomas.  A number of the plotters (or accused plotters) were executed.

It is perhaps unsurprising that the incidence of slave revolts increased sharply after 1822.  In 1807, the trade in slaves was abolished.  Although the existing slaves were forced to continue their servitude, the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled the Atlantic, capturing slave ships, and freeing slave cargoes.  Starting in 1808, hundreds of freed Africans were deposited on Tortola by the Navy who, after serving a 14 year &quot;apprenticeship&quot;, were then absolutely free.  Naturally, seeing free Africans in the Territory created enormous resentment and jealousy amongst the existing slave population, who understandably felt this to be enormously unjust.

==1834: Emancipation==
[[File:BrotherSlave.jpg|thumb|left|Emancipation pamphlet, circa 1815]]
The abolition of slavery occurred on 1 August 1834, and to this day it is celebrated by a [[Public holidays in the British Virgin Islands|three-day public holiday]] on the first Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August in the British Virgin Islands.  The original emancipation proclamation hangs in the High Court.  However, the abolition of slavery was not the single defining event that it is sometimes supposed to have been.  Emancipation freed a total of 5,792 slaves in the Territory, but at the time of abolition, there were already a considerable number of free blacks in the Territory, possibly as many as 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;A number of settlers in the Territory, [[John C. Lettsome]] and [[Samuel Nottingham]] amongst them, had manumitted large numbers of slaves.  Lettsome manumitted 1,000 slaves upon inheriting them.  Further, subsequent to the abolition of the slave trade, the [[Royal Navy]] deposited a number of freed Africans in the Territory who settled in the Kingston area on [[Tortola]].  In January 1808, [[HMS Cerberus (1794)|HMS ''Cerberus'']] seized the American schooner, the ''Nancy'' with a cargo of enslaved Senegalese Africans in the Territory's waters; between August 1814 and February 1815 a further four ships' slave cargoes were seized from the ''Venus'', the ''Manuella'', the ''Atrevido'' and the ''Candelaria'' and a further 1,318 liberated slaves were deposited on Tortola's shores (of whom just over 1,000 survived).  In 1819, a Portuguese slave ship, the ''Donna Paula'', was wrecked upon the reef at Anegada. The ship's crew and 235 slaves were saved from the wreckage.  Further Spanish ships, ''en route'' to [[Puerto Rico]] were reported wrecked off Anegada in 1817 and 1824, and their cargoes settled on Tortola.  Although many of these former slaves died due to the appalling conditions that they were kept in during the transatlantic crossing, a large number survived, and had children.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the effect of abolition was gradual; the freed slaves were not absolutely manumitted,&lt;ref&gt;Except for those under the age of 6, who were immediately freed.&lt;/ref&gt; but instead entered a form of forced apprenticeship which lasted four years for house slaves and six years for field slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], section 4 [http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms of the forced apprenticeship required them to provide 45 hours unpaid labour a week to their former masters, and prohibited them from leaving their residence without the masters permission.  The effect, deliberately, was to phase out reliance on slave labour rather than end it with a bang.  The Council would later legislate to reduce this period to four years for all slaves to quell rising dissent amongst the field slaves.

[[Joseph John Gurney]], a [[Quaker]], wrote in his ''Familiar Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky'' that the plantation owners in Tortola were &quot;decidedly saving money by the substitution of free labor on moderate wages, for the deadweight of slavery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;However, as a Quaker, Gurney was fundamentally opposed to slavery, and so his comments should perhaps be read accordingly.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the economics of the abolition are difficult to quantify.  Undeniably, the original slave owners suffered a huge capital loss.  Although they received £72,940 from the British Government in compensation, this was only a fraction of the true economic value of the manumitted slaves.&lt;ref&gt;It is difficult to quantify precisely the value of the freed slaves, but in 1798, the total value of slaves in the British Virgin Islands had been estimated at £360,000.  It is likely that figure would have increased considerably during the subsequent 36 years, particularly as the price of slaves rose enormously after the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of net cash flow, whilst the slave owners lost the right to &quot;free&quot; slave labour, they now no longer had to pay to house, clothe, and provide medical attention for their former slaves, which in some cases almost balanced out.  The former slaves now usually worked for the same masters, but instead received small wages, out of which they had to pay for the expenses formerly borne by their masters.  However, some former slaves managed to amass savings, which clearly demonstrates that in net terms the slave owners were less well off in income terms as well as capital as a result of abolition.

===Decline of the sugar industry===

An often held view is that the economy of the British Virgin Islands deteriorated considerably after the abolition of slavery.  Whilst this is, strictly speaking, true, it also disguises the fact that the decline had several different causes.  In 1834 the Territory was an agricultural economy with two main crops: [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]].  Of the two, sugar was the considerably more lucrative export.

Shortly after the abolition of slavery the Territory was rocked by a series of [[hurricane]]s.  At the time, there was no accurate method of forecasting hurricanes, and their effect was devastating.  A particularly devastating hurricane struck in 1837, which was reported to have completed destroyed 17 of the Territory's sugar works.  Further hurricanes hit in 1842 and 1852.  Two more struck in 1867&lt;ref&gt;The hurricane of 1867 was responsible for the sinking of the [[RMS Rhone|RMS ''Rhone'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1871.  The island also suffered severe drought between 1837&lt;ref&gt;Presumably apart from the hurricane&lt;/ref&gt; and 1847, which made sugar [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]] almost impossible to sustain.

[[File:Brewers Bay Sugar Mill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An abandoned and ruined sugar mill in Brewer's Bay.]]

To compound these miseries, in 1846 the United Kingdom passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846]] to equalise duties on sugar grown in the colonies.  Removing [[market distortion]]s had the net effect of making prices fall, a further blow to plantations in the British Virgin Islands.

In 1846, the commercial and trading firm of [[Reid, Irving &amp; Co.]] collapsed.  The firm had 10 sugar estates in the British Virgin Islands and employed 1,150 people.  But the actual economic effect of its failure was much wider; the company also acted as a ''de facto'' bank in the Territory, allowing advances to be drawn on the company as credit.  Further, the company had represented the only remaining direct line of communication to the United Kingdom; after its collapse, mail had to be sent via St. Thomas and [[Copenhagen]].

By 1848, [[Edward Hay Drummond Hay]], the [[List of Presidents of the British Virgin Islands|President of the British Virgin Islands]], reported that: &quot;there are now no properties in the Virgin Islands whose holders are not embarrassed for want of capital or credit sufficient to enable them to carry on the simplest method of cultivation effectively.&quot;

[[File:Cholera Memorial, BVI (2).jpg|left|200px|thumb|Cholera memorial in Long Bush, Road Town]]
In December 1853 there was a disastrous outbreak of [[cholera]] in the Territory, which killed nearly 15% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;A total of 942 deaths were recorded out of a total population of 6,919 (13.9%)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by an outbreak of [[smallpox]] in Tortola and [[Jost Van Dyke]] in 1861 which caused a further 33 deaths.

Up until 1845, the value of sugar exported from the Territory varied, but averaged around £10,000 per annum over the preceding ten years.  With the exception of 1847 (an unusually good year), the average for the subsequent 10 years was under £3,000.  By 1852, it had fallen below £1,000 and would never recover.

Although this was terrible news for the islands as a whole, as Isaac Dookhan has pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Dookhan, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 127&lt;/ref&gt; this did mean that the value of land plummeted sharply, and enabled the newly free black community to purchase land where otherwise it might not have been able to do so.  It also created the basis for the future peasant agricultural economy of the British Virgin Islands.

===Insurrection===
Soon after emancipation, the newly freed black population of the British Virgin Islands started to become increasingly disenchanted that freedom had not brought the prosperity that they had hoped for.  Economic decline had led to increased tax burdens, which became a source of general discontent, for former slaves and other residents of the Territory alike.

In 1848, a major disturbance occurred in the Territory.  The causes of the disturbance were several.  A revolt of slaves was occurring in St. Croix, which increased the general fervour in the islands, but the free population of Tortola were much more concerned with two other grievances: the appointment of public officials, and the crackdown on smuggling.  Although Tortola had sixteen coloured public officials, all except one were &quot;foreigners&quot; from outside the Territory.  During the period of economic decline, smuggling had been one of the few lucrative sources of employment, and recent laws which imposed stringent financial penalties (with hard labour for non-payment) were unpopular.  The anger was directed against the magistrates by the small shop keepers, and they concentrated their attack on the stipendiary magistrate, Isidore Dyett.  However, Dyett was popular with the rural population, who respected him for protecting them from unscrupulous planters.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Dookham, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 154 and 155&lt;/ref&gt;  The ringleaders of the insurrection had supposed that their attack would lead to a general revolt, but their choice of Dyett as a target robbed them of popular support, and the disturbance eventually fizzled.

However, the insurrection of 1853 was a far more serious affair, and would have much graver and more lasting consequences.  Arguably it was the single most defining event in the islands' history.  Taxation and economics was also at the root of that disturbance.  In March 1853, Robert Hawkins and Joshua Jordan, both Methodist missionaries, petitioned the Assembly to be relieved on taxes.  The Assembly rejected the request, and Jordan is said to have replied &quot;we will raise the people against you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source: Colonial Office papers 239/95 enclosure in a letter from Chads to Newcastle, 29 August 1853&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent meetings fostered the general discontent.  Then in June 1853 the legislature enacted a head tax on cattle in the Territory.  Injudiciously, the tax was to come into effect on 1 August, the anniversary of emancipation.  The burden of the tax would fall most heavily on the rural coloured community.  There was no violent protest when the Act was passed, and it has been suggested that rioting could have been avoided if the legislature had been more circumspect in enforcing it,&lt;ref name=&quot;Isaac Dookham page 156&quot;&gt;Isaac Dookham, ''History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 156&lt;/ref&gt; although the historical background suggests that insurrection was never far away, and only needed a reason to spark into life.

On 1 August 1853, a large body of rural labourers came to [[Road Town]] to protest the tax.  However, instead of showing a conciliatory approach, the authorities immediately read the [[Riot Act]], and made two arrests.  Violence then erupted almost immediately.  Several constables and magistrates were badly beaten, the greater part of Road Town itself was burned down, and a large number of the plantation houses were destroyed, cane fields were burned and sugar mills destroyed.  Almost all of the white population fled to [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]].  President [[John Cornell Chads|John Chads]] showed considerable personal courage, but little judgement or tact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Isaac Dookham page 156&quot;/&gt;  On 2 August 1853, he met a gathering of 1,500 to 2,000 protesters, but all he would promise to do was relay their grievances before the legislature (which could not meet, as all the other members had fled).  One protester was shot (the only recorded death during the disturbances themselves) which led to the continuation of the rampage.  By 3 August 1853, the only white people remaining in the Territory were John Chads himself, the Collector of Customs, a Methodist missionary and the island's doctor.

The riots were eventually suppressed with military assistance from St. Thomas, and reinforcements of British troops dispatched by the Governor of the Leeward Islands from [[Antigua]].  Twenty of the ringleaders of the riots were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment; three were [[capital punishment|executed]].

===&quot;Decline and disorder&quot;===

The period which followed the riots of 1853 has been referred to by one historian as the period of &quot;decline and disorder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Pickering, ''A Concise History of the British Virgin Islands'', page 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Some commentators have suggested that the white population essentially refused to return, and the islands &quot;went to de bush&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Lewisohn, ''Tales of Tortola and the British Virgin Islands'', page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  But this is clearly an exaggeration.  Whilst many whites did not return to their heavily mortgaged and now ruined estates, some did, and rebuilt.  But the rebuilding required as a result of the insurrection, as well as the climate of uncertainty it created, alongside the existing poor economic conditions, created an economic depression which would take nearly a century to lift.  It would in fact take a full two years before even the schools in the Territory would be able to open again.&lt;ref&gt;The first schools formally reopened in May 1855.  Reports indicated that others reopened &quot;gradually&quot; but do not indicate when the last school reopened.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions in the Territory continued to simmer, and local unrest ran high.  Exports continued to decline, and large numbers traveled abroad seeking work.  In 1887, a plot for an armed rebellion was uncovered.  In 1890, a dispute over smuggling led to further violence, and a Long Look resident, Christopher Flemming, emerged as a local hero simply for standing up to authority.  In each case widespread damage was averted by bringing in reinforcements for the local authorities from Antigua and, in 1890, from St. Thomas.

Whilst the violence undoubtedly reflected disenchantment with the economic decline and lack of social services, it would be wrong to construe this period as a form of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; for the Territory.  During this period there was, for the first time, a significant expansion in the islands' schools.  By 1875, the Territory had 10 schools; a remarkable development in light of the complete absence of functional schools after the insurrection of 1853.  This period also saw the first coloured British Virgin Islander, [[Fredrick Augustus Pickering]], appointed as President in 1884.

Pickering stepped down in 1887, and in 1889, the title of the office was changed to Commissioner, marking a clear decrease in administrative responsibilities.  Offices were also consolidated to save on salaries.&lt;ref&gt;The President also served as Magistrate and Treasurer.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council itself became less and less functional, and it only narrowly avoided dissolution by appointing two popular local figures, Joseph Romney and Pickering.

==Modern developments==
{{Main|British Overseas Territories}}
[[File:C de Castro and I Fonseca - busts.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The busts of [[Isaac Glanville Fonseca|Isaac Fonseca]] and Carlton de Castro outside of the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|House of Assembly.]]]]
However, in 1901 the Legislative Council ''was'' finally formally dissolved, and the islands were then officially administered through the Governor of the Leeward Islands, who appointed a commissioner and an executive council.  The Territory was not remotely economically prosperous, and social services had deteriorated to vanishing point.  Emigration was extremely high, particularly to St. Thomas and to the [[Dominican Republic]].  Both concern and assistance from Britain was in very short supply, not least because of the two [[World War]]s which were fought during this period.

In 1949 another unlikely hero emerged.  Theodolph H Faulkner was a fisherman from Anegada, who came to Tortola with his pregnant wife.  He had a disagreement with the medical officer, and he went straight to the marketplace and for several nights criticised the government with mounting passion.  His oratory struck a chord, and a movement started.  Led by community leaders such as [[Isaac Glanville Fonseca|Isaac Fonseca]] and Carlton de Castro, on 24 November 1949 a throng of over 1,500 British Virgin Islanders marched on the Commissioner's office and presented their grievances.  They presented a petition which commenced:

:&quot;''We are imbued with a desire to decide our local affairs with our own selves.  We have outgrown that undesirable stage where one official, or an official clique, makes decisions for us... We are seeking the privilege of deciding how our monies are spent and what shall be our Presidential laws and policies.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=209, para 1.40 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950 - Self government===
[[File:Old LegCo Building, Road Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Legislative Council building in Road Town, erected about sixty yards from the market where Faulker roused the crowds.]]
As a result of the demonstrations the previous year, the Legislative Council was reinstituted by the British Government in 1950 under a [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|new constitution]]. The reformation of the Legislative Council is often left as a footnote in the Territory's history - a mere part of the process that led to the more fundamental constitutional government in 1967. The 1950 constitution was in fact always envisaged as a temporary measure (it was famously described by [[McWelling Todman]] QC as “an instrument minimal in its intent and its effect”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.vg/index.php?pageid=6|title=Constitutional &amp; Political Development in the Virgin Islands 1950-2000|publisher=House of Assembly (website)}}&lt;/ref&gt;). But, having been denied any form of democratic control for nearly 50 years, the new Council did not sit idly by. In 1951 external capital was brought in to assist farmers from the Colonial Welfare and Development office. In 1953 the Hotel Aid Act was enacted to boost the nascent [[tourism]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to which [[Fort Burt]] hotel, Treasure Isle hotel and Little Dix Bay (built by [[Laurance Rockefeller]]) were built almost immediately.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1958 the Territory had only 12 miles of motorable roads; over the next 12 years the road system was vastly improved, linking West End to the East End of Tortola, and joining Tortola to [[Beef Island]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, British Virgin Islands|a new bridge]]. The [[Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport|Beef Island airport]] (now renamed after [[Terrance B. Lettsome]]) was built shortly thereafter.

External events also played a factor. In 1956 the [[Leeward Islands Federation]] was abolished. Defederation enhanced the political status of the British Virgin Islands. Jealous of its newly acquired powers, the Council declined to join the new [[Federation of the West Indies]] in 1958, a move that would later be crucial in the development of the [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore finance]] industry.

In 1967 [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|the new constitution]] with a much greater transfer of powers was brought into effect by order in council, and introduced true Ministerial Government to the British Virgin Islands. [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1967|Elections followed in 1967]], and a comparatively young [[Lavity Stoutt]] was elected as the first [[Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]] of the Territory.

===Financial services===
[[File:Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels.jpg|thumb|right|The financial services industry led to surge in growth in the Territory.]]
The fortunes of the Territory dramatically improved in the late twentieth century with the advent of the [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore financial services]] industry.  Former president of the BVI's [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]], [[Michael Riegels]], recites the anecdote that the industry commenced on an unknown date in the 1970s when a lawyer from a firm in New York telephoned him with a proposal to incorporate a [[company (law)|company]] in the British Virgin Islands to take advantage of a [[double taxation]] [[tax treaty|relief treaty]] with the United States.  Within the space of a few years, hundreds of such companies had been incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Virgin Islands Commercial Law |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |location= |isbn=978-962-661-462-4 |page=5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eventually came to the attention of the United States government, who unilaterally revoked the Treaty in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The British Virgin Islands was not alone in this regard; this was part of a policy of mass-repeal by the United States of double tax relief treaties with &quot;[[microstate]]s&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the British Virgin Islands, trying to recapture some of the lost offshore business, enacted a new form of companies legislation, the [[International Business Companies Act]], under which an [[offshore company]] which was exempt from local taxes could be formed.  The development was only a limited success until 1991, when the United States invaded [[Panama]] to oust General [[Manuel Noriega]].  At the time Panama was one of the largest providers of offshore financial services in the world, but the business fled subsequent the invasion, and the British Virgin Islands was one of the main beneficiaries.

In 2000, [[KPMG]] were commissioned by the British Government to produce a report on the offshore financial industry generally, and the report indicated that nearly 41% of the offshore companies in the world were formed in the British Virgin Islands.  The British Virgin Islands is now one of the [[Offshore Financial Centre#List of main offshore financial centres|world's leading offshore financial centres]], and boasts one of the highest incomes per capita in the Caribbean.

==Hurricane Irma==
{{Main|Effects of Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands}}

On 10 September, British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] pledged £32 million to the Caribbean region generally for a Hurricane relief fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/europe/irma-caribbean/|title=European leaders step up Irma relief effort in Caribbean|author1=Hilary Clarke |author2=Samantha Beech|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fourteen days after Hurricane Irma, the Territory was struck again by [[Hurricane Maria]], also a [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category 5 storm]] (albeit not as strong as Irma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/british-virgin-islands-may-face-155mph-winds-with-hurricane-maria|title=British Virgin Islands to face 155mph winds with Hurricane Maria |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the eye of the storm passed to the south of [[Saint Croix]], and the damage was minimal compared to Hurricane Irma.

In May 2018 the Immigration Department of the British Virgin Islands announced that the population of the Territory has dropped by approximately 11% since Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bvinews.com/new/bvis-population-drops-by-4000/|title=BVI's population drops by 4,000 |work=BVI News|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Brunei}}
The '''history of Brunei''' concerns the settlements and societies located on the north coast of the island of [[Borneo]], which has been under the influence of [[Greater India|Indianised kingdoms and empires]] for much of its history. Local scholars assume that the [[Islamisation]] of Brunei started in the fifteenth century, with the formation of the [[Bruneian Empire]], a [[thalassocracy]] which covered the northern part of [[Borneo]] and the southern [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Saunders|2013|pp=60}} At the end of the 17th century, Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by [[Brunei Civil War]], piracy, and European colonial expansion. Later, there was a brief [[Castilian War|war]] with [[Spain]], in which Brunei lost [[Manila]] and evacuated their capital for a brief period until the Spanish withdrew. The empire lost much of its territory with the arrival of the [[Western powers]], such as the Spanish in the [[Philippines]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Labuan]], [[Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]]. The decline of the Bruneian Empire accelerated in the nineteenth century when Brunei gave much of its territory to the [[White Rajahs]] of [[Sarawak]], resulting in its current small landmass and separation into two parts. Sultan [[Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin]] later appealed to the British to stop further annexation in 1888. In the same year, the British signed a &quot;Treaty of Protection&quot; and made Brunei a British protectorate until 1984 when it gained independence and prospered due to the discovery of oil.{{sfn|Abdul Majid|2007|pp=4}}{{sfn|Sidhu|2009|pp=92}}

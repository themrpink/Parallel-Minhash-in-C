Rivaling Buddhism was Taoism, a native Chinese philosophical and religious belief system that found its roots in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (a text attributed to a 6th-century BC figure named [[Lao Tzu]]) and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''. The ruling Li family of the Tang dynasty actually claimed descent from the ancient Lao Tzu.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=60}} On numerous occasions where Tang princes would become crown prince or Tang princesses taking vows as Taoist priestesses, their lavish former mansions would be converted into Taoist [[abbey]]s and places of worship.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=60}} Many Taoists were associated with [[alchemy]] in their pursuits to find an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]] and a means to create gold from concocted mixtures of many other elements.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=81}} Although they never achieved their goals in either of these futile pursuits, they did contribute to the discovery of new metal alloys, porcelain products, and new dyes.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=81}} The historian Joseph Needham labeled the work of the Taoist alchemists as &quot;protoscience rather than pseudoscience.&quot;{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=81}} However, the close connection between Taoism and alchemy, which some [[Sinology|sinologists]] have asserted, is refuted by [[Nathan Sivin]], who states that alchemy was just as prominent (if not more so) in the secular sphere and practiced more often by laymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sivin |first=Nathan |publisher=Variorum |year=1995 |access-date=August 13, 2008 |title=&quot;Taoism and Science&quot; in ''Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in Ancient China'' |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~nsivin/7tao.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623085807/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~nsivin/7tao.html |archive-date = June 23, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tang dynasty also officially recognized various foreign religions. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], otherwise known as the [[Nestorian Church]] or the [[Church of the East in China]], was given recognition by the Tang court. In 781, the [[Nestorian Stele]] was created in order to honor the achievements of their community in China. A Christian monastery was established in Shaanxi province where the [[Daqin Pagoda]] still stands, and inside the pagoda there is Christian-themed artwork. Although the religion largely died out after the Tang, it was revived in China following the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century.{{sfn|Gernet|1962|p=215}}

Although the [[Sogdia]]ns had been responsible for transmitting Buddhism to China from India during the 2nd to 4th centuries, soon afterwards they largely converted to [[Zoroastrianism]] due to their links to [[Sassanid]] Persia.{{sfn|Liu|2001|p=168}} Sogdian merchants and their families living in cities such as Chang'an, Luoyang, and Xiangyang usually built a Zoroastrian temple once their local communities grew larger than 100 households.{{sfn|Howard|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6QPWXrCCzBIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA134 134]}} Sogdians were also responsible for spreading [[Manicheism]] in Tang China and the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uighur Khaganate]]. The Uighurs built the first Manichean monastery in China in 768, yet in 843 the Tang government ordered that the property of all Manichean monasteries be confiscated in response to the outbreak of war with the Uighurs.{{sfn|Liu|2001|pp=168–69}} With the blanket ban on foreign religions two years later, Manicheism was driven underground and never flourished in China again.{{sfn|Liu|2001|p=169}}

Much more than earlier periods, the Tang era was renowned for the time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=149}} Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including [[archery]],{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=39, 170}} hunting,{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=22, 32}} horse [[polo]],{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=16, 90}} [[cuju]] (soccer),{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=151–152}} [[cockfighting]],{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=173–174}} and even [[tug of war]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=152}} Government officials were granted [[Annual leave|vacations]] during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, or 15 days off if the parents lived more than {{convert|167|mi|km|abbr=on}} away (travel time not included).{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=149}} Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the [[nuptial]]s of close relatives (travel time not included).{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=149}} Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=149}}

[[File:Tang Dynasty-Polo Game Relief Block.JPG|thumb|left|A Tang [[sancai]]-glazed carved relief showing horseback riders playing [[polo]]]]

[[Traditional Chinese holidays]] such as [[Chinese New Year]], [[Lantern Festival]], [[Cold Food Festival]], and others were universal holidays. In the capital city of [[Chang'an]] there was always lively celebration, especially for the [[Lantern Festival]] since the city's nighttime [[curfew]] was lifted by the government for three days straight.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=150–154}} Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand [[carnival]]s nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant [[harvest]]s after a long [[drought]] or [[famine]], the granting of [[amnesty|amnesties]], the installment of a new [[crown prince]], etc.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=154–155}} For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=132}} This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=132}} Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=142–147}} A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=143}}

=== Status in clothing ===
In general, garments were made from silk, wool, or linen depending on your social status and what you could afford. Furthermore, there were laws that specified what kinds of clothing could be worn by whom. The color of the clothing also indicated rank. &quot;Purple colored clothes were used by officials above the third grade; light red were meant for officials above the fifth grade; dark green was limited to the sixth grade and above officials; light green was solely for officials above the seventh grade; dark cyan was exclusive for officials above the eighth grade; light cyan garments adorned officials above the ninth grade. The common people and all those who did not reside in the palace were allowed to wear yellow colored clothes.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/tang-dynasty-clothing/|title=The Chinese Tang Dynasty Clothing: Fashion &amp; Dress|last=says|first=Celine|date=November 27, 2011|website=Totally History|language=en-US|access-date=May 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, China's power, culture, economy, and influence were thriving. As a result, women could afford to wear loose-fitting, wide-sleeved garments. Even lower-class women's robes would have sleeves four to five feet in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetangdynasty.org/tang-dynasty-clothing.html|title=Tang Dynasty Clothing – Facts about Tang Chinese Dress|website=thetangdynasty.org|access-date=May 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of women's social rights and social status during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely reserved for urban women of elite status, as men and women in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of [[silk worm]]s, while men tended to farming in the fields.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=32}}

There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Taoist priestesses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=60}} The head mistresses of high-class [[courtesan]]s in the [[Chang'an#East Central Chang'an|North Hamlet]] of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=64–66}} Said [[courtesan]]s, who likely influenced the Japanese [[geisha]]s,{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=64}} were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the [[drinking game]]s, and were trained to have the utmost respectable [[table manners]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=64–66}}

Although they were renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans were known to dominate the conversation among elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much or too loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her).{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=66}} When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=120}}

It was fashionable for women to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the presence of assertive, active women.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=114–115}}{{sfn|Gernet|1962|pp=165–166}} The foreign horse-riding sport of [[polo]] from Persia became a wildly popular trend among the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed [[earthenware]] figurines from the time period portray).{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=114–115}} The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like &quot;an elaborate edifice above the forehead&quot;,{{sfn|Gernet|1962|pp=165–166}} while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes.{{sfn|Gernet|1962|p=165}} Hairstyle and dress of [https://www.lotusgallery.co.uk/antiques/p/tang-female-figurine Tang dynasty] Court lady figures were sculpted and can be reflected on the trend of fashion at the time when Tang dynasty was heavily influenced by Turfan, central Asia. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lotusgallery.co.uk/antiques/p/tang-female-figurine&lt;/ref&gt; A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again in order to promote decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=28–29}}

There were some prominent court women after the era of [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], such as [[Yang Guifei]] (719–756), who had Emperor Xuanzong appoint many of her relatives and cronies to important ministerial and martial positions.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}

During the earlier [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] (420–589), and perhaps even earlier, the drinking of tea (''[[Camellia sinensis]]'') became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=120}} During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet [[Lu Tong]] (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author [[Lu Yu]] (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called ''[[The Classic of Tea]]''.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=95}} Although [[gift wrapping|wrapping paper]] had been used in China since the 2nd century BC,{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=122}} Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.

Earlier, the first recorded use of [[toilet paper]] was made in 589 by the scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591),{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}} and in 851 an [[Arabs|Arab]] traveler commented on how he believed that Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=123}}

In ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, wheat, [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and [[glutinous]] millet.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3–4}} The [[Ming dynasty]] [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]] [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage [[Shennong]] (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was &quot;an uncertain matter&quot;) into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese.{{sfn|Song|1966|pp=3–4}} But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice. In fact, in the Tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern China, but had also become popular in the north, which was for a long time the center of China.{{sfn|Wang Saishi|2003|p=18}}

[[File:Dame Chine Guimet 291003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tomb figure]] of a lady attendant, 7th- to 8th-century; during the Tang era, female hosts prepared feasts, tea parties, and played drinking games with their guests.]]

During the Tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop. As a consequence, wheat cake shared a considerable amount in the staple of Tang.{{sfn|Wang Saishi|2003|p=1}} There were four main kinds of cake: steamed cake, boiled cake, pancake, and Hu cake.
[[File:Plat à offrandes Chine Musée Guimet 2418 1.jpg|thumb|A rounded &quot;offering plate&quot; with design in &quot;three colors&quot; ([[sancai]]) glaze, 8th-century]]

Steamed cake was consumed commonly by both civilians and aristocrats. Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang’an, and its price was also far from expensive. ''Taiping Guangji'' recorded a civilian in Chang'an named Zou Luotuo, who was poor and &quot;often push his cart out selling steamed cake.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Li 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Taiping Guangji|last=Li|first=Fang|publisher=Harbin People Publisher|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiled cake was the staple of the Northern Dynasty, and it kept its popularity in the Tang dynasty. The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy. While aristocrats favored wonton, civilians usually consumed noodles and noodle slice soup, because the process to make wonton was heavy and complicated.{{sfn|Wang Saishi|2003|p=6}}

Pancake was hard to find in China before the Tang. But in the Tang dynasty pancake started becoming popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Junxia|date=2009|title=Analysis of cake food of Chang'an in Han and Tang Dynasty|journal=Tangdu Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many shops in Tang cities selling pancakes. A story in ''Taiping Guangji'' recorded that a merchant in early Tang bought a large vacant lot in Chang’an to set up several shops selling pancake and dumplings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li 1999&quot;/&gt;

Hu cake, which means foreign cake, was extremely popular in Tang.{{sfn|Wang Saishi|2003|p=4}} Hu cake was toasted in oven and covered by sesame. Restaurants in Tang usually treated Hu cake as an indispensable food in their menu. A Japanese Buddhist monk Ennin recorded in ''The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law'' that at that time Hu cake was popular among all civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ennin's Diary: The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law|last=Ennin|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chajing.jpeg|thumb|A page of [[Lu Yu]]'s ''[[The Classic of Tea]]'']]

During the Tang, the many common foodstuffs and cooking ingredients in addition to those already listed were barley, garlic, salt, turnips, soybeans, pears, apricots, peaches, apples, pomegranates, jujubes, rhubarb, hazelnuts, pine nuts, chestnuts, walnuts, yams, taro, etc. The various meats that were consumed included pork, chicken, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] (especially preferred in the north), [[sea otter]], bear (which was hard to catch, but there were recipes for steamed, boiled, and [[marination|marinated]] bear), and even [[Bactrian camel]]s.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=120}} In the south along the coast meat from seafood was by default the most common, as the Chinese enjoyed eating cooked [[jellyfish]] with [[cinnamon]], [[Sichuan pepper]], [[cardamom]], and [[ginger]], as well as [[oyster]]s with wine, fried [[squid]] with ginger and vinegar, [[horseshoe crab]]s and [[Portunus|red swimming crabs]], [[shrimp]] and [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]], which the Chinese called &quot;river piglet&quot;.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=121}}

Some foods were also off-limits, as the Tang court encouraged people not to eat beef (since the bull was a valuable [[working animal]]), and from 831 to 833 [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang]] even banned the slaughter of cattle on the grounds of his religious convictions to [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=125}}

From the trade overseas and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from [[Samarkand]], date palms, pistachios, and figs from [[Greater Iran]], [[pine nut]]s and [[ginseng]] roots from [[Korea]] and [[mango]]es from [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=123}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=1–2}} In China, there was a great demand for sugar; during the reign of [[Harsha]] over [[North India]] (r. 606–647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate [[sugarcane]].{{sfn|Sen|2003|pp=38–40}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=76, 83–84}} [[Cotton]] also came from India as a finished product from [[Bengal]], although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] it became the prime textile fabric in China.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}}

Methods of [[food preservation]] were important, and practiced throughout China. The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, [[brining]], and salting their foods.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=126–127}} The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits. Each year the emperor had laborers carve 1000 blocks of ice from frozen creeks in mountain valleys, each block with the dimension of {{cvt|3|ft|m}} by 3&amp;nbsp;ft by {{cvt|3.5|ft|m}}. Frozen delicacies such as chilled melon were enjoyed during the summer.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=126}}

===Engineering===
[[File:Square mirror with phoenix motif, Tang Dynasty.jpg|thumb|A square [[bronze mirror]] with [[Fenghuang|a phoenix]] motif of gold and silver inlaid with [[lacquer]], 8th-century]]
Technology during the Tang period was built also upon the precedents of the past. Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473–475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473–474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}

There were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&amp;nbsp;ft (0.91&amp;nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:

{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon…the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed…A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}

Yet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the number of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose &quot;wooden otter&quot; could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}

In the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang Lü'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712–756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}

[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]

[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist ''[[dharani]]'' [[sutra]] unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670.{{sfn|Pan|1997|pp=979–980}} The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868.{{sfn|Temple|1986|p=112}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=151}} Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=124–125}} With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} Although the later [[Bi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] [[printing]] in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant [[History of typography in East Asia|printing type in China]] until the more advanced [[printing press]] from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=227}} The first use of the [[playing card]] during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=131–132}}

In the realm of [[cartography]], there were further advances beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547–627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538–540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) in length and 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[Chinese cartography|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]]; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|p=90}}

===Medicine===
The Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, [[History of opium in China|plants]], herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=235}} In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}} Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of sugar in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=132–133}} As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=134–135}} The use of the [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgam]], manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text ''Xinxiu Bencao'' written by Su Gong in 659.&lt;ref name=czarnetzki&gt;{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|author2=Ehrhardt S. |title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===
Chinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of [[underwater diving|underwater divers]], a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=452}} The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Wood|1999|p=49}}

Ever since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport natural gas from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract salt.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=78–79}} During the Tang dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182&amp;nbsp;m (600&amp;nbsp;ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79–80}} These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79–80}}

The inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter and manually powered.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=99, 151, 233}} In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] had a &quot;Cool Hall&quot; built in the imperial palace, which the ''[[Tang Yulin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|唐語林}}) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=134, 151}} During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=151}}

==Historiography==
{{See also|Chinese historiography}}

The first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887–946) et al. of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labeled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007–1072), Song Qi (998–1061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Denis Crispin Twitchett |title=The Writing of Official History Under the T'ang |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-521-41348-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them also rank among the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' of China. One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019–1086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).

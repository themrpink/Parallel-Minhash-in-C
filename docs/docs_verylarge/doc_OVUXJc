On 7 December 1975, the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian Armed Forces launched an invasion of East Timor]]. At 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the two Portuguese corvettes, the NRP ''João Roby'' and NRP ''Afonso Cerqueira'', anchored near Atauro, detected on the radar a high number of unidentified air and naval targets approaching. They soon identified the targets as Indonesian military aircraft and warships, which initiated an assault against Dili. Lemos Pires and his staff then left Atauro, embarked on the Portuguese warships, and headed to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].

The ''João Roby'' and ''Afonso Cerqueira'' were ordered to continue patrolling the waters around the former Portuguese Timor, in preparation of possible military action to respond to the Indonesian invasion, constituting the naval task force UO 20.1.2 (latter renamed FORNAVTIMOR).  Portugal sent a third warship to the region, the NRP ''Oliveira e Carmo'', which arrived on 31 January 1976 and replaced the NRP ''Afonso Cerqueira''.  The Portuguese warships would continue in the region until May 1976, when the remaining NRP ''Oliveira e Carmo'' left, going back to Lisbon, at a time when a military action to expel the Indonesian forces was clearly seen as unviable.

On 17 July 1976, [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesia formally annexed East Timor, declaring it as its 27th province]] and renaming it [[East Timor (province)|Timor Timur]].  The United Nations, however, did not recognise the annexation, continuing to consider Portugal as the legitimate administering power of East Timor.

Following the end of Indonesian occupation in 1999, and [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|a United Nations administered transition period]], East Timor became formally independent in 2002.

==Currency==
[[File:Timorescudo2.jpg|thumb|upright|Portuguese Timor 20 Escudos 1967]]
The first Timorese currency was the [[Portuguese Timorese pataca]], introduced in 1894.

From 1959, the [[Portuguese Timorese escudo]] - linked to the [[Portuguese escudo]] - was used.

In 1975, the currency ceased to exist as East Timor was annexed by Indonesia and began using the [[Indonesian rupiah]].

The '''United States postmaster general''' (PMG) is the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/203&lt;/ref&gt; The postmaster general is responsible for managing and directing the day-to-day operations of the Postal Service.

The postmaster general is selected and appointed by the governors, who had been appointed by the [[president of the United States]] with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], on the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service|Board of Governors of the Postal Service]]. The postmaster general then also sits on the board.&lt;ref&gt;https://about.usps.com/who/leadership/board-governors/&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of the postmaster general does require Senate confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0506-bog-announces-selection-of-louis-dejoy-to-serve-as-nations-75th-postmaster-general.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/202&lt;/ref&gt; The governors and the postmaster general elect the deputy postmaster general.

The current officeholder is [[Louis DeJoy]], who was appointed on June 15, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://about.usps.com/who/leadership/officers/pmg-ceo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The office, in one form or another, dates from before the [[United States Constitution]] and the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], having been based on the much older English and later British position of [[Postmaster_General_of_the_United_Kingdom|Postmaster General]].  [[Benjamin Franklin]] was appointed by the [[Continental Congress]] as the first postmaster general in 1775&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pmg-franklin.pdf |title=Benjamin Franklin — About USPS |date=February 2003 |website=United States Postal Service |publisher=Historian US Postal Service |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006013742/https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pmg-franklin.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2019 |access-date=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving just over 15 months. Franklin had previously served as deputy postmaster for the British colonies of North America since 1753.

Until 1971, the postmaster general was the head of the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] (or simply &quot;Post Office&quot; until the 1820s).&lt;ref name=&quot;History7506&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100.pdf |title=The United States Postal Service: An American History 1775–2006 |date=2020 |publisher=United States Postal Service |isbn=978-0-9630952-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60-65}} During that era, the postmaster general was appointed by the [[president of the United States]], with the [[Advice and Consent Clause|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History7506&quot; /&gt;{{rp|120}} From 1829 to 1971, the postmaster general was a member of the [[President of the United States|president's]] [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]. After the passage of the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] and prior to the passage of the [[Hatch Act of 1939]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1098&amp;context=upk_united_states_history |title=Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945 |first=Sean J. |last=Savage |date=1991 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0813117553 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709184650/https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1098&amp;context=upk_united_states_history |archive-date=July 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the postmaster general was in charge of the governing party's [[patronage]] and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party, as exemplified by [[James Farley]]'s 1933-1940 tenure under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/01/11/archives/farley-and-howe-to-rule-patronage-to-ease-roosevelts-burden-they.html |title=Farley And Howe To Rule Patronage; To Ease Roosevelt's Burden, They Will Meet the Office-seekers at Capital. Working All Next Month. Meantime, Republicans Plan to Reorganize Committees and Start Publicity for 1936. |date=January 11, 1933 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[spoils system]] was reformed, the position remained a Cabinet post, and it was often given to a new president's campaign manager or other key political supporter, including [[Arthur Summerfield]], [[W. Marvin Watson]], and [[Larry O'Brien]] (all of whom played key roles organizing the campaigns of presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, respectively), and was considered something of a [[sinecure]]. Notably, poet and literary scholar [[Charles Olson]] (who served as a [[Democratic National Committee]] official during the [[1944 United States presidential election]]) declined the position in January 1945.

In 1971, the Post Office Department was re-organized into the [[United States Postal Service]], an independent agency of the executive branch, and the postmaster general was no longer a member of the Cabinet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mailboxnearme.net/history-of-usps/ |title=History of the United States Postal Service |website=Mailbox Near Me |language=en |access-date=2019-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor in line of [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]]. The postmaster general is now appointed by the &quot;governors&quot;, appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. The governors, along with the postmaster general and the deputy postmaster general, constitute the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History7506&quot; /&gt;{{rp|120}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/leadership/board-governors.htm |title=About the Board of Governors |website=United States Postal Service |access-date=2018-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927084552/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/leadership/board-governors.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postmaster general is the second-highest paid U.S. government official, based on publicly available salary information, after the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 Highest-Paid Government Jobs |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pf_article_112283.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081942/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pf_article_112283.html |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |website=24/7WallSt.com |accessdate=5 September 2011 |first1=Michael B. |last1=Sauter |first2=Jon C. |last2=Ogg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sartène''' ({{IPA-fr|saʁtɛn}}; {{lang-co|Sartè}}, {{IPA-co|sarˈtɛ|pron}}; {{lang-it|Sartena}}, {{IPA-it|sarˈtɛna|}} or {{lang|it|Sartene}}, {{IPA-it|sarˈtɛne|}}), is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Corse-du-Sud]] on the island of [[Corsica]], [[France]].

Its history dates back to [[medieval]] times and granite buildings from the early 16th century still line some of the streets. One of the main incidents in the town's history was an attack by [[pirates]] from [[Algiers]] in 1583, after which 400 people were taken away. These attacks continued into the 18th century.

[[Image:Sartène Paoli JPG1.jpg|thumb|left|Place de la Liberation|250px]]

The town is centred on the Place de la Liberation (previously the Place Porta), at the edge of which is the church of Sainte Marie. The town allows good views across the valley. Sartene wine is appreciated by wine connoisseurs for its good quality.

Sartene has given its name to one of the southern Corsican dialects a variety of which is the Gallurese spoken in North Sardinia.

Just as the likelihood, given no event, being 1, the log-likelihood, given no event, is 0, which corresponds to the value of the empty sum: without any data, there is no support for any models.

===Likelihood equations===
If the log-likelihood function is [[Smoothness|smooth]], its [[gradient]] with respect to the parameter, known as the [[Score (statistics)|score]] and written &lt;math&gt;s_{n}(\theta) \equiv \nabla_{\theta} \ell_{n}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, exists and allows for the application of [[differential calculus]]. The basic way to maximize a differentiable function is to find the [[stationary point]]s (the points where the [[derivative]] is zero); since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives, but the derivative of a product requires the [[product rule]], it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log-likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events.

The equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as [[estimating equations]] for the maximum likelihood estimator.
:&lt;math&gt;s_{n}(\theta) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
In that sense, the maximum likelihood estimator is implicitly defined by the value at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[inverse function]] &lt;math&gt;s_{n}^{-1}: \mathbb{E}^{d} \to \Theta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;var&gt;d&lt;/var&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Using the [[inverse function theorem]], it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;s_{n}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[well-defined]] in an [[open neighborhood]] about &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; with probability going to one, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{n} = s_{n}^{-1}(\mathbf{0})&lt;/math&gt; is a consistent estimate of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. As a consequence there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \hat{\theta}_{n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s_{n}(\hat{\theta}_{n}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically [[almost surely]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{n} \xrightarrow{\text{p}} \theta_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert V. |last=Foutz |title=On the Unique Consistent Solution to the Likelihood Equations |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=72 |year=1977 |issue=357 |pages=147–148 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1977.10479926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar result can be established using [[Rolle's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert E. |last1=Tarone |first2=Gary |last2=Gruenhage |title=A Note on the Uniqueness of Roots of the Likelihood Equations for Vector-Valued Parameters |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=70 |year=1975 |issue=352 |pages=903–904 |doi=10.1080/01621459.1975.10480321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Kamta |last1=Rai |first2=John |last2=Van Ryzin |title=A Note on a Multivariate Version of Rolle's Theorem and Uniqueness of Maximum Likelihood Roots |journal=Communications in Statistics |series=Theory and Methods |volume=11 |year=1982 |issue=13 |pages=1505–1510 |doi=10.1080/03610928208828325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second derivative evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, known as [[Fisher information]], determines the curvature of the likelihood surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=B. Raja |last=Rao |title=A formula for the curvature of the likelihood surface of a sample drawn from a distribution admitting sufficient statistics |journal=[[Biometrika]] |volume=47 |issue=1–2 |year=1960 |pages=203–207 |doi=10.1093/biomet/47.1-2.203 |mode=cs1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus indicates the [[Precision (statistics)|precision]] of the estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Michael D. |last1=Ward |first2=John S. |last2=Ahlquist |title=Maximum Likelihood for Social Science : Strategies for Analysis |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2018 |pages=25–27 |mode=cs1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exponential families===
{{details|Exponential family}}
The log-likelihood is also particularly useful for [[exponential families]] of distributions, which include many of the common [[parametric model|parametric probability distributions]]. The probability distribution function (and thus likelihood function) for exponential families contain products of factors involving [[exponentiation]]. The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products, again easier to differentiate than the original function.

An exponential family is one whose probability density function is of the form (for some functions, writing &lt;math&gt;\langle -, - \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the [[inner product]]):

:&lt;math&gt; p(x \mid \boldsymbol \theta) = h(x) \exp\Big(\langle \boldsymbol\eta({\boldsymbol \theta}), \mathbf{T}(x)\rangle -A({\boldsymbol \theta}) \Big).&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these terms has an interpretation,{{efn|See {{slink|Exponential family|Interpretation}}}} but simply switching from probability to likelihood and taking logarithms yields the sum:

:&lt;math&gt; \ell(\boldsymbol \theta \mid x) = \langle \boldsymbol\eta({\boldsymbol \theta}), \mathbf{T}(x)\rangle - A({\boldsymbol \theta}) + \log h(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \eta(\boldsymbol \theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; each correspond to a [[change of coordinates]], so in these coordinates, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is given by the simple formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \ell(\boldsymbol \eta \mid x) = \langle \boldsymbol\eta, \mathbf{T}(x)\rangle - A({\boldsymbol \eta}).&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is inner product of the natural parameter {{tmath|\boldsymbol\eta}} and the [[sufficient statistic]] {{tmath|\mathbf{T}(x)}}, minus the normalization factor ([[log-partition function]]) {{tmath|A({\boldsymbol \eta})}}. Thus for example the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by taking derivatives of the sufficient statistic {{math|''T''}} and the log-partition function {{math|''A''}}.

====Example: the gamma distribution====
The [[gamma distribution]] is an exponential family with two parameters, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The likelihood function is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (\alpha, \beta \mid x) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the maximum likelihood estimate of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; for a single observed value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; looks rather daunting. Its logarithm is much simpler to work with:

:&lt;math&gt;\log \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta \mid x) = \alpha \log \beta - \log \Gamma(\alpha) + (\alpha-1) \log x  - \beta x. \, &lt;/math&gt;

To maximize the log-likelihood, we first take the [[partial derivative]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \log \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta \mid x)}{\partial \beta} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} - x.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are a number of independent observations &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the joint log-likelihood will be the sum of individual log-likelihoods, and the derivative of this sum will be a sum of derivatives of each individual log-likelihood:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\partial \log \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta \mid x_1, \ldots, x_n)}{\partial \beta} \\
= {} &amp; \frac{\partial \log \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta \mid x_1)}{\partial \beta} + \cdots + \frac{\partial \log \mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta \mid x_n)}{\partial \beta} = \frac{n \alpha} \beta - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To complete the maximization procedure for the joint log-likelihood, the equation is set to zero and solved for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat\beta = \frac{\alpha}{\bar{x}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\widehat\beta&lt;/math&gt; denotes the maximum-likelihood estimate, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sample mean]] of the observations.

==Background and interpretation==
===Historical remarks===
{{see also|History of statistics|History of probability}}

The term &quot;likelihood&quot; has been in use in English since at least late [[Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;likelihood&quot;, ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Its formal use to refer to a specific [[Function (mathematics)|function]] in mathematical statistics was proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=On the history of maximum likelihood in relation to inverse probability and least squares| first= A. | last=Hald |author-link=Anders Hald |journal=[[Statistical Science]] |volume= 14| issue=2 |year=1999 | pages =214&amp;ndash;222 | doi=10.1214/ss/1009212248 | jstor = 2676741|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009212248 |mode=cs1 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; in two research papers published in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{Cquote|[I]n 1922, I proposed the term ‘likelihood,’ in view of the fact that, with respect to [the parameter], it is not a probability, and does not obey the laws of probability, while at the same time it bears to the problem of rational choice among the possible values of [the parameter] a relation similar to that which probability bears to the problem of predicting events in games of chance. . . .Whereas, however, in relation to psychological judgment, likelihood has some resemblance to probability, the two concepts are wholly distinct. . . .”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Klemens |first=Ben |title=Modeling with Data: Tools and Techniques for Scientific Computing |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |year=2008 |page=329 |mode=cs1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher

{{Cquote|I stress this because in spite of the emphasis that I have always laid upon the difference between probability and likelihood there is still a tendency to treat likelihood as though it were a sort of probability. The first result is thus that there are two different measures of rational belief appropriate to different cases. Knowing the population we can express our incomplete knowledge of, or expectation of, the sample in terms of probability; knowing the sample we can express our incomplete knowledge of the population in terms of likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Fisher's invention of statistical likelihood was in reaction against an earlier form of reasoning called [[inverse probability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Fienberg | first1 = Stephen E | year = 1997 | title = Introduction to R.A. Fisher on inverse probability and likelihood | journal = [[Statistical Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 161 | doi = 10.1214/ss/1030037905 |mode=cs1 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of the term &quot;likelihood&quot; fixed the meaning of the term within mathematical statistics.

[[A. W. F. Edwards]] (1972) established the axiomatic basis for use of the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of relative '''support''' for one hypothesis against another. The '''support function''' is then the natural logarithm of the likelihood function. Both terms are used in [[phylogenetics]], but were not adopted in a general treatment of the topic of statistical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Royall |first=R. |year=1997 |title=Statistical Evidence |publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]] |mode=cs1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations under different foundations===
Among statisticians, there is no consensus about what the [[Foundations of statistics|foundation of statistics]] should be. There are four main paradigms that have been proposed for the foundation: [[frequentism]], [[Bayesianism]], [[likelihoodism]], and [[Akaike information criterion|AIC-based]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BF11&quot; /&gt; For each of the proposed foundations, the interpretation of likelihood is different. The four interpretations are described in the subsections below.

====Frequentist interpretation====
{{empty section|date=March 2019}}

====Bayesian interpretation====
In [[Bayesian inference]], although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or [[random variable]] given another random variable: for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a [[statistical model]] (see [[marginal likelihood]]), given specified data or other evidence,&lt;ref name='good1950'&gt;I.

Lindley: ''Introduction to Probability and Statistics from a Bayesian Viewpoint. Part 1: Probability'' (Cambridge University Press 1980), §1.6&lt;/ref&gt; the likelihood function remains the same entity, with the additional interpretations of (i) a [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional density]] of the data given the parameter (since the parameter is then a random variable) and (ii) a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model.&lt;ref name='good1950'/&gt;&lt;ref name='jeffreys1983'/&gt;&lt;ref name='jaynes2003'/&gt;&lt;ref name='lindley1980'/&gt;&lt;ref name='gelmanetal2014'&gt;A.

Rubin: ''Bayesian Data Analysis'' (3rd ed., Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC 2014), §1.3&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the introduction of a probability structure on the parameter space or on the collection of models, it is possible that a parameter value or a statistical model have a large likelihood value for given data, and yet have a low ''probability'', or vice versa.&lt;ref name='jaynes2003'/&gt;&lt;ref name='gelmanetal2014'/&gt; This is often the case in medical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=H.

====Likelihoodist interpretation====
{{more footnotes|date=April 2019}}
In frequentist statistics, the likelihood function is itself a [[statistic]] that summarizes a single sample from a population, whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''p'' is the count of parameters in some already-selected [[statistical model]]. The value of the likelihood serves as a figure of merit for the choice used for the parameters, and the parameter set with maximum likelihood is the best choice, given the data available.

The specific calculation of the likelihood is the probability that the observed sample would be assigned, assuming that the model chosen and the values of the several parameters '''''&amp;theta;''''' give an accurate approximation of the [[frequency distribution]] of the population that the observed sample was drawn from. Heuristically, it makes sense that a good choice of parameters is those which render the sample actually observed the maximum possible ''post-hoc'' probability of having happened. [[Wilks' theorem]] quantifies the heuristic rule by showing that the difference in the logarithm of the likelihood generated by the estimate’s parameter values and the logarithm of the likelihood generated by population’s &quot;true&quot; (but unknown) parameter values is [[chi-squared distribution|&amp;chi;² distributed]].

Each independent sample's maximum likelihood estimate is a separate estimate of the &quot;true&quot; parameter set describing the population sampled. Successive estimates from many independent samples will cluster together with the population’s &quot;true&quot; set of parameter values hidden somewhere in their midst. The difference in the logarithms of the maximum likelihood and adjacent parameter sets’ likelihoods may be used to draw a [[confidence region]] on a plot whose co-ordinates are the parameters ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The region surrounds the maximum-likelihood estimate, and all points (parameter sets) within that region differ at most in log-likelihood by some fixed value. The [[chi-squared distribution|&amp;chi;² distribution]] given by [[Wilks' theorem]] converts the region's log-likelihood differences into the &quot;confidence&quot; that the population's &quot;true&quot; parameter set lies inside. The art of choosing the fixed log-likelihood difference is to make the confidence acceptably high while keeping the region acceptably small (narrow range of estimates).

As more data are observed, instead of being used to make independent estimates, they can be combined with the previous samples to make a single combined sample, and that large sample may be used for a new maximum likelihood estimate. As the size of the combined sample increases, the size of the likelihood region with the same confidence shrinks. Eventually, either the size of the confidence region is very nearly a single point, or the entire population has been sampled; in both cases, the estimated parameter set is essentially the same as the population parameter set.

====AIC-based interpretation====
{{expand section|date=March 2019}}
Under the [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] paradigm, likelihood is interpreted within the context of [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=H. |last=Akaike |author-link=Hirotugu Akaike | contribution = Prediction and entropy | pages=1–24 | title= A Celebration of Statistics | editor1-first= A.

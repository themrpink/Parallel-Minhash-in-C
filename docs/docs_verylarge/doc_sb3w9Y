Signature formatting has been the subject of [[WP:RFC|Requests for Comment]], and has also resulted in some very heated debates. In one case a user who refused to cease using &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; as a signature was [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/-Ril-#Sig change|required to change it]] by the Arbitration Committee. This is an extreme measure for refusal to cooperate with reasonable requests, and should be considered a last resort. When dealing with potentially problematic signatures, simply being [[WP:POLITE|polite]] is often sufficient and can prevent the situation from escalating into a [[WP:DISPUTE|dispute]].

=== Appearance and color ===
{{Policy section|WP:SIGAPP|WP:Appearance and color}}
{{nutshell|title=This section|Make sure that your signature is easily readable and does not cause disruption to other editors.}}
'''Your signature must not blink, scroll, or otherwise cause inconvenience to or annoy other editors.'''
* Avoid markup such as {{Tag|big|o}} and {{Tag|span|params=style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;|o}}&lt;sup&gt;(or more)&lt;/sup&gt; tags (which {{Big|enlarge}} text); this is likely to disrupt the way that surrounding text displays.
* Do not add line breaks ({{Tag|br|s}}), which can also negatively affect nearby text display. The use of [[non-breaking space]]s to ensure that the signature displays on one line is recommended.
* Be sparing with [[subscript and superscript]]. In some cases, this type of script can also affect the way that surrounding text is displayed.
* Do not make your signature so small that it is difficult to read.
* As some users have vision problems, be sparing with color. If you use different colors in your signature, please ensure that the result will be readable by people with [[color blindness]], defective color vision, and other visual disabilities.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] specify a [[contrast ratio]] of ''at least'' 4.5:1 for text, and [[WP:COLOR]] requires 7:1 &quot;where feasible&quot;. To use named CSS colors on a white background, refer to [[MOS:ONWHITE]] for recommended colors. For other usage, use this [http://www.msfw.com/Services/ContrastRatioCalculator Contrast ratio calculator] to help determine if the colors will be visible to everyone. Signatures do not always appear on white backgrounds. Other colors for calculations range from the [[WP:Skin|Monobook skin's]] very pale blue ({{Color box|#F8FCFF|#F8FCFF}}) to the closed discussion [[Template:hat|Hidden archive]] tan ({{Color box|#F2DFCE|#F2DFCE}}) title bar. Other tools for checking contrast are described at [[WP:COLOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do not include horizontal rules (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or {{Tag|hr|s}}).
* Do not include {{tag|div}}s because those cause the surrounding text to make a new line.
For guidance on how to use color and other effects to customize the appearance of your signature, see [[Wikipedia:Signature tutorial|this tutorial]].
; Notes: 
{{Reflist|group=note}}

=== Font tags ===
{{shortcut|WP:SIGFONT}}
{{tag|font}} tags were deprecated in [[HTML4]] and are entirely obsolete in [[HTML5]]. This means that the popular browsers may drop support for them at some point. Wikipedia is already preparing for this by [[lint (software)|delinting]] code project-wide through [[Wikipedia:Linter|Linter]]. When support finally is dropped, the tags will be ignored in all signatures; any properties such as color and font family will revert to their default values. For this reason, it is recommended that you use {{tag|span}} tags and CSS properties instead. For usage examples, see [[Wikipedia:Signature tutorial#Real-life examples|Wikipedia:Signature tutorial § Real-life examples]]. You may request additional coding assistance at [[Wikipedia:Help desk]].

A change to your signature definition does not affect signatures created before then. Therefore, if you currently use {{tag|font}} tags in your signature, switching to {{tag|span}} tags now will reduce the number of your signatures (including those in the archives of talk spaces) that will render incorrectly after the browsers drop support for {{tag|font}}. Moreover, [[WP:REFACTOR|refactoring]] old signatures from you and other users (including in archive pages) by changing {{tag|font|o}} tags to {{tag|span|o}} tags can help prepare the project for this eventual loss of support.

=== Images ===
{{policy section|WP:SIGIMAGE}}
{{See also|Phabricator:T8379}}
'''Images of any kind must not be used in signatures for the following reasons:'''
* They are an unnecessary drain on server resources, and could cause server slowdown
* A new image can be uploaded in place of the one you chose, making your signature a target for possible vandalism and [[denial-of-service attack]]s
* They make pages more difficult to read and scan
* They make it more difficult to copy text from a page
* They are potentially distracting from the actual content
* Images do not scale with the text, making the lines with images higher than those without them
* They clutter up the &quot;file links&quot; list on the respective image's page every time one signs on a different talk page
* Images in signatures give undue prominence to a given user's contribution

=== &lt;span id=&quot;LENGTH&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Length ===
{{Shortcut|WP:SIGLEN|WP:SIGLENGTH}}
'''Keep signatures short, both in display and in markup.'''

Extremely long signatures with a lot of HTML/wiki markup make page editing and discussion more difficult for the following reasons:
* Signatures that take up more than two or three lines in the edit window clutter the page and make it harder to distinguish posts from signatures.
* Long signatures give undue prominence to a given user's contribution.
* Signatures that occupy more space than necessary in the edit box displace meaningful comments, thus forcing editors to scroll when writing their replies.
* The presence of such long signatures in the discussion also disrupts the reading of comments when editors are formulating their replies.

The software will automatically truncate both plain and raw signatures to 255 characters of '''code''' in the Signature field. If [[#NT|substitution]] of templates or another page is used, please be careful to verify that your signature does not violate the 255-character length limit when the templates are expanded, as the software will not do this automatically.

=== Overriding custom signatures ===
==== &lt;span id=&quot;Signature minimisation&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Unclutter signature minimiser ====
[[File:Keφr's Unclutter signature minimiser.png|thumb|right|Custom-styled Unclutter and [[Wikipedia:Comments in Local Time|Comments in Local Time]] reformatting signatures and timestamps in a Wikipedia discussion.]]
If you prefer not to see other users' custom signatures, you can use the custom [[JavaScript]] module ''Unclutter''. By default, Unclutter scans non-special non-article pages for timestamped signatures, wraps them up and replaces with a text of the form:

: &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot; style=&quot;background: rgba(0,0,0,.05);&quot;&gt;— [[User:Example|Example]] (annotation) &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Example|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Example|ctb]] • [[Special:Log/Example|act]] • [{{fullurl:Special:Log|page=User:Example}} log] • [[#Signature minimisation|sig]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This technique displays the actual username to you and is extensively configurable. It doesn't affect how anyone else sees the signatures. See [[User:Kephir/gadgets/unclutter]] for more details.

'''Note:''' while this script works in practice for most signatures found on the English Wikipedia, there are [[User:Kephir/gadgets/unclutter#Limitations|several unavoidable limitations]] which make Unclutter fail to recognise every possible signature. Signatures which violate policies laid out on this page may not be recognised. Unclutter is not an excuse to violate or decline to enforce the signature policy.

==== Using custom CSS ====
[[File:manage enwiki signatures with css - thumbnail.png|thumb|right|Overriding custom signature formatting ([[:File:manage enwiki signatures with css.png|→more examples]])]]
It's also possible to use your personal [[Special:MyPage/common.css|common.css]] style sheet to override the formatting of other users' signatures.

This allows you to decide how links to user pages should be displayed to you when you are logged-in. For example, you could highlight &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: #6633ff; color: #ffffff;&quot;&gt;Your username&lt;/span&gt; in bold reversed mauve and &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal; color: #6633ff; &quot;&gt;Other signatures&lt;/span&gt; in normal mauve. This approach works by reversing a variety of commonly used signature formatting techniques, but it doesn't attempt to replace the text content of the signature. For example, if &lt;code&gt;[[User:Example]]&lt;/code&gt; has customized their signature to read &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #804; color: #fa0;&quot;&gt;Ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal; background-color: inherit; color: #5b2;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic; background-color: #804; color: #fa0;&quot;&gt;mple&lt;/span&gt;, changing the formatting would display &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal; color: #6633ff; &quot;&gt;Ex@mple&lt;/span&gt; rather than their actual name &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal; color: #6633ff; &quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt;.

No other users will see your custom effects. You can remove or modify them at any time by changing the instructions in your style sheet. The change will apply to all pages regardless of how old they may be. For an example stylesheet, see [[User:Pointillist/reformat-signatures.css]].

== &lt;span id=&quot;LINK&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Links ==
{{shortcut|WP:SIGLINK}}
=== Internal links ===

Signatures must include at least one direct internal link to your [[WP:user page|user page]], user talk page, or contributions page; this allows other editors easy access to your talk page and contributions log. The lack of such a link is widely viewed as obstructive.

If, while making modifications, you accidentally disable this link, see [[Help:How to fix your signature]]. When you insert your signature on your talk page or user page, a link to that page will appear black, bold and inactive, so test your signature elsewhere, such as the [[Draft:Sandbox|Sandbox]].

=== &lt;span id=&quot;DL&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Disruptive links ===
{{shortcut|WP:SIG#DL}}
It is better to put information on your user page rather than in your signature. Brief additional internal links are generally tolerated when used to facilitate communication or to provide general information, but undesirable if seen as [[Wikipedia:canvassing|canvassing]] for some purpose.

Do not place any disruptive internal links (especially when combined with custom formatting, for example &lt;span style=&quot;color:#002BB8; cursor:pointer; vertical-align:super;&quot; title=&quot;this is just an example, and does not link to anything&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE!!!&lt;/span&gt;) in your signature.

=== &lt;span id=&quot;EL&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;External links ===
{{shortcut|WP:SIG#EL}}
'''Do not include links to external websites in your signature.'''

Mass posting of links to a particular website is strongly discouraged on Wikipedia. Posting a link to an external website with each comment you make on a talk page could be taken as link spamming, or an attempt to improve your website's ranking on search engines (which doesn't actually work in the first place). If you want to tell other Wikipedians about a website with which you are associated, you can do so on your user page.

&lt;div id=&quot;NoTemplates&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;NT&quot;&gt;

===Transclusion of templates (or other pages)===
{{shortcut|WP:SIG#NoTemplates|WP:SIG#NT}}
* [[Wikipedia:Transclusion|Transclusions]] of [[Wikipedia:Template namespace|templates]], [[WP:LUA|Lua modules]], [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|parser functions]], and [[Wikipedia:TemplateStyles|TemplateStyles]] in signatures (like those which appear as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Name/sig}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;templatestyles ... /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are forbidden for the following reasons:
** Certain automated scripts (bots) are used to automatically archive particularly active talk pages. These bots read the source of the talk page, but don't transclude templates, and so don't recognize the template as a signature.
** Signature templates are vandalism targets, and will be forever, even if the user leaves the project.
** Signature templates are a small but unnecessary drain on the servers. Transcluded signatures require extra processing—whenever you change your signature source, all talk pages you have posted on must be [[Web cache|re-cached]].
** [[WP:PING|User mention notifications]] will not work if the mentioning user's signature is contained in a template.
* [[WP:SUBST|Substitutions]] of templates in signatures is permissible but &lt;u&gt;discouraged&lt;/u&gt;, as the template that is substituted may be vandalized without the user knowing.
** Users who choose to substitute their signature are '''required''' to be '''highly vigilant''' of their signature whenever they sign.
** Substitution must not be used to circumvent the normal restrictions on signature content, including the use of [[#Images|images]], [[#Appearance and color|obnoxious markup]], or [[#LENGTH|excessive length]].

Simple text signatures, which are stored along with the page content and use no more resources than the comments themselves, avoid these problems.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;NoCAT&quot;&gt;

=== Categories ===
{{shortcut|WP:SIG#NoCAT}}
Signatures must not contain [[Help:Category|categories]]. Categorizing talk pages by who has edited them is unhelpful, and the same information can be found by using [[Help:User contributions|your contributions list]]. Many of the various [[Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters|edit counting utilities]] also provide this data.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;Non-Latin&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;NL&quot;&gt;

== Non-Latin usernames ==
{{see also|Wikipedia:Username policy#Usernames with non-Latin characters}}
{{shortcut|WP:NLS|WP:SIG#NL|WP:SIG#Non-Latin}}

Editors with non-[[Latin alphabet|Latin]] usernames are welcome to edit in Wikipedia. However, non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Indic scripts, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Thai and others,&lt;!--Please expand/reduce as you see fit--&gt; are illegible to most other contributors of the English Wikipedia. Not everyone uses a keyboard that has immediate access to non-Latin characters, and names that cannot be pronounced cannot be retained in memory. As a courtesy to the rest of the contributors, users with such usernames are encouraged to sign their posts (at least in part) with Latin characters. For an example refer to [[User:Παράδειγμα]], who signs his posts as ''Παράδειγμα/Paradigma''.

A signature consisting of or ending with characters from a right-to-left script will appear (in modern browsers) when viewing pages as
:''--DD ,HH:MM NAME Month YYYY''
e.g.,
: --18 ,23:58 &amp;lrm;שֵׁם&amp;lrm; May 2016
and similarly misordered text in the edit box. Adding a [[Left-to-right mark|left-to-right marker symbol]], at the end of the raw signature (HTML code: &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lrm;&lt;/code&gt;), will resolve this. Or, if you include both Latin and a right-to-left script, such as Hebrew or Arabic, in your signature, consider putting Latin second, where it will be directly next to the timestamp.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Dealing with unsigned comments ==
{{Redirect|WP:UNSIGNED|the actual template|Template:Unsigned}}
{{shortcut|WP:UNSIGNED}}
The templates {{tl|unsigned}} and {{tl|unsignedIP}} can be used at the end of an unsigned comment to attach the username or IP to the comment. None of these templates automatically populate (fill in) the name or IP of the poster and the time of the post. That information is best copied from the history page and pasted into the following templates. '''Note''': All of the unsigned templates must be [[WP:SUBST|substituted]].

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;username or IP&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned|Example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsigned|Example|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;username or IP&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned|Example|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsigned|Example|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;IP address&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP|127.0.0.1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsignedIP|127.0.0.1|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;IP address&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP|127.0.0.1|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsignedIP|127.0.0.1|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)|demo=yes}}
|}

The templates {{tl|unsigned2}} and {{tl|unsignedIP2}} do almost the same as {{tl|unsigned}} and {{tl|unsignedIP}} when used with two parameters, but the ordering of the parameters is reversed. The resulting display is the same. These templates may be useful when copying and pasting from the edit history, where the timestamp appears before the username.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned2|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;username or ip&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsigned2|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;nowiki&gt;|Example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsigned2|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)|Example|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP2|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;IP address&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:unsignedIP2|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|127.0.0.1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{unsignedIP2|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}|127.0.0.1|demo=yes}}
|}

The template {{tl|xsign}} is a wrapper for {{tl|unsigned}} and {{tl|unsignedIP}} that will parse the username and date string copied and pasted directly from the edit history. The resulting display is the same.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xsign|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date/username string&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xsign|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} Example}}&lt;/code&gt;
|{{xsign|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} Example|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xsign|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date/IP string&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:xsign|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} 127.0.0.1}}&lt;/code&gt;
|{{xsign|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} 127.0.0.1|demo=yes}}
|}

It is also a good idea to notify users, especially new users, that they should sign their comments. You may use the template {{tl|uw-tilde}} on the user's talk page or one of the [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace#Welcoming new users|welcome messages]] for new users.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:uw-tilde}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:uw-tilde}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{uw-tilde|demo=yes}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:uw-tilde|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;Article&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;Additional text&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:uw-tilde|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Article name&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;Comments go here.}}&lt;/code&gt;
|{{uw-tilde|Article name|Comments go here.|demo=yes}}
|}

Also, the template {{tl|undated}} can be used at the end of comments where the user gave his or her username but no timestamp:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:undated|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;date&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:undated|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|{{undated|{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)|demo=yes}}
|}

=== Automatic adding of signatures ===

The [[wp:bots|bot]] [[User:SineBot|SineBot]] signs comments on talkpages and pages in [[:Category:Non-talk pages that are automatically signed]], for unregistered users and users who have fewer than 800 edits. To re-enable autosigning of your unsigned comments, you can place {{tl|YesAutosign}} on your [[wp:user page|user page]] or user talk page.

== Dealing with problematic signatures ==
{{shortcut|WP:SIGPROB}}
Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Username policy|Username policy]] describes accepted practices and behavior in naming and operating a user account on Wikipedia that apply to both usernames and signatures. A purpose of your signature is to identify you as a contributor. If your signature is unnecessarily confusing, editors may request that you change it. Our guidelines for talk page usage also [[WP:TPO|permit editors to change signatures that contravene this guideline back to the standard form]]. An editor with a confusing signature may be blocked sooner than usual for other inappropriate behavior such as disruption or vandalism, if their confusing signature contributes to the disruption.

{{anchor|confusing}}Signatures that link to, but do not display, the user's username (for example by signing with a nickname, as in &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|User:Nickname]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|Nickname]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;) can be confusing for editors (particularly newcomers). The actual username always appears in the page history, so using just the nickname on the relevant talk page can make your signed comments appear to be from a different person. Alternatives include [[WP:CHU|changing your username]] and including your account name in addition to the username, e.g., in the form &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|User:Example]]/Nickname&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;.

The timestamp must adhere to the system-generated format (&lt;code&gt;HH:MM, D MM YYYY (UTC)&lt;/code&gt;) and must not be customized. This is necessary for clear communications and for archiving bots to function correctly&lt;!-- as well as gadgets and the soon-WMF talk pages improvement work --&gt;. Timestamps that are customized may be considered disruptive and editors using them may be blocked accordingly.

Persistent failure to sign after being reminded may become disruptive and be subject to sanctions.

==History==
[[UseModWiki]], the wiki software in use on the English Wikipedia from its inception to 25 January 2002, did not have markup to create a signature, so signatures had to be made manually where desired. (c.f., for example, several such signatures in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Larry_Sanger/old&amp;oldid=6644889 this diff] ''et al.'') The modern tilde feature was a part of the earliest MediaWiki coding from mid-2001; the original developer of MediaWiki, [[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]], intended it to resemble scribbled physical signatures like that of his father.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;See [https://twitter.com/MagnusManske/status/1083507467802365952 this Twitter exchange] for further information.&lt;/ref&gt; Images in signatures have been banned since 2006, but had been discouraged beforehand.

The concept of {{strong|not}} signing one's contributions to the main namespace has also not always been here. The first ever revision to the page [[WikiPedia]], from 15 January 2001, indicated that &quot;You can [write an article] anonymously or give yourself credit,&quot; and indeed several pages from early 2001 have signatures at the end of them, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AlchemY&amp;oldid=233236 here] and [https://reagle.org/joseph/2010/wp/redux/TestThreePhasePumps/981560160.html here].

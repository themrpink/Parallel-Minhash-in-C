Watching plays became very popular during the Tudor period. Most towns sponsored plays enacted in town squares followed by the actors using the courtyards of taverns or inns (referred to as inn-yards) followed by the first theatres (great open-air amphitheatres and then the introduction of indoor theatres called playhouses). This popularity was helped by the rise of great playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] using London theatres such as the [[Globe Theatre]]. By 1595, 15,000 people a week were watching plays in London. It was during Elizabeth's reign that the first real theatres were built in England. Before theatres were built, actors travelled from town to town and performed in the streets or outside inns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/entertainment.html |title=Tudor Entertainment |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618130140/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/entertainment.html |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miracle plays were local re-enactments of stories from the Bible. They derived from the old custom of [[mystery play]]s, in which stories and fables were enacted to teach lessons or educate about life in general. They influenced Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theresa Coletti |title=The Chester Cycle in Sixteenth-Century Religious Culture |journal=Journal of Medieval &amp; Early Modern Studies |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=531–547 |doi=10.1215/10829636-2007-012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festivals were popular seasonal entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;François Laroque (1993) ''Shakespeare's festive world: Elizabethan seasonal entertainment and the professional stage'', Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521457866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
There were many different types of Elizabethan sports and entertainment. Animal sports included [[bear baiting|bear]] and [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cock fighting]].

The rich enjoyed [[tennis]], [[fencing]], and [[jousting]]. Hunting was strictly limited to the upper class. They favoured their packs of dogs and hounds trained to chase foxes, hares and boars. The rich also enjoyed hunting small game and birds with hawks, known as [[falconry]].

====Jousting====
Jousting was an upscale, very expensive sport where warriors on horseback raced toward each other in full armor trying to use their lance to knock the other off his horse. It was a violent sport--[[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] of France was killed in a tournament in 1559, as were many lesser men. King Henry VIII was a champion; he finally retired from the lists after a hard fall left him unconscious for hours.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Barber and Juliet Barker,  ''Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages'' (Boydell Press, 1998) {{ISBN|0851157815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports included archery, bowling, hammer-throwing, quarter-staff contests, [[troco]], [[quoits]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], wrestling and [[mob football]].

====Gambling and card games====
Dice was a popular activity in all social classes.  Cards appeared in Spain and Italy about 1370, but they probably came from Egypt. They began to spread throughout Europe and came into England around 1460. By the time of Elizabeth's reign, gambling was a common sport. Cards were not played only by the upper class. Many of the lower classes had access to playing cards. The card suits tended to change over time. The first Italian and Spanish decks had the same suits: Swords, Batons/ Clubs, Cups, and Coins. The suits often changed from country to country. England probably followed the Latin version, initially using cards imported from Spain but later relying on more convenient supplies from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daines Barrington|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=London|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the decks that have survived use the French Suit: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Yet even before Elizabeth had begun to reign, the number of cards had been standardized to 52 cards per deck. The lowest court subject in England was called the “knave.” The lowest court card was therefore called the knave until later when the term “Jack” became more common. Popular card games included Maw, One and Thirty, Bone-ace. (These are all games for small group players.) Ruff and Honors was a team game.

===Festivals, holidays and celebrations===
[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey.png|right|thumb|300px|A wedding feast, c. 1569.]]

During the Elizabethan era, people looked forward to holidays because opportunities for leisure were limited, with time away from hard work being restricted to periods after church on Sundays. For the most part, leisure and festivities took place on a public church holy day. Every month had its own holiday, some of which are listed below:
* The first Monday after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] of January (any time between 7 January and 14 January) was [[Plough Monday]]. It celebrated returning to work after the Christmas celebrations and the New Year.
* 2 February: [[Candlemas]]. Although often still very cold, Candlemas was celebrated as the first day of spring. All Christmas decorations were burned on this day, in candlelight and torchlight processions.
* 14 February: [[Valentine's day|Valentine's Day]].
* Between 3 March and 9 March: [[Shrove Tuesday]] (known as [[Mardi Gras]] or Carnival on the Continent). On this day, apprentices were allowed to run amok in the city in mobs, wreaking havoc, because it supposedly cleansed the city of vices before [[Lent]]. &lt;br /&gt;The day after Shrove Tuesday was [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of Lent when all were to abstain from eating and drinking certain things.&lt;br /&gt;24 March: [[Lady Day]] or the feast of the Annunciation, the first of the [[quarter days|Quarter Days]] on which rents and salaries were due and payable. It was a legal New Year when courts of law convened after a winter break, and it marked the supposed moment when the Angel [[Gabriel]] came to announce to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she would bear a child.
* 1 May: [[May day|May Day]], celebrated as the first day of summer. This was one of the few Celtic festivals with no connection to Christianity and patterned on [[Beltane]]. It featured crowning a [[May Queen]], a [[green man|Green Man]] and dancing around a [[maypole]].
* 21 June: [[Midsummer]] (Christianized as the feast of [[John the Baptist]]) and another Quarter Day.
* 1 August: [[Lammas]]tide, or Lammas Day. Traditionally, the first day of August, in which it was customary to bring a loaf of bread to the church.
* 29 September: [[Michaelmas]]. Another Quarter Day. Michaelmas celebrated the beginning of autumn, and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]].
* 25 October: [[St. Crispin's Day]]. Bonfires, revels, and an elected 'King Crispin' were all featured in this celebration. Dramatized by Shakespeare in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.&lt;br /&gt;28 October: [[Lord Mayor's Show|The Lord Mayor's Show]], which still takes place today in London.&lt;br /&gt;31 October: [[All Hallows Eve]] or [[Halloween]]. The beginning celebration of the days of the dead.
* 1 November: [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows]] or [[All Saints' Day]], followed by [[All Souls' Day]].
* 17 November: [[Accession Day]] or Queen's Day, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, celebrated with lavish [[Accession Day tilt|court festivities featuring jousting]] during her lifetime and as a national holiday for dozens of years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146–151&lt;/ref&gt;
* 24 December: The [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] started at sundown and lasted until [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] on 6 January. Christmas was the last of the Quarter Days for the year.

[[File:Libretto Cover Andrea Chenier.jpg|thumb|Cover of a 1921 libretto for [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]]'s ''[[Andrea Chénier]]'']]
A '''libretto''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for &quot;booklet&quot;) is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[masque]], [[oratorio]], [[cantata]] or [[Musical theatre|musical]]. The term ''libretto'' is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], [[requiem]] and sacred cantata, or the story line of a [[ballet]].

''Libretto'' ({{IPA-it|liˈbretto|pron}}; plural ''libretti'' {{IPA-it|liˈbretti|}}), from [[Italian language|Italian]], is the diminutive of the word ''[[wiktionary:libro#Italian|libro]]'' (&quot;book&quot;). Sometimes other-language equivalents are used for libretti in that language, ''livret'' for French works and ''Textbuch'' for German. A libretto is distinct from a synopsis or [[scenario]] of the plot, in that the libretto contains all the words and stage directions, while a synopsis summarizes the plot. Some [[ballet]] historians also use the word ''libretto'' to refer to the 15–40 page books which were on sale to 19th century ballet audiences in Paris and contained a very detailed description of the ballet's story, scene by scene.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example {{harvnb|Smith|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the '''librettist''' (that is, the writer of a libretto) to the [[composer]] in the creation of a musical work has varied over the centuries, as have the sources and the writing techniques employed.

In the context of a modern English language musical theatre piece, the libretto is often referred to as the [[Musical theatre#Book musicals|book]] of the work, though this usage typically excludes sung lyrics.

==Relationship of composer and librettist==
[[File:Mascagni and Librettists.jpg|thumb|The composer of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', [[Pietro Mascagni]], flanked by his librettists, [[Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti]] and [[Guido Menasci]]]]

Libretti for operas, [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s in the 17th and 18th centuries were generally written by someone other than the composer, often a well-known poet.

Pietro Trapassi, known as [[Metastasio]] (1698–1782) was one of the most highly regarded librettists in Europe. His libretti were set many times by many different composers. Another noted 18th-century librettist was [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. He wrote the libretti for three of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas, and for many other composers as well. [[Eugène Scribe]] was one of the most prolific librettists of the 19th century, providing the words for works by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] (with whom he had a lasting collaboration), [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. The French writers' duo [[Henri Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Halévy]] wrote many [[opera]] and [[operetta]] libretti for the likes of [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Georges Bizet]]. [[Arrigo Boito]], who wrote libretti for, among others, [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Amilcare Ponchielli]], also composed two operas of his own.

The libretto is not always written before the music. Some composers, such as [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Serov]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] and [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]] wrote passages of music without text and subsequently had the librettist add words to the vocal melody lines. (This has often been the case with American popular song and musicals in the 20th century, as with [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]'s collaboration, although with the later team of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] the [[lyrics]] were generally written first, which was Rodgers' preferred modus operandi.)

Some composers wrote their own libretti. [[Richard Wagner]] is perhaps most famous in this regard, with his transformations of Germanic legends and events into epic subjects for his operas and music dramas. [[Hector Berlioz]], too, wrote the libretti for two of his best-known works, ''[[La Damnation de Faust]]'' and ''[[Les Troyens]]''. [[Alban Berg]] adapted [[Georg Büchner]]'s play ''[[Woyzeck]]'' for the libretto of ''[[Wozzeck]]''.

[[File:Ernani Libretto 1859.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pages from an 1859 libretto for ''[[Ernani]]'', with the original Italian lyrics, English translation and musical notation for one of the arias]]
Sometimes the libretto is written in close collaboration with the composer; this can involve adaptation, as was the case with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and his librettist {{ill|Vladimir Ivanovich Belsky|ru|Бельский, Владимир Иванович|de|Wladimir Iwanowitsch Belski}}, or an entirely original work. In the case of musicals, the music, the lyrics and the &quot;book&quot; (i.e., the spoken dialogue and the stage directions) may each have its own author. Thus, a musical such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' has a composer ([[Jerry Bock]]), a lyricist ([[Sheldon Harnick]]) and the writer of the &quot;book&quot; ([[Joseph Stein]]). In rare cases, the composer writes everything except the dance arrangements – music, lyrics and libretto, as [[Lionel Bart]] did for ''[[Oliver!]]''.

Other matters in the process of developing a libretto parallel those of spoken [[drama]]s for stage or screen. There are the preliminary steps of selecting or suggesting a subject and developing a sketch of the action in the form of a [[scenario]], as well as revisions that might come about when the work is in production, as with out-of-town tryouts for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals, or changes made for a specific local audience. A famous case of the latter is Wagner's 1861 revision of the original 1845 [[Semperoper|Dresden]] version of his opera ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' for Paris.

==Literary characteristics==

The opera libretto from its inception (ca. 1600) was written in verse, and this continued well into the 19th century, although genres of musical theatre with spoken dialogue have typically alternated verse in the musical numbers with spoken prose. Since the late 19th century some opera composers have written music to prose or free verse libretti. Much of the [[recitative]]s of [[George Gershwin]]'s opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', for instance, are merely [[DuBose Heyward|DuBose]] and [[Dorothy Heyward]]'s play ''[[Porgy (play)|Porgy]]'' set to music as written – in prose – with the lyrics of the [[aria]]s, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s and [[refrain|choruses]] written in verse.

The libretto of a musical, on the other hand, is almost always written in prose (except for the song lyrics). The libretto of a musical, if the musical is adapted from a play (or even a novel), may even borrow their source's original dialogue liberally – much as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' used dialogue from [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' used dialogue from [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' took most of its dialogue word-for-word from [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' was adapted from the 1959 television play ''[[I, Don Quixote]]'', which supplied most of the dialogue, and the 1954 musical version of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' used [[J. M. Barrie]]'s dialogue. Even the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'', which is greatly different from the [[Show Boat (novel)|Edna Ferber novel from which it was adapted]], uses some of Ferber's original dialogue, notably during the [[miscegenation]] scene. And [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'' uses chunks of dialogue from [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', although it bills itself as a &quot;free adaptation&quot; of the novel.

==Language and translation==
[[File:Henry Purcell portrait by John Closterman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Purcell]] (1659–1695), whose operas were written to English libretti]]
As the originating language of opera, Italian dominated that genre in Europe (except in France) well through the 18th century, and even into the next century in Russia, for example, when the Italian opera troupe in [[Saint Petersburg]] was challenged by the emerging native Russian repertory. Significant exceptions before 1800 can be found in [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s works, German opera of [[Hamburg]] during the Baroque, [[ballad opera]] and [[Singspiel]] of the 18th century, etc.

Just as with literature and song, the libretto has its share of problems and challenges with [[translation]]. In the past (and even today), foreign musical stage works with spoken dialogue, especially comedies, were sometimes performed with the sung portions in the original language and the spoken dialogue in the vernacular. The effects of leaving lyrics untranslated depend on the piece.

Many musicals, such as the old [[Betty Grable]] – [[Don Ameche]] – [[Carmen Miranda]] vehicles, are largely unaffected, but this practice is especially misleading in translations of musicals like ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''My Fair Lady'' or ''Carousel'', in which the lyrics to the songs and the spoken text are often or always closely integrated, and the lyrics serve to further the plot.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Availability of printed or projected translations today makes singing in the original language more practical, although one cannot discount the desire to hear a sung drama in one's own language.

The Spanish words ''libretista'' (playwright, script writer or screenwriter) and ''libreto'' (script or screen play), which are used in the Hispanic TV and cinema industry, derived their meanings from the original operatic sense.

==Status of librettists and the libretto==
[[File:Adolfo De Karolis (1874-1928), La figlia di Iorio (1914).jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for ''[[La figlia di Iorio]]'' where the librettist, [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], is given top billing]]
Librettists have historically received less prominent credit than the composer. In some 17th-century operas still being performed, the name of the librettist was not even recorded. As the printing of libretti for sale at performances became more common, these records often survive better than music left in manuscript. But even in late 18th century London, reviews rarely mentioned the name of the librettist, as [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] lamented in his memoirs.

By the 20th century some librettists became recognised as part of famous collaborations, as with [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] or [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]. Today the composer (past or present) of the musical score to an opera or operetta is usually given top billing for the completed work, and the writer of the lyrics relegated to second place or a mere footnote, a notable exception being [[Gertrude Stein]], who received top billing for ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]''. Another exception was [[Alberto Franchetti]]'s 1906 opera ''[[La figlia di Iorio]]'' which was a close rendering of a highly successful play by its librettist, [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], a celebrated Italian poet, novelist and dramatist of the day. In some cases, the operatic adaptation has become more famous than the literary text on which it was based, as with [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' after a play by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].

The question of which is more important in opera – the music or the words – has been debated over time, and forms the basis of at least two operas, [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' and [[Antonio Salieri]]'s ''[[Prima la musica e poi le parole]]''.

==Publication of libretti==
Libretti have been made available in several formats, some more nearly complete than others. The text – i.e., the spoken dialogue, song lyrics and stage directions, as applicable – is commonly published separately from the music (such a booklet is usually included with sound recordings of most operas). Sometimes (particularly for operas in the [[public domain]]) this format is supplemented with melodic excerpts of [[Sheet music|musical notation]] for important numbers.

Printed [[Sheet music|scores]] for operas naturally contain the entire libretto, although there can exist significant differences between the score and the separately printed text. More often than not, this involves the extra repetition of words or phrases from the libretto in the actual score. For example, in the [[aria]] &quot;[[Nessun dorma]]&quot; from Puccini's ''[[Turandot]]'', the final lines in the libretto are &quot;Tramontate, stelle! All'alba, vincerò!&quot; (Fade, you stars! At dawn, I will win!). However, in the score they are sung as &quot;Tramontate, stelle! Tramontate, stelle! All'alba, vincerò! Vincerò! Vincerò!&quot;

Because the modern musical tends to be published in two separate but intersecting formats (i.e., the book and lyrics, with all the words, and the piano-vocal score, with all the musical material, including some spoken cues), both are needed in order to make a thorough reading of an entire show.

'''[[Chrominance|Chroma]] key compositing''', or '''chroma keying''', is a [[Visual effects|visual-effects]] and [[post-production]] technique for [[compositing]] (layering) two [[image]]s or [[video]] streams together based on colour hues ([[colorfulness|chroma]] range). The technique has been used in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video – particularly the [[newscast]]ing, [[motion picture]], and [[video game]] industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''colour keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name=&quot;What is Chroma Key?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as '''green screen''', '''blue screen''' and '''magic pink'''; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from [[human skin colour]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.&lt;ref name=&quot;BorisFX&quot; /&gt;

It is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television newscasts, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the colour is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games. [[Rotoscopy]] may instead be carried out on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen. [[Match moving|Motion tracking]] can also be used in conjunction with chroma keying, for example to move the background as the subject moves.

==History==

===Predecessors===

Prior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70| isbn=9781136071508 | date=2015-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

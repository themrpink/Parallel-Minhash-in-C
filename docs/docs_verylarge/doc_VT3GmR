==Chemistry==
Clozapine is a [[dibenzodiazepine]] that is structurally related to [[loxapine]]. It is slightly soluble in water, soluble in [[acetone]], and highly soluble in [[chloroform]]. Its solubility in water is 0.1889&amp;nbsp;mg/L (25&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopfinger&quot;/&gt; Its manufacturer, Novartis, claims a solubility of &lt;0.01% in water (&lt;100&amp;nbsp;mg/L).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last = Novartis Pharmaceuticals |author-link = Novartis |title = Prescribing Information |url = http://www.rxlist.com/clozaril-drug.htm |format = PDF |access-date = 29 June 2007 |date = April 2006 |publisher = Novartis Pharmaceuticals |pages = 36 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081023052932/http://www.rxlist.com/clozaril-drug.htm |archive-date = 2008-10-23 }}

==History==
Clozapine was synthesized in 1956&lt;ref name=Stat2019/&gt; by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, based on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant [[imipramine]]. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 as well as a trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]].&lt;ref name=Cri2007 /&gt; Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cri2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; In 1975, after reports of [[agranulocytosis]] leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Healy, David |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=238–42 |isbn=978-0-674-01599-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clozapine fell out of favor for more than a decade despite unclear reasons for the agranulocytosis which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffith RW, Saameli K | title = Letter: Clozapine and agranulocytosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 7936 | pages = 657 | date = October 1975 | pmid = 52022 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(75)90135-x | s2cid = 53296036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that clozapine was more effective against treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]] than other [[antipsychotics]], the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular [[hematological]] monitoring to detect [[granulocytopenia]], before [[agranulocytosis]] develops. In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for reducing the risk of suicide in schizophrenic or [[schizoaffective]] patients judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/19758se1-047ltr.pdf |title=Supplemental NDA Approval Letter for Clozaril, NDA 19-758 / S-047 |date=18 December 2002 |publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration |access-date=23 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108024629/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/19758se1-047ltr.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2005/019758s054ltr.pdf |title=Letter to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation |access-date=2009-09-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511063325/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2005/019758s054ltr.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was enthusiastically taken up in the United States by the [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] and the [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] [[James W. Watts]] who devised what became the standard prefrontal procedure and named their operative technique [[lobotomy]], although the operation was called leucotomy in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Freeman| first = Walter|author2=James W. Watts | title = Psychosurgery| location = Baltimore| year = 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the award of the [[Nobel prize]] to Moniz in 1949, the use of psychosurgery declined during the 1950s. By the 1970s the standard Freeman-Watts type of operation was very rare, but other forms of psychosurgery, although used on a much smaller scale, survived. Some countries have abandoned psychosurgery altogether; in others, for example the US and the UK, it is only used in a few centres on small numbers of people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPsy&quot;&gt;Neurosurgery working group 2000 ''Neurosurgery for mental disorder''. London: Royal College of Psychiatrists&lt;/ref&gt;
In some countries it is also used in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and other disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;&gt;N. Zamiska 2007 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119393867164279313 In China, brain surgery is pushed on the mentally ill].

Psychosurgery is a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurosurgeons. During the operation, which is carried out under a [[general anaesthetic]] and using [[Stereotactic surgery|stereotactic]] methods, a small piece of [[Human brain|brain]] is destroyed or removed. The most common types of psychosurgery in current or recent use are anterior capsulotomy, [[bilateral cingulotomy|cingulotomy]], [[subcaudate tractotomy]] and [[limbic leucotomy]]. Lesions are made by radiation, thermo-coagulation, freezing or cutting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt; About a third of patients show significant improvement in their symptoms after operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt;
Advances in surgical technique have greatly reduced the incidence of death and serious damage from psychosurgery; the remaining risks include [[seizures]], incontinence, decreased drive and initiative, weight gain, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt;

Currently, interest in the neurosurgical treatment of mental illness is shifting from [[Ablation|ablative]] psychosurgery (where the aim is to destroy brain tissue) to [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) where the aim is to stimulate areas of the brain with implanted [[electrode]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachdev&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831c8475 | last1 = Sachdev | first1 = P. | last2 = Chen | first2 = X. | year = 2009 | title = Neurosurgical treatment of mood disorders: traditional psychosurgery and the advent of deep brain stimulation | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 25–31 | pmid = 19122531 | s2cid = 30892980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

All the forms of psychosurgery in use today (or used in recent years) target the limbic system, which involves structures such as the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], certain [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[hypothalamic]] nuclei, [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate gyrus]] &amp;mdash; all connected by fibre pathways and thought to play a part in the regulation of emotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;&gt;Clinical resource and audit group 1996 ''Neurosurgery for mental disorder''. Edinburgh: Scottish Office&lt;/ref&gt; There is no international consensus on the best target site.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt;

'''Anterior cingulotomy''' was first used by [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]] in the UK, and developed in the US by H.T. Ballantine jnr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller&quot;/&gt; In recent decades it has been the most commonly used psychosurgical procedure in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt; The target site is the anterior cingulate cortex; the operation disconnects the thalamic and posterior frontal regions and damages the anterior cingulate region.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt;

'''Anterior capsulotomy''' was developed in Sweden, where it became the most frequently used procedure. It is also used in Scotland and Canada. The aim of the operation is to disconnect the orbitofrontal cortex and thalamic nuclei by inducing a lesion in the anterior limb of [[internal capsule]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3221188 | pmid=22135450 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.86823 | volume=53 | issue=3 | title=Anterior capsulotomy for refractory OCD: First case as per the core group guidelines | author=Doshi PK | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=270–3| year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subcaudate tractotomy''' was the most commonly used form of psychosurgery in the UK from the 1960s to the 1990s. It targets the lower medial quadrant of the frontal lobes, severing connections between the limbic system and supra-orbital part of the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt;

'''Limbic leucotomy'''  is a combination of subcaudate tractotomy and anterior cingulotomy. It was used at [[Atkinson Morley Hospital]] London in the 1990s&lt;ref name=&quot;CRAG&quot;/&gt; and also at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v62n1202 | last1 = Price | first1 = B.H. | last2 = Baral | year = 2001 | first2 = I | last3 = Cosgrove | first3 = GR | last4 = Rauch | first4 = SL | last5 = Nierenberg | first5 = AA | last6 = Jenike | first6 = MA | last7 = Cassem | first7 = EH | title = Improvement in severe self-mutilation following limbic leucotomy: a series of five consecutive cases | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 12| pages = 925–32 | pmid = 11780871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Amygdalotomy]]''', which targets the [[amygdala]], was developed as a treatment for aggression by Hideki Narabayashi in 1961 and is still used occasionally, for example at the [[Medical College of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fountas | first1 = K.N. | last2 = Smith | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Lee | first3 = G.P. | year = 2007 | title = Bilateral stereotactic amygdalotomy for self-mutilation disorder: a case report and review of the literature | url = | journal = Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery | volume = 85 | issue = 2–3| pages = 121–8 | pmid = 17228178 | doi = 10.1159/000098527 | s2cid = 71754991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate about whether [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) should be classed as a form of psychosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12376-009-0031-7 | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J. | year = 2009 | title = A dark history: memories of lobotomy in the new era of psychosurgery | url = | journal = Medicine Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 367–78 | s2cid = 144488587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Success rates for anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy in treating depression and OCD have been reported as between 25 and 70 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt; The quality of outcome data is poor and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in their 2000 report concluded that there were no simple answers to the question of modern psychosurgery's clinical effectiveness; studies suggested improvements in symptoms following surgery but it was impossible to establish the extent to which other factors contributed to this improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPsy&quot;/&gt; Research into the effects of psychosurgery has not been able to overcome a number of methodological problems, including the problems associated with non-standardised diagnoses and outcome measurements, the small numbers treated at any one centre, and [[Publication bias|positive publication bias]]. Controlled studies are very few in number and there have been no placebo-controlled studies. There are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mashour&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christmas D | year = 2004 | title = Neurosurgery for mental disorder | journal = Advances in Psychiatric Treatment | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 189–199 | doi=10.1192/apt.10.3.189| pmid = 15286074 |display-authors=etal| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern techniques have greatly reduced the risks of psychosurgery, although risks of adverse effects still remain. Whilst the risk of death or vascular injury has become extremely small, there remains a risk of seizures, fatigue, and personality changes following operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPsy&quot;/&gt;

A recent follow-up study of eight depressed patients who underwent anterior capsulotomy in Vancouver, Canada, classified five of them as responders at two to three years after surgery. Results on neuropsychological testing were unchanged or improved, although there were isolated deficits and one patient was left with long-term frontal psychobehavioral changes and fatigue. One patient, aged 75, was left mute and [[Hypokinesia|akinetic]] for a month following surgery and then developed [[dementia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurwitz&quot;/&gt;

===China===

In China, psychosurgical operations which make a lesion in the [[nucleus accumbens]] are used in the treatment of drug and alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = HM | last2 = Wang | first2 = XL | last3 = Chang | first3 = CW | last4 = Li | first4 = N | last5 = Gao | first5 = L | last6 = Geng | first6 = N | last7 = Ma | first7 = JH | last8 = Zhao | first8 = W | last9 = Gao | first9 = GD. |name-list-style=vanc| year = 2010 | title = Preliminary findings in ablating the nucleus accumbens using stereotactic surgery for alleviating psychological dependence on alcohol | url = | journal = Neurosci.

===India===
India had an extensive psychosurgery programme until the 1980s, using it to treat addiction, and aggressive behaviour in adults and children, as well as depression and OCD.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Doshi 2009 [https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-540-69960-6_12 History of stereotactic surgery in India]. In A.M. Lozano, P.L. Gildenberg and R.R. Tasker (eds.) ''Textbook of stereotactic and functional neurosurgery''. Berlin: Springer, 155-68&lt;/ref&gt;
Cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and OCD continue to be used, for example at the BSES MG Hospital in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghrc-bk.org/hospital_surgical_neurosurgery.html Neurosurgery at the BSES MG Hospital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216032459/http://www.ghrc-bk.org/hospital_surgical_neurosurgery.html |date=2009-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan the first lobotomy was performed in 1939 and the operation was used extensively in mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fujikura | first1 = I. | year = 1993 | title = History of psychosurgery | url = | journal = Nippon Ishigaku Zasshi | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 217–22 | pmid = 11639762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, psychosurgery fell into disrepute in the 1970s, partly due to its use on children with behavioural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ramamurthi | first1 = B. | year = 2000 | title = Stereotactic surgery in India: the past, present and the future | url = http://www.neurologyindia.com/text.asp?2000/48/1/1/1482 | journal = Neurology India | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 | pmid = 10751807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===

In the 1980s there were 10–20 operations a year in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachdev&quot;/&gt; The number had decreased to one or two a year by the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachdev&quot;/&gt; In Victoria, there were no operations between 2001 and 2006, but between 2007 and 2012 the Victoria Psychosurgery Review Board dealt with 12 applications, all them for DBS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhrb.vic.gov.au/images/stories/mhrb/publications/annualreports/prb2012.pdf Psychosurgery Board annual report 2011/12.

===Europe===

In the twenty-year period 1971–1991 the Committee on Psychosurgery in the '''Netherlands''' and '''Belgium''' oversaw 79 operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPsy&quot;/&gt; Since 2000 there has been only one centre in Belgium performing psychosurgery, carrying out about 8 or 9 operations a year (some capsulotomies and some DBS), mostly for OCD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sachdev&quot;/&gt;

In '''France''' about five people a year were undergoing psychosurgery in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La neurochirurgie fonctionnelle d'affections psychiatriques sévères |publisher=[[Comité Consultatif National d'Ethique]] |date=2002-04-25 |url=http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/fr/avis071.pdf |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720211020/http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/fr/avis071.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 }} (French national consultative committee on ethics, opinion #71: Functional neurosurgery of severe psychiatric conditions)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005 the Health Authority recommended the use of ablative psychosurgery and DBS for OCD.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wainrib 2006 Psychiatrie; vers le nouveau 'sujet toc'. ''Le Monde'', 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s in '''Spain''' about 24 psychosurgical operations (capsulotomy, cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and hypothalamotomy) a year were being performed. OCD was the most common diagnosis, but psychosurgery was also being used in the treatment of anxiety and schizophrenia, and other disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the '''UK''' between the late 1990s and 2009 there were just two centres using psychosurgery: a few stereotactic anterior capsulotomies are performed every year at the [[University Hospital of Wales]], Cardiff, while anterior cingulotomies are carried out by the Advanced Interventions Service at [[Ninewells Hospital]], Dundee. The patients have diagnoses of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety. Ablative psychosurgery was not performed in England between the late 1990s and 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;RCPsy&quot;/&gt; although a couple of hospitals have been experimenting with DBS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4625775.stm Brain pacemaker lifts depression] (BBC article)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Frenchay Hospital]], Bristol, performed an anterior cingulotomy on a woman who had previously undergone DBS.&lt;ref&gt;Care Quality Commission 2010 [http://www.cqc.org.uk/_.../CQC_Monitoring_the_use_of_the_Mental_Health_Act_in_200910_Main_report_Tagged.pdf ''Monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act in 2009/10''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103133/http://www.cqc.org.uk/_.../CQC_Monitoring_the_use_of_the_Mental_Health_Act_in_200910_Main_report_Tagged.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}: 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Russia''' in 1998 the Institute of the Human Brain (Russian Academy of Sciences) started a programme of stereotactic cingulotomy for the treatment of drug addiction. About 85 people, all under the age of 35, were operated on annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1024945927301 | last1 = Medvedev | first1 = S.V. | last2 = Anichkov | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Polykov | first3 = Y.I. | year = 2003 | title = Physiological mechanisms of the effectiveness of bilateral stereotactic cingulotomy against strong psychological dependence in drug addicts | url = | journal = Human Physiology | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 492–7 | s2cid = 27264612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In  the former USSR, leucotomies were used for the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1940s, but the practice was prohibited by the Ministry of Health in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lichterman&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lichterman | first1 = B.L. | year = 1993 | title = On the history of psychosurgery in Russia | url = | journal = Acta Neurochirugie | volume = 125 | issue = 1–4| pages = 1–4 | doi=10.1007/bf01401819 | pmid=8122532| s2cid = 189764136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

In the '''US''' the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] has a psychosurgery program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/functional/psysurg.htm Massachusetts General Hospital Functional and Stereotactic Neurosurgery Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Operations are also performed at a few other centres.

In '''Mexico''' psychosurgery is used in the treatment of anorexia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?idc=144281 El ISSSTE es pionero en psicocirugía contra anorexia]. ''La Cronica'', 17 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in the treatment of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jiménez-Ponce F.|display-authors=etal| year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of bilateral cingulotomy and anterior capsulotomy for the treatment of aggressive behavior | url = http://www.nietoeditores.com.mx/download/Cirugia%20y%20Cirujanos/Marzo-Abril2011/INGLES/Cir%20Cir%20ingles%202.3%20EVALUATION.pdf | journal = Cirugia y Cirujanos | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–13 | pmid = 21631970 | access-date = 2012-02-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223250/http://www.nietoeditores.com.mx/download/Cirugia%20y%20Cirujanos/Marzo-Abril2011/INGLES/Cir%20Cir%20ingles%202.3%20EVALUATION.pdf | archive-date = 2016-03-03 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livinallongo del Col di Lana|Arabba]] lies between the [[Sella group]] and the [[Marmolada]].

[[Auronzo di Cadore|Auronzo]] is in the upper [[Cadore]].

Other carateristical places are:
* Mount [[Pasubio]] and [[Strada delle 52 Gallerie]] (a military mule built during [[World War I]] with 52 tunnels)
* [[Altopiano di Asiago]] and [[Calà del Sasso]], with 4444 steps, the world's longest staircase open to the public.

===Thermal baths===
The [[thermal baths]] of [[Abano Terme]] are an important [[tourist attraction]]. [[Montegrotto Terme]] and [[Recoaro Terme]] are other resorts.

'''Dál Riata''' or '''Dál Riada''' (also '''Dalriada''') ({{IPAc-en|d|æ|l|ˈ|r|iː|ə|d|ə}}) was a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Monarchy|kingdom]] that encompassed the [[Inner Hebrides|western seaboard]] of [[Scotland]] and the north-eastern corner of [[Ireland]], on each side of the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. At its height in the 6th and 7th centuries, it covered what is now [[Argyll]] (&quot;Coast of the Gaels&quot;) in Scotland and part of [[County Antrim]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Thomas Owen, &quot;Philosopher King: Nechtan mac Der Ilei,&quot; SHR 83 (2004): 135–149&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of expansion, Dál Riata eventually became associated with the Gaelic [[Kingdom of Alba]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordCompanion1&quot;&gt;Oxford Companion to Scottish History p. 161–162, edited by Michael Lynch, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923482-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland c.

Antrim, Ireland, were known as the Scots, a name they transported to what is now Argyll and the adjacent islands where they established the kingdom of Dál Riata.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argyll, it consisted of four main [[clan|kindreds]], each with their own chief: [[Cenél nGabráin]] (based in [[Kintyre]]), [[Cenél nÓengusa]] (based on [[Islay]]), [[Loarn mac Eirc|Cenél Loairn]] (who gave their name to the district of [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorn]])&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordCompanion1&quot;/&gt; and [[Cenél Comgaill]] (who gave their name to [[Cowal]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordCompanion1&quot;/&gt; The [[hillfort]] of [[Dunadd]] is believed to have been its capital. Other royal forts included [[Dunollie Castle|Dunollie]], [[Dunaverty]] and [[Dunseverick]]. Within Dál Riata was the important monastery of [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], which played a key role in the spread of [[Celtic Christianity]] throughout northern Britain, and in the development of [[insular art]]. Iona was a centre of learning and produced many important manuscripts. Dál Riata had a strong [[seafaring]] culture and a large naval fleet.

Dál Riata is said to have been founded by the legendary king [[Fergus Mór]] (Fergus the Great) in the 5th century. The kingdom reached its height under [[Áedán mac Gabráin]] ({{reign|574|608}}). During his reign Dál Riata's power and influence grew; it carried out naval expeditions to [[Orkney]] and the [[Isle of Man]], and assaults on the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglian]] kingdom of [[Bernicia]]. However, King [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria|Æthelfrith]] of [[Bernicia]] checked its growth at the [[Battle of Degsastan]] in 603. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of [[Domnall Brecc]] (died 642) ended Dál Riata's &quot;golden age&quot;, and the kingdom became a client of [[Northumbria]] for a time. In the 730s the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[Óengus I]] led campaigns against Dál Riata and brought it under Pictish overlordship by 741. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars have seen no revival of Dál Riatan power after the long period of foreign domination ({{circa|637}} to {{circa|750–760}}), while others have seen a revival under [[Áed Find]] (736–778). Some even claim that the Dál Riata usurped the kingship of [[Fortriu]]. From 795 onward there were sporadic [[Viking]] raids in Dál Riata. In the following century, there may have been a merger of the Dál Riatan and Pictish crowns. Some sources say [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] (Kenneth MacAlpin) was king of Dál Riata before becoming king of the Picts in 843, following a disastrous defeat of the Picts by Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, and Bannerman, ''Scottish Takeover'', present this case, arguing that Pictish kings from [[Ciniod II of the Picts|Ciniod son of Uuredech]] and [[Caustantín of the Picts|Caustantín]] onwards were descendants of [[Fergus mac Echdach]] and Feradach, son of [[Selbach mac Ferchair]]. Broun's ''Pictish Kings'' offers an alternative reconstruction, and one which has attracted considerable support, e.g. Clancy, &quot;Iona in the kingdom of the Picts: a note&quot;, Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom's independence ended sometime after, as it merged with Pictland to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]].

[[Latin language|Latin]] sources often referred to the inhabitants of Dál Riata as ''Scots'' (''[[Scoti]]''), a name originally used by Roman and Greek writers for the Irish Gaels who raided and colonized [[Roman Britain]]. Later, it came to refer to Gaels, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. 159–160, considers whether the Latin terms ''Scotti'' and ''Atacotti'' refer to the confederations in Ulster and [[Leinster]] respectively. The etymology of ''Scotti'', and its Gaelic roots, if any, are uncertain. The term in late Classical sources is either specifically linked to raiders from Ireland, or is geographically ambiguous. In sharp contrast, no clear reference pointing to Scotti in Scotland in the Roman period has been found. Despite several references listing different combinations of Picti, Scotti, Hiberni, Attecotti and Saxons together as later Roman Britain's archetypal enemies, it is worth noting that 'Scotti' and 'Hiberni' are never listed together, confirming that they were then, as they were later, alternative names for the Irish or confederations of the Irish. Regardless of the original sense, or its modern popularity, to use the term &quot;Scot&quot; in this context invites confusion.&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to herein as ''Gaels'' or as ''Dál Riatans''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[1066 And All That]]'', p. 5, for a parody of the confusion the word &quot;Scot&quot; engenders in this context.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name ''{{lang|sga|Dál Riata}}'' is derived from [[Old Irish]]. ''{{lang|sga|Dál}}'', from [[Proto-Celtic]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Celtic/dālom|''*dālom'']], means 'portion' or 'share' (as in 'a portion of land'); ''Riata'' or ''Riada'' is believed to be a personal name.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede1&quot;&gt;Bede, HE, Book I, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the name refers to &quot;Riada's portion&quot; of territory in the area.

The [[Dalradian]] geological series, a term coined by [[Archibald Geikie]] in 1891, was named after Dál Riata because its outcrop has a similar geographical reach to that of the former kingdom.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==People, land and sea==
[[File:Ulster &amp; the Hebrides.png|thumb|right|200px|Ulster and the Hebrides]]
Dál Riata spanned the North Channel and included parts of western Scotland and northeastern Ireland. In Scotland, it corresponded roughly to [[Argyll]] (from ''Airer Goídel'', &quot;coast of the Gaels&quot;) and later grew to include [[Skye]]. In Ireland, it took in the northeast of [[County Antrim]], roughly corresponding to the [[Baronies of Ireland|baronies]] of [[Cary (barony)|Cary]] and [[Glenarm Lower|Glenarm]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Hugh Alexander. [http://antrimhistory.net/irish-dalriada-by-hugh-alexander-boyd/ Irish Dalriada]. ''The Glynns: Journal of The Glens of Antrim Historical Society''. Volume 76 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern human landscape of Dál Riata differs a great deal from that of the first millennium. Most people today live in settlements far larger than anything known in early times, while some areas, such as [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and many of the islands, such as [[Islay]] and [[Tiree]], may well have had as many inhabitants as they do today. Many of the small settlements have now disappeared, so that the countryside is far emptier than was formerly the case, and many areas that were formerly farmed are now abandoned. Even the physical landscape is not entirely as it was: sea-levels have changed, and the combination of erosion and silting will have considerably altered the shape of the coast in some places, while the natural accumulation of peat and man-made changes from peat-cutting have altered inland landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;See McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', pp.10–20, for a short discussion of the geography of Dál Riata in Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

As was normal at the time, subsistence farming was the occupation of most people. [[Oat]]s and [[barley]] were the main cereal crops. [[Pastoralism]] was especially important, and [[transhumance]] (the seasonal movement of people with their livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures) was the practice in many places. Some areas, most notably Islay, were especially fertile, and good grazing would have been available all year round, just as it was in Ireland. Tiree was famed in later times for its oats and barley, while smaller, uninhabited islands were used to keep sheep. The area, until lately, was notable for its inshore fisheries, and for plentiful shellfish, therefore seafood is likely to have been an important part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Saints and Sea-kings'', pp. 22–29; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 49–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'' lists three main kin groups in Dál Riata in Scotland, with a fourth being added later:&lt;ref&gt;The Senchus is translated in Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 47–49; previously published in ''Celtica'', vols. 7 (1966) – 9 (1971); earlier translations in Anderson, ''ESSH'', vol. 1, pp. cl–cliii and Skene, ''Chronicles of the Picts and Scots''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Cenél nGabráin]] (kindred of Gabrán) in [[Kintyre]], who claimed descent from [[Gabrán mac Domangairt]].
* The [[Cenél nÓengusa]] (kindred of Óengus) in Islay and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], who claimed descent from Óengus Mór mac Eirc.
* The [[Loarn mac Eirc|Cenél Loairn]] (kindred of Loarn) in [[Lorne, Argyll and Bute|Lorne]], perhaps also [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Ardnamurchan]], who claimed descent from [[Loarn mac Eirc]].&lt;ref&gt;Broun, &quot;&quot;Dál Riata&quot;, notes that the Senchus treats the Cenél Loairn differently. In fact, it lists the three (actually four) thirds of the Cenél Loairn as the Cenél Shalaig (or Cenél Fergusa Shalaig), Cenél Cathbath, Cenél nEchdach and Cenél Muiredaig. Even the compiler of the Senchus doubts whether their [[eponym]]ous founders Fergus Shalaig, Cathbad, Eochaid and Muiredach were all sons of Loarn mac Eirc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Cenél Comgaill]] (kindred of Comgall) in [[Cowal]] and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], a later addition, who claimed descent from [[Comgall mac Domangairt]].&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, ''Studies'', p. 110, dates the separation of the Cenél Comgaill from the Cenél nGabráin to around 700.&lt;/ref&gt; They may have expanded eastwards into [[Strathearn]] during the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Thomas Owen, &quot;Philosopher King: Nechtan mac Der Ilei,&quot; SHR 83 (2004): 135–149&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Senchus does not list any kindreds in Ireland, but does list an apparently very minor kindred called Cenél Chonchride in Islay descended from another son of Erc, Fergus Becc. Another kindred, Cenél Báetáin of [[Morvern]] (later [[Clan MacInnes]]), branched off from Cenél Loairn about the same time that Cenél Comgaill separated from its parent kindred. The [[Morvern]] district was formerly known as Kinelvadon, after the Cenél Báetáin.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Celtic Place-names of Scotland'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cenél Loairn may have been the largest of the &quot;three kindreds&quot;, as the Senchus reports it being divided further into Cenél Shalaig, Cenél Cathbath, Cenél nEchdach, Cenél Murerdaig. Among the Cenél Loairn it also lists the [[Airgíalla]], although whether this should be understood as being Irish settlers or simply another tribe to whom the label was applied is unclear. Bannerman proposes a tie to the [[Uí Macc Uais]].&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 115–118. See also Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 120 &amp; 122, noting that the ''Tripartite Life'' of [[Saint Patrick]] appears to refer to a &quot;Cenél nÓengusa&quot; in Antrim.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of Airgíalla 'hostage givers' adds to the uncertainty, although it must be observed that only one grouping in Ireland was apparently given this name and it is therefore very rare, perhaps supporting the Ui Macc Uais hypothesis. There is no reason to suppose that this is a complete or accurate list.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 670, refer to the return of the ''genus Gartnaith'', i.e. the Cenél Gartnait, from Ireland to Skye. This Gartnait is presumed to be a son of Áedán mac Gabraín: see Broun, &quot;Dál Riata&quot;. Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 92–94, identifies this Gartnait as a son of Áedán, whom he sees as the same person as [[Gartnait IV of the Picts|Gartnait]], king of the Picts. No such son is named by Adomnán, in the annals, or by the Senchus. See also Adomnán, ''Life'', II, 22, and note 258, where a certain Ioan mac Conaill mac Domnaill is said to have belonged to &quot;the royal lineage of Cenél nGabráin&quot;. See also the discussion of the Cenél Loairn above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four sites in Dál Riata may have had royal associations:  [[Dunadd]], [[Dunollie Castle|Dunollie]], [[Dunaverty]] and [[Tarbert, Kintyre|Tarbert]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Alcock, &quot;Early historic fortifications in Scotland&quot;, ''in'' Guilbert (ed) 1981, pp. 150-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, [[Dunadd]] appears to have been the most important. It has been partly excavated, and weapons, [[quern-stone]]s and many moulds for the manufacture of jewellery were found in addition to fortifications. Other high-status material included glassware and wine [[amphora]]e from [[Gaul]], and in larger quantities than found elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. Lesser centres included [[Dunollie Castle|Dun Ollaigh]], seat of the Cenél Loairn kings, and [[Dunaverty]], at the southern end of Kintyre, in the lands of the Cenél nGabráin.&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 111–118; Campbell, ''Saints and Sea-kings'', pp. 17–28; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt; The main royal centre in Ireland appears to have been at [[Dunseverick]] (''Dún Sebuirge'').&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' (2000), pp. 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dál Riata had a strong [[seafaring]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, G. J. ''The Conquest of the North Atlantic''. Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2007 [1980]. p.21&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[archipelago]] with many islands and [[peninsula]]s. This, and the difficulty of overland travel, meant that travel by sea was the easiest means of moving any distance. As well as long distance trade, local trade must also have been significant.&lt;ref&gt;See Adomnán, ''Life'', note 72, where a trading fleet of 50 ships is mentioned; see also Bannerman, ''Studies'', pp. 148–154 for an analysis of Adomnán's reports, and those in the annals, dealing with maritime matters.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Currach]]s were probably the most common seagoing craft, and on inland waters [[Dugout (boat)|dugouts]] and [[coracle]]s were used. Large timber ships, called &quot;long ships&quot;, perhaps similar to the [[Viking]] [[Longship|ships of the same name]], are attested to in a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, ''Life'', note 297; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Dál Riata had a large [[Navy|war fleet]] manned by skilled sailors, capable of undertaking far-reaching expeditions. It had an organized system for manning the fleet. Houses were grouped into twenties for the purpose of naval recruitment, with each group having to provide a quota of 28 [[Rowing|oarsmen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;duffy586&quot;&gt;Duffy, Seán.

==Religion and art==
[[File:St Martins Cross on Iona.jpg|thumb|200px|9th-century St Martin's Cross on [[Iona]].]]
[[File:KellsFol028vPortMatt.jpg|thumb|200px|Saint Matthew, folio 28v in the [[Book of Kells]]]]
No written accounts exist for pre-Christian Dál Riata, and the earliest known records come from the chroniclers of [[Iona]] and Irish monasteries. [[Adomnán]]'s ''Life of St [[Columba]]'' implies a Christian Dál Riata.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, &quot;Iona&quot;; Markus, &quot;Conversion&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is true cannot be known. The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Christianity in Dál Riata. Adomnán's ''Life'', although useful as a record, was not intended to serve as history, but rather as [[hagiography]]. Because the writing of the lives of the saints in Adomnán's day had not reached the stylised formulas of the [[High Middle Ages]], the ''Life'' contains a great deal of historically valuable information. It is also a vital linguistic source indicating the distribution of Gaelic and P-Celtic placenames in northern Scotland by the end of the 7th century. It famously notes Columba's need for a translator when conversing with an individual on Skye.&lt;ref&gt;As well as Sharpe's translation of Adomnán's ''Life of St Columba'', Broun &amp; Clancy (eds.), ''Spes Scotorum'', is essential reading on Columba, Iona and Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence of a non-Gaelic language is supported by a sprinkling of P-Celtic placenames on the remote mainland opposite the island.&lt;ref&gt;W.F.H. Nicolaisen, ''Scottish Placenames: Their study and significance'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

Columba's founding Iona within the bounds of Dál Riata ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain, not only to Pictland, but also to Northumbria, via [[Lindisfarne]], to [[Mercia]], and beyond. Although the monastery of Iona belonged to the [[Cenél Conaill]] of the Northern Uí Néill, and not to Dál Riata, it had close ties to the Cenél nGabráin, ties which may make the annals less than entirely impartial.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Broun, &quot;Dál Riata&quot;; for the evidence of place-names as an indicator of Ionan influence, see Taylor, &quot;Iona abbots&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Iona was the greatest religious centre in Dál Riata, it was far from unique. [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]], in the territory of the Cenél Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency. [[Applecross]], probably in Pictish territory for most of the period, and [[Kingarth]] on Bute are also known to have been monastic sites, and many smaller sites, such as on [[Eigg]] and Tiree, are known from the annals.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, &quot;Church institutions&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, [[Armoy]] was the main ecclesiastical centre in early times, associated with [[Saint Patrick]] and with [[Saint Olcán]], said to have been first bishop at Armoy. An important early centre, Armoy later declined, overshadowed by the monasteries at Movilla ([[Newtownards]]) and [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as their primary spiritual importance, the political significance of religious centres cannot be dismissed. The prestige of being associated with the saintly founder was of no small importance. Monasteries represented a source of wealth as well as prestige. Additionally, the learning and literacy found in monasteries served as useful tools for ambitious kings.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 42–44, 94–95 &amp; 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Book of Kells]] was probably at least begun at Iona, although not by Columba as legend has it, as it dates from about 800 (it may have been commissioned to mark the bicentennial of Columba's death in 597). Whether it was or not, Iona was certainly important in the formation of [[Insular art]], which combined Mediterranean, [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and Pictish elements into a style of which the book of Kells is a late example.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

For other arts, a number of sculptures remain to give an impression of Dál Riatan work. The St. Martin's Cross on Iona is the best-preserved [[high cross]], probably inspired by Northumbrian free-standing crosses, such as the [[Ruthwell Cross]], although a similar cross exists in Ireland ([[Ahenny]], [[County Tipperary]]). The [[Kildalton Cross]] on Islay is similar. A sculpted slab at [[Ardchattan]] appears to show strong Pictish influences, while the [[Dupplin Cross]], it has been argued, shows that influences also moved in the opposite direction. Fine [[Hiberno-Saxon]] metalwork such as [[penannular brooches]] is believed to have been created at Dunadd.&lt;ref&gt;Laing &amp; Laing, ''The Picts and the Scots'', pp 136–137, deals with Dál Riatan arts at greater length; see also Ritchie, &quot;Culture: Picto-Celtic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the monastic sites, a considerable number of churches are attested, not only from archaeological evidence, but also from the evidence of place-names. The element &quot;kil&quot;, from Gaelic ''cill'', can be shown in many cases to be associated with early churches, such as at Kilmartin by Dunadd.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, &quot;Religious life&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Duan Albanach]]'' (Song of the Scots) tells that the three sons of [[Erc of Dalriada|Erc]]—[[Fergus Mór]], [[Loarn mac Eirc|Loarn]] and Óengus—conquered ''Alba'' (Scotland) in around 500. [[Bede]] offers a different, and probably older, account wherein Dál Riata was conquered by Irish Gaels led by a certain ''Reuda''. [[Old Irish]] ''dál'' means 'portion' or 'share', and is usually followed by the name of an [[eponym]]ous founder.&lt;ref name=&quot;bede1&quot;/&gt; Bede's tale may come from the same root as the Irish tales of Cairpre Riata and his brothers, the [[Síl Conairi]] (sons/descendants of [[Conaire Mór]] / [[Conaire Cóem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bannerman,''Studies'', pp. 122–124.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Dál Riata moves from [[Myth of origins|foundation myth]] to something nearer to history with the reports of the death of [[Comgall mac Domangairt]] around 540 and of his brother [[Gabrán mac Domangairt|Gabrán]] around 560.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals of Ulster]], death of Comgall s.a. 538, also s.a. 542, s.a. 545, death of Gabrán s.a. 558, s.a. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of history in the ''Duan Albanach'' was long accepted, although it is preceded by the purely fictional tale of [[Albanactus|Albanus]] and [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] conquering Britain. The presence of Gaelic in Scotland was seen as the result of either a large-scale migration from Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;See Mackie, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 18–19. Neither Smyth nor Laing &amp; Laing accept the migration theory without reservation.&lt;/ref&gt; or a takeover by Irish Gaelic elites. However, this theory is no longer universally accepted. In his academic paper ''Were the Scots Irish?'', archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell says that there is no archaeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell&gt;Campbell, Ewan. &quot;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/scotsirish.htm Were the Scots Irish?]&quot; in ''Antiquity'' No. 75 (2001). pp. 285–292.&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of archaeological evidence was previously noted by Professor [[Leslie Alcock]].&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that Argyll was different from Ireland, before and after the supposed migration, but that it also formed part of the Irish Sea province with Ireland, being easily distinguished from the rest of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Saints and Sea-kings'', pp. 8–15; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 9–10; Broun, &quot;Dál Riata&quot;; Clancy, &quot;Ireland&quot;; Forsyth, &quot;Origins&quot;, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell suggests that Argyll and Antrim formed a &quot;maritime province&quot;, united by the sea and isolated from the rest of Scotland by the mountainous ridge called the ''Druim Alban''.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt; This allowed a shared language to be maintained through the centuries; Argyll remained Gaelic-speaking while the rest of Scotland was either [[Pictish language|Pictish]] or [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt; Campbell argues that the medieval accounts were a kind of dynastic propaganda, constructed to bolster a dynasty's claim to the throne and to bolster Dál Riata claims to territory in Antrim.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt; This view of the medieval accounts is shared by other historians.&lt;ref name=ewancampbell/&gt;

However Dál Riata came to be, the time in which it arose was one of great instability in Ulster, following the [[Ulaid]]'s loss of territory (including the ancient centre of Emain Macha) to the [[Airgíalla]] and the [[Uí Néill]]. Whether the two parts of Dál Riata had long been united, or whether a conquest in the 4th century or early 5th century, either of Antrim from Argyll, or vice versa, in line with myth,{{Incomprehensible inline|reason=A main verb appears to be missing.|date=August 2020}} is not known. &quot;The thriving of Dalriada&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;47–50, notes that a conquest of Irish Dál Riata from Scotland, in the period after the fall of Emain Macha, fits the facts as well as any other hypothesis.

Linguistic and genealogical evidence associates ancestors of the Dál Riata with the prehistoric [[Iverni]] and [[Darini]], suggesting kinship with the Ulaid and a number of shadowy kingdoms in distant [[Munster]]. The [[Robogdii]] have also been suggested as ancestral.&lt;ref&gt;see [[O'Rahilly's historical model]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Dál Riata, according to the earliest genealogies, are descendants of [[Deda mac Sin]], a prehistoric king or deity of the [[Érainn]].

===Druimm Cete to Mag Rath===
[[File:Dalriada.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Map of Dál Riata at its height, c. 580–600. [[Picts|Pictish]] regions are marked in yellow.]]
By the mid 6th-century, the Dál Riata in Scotland came under serious threat from [[Bridei I]], [[king of the Picts]], whilst the Irish portion faced hostility from the [[Dál nAraidi]] of [[Ulaid]], resulting in them seeking the aid of the Irish [[Northern Uí Néill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardon17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2007pg316-9&quot;/&gt; Dál Riata reached its greatest extent in the reign of Áedán mac Gabráin, who was said to have been consecrated by Columba,&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/columba-e.html Life of St Columba]'', Book III, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who Áedán granted the island of [[Iona]] off the coast of Scotland. Columba, who was also a [[Cenél Conaill]] prince, negotiated an alliance between Dál Riata and the Cenél Conaill, who were the ruling dynasty of the Northern Uí Néill, in 575 at the Convention of Druimm Cete near [[Limavady]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardon17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McSparron109&quot;/&gt; In attendance were Columba, Áedán mac Gabráin, and [[Áed mac Ainmuirech]], king of the Northern Uí Néill and [[High King of Ireland]].

What was actually discussed at Druimm Cete is the matter of debate with various suggestions provided that it was: to determine the constitutional status of both parts of Dál Riata; to determine the status of Irish Dál Riata only with it having its own king; that Dál Riata was to become independent of the High King of Ireland;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2007pg316-9&quot;/&gt; that the Ireland part of Dál Riata would pay tribute to the High King and support him with land forces, and that the Scotland part would be independent but support the High King with its fleet when needed;&lt;ref name=&quot;duffy586&quot;/&gt; the removal of Dál Riata from Ulaid's overlordship, allowing it to concentrate on extending its Scottish domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardon17&quot;/&gt; What is certain is that both parties had the Dál nAraidi as a common foe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2007pg316-9&quot;/&gt;

This pact between the Dál Riata and Cenél Conaill was successful, first in defeating Báetan mac Cairill, king of the Dál nAraidi, then in allowing Áedán to campaign widely against his neighbours, as far afield as [[Orkney]] and lands of the [[Maeatae]], on the [[River Forth]]. Áedán appears to have been very successful in extending his power, until he faced the [[Bernicia]]n king [[Æthelfrith of Northumbria|Æthelfrith]] at [[Battle of Degsastan|Degsastan]] {{circa|603}}. Æthelfrith's brother was among the dead, but Áedán was defeated, and the Bernician kings continued their advances in southern Scotland. Áedán died {{circa|608}} aged about 70. Dál Riata did expand to include [[Skye]], possibly conquered by Áedán's son Gartnait.

It has been suggested that [[Fiachnae mac Báetáin]] (died 626), Dál nAraidi over-king of Ulaid, was overlord of both parts of Dál Riata. Fiachnae campaigned against the Northumbrians, and besieged [[Bamburgh]], and the Dál Riatans are thought to have fought in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;For Báetan and Fiachnae see Byrne, ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'', pp. 109–112, and Ó Cróinín, ''Early Medieval Ireland'', pp. 48–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 629 the Dál Riata suffered significant loses at the battle of Fid Euin where the Dál nAraidi, led by [[Congal Cáech|Congal Cáech mac Scandláin]], killed the Dál Riata king as well as three grandsons of Áedán mac Gabráin. It is suggested to have been an achievement that Dál Riata itself survived this battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2007pg316-9&quot;/&gt; That same year the Cenél Conaill defeated Congal Cáech at the battle of Dún Ceithirn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2007pg316-9&quot;/&gt;

Dál Riata remained allied with the Northern Uí Néill until the reign of Domnall Brecc, who was persuaded by the king of Dál nAraidi, [[Congal Cáech]], to renounce this alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;McSparron109&quot;/&gt; In an attempt to have himself installed as [[High King of Ireland]], Congal made alliances with Dál Riata and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], which resulted in the disastrous [[Battle of Magh Rath]] in 637, which saw Congal slain by High King [[Domnall mac Áedo]] of the Northern Uí Néill and resulted in Irish Dál Riata losing possession of its Scottish lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardon20-1&quot;/&gt; A battle had also taken place at sea at Sailtír, off Kintyre, in 637. This defeat was then attributed as divine retribution for Domnall Brecc turning his back on his prior alliance.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumméne's &quot;Life of Columba&quot; quoted in Sharpe's edition of Adomnán, Book III, Chapter 5, and notes 360, 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Domnall Brecc's policy appears to have died with him in 642, at his final, and fatal, defeat by [[Eugein I of Alt Clut|Eugein map Beli]] of Strathclyde at [[River Carron (Forth)|Strathcarron]], for as late as the 730s, armies and fleets from Dál Riata fought alongside the Uí Néill.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'', p. 114; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;

This defeat shattered the power of Dál Riata as well as that of Dál nAraidi, allowing the Northern Uí Néill to become the dominant force in the north of Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;McSparron109&quot;/&gt; By the 10th-century, the Irish lands of Dál Riata were under the control of the [[Uí Tuirtri]], and their clients, the Fir Lí.&lt;ref name=&quot;McSparron109&quot;/&gt;

===Mag Rath to the Pictish Conquest===
It has been proposed that some of the more obscure kings of Dál Riata mentioned in the Annals of Ulster, such as [[Fiannamail ua Dúnchado]] and [[Donncoirce]], may have been kings of Irish Dál Riata.&lt;ref&gt;See Bannerman, &quot;Scottish Takeover&quot;, pp. 76–77. If Charles-Edwards and Byrne are correct as to the loss of lands in Antrim after Mag Rath, it not obvious how Bannerman's thesis can be accommodated.&lt;/ref&gt;

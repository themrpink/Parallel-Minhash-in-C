[[Brill-Zinsser disease]], first described by [[Nathan Brill]] in 1913 at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City]], is a mild form of epidemic typhus which recurs in someone after a long period of latency (similar to the relationship between [[chickenpox]] and [[shingles]]). This recurrence often occurs in times of relative [[immunosuppression]], which is often in the context of malnutrition and other illnesses. In combination with poor sanitation and hygiene which leads to a greater density of lice, this reactivation is why typhus forms epidemics in times of social chaos and upheaval.

==Transmission==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Feeding on a human who carries the bacterium infects the [[louse]]. ''R. prowazekii'' grows in the louse's gut and is excreted in its [[feces]]. The disease is then transmitted to an uninfected human who scratches the louse bite (which itches) and rubs the feces into the wound. The [[incubation period]] is one to two weeks. ''R. prowazekii'' can remain viable and virulent in the dried louse feces for many days. Typhus will eventually kill the louse, though the disease will remain viable for many weeks in the dead louse.

Epidemic typhus has historically occurred during times of war and deprivation. For example, typhus killed millions of prisoners in German [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s during [[World War II]]. The deteriorating quality of hygiene in camps such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] created conditions where diseases such as typhus flourished. Situations in the twenty-first century with potential for a typhus epidemic would include refugee camps during a major famine or natural disaster. In the periods between outbreaks, when human to human transmission occurs less often, the [[flying squirrel]] serves as a zoonotic [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] for the ''Rickettsia prowazekii'' bacterium.

In 1916, [[Henrique da Rocha Lima]] proved that the bacterium ''Rickettsia prowazekii'' was the agent responsible for typhus; he named it after [[H. T. Ricketts]] and [[Stanislaus von Prowazek]], two zoologists who had died from typhus while investigating epidemics. Once these crucial facts were recognized, [[Rudolf Weigl]] in 1930 was able to fashion a practical and effective vaccine production method&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwow.home.pl/Weigl/krynski/teoria.html Weigl's method of intrarectal inoculation of lice in production of typhus vaccine and experimental works with ''Rickettsia Prowazeki'']&lt;/ref&gt; by grinding up the insides of infected lice that had been drinking blood. It was, however, very dangerous to produce, and carried a high likelihood of infection to those who were working on it.

A safer [[mass production|mass-production]]-ready method using [[egg yolk]]s was developed by [[H. R. Cox|Herald R. Cox]] in 1938.&lt;ref name =Mazal1&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuremberg Military Tribunal  |pages=508–511 |volume=I |url=http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/01/NMT01-T508.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070701135035/http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/01/NMT01-T508.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This vaccine was widely available and used extensively by 1943.

==Diagnosis==
IFA, [[ELISA]] or PCR positive after 10 days.

==Treatment==
The infection is treated with [[antibiotics]]. Intravenous fluids and [[oxygen]] may be needed to stabilize the patient. There is a significant disparity between the untreated mortality and treated mortality rates: 10-60% untreated versus close to 0% treated with antibiotics within 8 days of initial infection. [[Tetracycline]], [[chloramphenicol]], and [[doxycycline]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouqui|first=Philippe|date=2011-01-01|title=Arthropod-Borne Diseases Associated with Political and Social Disorder|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=56|issue=1|pages=357–374|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-120709-144739|pmid=20822446}}&lt;/ref&gt; are commonly used. Infection can also be prevented by vaccination.

Some of the simplest methods of prevention and treatment focus on preventing infestation of body lice. Complete change of clothing, washing the infested clothing in hot water, and in some cases also treating recently used bedsheets all help to prevent typhus by removing potentially infected lice. Clothes also left unworn and unwashed for 7 days also cause both lice and their eggs to die, as they have no access to their human host.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Raoult|first1=Didier|last2=Roux|first2=Véronique|date=1999-08-15|title=The Body Louse as a Vector of Reemerging Human Diseases|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/888|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=888–911|doi=10.1086/520454|issn=1058-4838|pmid=10589908|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of lice prevention requires dusting infested clothing with a powder consisting of 10% [[DDT]], 1% [[malathion]], or 1% [[permethrin]], which kill lice and their eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==History==

=== History of Outbreaks ===
During the second year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (430 BC), the [[city-state]] of [[History of Athens|Athens]] in ancient [[Greece]] was hit by a devastating epidemic, known as the [[Plague of Athens]], which killed, among others, [[Pericles]] and his two elder sons. The plague returned twice more, in 429 BC and in the winter of 427/6 BC. Epidemic typhus is a strong candidate for the cause of this disease outbreak, supported by both medical and scholarly opinions.&lt;ref&gt;At a January 1999 medical conference at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], Dr. David Durack, consulting professor of medicine at [[Duke University]] notes: ''&quot;Epidemic typhus fever is the best explanation. It hits hardest in times of war and privation, it has about 20 percent mortality, it kills the victim after about seven days, and it sometimes causes a striking complication: gangrene of the tips of the fingers and toes. The Plague of Athens had all these features.&quot;'' see also: [http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/athens.html umm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Arnold Wycombe Gomme |last=Gomme |first=A.W. |editor-first=A. |editor-last=Andrewes |editor2-first=K.J. |editor2-last=Dover |chapter=Volume 5.

The first description of typhus was probably given in 1083 at [[La Trinità della Cava|La Cava abbey]] near [[Salerno]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Waclaw |last=Szybalski  |title=Maintenance of human-fed live lice in the laboratory and production of Weigl's exanthematous typhus vaccine |year=1999 |url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/Weigl.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Beppe |last=Carugo |title=Breve Storia della Medicina, della Diagnostica, delle Arti Sanitarie |location= |year=2006 |edition=2nd |pages= |url=http://www.qualitologia.it/attivita/27.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1546, [[Girolamo Fracastoro]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] physician, described typhus in his famous treatise on viruses and contagion, ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fracastoro |first=Girolamo |authorlink=Girolamo Fracastoro |title=De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B580FxRJwQUC |location= |year=1546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typhus was a devastating disease for humans and was responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths during WWII.&lt;ref name= Zinsser&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinsser |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Zinsser |title=Rats, Lice and History: A Chronicle of Pestilence and Plagues |publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal |location=New York |origyear=1935 |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-884822-47-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ratslicehistoryb00zins_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typhus also arrived in Europe with soldiers who had been fighting on [[Cyprus]]. The first reliable description of the disease appears during the siege of the [[Emirate of Granada]] by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in 1489 during the [[Granada War]]. These accounts include descriptions of fever and red spots over arms, back and chest, progressing to delirium, gangrenous sores, and the stench of rotting flesh. During the siege, the Catholics lost 3,000 men to enemy action while an additional 17,000 died of typhus.

Typhus was also common in prisons (and in crowded conditions where lice spread easily), where it was known as ''Gaol fever'' or ''Jail fever''. Gaol fever often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms. Imprisonment until the next term of court was often equivalent to a death sentence. It was so infectious that prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected the court itself. Following the [[Black Assize of Oxford 1577]], over 300 died from epidemic typhus, including Speaker [[Robert Bell (Speaker)|Robert Bell]], [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]]. The outbreak that followed, between 1577 and 1579, killed about 10% of the [[English people|English population]]. During the [[assizes|Lent assize]] held at [[Taunton]] (1730) typhus caused the death of the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, as well as the [[High Sheriff of Somerset]], the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when there were 241 capital offences, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the realm. In 1759 an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph D. Smith, Comment, Criminal Law – Arrest – The Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest, 7 Nat. Resources J. 119, 122 n.16 (1967) (hereinafter Comment) (citing John Howard, The State of Prisons 6-7 (1929)) (Howard's observations are from 1773 to 1775). Copied from State v. Valentine May 1997 132 Wn.2d 1, 935 P.2d 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In [[London]], typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of [[Newgate Gaol]] and then moved into the general city population.

Epidemics occurred throughout Europe and occurred during the [[English Civil War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Many historians believe that the typhus outbreak among Napoleon's troops is the real reason why he stalled his military campaign into Russia instead of starvation or the cold.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Typhus- Biological Weapons|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio-typhus.htm|access-date=2020-10-09|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major epidemic occurred in [[Ireland]] between 1816–19, and again in the late 1830s, while yet another major typhus epidemic occurred during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] between 1846 and 1849. The Irish typhus spread to England, where it was sometimes called &quot;Irish fever&quot; and was noted for its virulence. It killed people of all social classes since lice were endemic and inescapable, but it hit particularly hard in the lower or &quot;unwashed&quot; social strata. In Canada, the [[1847 North American typhus epidemic]] killed more than 20,000 people, mainly Irish immigrants in [[fever shed]]s and other forms of quarantine, who had contracted the disease aboard [[coffin ships]].&lt;ref name=mccord1&gt;{{cite web |id=M993X.5.1529.1 |title=The government inspector's office|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/M993X.5.1529.1|work=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=[[Montreal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 900,000 deaths have been attributed to the typhus fever during the Crimean War in 1853-1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

In America, a typhus epidemic killed the son of [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] in 1843 and struck in [[Philadelphia]] in 1837. Several epidemics occurred in [[Baltimore]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] between 1865 and 1873. Typhus fever was also a significant killer during the [[American Civil War]], although [[typhoid]] fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War &quot;camp fever.&quot; Typhoid is a completely different disease from typhus.

Physician, anthropologist, historian [[Rudolph Carl Virchow]]’s attempt to control an outbreak of typhus in Upper Silesia and his subsequent 190-page report included the observation that the solution to the outbreak did not lie in individual treatment or small changes in housing, food or clothing provided, but rather in widespread structural changes that directly addressed the issue of poverty. Virchow’s experience in Upper Silesia led to the observation that “Medicine is a social science”. His report led to changes in German public health policy.

During [[World War I]] typhus caused three million deaths in Russia and more in [[Poland]] and [[Romania]]. Delousing stations were established for troops on the Western front but the disease ravaged the armies of the Eastern front, with over 150,000 dying in Serbia alone. Fatalities were generally between 10 and 40 percent of those infected, and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick. Between 1918 and 1922 typhus caused at least 3 million deaths out of 20–30 million cases. In Russia after World War I, during the [[Russian Civil War]] between the [[White Army|White]] and [[Red Army|Red]], typhus killed three million, largely civilians. 
During [[World War II]], typhus struck the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] during [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of Russia, in 1941.&lt;ref name =Mazal1/&gt; In 1942 and 1943 typhus hit [[French North Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]] particularly hard.&lt;ref&gt;Zarafonetis, Chris J.

Even larger epidemics in the post-war chaos of Europe were only averted by the widespread use of the newly discovered [[DDT]] to kill the lice on millions of refugees and displaced persons.

Following the development of a vaccine during World War II, epidemics have usually occurred in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and parts of Africa, particularly [[Ethiopia]], where its eradication was the focus of major research efforts by [[Naval Medical Research Unit Five]].

In one of its first major outbreaks since World War II, epidemic typhus reemerged in 1995 in a jail in [[Ngozi, Burundi|N'Gozi]], [[Burundi]]. This outbreak followed the outbreak of the [[Burundian Civil War]] in 1993 that caused the displacement of 760,000 people. Refugee camps were crowded and unsanitary, often far from towns and medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Raoult|first1=D|last2=Ndihokubwayo|first2=JB|last3=Tissot-Dupont|first3=H|last4=Roux|first4=V|last5=Faugere|first5=B|last6=Abegbinni|first6=R|last7=Birtles|first7=RJ|date=1998-08-01|title=Outbreak of epidemic typhus associated with trench fever in Burundi|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)12433-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=352|issue=9125|pages=353–358|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)12433-3|pmid=9717922|s2cid=25814472|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of Vaccines ===

Major developments for [[typhus]] [[vaccines]] started during [[World War I]] where typhus had become a serious problem for soldiers on the battlefield. &lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenmann|first=Jean|date=2002|title=Typhus Vaccine Developments from the First to the Second World War (On Paul Weindling's 'Between Bacteriology and Virology...')|url=|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|publisher=Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn - Napoli|volume=24|pages=467-485|doi=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccines for typhus, like other vaccines of the time, were classified as either living or killed vaccines.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenmann|first=Jean|date=2002|title=Typhus Vaccine Developments from the First to the Second World War (On Paul Weindling's 'Between Bacteriology and Virology...')|url=|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|publisher=Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn - Napoli|volume=24|pages=467-485|doi=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live vaccines were typically an injection of live agent, and killed vaccines are live cultures of an agent that are chemically inactivated prior to use. &lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenmann|first=Jean|date=2002|title=Typhus Vaccine Developments from the First to the Second World War (On Paul Weindling's 'Between Bacteriology and Virology...')|url=|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|publisher=Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn - Napoli|volume=24|pages=467-485|doi=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Biological weapon===
Typhus was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential [[biological weapon]]s before [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] suspended all non-defensive aspects of the U.S. biological weapons program in 1969.&lt;ref name=jmcenter&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical and Biological Weapons: Possession and Programs Past and Present |date=9 April 2002 |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |location=[[Middlebury College]] |url=http://cns.miis.edu/research/cbw/possess.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011002153149/http://www.cns.miis.edu/research/cbw/possess.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poverty and displacement ===
The CDC lists the following areas as active foci of human epidemic typhus: Andean regions of South America, some parts of Africa; on the other hand, the CDC only recognizes an active enzootic cycle in the United States involving [[flying squirrel]]s (CDC). Though epidemic typhus is commonly thought to be restricted to areas of the developing world, serological examination of homeless persons in Houston found evidence for exposure to the bacterial pathogens that cause epidemic typhus and murine typhus.  A study involving 930 homeless people in [[Marseilles, France]] found high rates of seroprevalence to ''R. prowazekii'' and a high prevalence of louse-borne infections in the homeless.

Typhus has been increasingly discovered in homeless populations in developed nations. Typhus among homeless populations is especially prevalent as these populations tend to migrate across states and countries, spreading the risk of infection with their movement. The same risk applies to [[refugee]]s, who travel across country lines, often living in close proximity and unable to maintain necessary hygienic standards to avoid being at risk for catching lice possibly infected with typhus.

Because the typhus-infected lice live in clothing, the prevalence of typhus is also affected by weather, humidity, poverty and lack of hygiene. Lice, and therefore typhus, are more prevalent during colder months, especially winter and early spring. In these seasons, people tend to wear multiple layers of clothing, giving lice more places to go unnoticed by their hosts. This is particularly a problem for [[poverty]]-stricken populations as they often do not have multiple sets of clothing, preventing them from practicing good hygiene habits that could prevent louse infestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Due to fear of an outbreak of epidemic typhus, the US Government put a typhus quarantine in place in 1917 across the entirety of the [[Mexico–United States border|US-Mexican border]]. Sanitation plants were constructed that required immigrants to be thoroughly inspected and bathed before crossing the border. Those who routinely crossed back and forth across the border for work were required to go through the sanitation process weekly, updating their quarantine card with the date of the next week's sanitation. These sanitation border stations remained active over the next two decades, regardless of the disappearance of the typhus threat. This fear of typhus and resulting quarantine and sanitation protocols dramatically hardened the border between the US and Mexico, fostering scientific and popular prejudices against Mexicans. This ultimately intensified racial tensions and fueled efforts to ban immigrants to the US from the Southern Hemisphere because the [[immigrants]] were associated with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontier of Better Breeding in Modern America|last=Stern|first=Alexandra Minna|publisher=University of California Press|year=2005|isbn=9780520285064|location=ProQuest ebrary|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

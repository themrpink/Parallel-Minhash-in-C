[[Christopher Levett]], an English naval captain granted {{convert|6000|acre|ha}} in 1623 to found a settlement in [[Casco Bay]]. A member of the [[Plymouth Council for New England|Council for New England]] and agent for [[Ferdinando Gorges]], Levett built a stone house where he left a company of ten men, then returned to England to write a book about his voyage to bolster support for the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/christopherleve00levegoog|quote=christopher levett.|title=Christopher Levett, of York: The Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay|first=James Phinney|last=Baxter|date=September 10, 1893|publisher=Gorges Society|accessdate=September 10, 2017|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the settlement was a failure and the fate of Levett's colonists is unknown. The explorer sailed from England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] to meet [[John Winthrop]] in 1630, but never returned to Maine. [[Fort Levett]] in the harbor is named for him.

The [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]] was settled in 1632 as a fishing and trading village named '''Casco'''.&lt;ref name=maineguide /&gt; When the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] took over Casco Bay in 1658, the town's name changed again to '''Falmouth'''. In 1676, the village was destroyed by the [[Abenaki]] during [[King Philip's War]]. It was rebuilt. During [[King William's War]], a raiding party of French and their native allies attacked and largely destroyed it again in the [[Battle of Fort Loyal]] (1690).

On October 18, 1775, [[Burning of Falmouth|Falmouth was burned]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] by the [[Royal Navy]] under command of Captain [[Henry Mowat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainememory.net/bin/Detail?ln=7479|title=Jedediah Preble letter on Mowat kidnapping, 1775|accessdate=April 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033714/http://www.mainememory.net/bin/Detail?ln=7479|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, a section of Falmouth called The Neck developed as a commercial port and began to grow rapidly as a shipping center. In 1786, the citizens of Falmouth formed a separate town in Falmouth Neck and named it '''Portland''', after the [[Isle of Portland|isle]] off the coast of [[Dorset]], England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolidge, A.J 1859. p. 301&quot;/&gt; Portland's economy was greatly stressed by the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] (prohibition of trade with the British), which ended in 1809, and the [[War of 1812]], which ended in 1815.

In 1820, Maine was established as a state with Portland as its capital. In 1832, the capital was moved north and East to [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]]. In 1851, Maine led the nation by passing the first state law prohibiting the sale of alcohol except for &quot;medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes.&quot; The law subsequently became known as the [[Maine law]], as 18 states quickly followed. On June 2, 1855, the [[Portland Rum Riot]] occurred.

In 1853, upon completion of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] to [[Montreal]], Portland became the primary ice-free winter seaport for Canadian exports. The [[Portland Company]], located on Fore Street, manufactured more than 600 19th-century steam [[locomotive]]s, as well as engines for trains and boats, fire engines and other railroad transportation equipment. The [[Portland Company]] was, for a time, the city's largest employer and many of its employees were immigrants from Canada, Ireland and Italy. Portland became a 20th-century [[junction (rail)|rail hub]] as five additional rail lines merged into [[Portland Terminal Company]] in 1911. Following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923, Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to [[Halifax Harbour|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], resulting in marked local economic decline. In the 20th century, [[icebreaker]]s later enabled ships to reach Montreal in winter, drastically reducing Portland's role as a winter port for Canada.

On June 26, 1863, a Confederate raiding party led by Captain Charles Read entered the harbor at Portland leading to the [[Battle of Portland Harbor]], one of the northernmost battles of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[1866 Great Fire of Portland, Maine]], on July 4, 1866, ignited during the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration, destroyed most of the commercial buildings in the city, half the churches and hundreds of homes. More than 10,000 people were left homeless.

By act of the Maine Legislature in 1899, Portland annexed the city of [[Deering, Maine|Deering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maine Secretary of State|title=Private and Special Laws of the State of Maine|date=1899|publisher=Kennebec Journal Print|pages=9–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3xKAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=portland+deering+annex&amp;pg=RA1-PA9|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a vote by Deering residents rejecting the annexation, thereby greatly increasing the size of the city and opening areas for development beyond the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conforti|first1=Joseph|title=Creating Portland|date=2007|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-449-0|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WjGkuhZyaoC&amp;q=portland+deering+expansion&amp;pg=PR17|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of [[The Maine Mall]], an indoor shopping center established in the suburb of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], during the 1970s, economically depressed downtown Portland. The trend reversed when tourists and new businesses started revitalizing the old seaport, a part of which is known locally as the Old Port. Since the 1990s, the historically industrial Bayside neighborhood has seen rapid development, including attracting a Whole Foods and Trader Joes supermarkets, as well as [[Baxter Academy for Technology and Science]], an increasingly popular charter school.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|69.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|21.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|48.13|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portland is situated on a peninsula in Casco Bay on the [[Gulf of Maine]] and the Atlantic Ocean.

Portland borders [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], [[Westbrook, Maine|Westbrook]] and [[Falmouth, Maine|Falmouth]]. The city is located at 43.66713 N, 70.20717 W.

=== Climate ===
Portland has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''), with cold, snowy, and often prolonged winters, and warm, relatively short summers. The monthly average high temperature ranges from roughly {{convert|30|°F|0}} in January to around {{convert|80|°F|0}} in July. Daily high temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on only 4 days per year on average, while cold-season lows of {{convert|0|°F|0}} or below are reached on 10 nights per year on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portland weatherbox NOAA&quot;/&gt; The area can be affected by severe [[nor'easter]]s during winter, with high winds and snowfall totals often measuring over a foot. Annual liquid precipitation (rain) averages {{convert|47.2|in|sigfig=3}} and is plentiful year-round, but with a slightly drier summer. Annual frozen precipitation (snow) averages {{convert|62|in|cm|0}} in the city. However, neighborhoods away from the immediate coast average slightly more, as the warmer ocean waters and onshore flow can cause snow to transition to sleet or rain along the coast. In Southern Maine, winter-season snowstorms can be intense from November through early April, while warm-season thunderstorms are somewhat less frequent than in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern U.S. Direct strikes by hurricanes or tropical storms are rare, partially due to the normally cooler Atlantic waters off the Maine coast (which usually weaken tropical systems), but primarily because most tropical systems approaching or reaching 40 degrees North latitude recurve (due to the Coriolis force) and track east out to sea well south of the Portland area. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−39|°F|0}} on February 16, 1943, to {{convert|103|°F|0}} on July 4, 1911, and August 2, 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portland weatherbox NOAA&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by template: Portland, Maine weatherbox --&gt;

Portland is organized into neighborhoods generally recognized by residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeportland.com/resources/neighborhoods|title=Neighborhoods|work=Portland, Maine|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201192919/http://www.creativeportland.com/resources/neighborhoods|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have no legal or political authority. In many cases, city signs identify neighborhoods or intersections (which are often called corners). Most city neighborhoods have a local association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginportland.org/|title=Neighborhoods Associations - Portland, ME|website=www.livinginportland.org|accessdate=September 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105032934/http://www.livinginportland.org/|archive-date=January 5, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually maintains ongoing relations of varying degrees with the city government on issues affecting the neighborhood.

On March 8, 1899, Portland annexed the neighboring city of Deering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Shall We Tax the Hunters? |work=Lewiston Evening Journal |date= February 2, 1899 |page=2 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZMIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=926,2137056&amp;dq=portland+deering&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deering neighborhoods now comprise the northern and eastern sections of the city before the merger. Portland's [[Deering High School]] was formerly the public high school for Deering.

Portland has become Maine's economic capital because the city has Maine's largest port, largest population, and is close to Boston (105 miles to the south). Over the years, the local economy has shifted from fishing, [[manufacturing]], and agriculture towards a more [[service economy|service-based economy]]. Most national [[financial services]] organizations such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank|Key Bank]] base their Maine operations in Portland. [[Unum]], [[TruChoice Federal Credit Union]], [[People's United Bank]], [[ImmuCell Corp]], and [[Pioneer Telephone]] have headquarters here, and Portland's neighboring cities of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], [[Westbrook, Maine|Westbrook]] and [[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]], provide homes for other corporations including [[Idexx Laboratories|IDEXX]] and [[WEX Inc.|WEX Inc]]. Since 1867, Burnham &amp; Morrill Co., maker of B&amp;M Baked Beans, has had its main plant in Portland and is considered a landmark.

The city's port is also undergoing a revival and the first-ever container train departed from the new International Marine Terminal with 15 containers of locally produced bottled water in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/06/poland-spring-to-ship-water-by-train-to-massachusetts-distributors/|title=Poland Spring to ship water by train to Massachusetts distributors|date=2016-04-06|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americold]], a US-based international provider of temperature-controlled storage and distribution, won a bid to develop a state-of-the-art temperature-controlled storage facility adjacent to the port.  The facility will support perishable produce, meats, and seafood imports with direct exports but construction has not yet begun.

Portland has a low unemployment rate (3% in June 2017) when compared to national and state averages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/laummtrk.htm] Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The city and its adjacent communities also have higher median incomes than most of the state.

In January 2020 Portland was announced to be the location of a new research institute that will focus on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. [[Northeastern University]] was selected by technology entrepreneur David Roux to lead the institute that will include programs that will allow graduate student research.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/01/28/northeastern-university-launches-100-million-research-center-maine&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland also has a large subsidized housing industry with more than five large real estate companies entirely in the business.

Portland has a long history of prominence in the arts, peaking the first time in the early nineteenth century, when the city was &quot;a rival, and not a satellite of either Boston or New York.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sears | first = Donald A. | title = John Neal | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1978 | isbn = 080-5-7723-08 | page = 124, quoting Edward C.

Portland has enjoyed an arts-related revitalization since the late twentieth century.

The spire of the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Portland, Maine)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] has been a notable feature of the Portland skyline since its completion in 1854. In 1859, [[Ammi B. Young]] designed the Marine Hospital, the first of three local works by [[Office of the Supervising Architect|Supervising Architects of the U.S. Treasury Department]]. Although the city lost to redevelopment its 1867 [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] post office, which was designed by [[Alfred B. Mullett]] of white [[Vermont]] [[marble]] and featured a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[portico]], Portland retains his equally monumental 1872 [[granite]] [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]–[[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance Revival]] [[custom house]].

A more recent building of note is [[Franklin Towers]], a 16-story residential tower completed in 1969. At 175 feet (53 meters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/franklintowers-portland-me-usa|title=Franklin Towers|accessdate=2014-02-13|publisher=Emporis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is Portland's (as well as Maine's) tallest building. It is next to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on the city skyline. During the building boom of the 1980s, several new buildings rose on the peninsula, including the 1983 Charles Shipman Payson Building by [[Henry N. Cobb]] of [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners|Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners]] at the [[Portland Museum of Art]] complex (a component of which is the 1801 [[McLellan-Sweat Mansion]]), and the Back Bay Tower, a 15-story residential building completed in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbre.com/NR/rdonlyres/3CB731EA-C269-11D5-A91D-00508B5B0FEB/328757/PortlandMarketSurvey2006.pdf |title=Greater Portland Area 2006 Office Market Survey |accessdate=August 10, 2006 |author=CB Richard Ellis/The Boulos Company |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822013259/http://www.cbre.com/NR/rdonlyres/3CB731EA-C269-11D5-A91D-00508B5B0FEB/328757/PortlandMarketSurvey2006.pdf |archivedate=August 22, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

477 Congress Street (known locally as the [[Time and Temperature Building]]) is situated near [[Monument Square (Portland, Maine)|Monument Square]] in the Arts District and is a major landmark: the 14-story building features a large electronic sign on its roof that flashes time and temperature data, as well as parking ban information in the winter. The sign can be seen from nearly all of downtown Portland. The building is home to several radio stations.

In 1970, there was a first state reform, which resulted in the establishment of three cultural communities: the Dutch Cultural Community, the French Cultural Community and the German Cultural Community. This reform was a response to the [[Flanders|Flemish]] demand for cultural autonomy. The constitutional revision of 1970 also laid the foundations for the establishment of three [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Regions]], which was a response to the demand of the [[Wallonia|Walloons]] and the French-speaking inhabitants of [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] for economic autonomy. On February 18, 1970, [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Gaston Eyskens]] announces the end of &quot;La Belgique de papa&quot;.

The second state reform took place in 1980, when the cultural communities became [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Communities]]. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the [[Flemish Community]], the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the [[Flemish Region]] and the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge the institutions of the Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was not established until the third state reform.

During the third state reform in 1988 and 1989, under [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfried Martens]], the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was established with its own regional institutions, as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]] institutions for community matters. The Brussels-Capital Region remained limited to 19 municipalities. Other changes included that the competencies of the Communities and Regions were expanded. One notable responsibility that was transferred to the Communities during the third state reform was education.

[[File:Belgium province Brabant.png|thumb|right|Map showing the division of [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] (yellow), [[Walloon Brabant]] (red) and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]] (orange) in 1995]]

The fourth state reform, which took place in 1993 under Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], consolidated the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] was amended to read as follows, “Belgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions”. During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the [[Province of Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]], and the reformation of the [[Federal Parliament of Belgium|Federal Parliament's]] [[bicameralism|bicameral]] system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the [[Belgian Federal Government|Federal Government]]. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.

However, the fourth state reform was not the end of the process of federalization. In 2001, a fifth state reform took place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=contentPage&amp;docId=42152.0 | title = Belgium.be | accessdate = 1 November 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184522/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&amp;event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&amp;pageid=contentPage&amp;docId=42152.0 | archive-date = 30 September 2007 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; under Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], with the Lambermont and the Lombard Accords. In the course of that reform, more powers were transferred to the Communities and the Regions, with regard to agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, development cooperation, auditing of electoral expenses and the supplementary financing of the political parties. The Regions became responsible for twelve regional taxes, and local and provincial government became a matter for the Regions. The first municipal and provincial elections under the supervision of the Regions were the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 municipal elections]]. The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other things in a guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants of Brussels in the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]].

At the end of 2011, following the longest political crisis in Belgium's contemporary history, a constitutional accord between the four main political families (socialists, liberals, social-Christians, ecologists), but excluding the Flemish nationalists, ushered in the [[Sixth Belgian state reform|sixth state reform]] which provided for major institutional changes and additional transfers of competences from the federal level to the Communities and the Regions. Among other changes, the Senate ceased to be directly elected to become an assembly of regional parliaments, the Brussels-Capital Region was granted constitutive autonomy, and the Regions received economic, employment and family welfare competences as well as greater fiscal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/country/history/belgium_from_1830/formation_federal_state/sixth_state_reform/ | title=Sixth State Reform| date=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium was one of the founders of the European [[European Economic Community|Common Market]]. Between 1999 and 2002, the [[Euro]] gradually replaced the [[Belgian franc]] (the currency of Belgium since 1830) at the rate of 1 EUR=40.3399 BEF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium and the euro|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/countries/belgium_en.htm|work=Economic and financial affairs|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian Euro coins usually depict [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] on the obverse.

===Political parties===
:''See also [[Political parties in Belgium]]''
From the 1960s, most political parties, which had previously stood in elections in both Flemish and Walloon areas, split down linguistic divides. The [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Catholic party]] split in 1968 while the [[Belgian Socialist Party]] split in 1978 into the French-speaking [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]] and Flemish [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialistische Partij]].&lt;ref name=SocialDem1&gt;{{cite book|last=Liebman|first=Marcel|title=The Crisis of Belgian Social Democracy|year=1966|publisher=The Socialist Register 1966|pages=44–65|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/liebman/1966/xx/belgium.htm|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Party for Freedom and Progress|Liberals]] also split on regional lines in 1992.

&quot;Green&quot; politics in Belgium became quite successful in the aftermath of the [[Marc Dutroux]] Scandal and the &quot;[[Dioxin Affair]]&quot; which led to disillusionment with the preexisting parties and the decline of the Catholic vote.

===1990 to present===

===The Marc Dutroux scandal===
{{Main|Marc Dutroux}}
In 1996, confidence in the political and criminal justice systems was shaken by the news that one [[Marc Dutroux]] and his accomplices had kidnapped, tortured, and murdered young girls. Parliamentary inquiries found the police forces were incompetent and bureaucratic, and the judicial system suffered from bureaucracy, very poor communication with, and support for, the victims, slow procedures and many loopholes for criminals.  On October 26, 1996, about 300,000 Belgians joined the &quot;[[White March]]&quot; in Brussels in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hubert Bocken, Walter de Bondt|author2=Walter De Bondt|title=Introduction to Belgian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNwjZg0r8RgC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Law International|pages=18–19|isbn=9789041114563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgian military intervention since 1990===
[[File:UNAMIR Blue Berets memorial Kigali (2).jpg|thumb|right|Site of the massacre of Belgian UN personnel in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]].]]
The [[United Nations]] mission in Rwanda during the [[Rwandan Civil War]], known as [[UNAMIR]], involved a significant Belgian contingent under the command of [[Roméo Dallaire]]. Belgium, as the former colonial power in the country, sent the largest force of around 400 soldiers from the [[2nd Commando Battalion (Belgium)|2nd Commando Battalion]].

After the [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|downing of the Rwandan and Burundian presidential plane]] 10 Belgian peacekeepers were kidnapped, mutilated and murdered by the Hutu-dominated government army. In response, Belgium withdrew all of its peacekeepers, blaming UNAMIR for failing to rescue their men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Events during the Rwandan Genocide|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/justiceontrial/rwanda_chronology.html|publisher=American Radio Works|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgians had represented the largest and most capable element in the UNAMIR mission, leaving it incapacitated and unable to cope with the events of the [[Rwandan genocide]].

Belgian paratroopers were deployed to [[Somalia]] during [[Operation Restore Hope]] as part of [[UNOSOM II|UNOSOM]] tasked with securing aid deliveries and peacekeeping. Several Belgian soldiers were killed during the deployment.

During the [[Kosovo crisis]] of 1999, 600 Belgian [[paratroopers]] participated in Operation Allied Harbour, a [[NATO]] operation to protect and provide assistance to the huge number of ethnic Albanian [[refugees]] in [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. That same year, 1,100 Belgian soldiers left for [[Kosovo]] to participate in the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), a NATO-led [[peacekeeping]] force.

Belgian soldiers have served in [[Lebanon]], under the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL). Approximately 394 Belgians have served in Lebanon, in demining and medical operations, and a [[Belgian frigate Leopold I (F930)|frigate]] is also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.N. force looks more European, less multinational|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/1775|newspaper=Asian Tribune|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium to send 400 troops to Lebanon|url=http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/belgium-to-send-400-troops-to-lebanon-32572.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123045338/http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/belgium-to-send-400-troops-to-lebanon-32572.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 January 2013|publisher=Expatica Communications|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium to assume command of UNIFIL's maritime task force|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/news/2009/news_unifil.jsp|publisher=belgium.be|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belgian military F-16 Fighting Falcon conducts a combat patrol over Afghanistan.JPG|thumb|right|[[Belgian Air Component|Belgian]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] conducts a combat patrol over Afghanistan, 2008]]
In the 2011, the [[Belgian Air Force]] deployed six [[F-16 Falcon|F-16]] fighter jets in support of the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]]. Belgian aircraft were involved in airstrikes on [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|pro-Ghadaffi forces]].

Belgium is part of the [[ISAF]] mission in Afghanistan, joint with soldiers from Luxembourg. Its continent is named ''BELU ISAF 21,'' with the main objective of providing security at [[Kabul International Airport]], while detachments (''KUNDUZ 16'') assist in the northern PRTs of [[Kunduz]] and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. In September 2008, four [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F‑16 jets]] with about 140 support personnel were deployed. They operate from [[Kandahar Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgische F-16's in Afghanistan zijn Operationeel|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=DMF09092008_067|publisher=Het Nieuwsblad|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Air Force operated close together with the Dutch F-16 fighter jets already deployed there.

===Debt and economic slowdown===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Belgium created huge debts during times when rates were low and generated new debts to service the initial debt. Its debts amounted to about 130% of the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] in 1992 and were reduced to about 99% in 2001 when Belgium entered the [[Eurozone]]. This drastic economic policy resulted in deep budget spending cuts, such as significant cuts to scientific research.

===Internal politics===
In the [[Belgian federal election, 1999|1999 Belgian federal election]], the traditional government parties suffered a significant defeat due to the so-called &quot;[[Dioxin Affair]]&quot;, leading to the fall of [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]]'s government after eight years in office. [[Guy Verhofstadt]] formed a government of [[Liberalism in Belgium|Liberals]], [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and [[Green movement|Greens]], forming a government without the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|Christian People's Party]] for the first time since 1958.

In July 1999, a government of [[Groen!|Greens]] and [[Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] announced a gradual phase-out of [[Nuclear reactors in Belgium|Belgium's seven nuclear reactors]] after 40 years of operation. Though it was speculated that the next government without Greens would immediately revoke this legislation,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf | title = Essential Programme to Underpin Government Policy on Nuclear Power | publisher = Scientific Alliance | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050905210619/http://www.scientific-alliance.org/pdf/essential_programme_to_underpin_government_policy_on_nuclear_power.pdf | archivedate = 2005-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the 2003 elections there was still no sign of a policy reversal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of nuclear in current member states|url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/596-8/h3.php|publisher=World Information Service on Energy|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  particularly in the aftermath of the incident at [[Tihange Nuclear Power Station|Tihange reactor]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious incident vindicates Belgian nuclear phaseout|url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/582/5485.html|publisher=World Information Service on Energy|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] proposed a reconsideration of the phase out.

The Belgian government was strongly opposed to the [[Iraq War]] during the [[Iraq crisis of 2003]]. The [[Guy Verhofstadt|Verhofstadt government]] proposed a diplomatic solution regarding [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] and took the view that military action could only be taken with UN approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-i/irak/23.asp | title = Irak | work = Dossier | publisher = GVA | access-date = 2006-12-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030804193910/http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-i/irak/23.asp | archive-date = 2003-08-04 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2003, Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize [[same-sex marriage]]. However, this law did not permit [[Gay adoption|adoption by same-sex partners]]. In December 2005, a controversial proposal by the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party]] to permit adoption was approved by the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]].

===Political Crisis 2010–11===
[[File:Elio di Rupo-15-12-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elio di Rupo]], the Prime Minister of Belgium until 2014]]
:''See also [[Belgian federal election, 2010]] and [[2010–2011 Belgian government formation]]''

The [[Belgian federal election, 2010|2010 Belgian federal election]] produced a highly fragmented political landscape, with 11 parties elected to the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]], none of which had more than 20% of the seats.  The separatist [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA), the largest party in [[Flanders]] and the country as a whole, controlled 27 of 150 seats in the lower chamber.  The Francophone [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS), the largest party in [[Wallonia]], controlled 26 seats.  Belgium beat the world record for time taken to form a new democratic government after an election, at 353 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fries Revolution: Belgium's Political Crisis Foretells EU's Future|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-fries-revolution-belgium-s-political-crisis-foretells-eu-s-future-a-751536.html|newspaper=Spiegel Online|accessdate=18 November 2012|date=2011-03-17|last1=Mayr|first1=Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally a government coalition was sworn in on 6 December 2011, with Socialist [[Elio Di Rupo]] becoming Prime Minister of the [[Di Rupo Government]].

==Historiography==
Modern [[historiography]] of Belgium began to appear in the later 18th century, as scholars moved beyond the chronicles of particular provinces, cities or leaders and relied on rapidly accumulating data. They wrote dissertations using the critical approach to particular historical problems. This development was sponsored by [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]] and reflected Enlightenment influences—such as that of [[Voltaire]]—in exploring the history of the people. They pondered questions of causality. Their goal was building the blocks for a general history of the Austrian Netherlands, thus marking an important step toward the creation of a Belgian national history.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Verschaffel, &quot;The modernization of historiography in 18th-century Belgium,&quot; ''History of European Ideas'' (2005) 31#2 pp 135–146&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Belgium became an independent nation only in 1830, defining nationhood was a special issue for the historians of the late 19th century.  The usual European solutions which defined nationhood in terms of language would not work.  The Romantic Joseph-Jean de Smet portrayed his country as a &quot;phoenix&quot; (a reference to the great bird that rose from the dead.)  The challenge of defining the nation's past and present in the face of Dutch, Spanish, Austrian, French, and German influences posed a central problem.  Defending the boundaries of Belgium (especially why Flanders should not be in the Netherlands) was another issue that preoccupied historical writers such as Pirenne.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Tollebeek, &quot;Historical representation and the nation-state in romantic Belgium (1830–1850),&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1998) 59#2 pp 329–53 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3653979 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The medievalist Godefroid Kurth (1847–1916) was a student of Germany's famous professor [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Kurth introduced Ranke's advanced scholarly methods in his seminar at the Universite de Liège. Belgian historiography achieved international stature in the early 20th century with the work of medievalist [[Henri Pirenne]] (1862–1935).&lt;ref&gt;Jo Tollebeek, &quot;At the crossroads of nationalism: Huizinga, Pirenne and the Low Countries in Europe,&quot; ''European Review of History'' (2010) 17#2 pp 187–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historiography at [[Ghent University]] was pioneered by medievalists, especially Hubert Van Houtte. After 1945 [[Charles Verlinden]] introduced the methods of the French [[Annales School]] of social history. Research topics at Ghent included colonial and maritime history, the history of prices and wages, agrarian history, business history, and the textile industry. In the 1970 and 1980s came a broadening to such topics as historical demography; living standards and lifestyles; beggary and crime; and the history of culture and mind-sets.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Soly, &quot;Honderd Jaar Geschiedenis van de Nieuwe Tijd Aan de Universiteit Gent: De Dynamiek van een Selectief En Kritisch Eclectisme,&quot; [One hundred years of modern history at the University of Ghent: the dynamics of a selective and critical eclecticism], ''Handelingen der Maatschappij voor Geschiedenis en Oudheidkunde te Gent'' (2006), Vol. 60, pp 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Logarithmic Spiral Pylab.svg|thumb|Logarithmic spiral (pitch 10°)]]

A '''logarithmic spiral''', '''equiangular spiral''', or '''growth spiral''' is a [[self-similarity|self-similar]] [[spiral]] [[curve]] that often appears in nature. The logarithmic spiral was first described by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and later extensively investigated by [[Jacob Bernoulli]], who called it ''Spira mirabilis'', &quot;the marvelous spiral&quot;.

The logarithmic spiral can be distinguished from the [[Archimedean spiral]] by the fact that the distances between the turnings of a logarithmic spiral increase in [[geometric progression]], while in an Archimedean spiral these distances are constant.

==Definition==
In [[polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; the [[logarithm]]ic spiral can be written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Divine Proportion: Φ Phi in Art, Nature, and Science | author = Priya Hemenway | isbn = 978-1-4027-3522-6 | publisher = Sterling Publishing Co | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = ae^{k\varphi},\quad \varphi  \in \mathbb R,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1}{k} \ln \frac{r}{a},&lt;/math&gt;

with [[e (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;]] being the base of natural logarithms, and &lt;math&gt;a&gt; 0, k\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; being real constants.

== In Cartesian coordinates ==
The logarithmic spiral with the polar equation
:&lt;math&gt;\; r=a e^{k\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; 
can be represented in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x=r\cos\varphi,\, y=r\sin\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; by
* &lt;math&gt;x = a e^{k\varphi}\cos \varphi, \qquad y = a e^{k\varphi}\sin \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;
In the [[complex plane]] &lt;math&gt;(z=x+iy,\, e^{i\varphi}=\cos\varphi + i\sin\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;z=ae^{(k+i)\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

==''Spira mirabilis'' and Jacob Bernoulli==
'''''Spira mirabilis''''', [[Latin]] for &quot;miraculous spiral&quot;, is another name for the logarithmic spiral. Although this curve had already been named by other mathematicians, the specific name (&quot;miraculous&quot; or &quot;marvelous&quot; spiral) was given to this curve by [[Jacob Bernoulli]], because he was fascinated by one of its unique mathematical properties: the size of the spiral increases but its shape is unaltered with each successive curve, a property known as [[self-similarity]]. Possibly as a result of this unique property, the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature, appearing in certain growing forms such as [[nautilus]] shells and [[sunflower]] heads.  Jacob Bernoulli wanted such a spiral engraved on his [[headstone]] along with the phrase &quot;[[Eadem mutata resurgo]]&quot; (&quot;Although changed, I shall arise the same.&quot;), but, by error, an [[Archimedean spiral]] was placed there instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;livio&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Livio |first=Mario |year=2002 |title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7679-0815-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/goldenratiostory00livi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yates, R. C.: ''A Handbook on Curves and Their Properties'', J. W. Edwards (1952), &quot;Evolutes&quot;. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Spiral-log-st-se.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Definition of slope angle and sector]]
The logarithmic spiral &lt;math&gt;\; r=a e^{k\varphi} \;,\; k\ne 0,\;&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties (see [[Spiral]]):

* '''Polar slope''': &lt;math&gt;\  \tan\alpha=k\quad ( {\color{red}{\text{constant !}}} )&lt;/math&gt; 
: with ''polar slope angle'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (see diagram).
:(In case of &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; would be 0 and the curve a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.)

* '''Curvature''': &lt;math&gt;\; \kappa=\frac{1}{r\sqrt{1+k^2}}=\frac{\cos \alpha}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

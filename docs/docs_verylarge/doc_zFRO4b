'''Dogma''' in the broad sense is any belief held unquestioningly and with undefended certainty. It may be in the form of an official system of [[principle|principles]] or [[doctrine|doctrines]] of a [[religion]], such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] or [[Protestantism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05089a.htm|title=Dogma|website=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia|access-date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Philosophical theory|positions]] of a philosopher or of a [[Philosophical movement|philosophical school]] such as [[Stoicism]].

In the [[pejorative]] sense, dogma refers to enforced decisions, such as those of aggressive political interests or authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], &quot;dogma.&quot; Merriam-Webster.com | An Encyclopædia Britannica Company, Inc. 1831 | &lt;www.merriam-webster.com/about-us/faq&gt; http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dogma|title=Dogma|website=dictionary.com|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is applied to some strong belief which its adherents are not willing to discuss rationally. This attitude is named as a dogmatic one, or as dogmatism; and is often used to refer to matters related to religion, but is not limited to theistic attitudes alone and is often used with respect to political or philosophical dogmas.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dogma&quot; was translated in the 17th century from Latin ''dogma'' meaning &quot;philosophical tenet&quot; or principle, derived from the Greek ''dogma'' (δόγμα) meaning literally &quot;that which one thinks is true&quot; and the verb ''dokein'', &quot;to seem good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dogma|title=Dogma (n)|date=2016|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dogma|title=Dogma|website=The Free Encyclopedia by Farlex|access-date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plural, based on the Greek, is &quot;dogmata&quot; ({{respell|dawg-MAH-tah}}), though &quot;dogmas&quot; may be more commonly used in English.

== Religion ==
Formally, the term dogma has been used by some theistic religious groups to describe the body of positions forming the group's most central, foundational, or essential beliefs, though the term may also be used to refer to the entire set of formal beliefs identified by a theistic or non-theistic religious group.  In some cases dogma is distinguished from religious opinion and those things in doctrine considered less significant or uncertain. Formal church dogma is often clarified and elaborated upon in its communication.

=== Buddhism===
{{main|View (Buddhism)}}
[[View (Buddhism)|View]] or position ([[Pali]] ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|dṛṣṭi}}'') is a central idea in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=1}} In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lusthaus 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/buddhist_phenomenology_-_a_pholosophical_investigation_of_yogacara_buddhism_and_the_cheng_wei-shih_lun.pdf|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=242, n. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to be put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, while othertimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pages=1–2}}

=== Christianity ===
In the Christian Church, ''dogma'' means a belief communicated by divine revelation and defined by the Church,{{sfn|Blackburn|2016|p=139}} In the narrower sense of the church's official interpretation of divine revelation,{{sfn|Stanglin|2009|p=240}} theologians distinguish between defined and non-defined dogmas, the former being those set out by authoritative bodies such as the Roman Curia for the Catholic Church, the latter being those which are universally held but have not been officially defined, the nature of Christ as universal redeemer being an example.{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|pp=162–63}} The term originated in late Greek philosophy legal usage, in which it meant a decree or command, and came to be used in the same sense in early Christian theology.{{sfn|McKim|2001|p=350}}

Christianity is defined by a set of core beliefs shared by virtually all Christians, though how those core beliefs are implemented and secondary questions vary within Christianity. When formally communicated by the organization, these beliefs are sometimes referred to as 'dogmata'.   The organization's formal religious positions may be taught to new members or simply communicated to those who choose to become members. It is rare for agreement with an organization's formal positions to be a requirement for attendance, though membership may be required for some church activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfordreference.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t98.e978], &quot;dogma&quot;  The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press,  2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to differing degrees are less formal about doctrine, and often rely on denomination-specific beliefs, but seldom refer to these beliefs as dogmata. The first unofficial institution of dogma in the Christian church was by [[Irenaeus|Saint Irenaeus]] in his ''Demonstration of Apostolic Teaching'', which provides a 'manual of essentials' constituting the 'body of truth'.

==== Catholicism and Eastern Christianity ====
{{main|Dogma in the Catholic Church}}
For [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Christianity]], the dogmata are contained in the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[canon law]]s of two, three, seven, or twenty [[ecumenical council]]s (depending on whether one is [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). These tenets are summarized by [[John of Damascus]] in his ''Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith'', which is the third book of his main work, titled ''The Fount of Knowledge''. In this book he takes a dual approach in explaining each article of the faith: one, directed at Christians, where he uses quotes from the [[Bible]] and, occasionally, from works of other [[Church Fathers]], and the second, directed both at members of non-Christian religions and at [[atheist]]s, for whom he employs [[term logic|Aristotelian logic]] and [[dialectics]].

The decisions of fourteen later councils that Catholics hold as dogmatic and a small number of decrees promulgated by [[pope]]s exercising [[papal infallibility]] (for examples, see [[Immaculate Conception]] and [[Assumption of Mary]]) are considered as being a part of the Catholic Church's sacred body of doctrine.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Iman (concept)#The Six Articles of Faith}}
In [[Islam]] the Quran'', [[Hadith]]'', and ''[[aqidah]]'' correspond, albeit differently across cultural and theological lines, to the Latin terms ''dogma/dogmata''.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad ʻĀbid Jābirī, &quot;the principle of analogy&quot;, in Arab-Islamic Philosophy, trans. Aziz Abbassi (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999), 74-85. {{ISBN|9780292704800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

===Epicureanism===
[[Epicureanism]] is a dogmatic philosophy teaching that truth is knowable and that there are knowable, measurable, observable truths. Its philosophical dogmatism is grounded on the Epicurean view of [[empiricism]] and based on the evidence of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;https://societyofepicurus.com/advise-to-new-students-of-epicurean-philosophy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoicism===
In [[Stoicism]] &quot;dogma&quot; (δόγμα) is a principle established by reason and experience. Stoicism has many dogmas, such as the well-known Stoic dogma &quot;the only good is moral good, and the only evil is moral evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptypes.com/fundamental_dogmas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyrrhonism===
{{Pyrrhonism sidebar}}
In [[pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosophy &quot;dogma&quot; refers to assent to a proposition about a non-evident matter.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, 'Outlines of Pyrrhonism', I. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The main principle of Pyrrhonism is expressed by the word ''[[acatalepsia]]'', which connotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of [[Noumenon|things in their own nature]]; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification. Consequently, Pyrrhonists withhold assent with regard to non-evident propositions, i.e., dogmas.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, 'Outlines of Pyrrhonism', I. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Pyrrhonists argue that dogmatists, such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]], and [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetics]], have failed to demonstrate that their doctrines regarding non-evident matters are true.

It is the capital of the [[Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria]] and the seat of the Regional Council of Calabria.

Reggio is located on the &quot;toe&quot; of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and is separated from the island of [[Sicily]] by the [[Strait of Messina]]. It is situated on the slopes of the [[Aspromonte]], a long, craggy mountain range that runs up through the centre of the region. The third economic centre of mainland [[Southern Italy]], the city proper has a population of more than 200,000 inhabitants spread over {{convert|236|km²|0|abbr=out}}, while the fast-growing urban area numbers 260,000 inhabitants. About 560,000 people live in the metropolitan area, recognised in 2015 by [[Italian Republic]] as a [[Metropolitan cities of Italy|metropolitan city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_marzo_22/stella_b2bc9ae0-16bf-11de-a7e8-00144f486ba6.shtml|title=E Reggio Calabria diventa &quot;metropoli&quot;|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a major functional pole in the region, it has strong historical, cultural and economic ties with the city of [[Messina]], which lies across the strait in [[Sicily]], forming a metro city of less than 1 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.strill.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=174146|title=Area dello Stretto: Messina rilancia|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reggio is the oldest city in the region, and during ancient times, it was an important and flourishing colony of [[Magna Graecia]]. Reggio has a modern urban system, set up after the catastrophic [[1908 Messina earthquake|earthquake of 1908]], which destroyed most of the city. The region has been subject to earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protezionecivile-imbersago.com/rischio-sismico.html|title=L'Italia è un paese ad alto rischio sismico - Protezione Civile Imbersago|first=Massimo|last=Corno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a major economic centre for regional services and transport on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Reggio, with [[Naples]] and [[Taranto]], is home to one of the most important archaeological museums, the prestigious [[Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia|National Archaeological Museum of Magna Græcia]], dedicated to [[Ancient Greece]] (which houses the [[Riace bronzes|Bronzes of Riace]], rare example of [[Greek sculpture|Greek bronze sculpture]], which became one of the symbols of the city). Reggio is the seat, since 1907, of the Archeological Superintendence of Bruttium and Lucania.

The city centre, consisting primarily of [[Art Nouveau#Italy|Liberty]] buildings, has a linear development along the coast with parallel streets, and the promenade is dotted with rare [[magnolias]] and exotic [[palm (plant)|palm]]s. Reggio has commonly used popular nicknames: The &quot;city of Bronzes&quot;, after the Bronzes of Riace that are testimonials of its Greek origins; the &quot;city of [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]]&quot;, which is exclusively cultivated in the region; and the &quot;city of [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fatamorgana]]&quot;, an optical phenomenon visible in Italy only from the Reggio seaside. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Etymology==
During its 3,500-year history Reggio has often been renamed. Each name corresponds with the city's major historical phases:

*''Erythra'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for &quot;Red&quot;), allegedly the name of the pre-Greek settlement.
*''Rhegion'' (Ῥήγιον), the Greek city from the 8th to the 3rd centuries BC.
*''Phoibeia'' (after [[Apollo]]), a short period under [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]], in the 4th century BC.
*''Regium'' or ''Rhegium'', its first Latin name, during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.
*''Rhegium Julii'' (''Reggio Giulia''), during the Roman Imperial period.
*''Rivàh'', Arabic name under the short domination by [[Emirate of Sicily]], between 10th and 11th centuries.
*''Rìsa'', under the [[Normans]], between the 11th and 12th centuries.
*''Regols'', Catalan name under the [[Crown of Aragon]], in the late 13th century.
*''Reggio'' or ''Regio'', usual Italian name in the Middle and Modern age.
*''Reggio di Calàbria'', post [[Italian Unification]] (to be distinguished from Reggio ''di Lombardia'' or ''di Modena'' – located in northern Italy – which was renamed ''Reggio nell'Emilia'').

The toponym of the city might derive from an Italic word ''rec'' (meaning ''king'', cognate with [[Latin]] ''rex''). Ancient Greek and Roman etymologists derived it from the Greek ''regnynai'' (ῥηγνυναι, break), referring to a mythic earthquake in which Sicily was broken off from the Italian mainland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Alessandro Gioffrè d'Ambra and others ''Reggio Centro del Mediterraneo - un excursus storico di 3500 anni'', Club UNESCO 'Re Italo', Provincia di Reggio, Tipografia Enotria, Reggio di Calabria, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Reggio Calabria}}

===Ancient times===
The history of the area before the arrival of the Greeks in the eighth century BC is not reliably known. Mythical accounts record a series of different peoples in the region, including the [[Osci]] (sometimes referred to as ''Opici''), [[Troy|Trojans]], [[Oenotrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Ausones]], [[Mamertines]], [[Taureanes]], [[Sicels]], [[Morgeti]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Itali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.it&quot;&gt;Domenico Spanò Bolani, ''Storia di Reggio – da' tempi primitivi sino all'anno 1797'' • Stamperia e Cartiere del Fibreno, Naples, 1857 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H6IBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that the land around Reggio was first known as Saturnia, or Neptunia. The term 'Italia' initially referred to the area around Reggio itself, before expanding to cover present-day southern Calabria (later known as [[Bruttium]]), and finally becoming the name of the whole Italian peninsula around the third century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.it&quot;/&gt; Allegedly, the name derives from king [[Italus]], an Oenotrian king of the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Lessico Universale Italiano ''XI, &quot;Italo&quot;, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani, Roma, 1973.&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Cumae]], Reggio was one of the first Greek colonies in southern Italy. The colony was settled by the inhabitants of [[Chalcis]] in 730 or 743 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.it&quot;/&gt; on the site of the older settlement, Erythra (Ερυθρά), meaning &quot;red&quot;. The legendary founder of the city was King Iocastus, son of [[Aeolus]], who was later said to be buried on the Punta Calamizzi promontory (called &quot;Pallantion&quot;) and appeared on the city's coinage. The colony retained the name of &quot;Rhegion&quot; (Ῥήγιoν).&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.it&quot;/&gt; [[Pseudo-Scylax]] also writes that it was a Greek city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante06/Skylax/sky_p001.html Pseudo Scylax, Periplous, §12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhegion was one of the most important cities in [[Magna Graecia]], reaching great economic and political power during the 5th and 6th centuries BC under [[Anaxilas]], who reigned as tyrant from 494–476 BC. Anaxilas conquered [[Zancle]] (modern [[Messina]]), extending Rhegian control over both shores of the Straits of Messina. He attempted to conquer [[Locri]] as well in 477 BC but was rebuffed. When he died in 476 BC, his two sons were too young to rule, so power was held by their regent [[Micythus]]. Under his rule, Rhegion founded a colony, Pyxous (modern [[Policastro Bussentino]]) in [[Campania]] in 471 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 7.170; [[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.52, 11.59.14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hieron I of Syracuse]] orchestrated Micythus' removal from power in 467 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.66.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; after which Anaxilas' sons ruled on their own until they were deposed in 461 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.76.5; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 4.3.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Rhegion allied with [[Athens]]. An Athenian inscription (''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' I&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 53) reports a renewal of this alliance in 433 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atticinscriptions.com/inscription/IGI3/53 Translation and commentary] on ''Attic Inscriptions Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians supported Rhegion in a war with Locri during the First Sicilian Expedition (427–425 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] 4.1.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Athenians launched the much larger [[Sicilian Expedition]] of 415–413 BC, Rhegion offered them only limited assistance.

During the [[Third Sicilian War]], Rhegion became hostile to [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. He attacked the city for the first time in 396 BC, but he was rebuffed. Dionysius destroyed the Rhegian navy in 389 BC, besieged the city again in 388 BC and, when it finally fell in 387 BC, destroyed it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] 1.6.1, Diodorus Siculus 14.56.1-2, 108-111, 114-117&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] refounded the city as 'Phoebeia' in the 360s BC. When he was expelled from Syracuse in 356 BC, he retained control of Phoebeia, but it was captured by Syracusan forces led by [[Leptines II|Leptines]] and [[Callippus of Syracuse|Callippus]] in 351 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] 16.45.9&lt;/ref&gt; Rhegion then reverted to its original name.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.it&quot;/&gt;

Throughout classical antiquity Rhegion remained an important maritime and commercial city as well as a cultural centre, as is demonstrated by the presence of academies of art, philosophy, and science, such as the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] School, and also by its well-known poet [[Ibycus]], the historian [[:it:Ippi di Reggio|Ippys]], the musicologist Glaucus, and the sculptors [[Pythagoras of Rhegium|Pythagoras]] and [[Clearchus of Rhegium|Clearchus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Rhegion made an alliance with the [[Roman republic]] in 282 BC, shortly before the [[Pyrrhic War]]. The {{ill|Legio Campana|de}}, under the command of Decius Vibellus, was installed as a garrison but subsequently launched a violent coup and seized control of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 20.4. cf. [[Polybius]] 1.7.6-7, [[Diodorus Siculus]] 22.1.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Roman forces deposed Decius and restored the city's independence in 271 BC. Thereafter, Rhegium was an important ally of Rome, with the status of {{Lang|la|[[municipium]]}} and ''socia navalis'' (naval ally). It retained its Greek customs and language, as well as its [[mint (coin)|mint]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; It was a central pivot for both maritime and mainland traffic, reached by the final part of the [[Via Popilia]], which was built in the 2nd century BC and joined the older [[Via Appia]] at [[Capua]], south of Rome. Close to Rhegion, on the Straits of Messina, was the busy port of Columna Rhegina. Under the Emperor [[Augustus]], the city was renamed Rhegium Juli in honour of the emperor's adoptive father [[Julius Caesar]] and was the seat of the {{Lang|la|[[corrector|corrēctor]]}} (governor) of &quot;Regio III Lucania et Bruttii&quot; (the southernmost of the eleven [[Roman Italy#Augustan organization|regiones]] into which Italy was divided). In AD 61 the apostle [[St. Paul]] passed through Rhegium on his final voyage towards Rome,&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Acts|Acts]] 28.13&lt;/ref&gt; converting the first local Christians and, according to tradition, laying the foundations of the Christianization of Bruttium.

Rhegium boasted in imperial times nine thermal baths,&lt;ref&gt;De Gregorio, Lucia. &quot;Le Terme Romane di Reggio Calabria.

===Middle Ages===

Numerous occupying armies came to Reggio during the early Middle Ages due to the city's strategic importance. 

Invasions by the [[Vandals]], the [[Lombards]] and the [[Goths]] occurred in the 5th–6th centuries. Then, under [[Byzantine]] rule, it became a metropolis of the Byzantine possessions in Italy and was also the capital of the [[List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria|Duchy of Calabria]] several times between 536 and 1060 AD. Following wars between the Lombards and Byzantines in the 6th century, Bruttium was renamed Calabria.

As a Byzantine centre of culture, certain monks there undertook scribal work, carrying out the transcription of ancient classical works. Until the 15th century, Reggio was one of the most important Greek-rite Bishoprics in Italy—even today Greek words are used and are recognisable in local speech and Byzantine terms can be found in local liturgy, in religious icons and even in local recipes.

The Arabs occupied Reggio in 918 and holded some of its inhabitants to ransom or kept them prisoners as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Europe on the Eve of the Crusades'', Sidney Painter, ''A History of the Crusades'', Vol. I, ed. Kenneth M. Setton and Marshall W. Baldwin, (University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), p. 50.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For brief periods in the 10th–11th centuries the city was ruled by the [[Arabs]] and, renamed ''Rivàh'' (or sometimes ''Rŷu''), became part of the [[Emirate of Sicily]]. During the period of Arab rule various beneficial ideas were introduced into Calabria, such as Citrus fruit trees, Mulberry trees (used in [[silk]] production) and several ways of cooking local vegetables such as aubergines. The Arabs introduced water ices and ice cream and also greatly improved agricultural and hydraulic techniques for irrigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

In 1060 the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]], under [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily]], captured Reggio but Greek cultural and religious elements persisted until the 17th century. In 1194 Reggio and the whole of southern Italy went to the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]], who held it until 1266. In 1234 the town fair was established by decree of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

From 1266 it was ruled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]], under whom life in Calabria deteriorated because of their tendency to accumulate wealth in their capital, Naples, leaving Calabria in the power of local barons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Mario Caligiuri, ''Breve Storia della Calabria''. Newton &amp; Compton, Rome, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1282, during the [[Sicilian Vespers]], Reggio rallied in support of [[Messina]] and the other oriental Sicily cities because of the shared history, commercial and cultural interests. From 1147 to 1443 and again from 1465 to 1582, Reggio was the capital of the Calabrian ''Giustizierato''. It supported the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] forces against the House of Anjou. In the 14th century it obtained new administrative powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  In 1459 the Aragonese enlarged its medieval castle.

Reggio, throughout the Middle Ages, was first an important centre of [[calligraphy]] and then of [[printing]] after its invention. It boasts the first dated, printed edition of a [[Hebrew]] text, a [[Rashi]] commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], printed in 1475 in [[La Giudecca]] of Reggio,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/guide/hs-books.html &quot;The Books of the People of the Book – Hebraic Collections&quot;], Library of Congress, Washington, DC; accessed 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; even though scholars consider Rome as the city where Hebrew printing began.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The Jewish community of Reggio was also considered to be among the foremost internationally, for the dyeing and the trading of [[silk]]: silk woven in Reggio was esteemed and bought by the Spaniards, the Genoese, the Dutch, the English and the Venetians, as it was recognised as the best silk in the Kingdom of Naples.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Early modern period===
From the early 16th century, the Kingdom of Naples was under the [[Habsburgs]] of [[Spain]], who put Reggio under a viceroy from 1504 to 1713. The 16th and 17th centuries were an age of decay due to high Spanish taxes, pestilence, the 1562 earthquake, and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish invasions suffered by Reggio between 1534 and 1594. In 1534, facing attack by an Ottoman fleet under [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], the townspeople abandoned Reggio. Barbarossa captured eight hundred of those who remained and then burned the town.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Crowley, Empires of the Sea, faber and faber 2008 p.58&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Barbary pirates]] attacked Reggio in 1558, they took most of its inhabitants as slaves to [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamil M.

In 1714 southern Italy became once more property of the Austrian Habsburgs, who remained until 1734, when they were replaced by the [[Bourbons]] of Spain. Reggio was the capital of Calabria Ulteriore Prima from 1759 to 1860. In 1783, a disastrous [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] damaged Reggio, all of southern Calabria and [[Messina]].

The precious citrus fruit, [[Bergamot orange]], had been cultivated and used in the Reggio area since the 15th century. By 1750 it was being grown intensively in the Rada Giunchi area of Reggio and was the first plantation of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 1806, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took Reggio and made the city a Duchy and General Headquarters. After the former's fall, in 1816, the two ancient Kingdoms of Naples and of Sicily were unified, becoming the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

During the course of the 19th century new public gardens were laid out, the piazzas (or squares) were embellished and cafés and a theatre were opened. On the newly opened sea promenade a Civic Museum was inaugurated. In fact, some 60 years after the devastation caused by the 1783 earthquake, the English traveller and painter [[Edward Lear]] remarked &quot;Reggio is indeed one vast garden, and doubtless one of the loveliest spots to be seen on earth. A half-ruined castle, beautiful in colour and picturesque in form, overlooks all the long city, the wide straits, and snow-topped Mongibello beyond.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lear, ''Journals of a landscape painter in Southern Calabria'', R. Bentley, London, 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

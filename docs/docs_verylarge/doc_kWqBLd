==== ''Charles Henderson'' explosion ====
The port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship ''[[SS Charles Henderson|Charles Henderson]]'' exploded in the harbour while offloading 2000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered nonoperational, this time for a month.

==== Basilica of Saint Nicholas ====
[[File:Bari Basilica San Nicola.jpg|thumb|St. Nicholas Basilica]]
The ''[[Basilica di San Nicola]]'' (Saint Nicholas) was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were brought from [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], and now lie beneath the [[altar]] in the [[crypt]], where are buried the Topins, which are a legacy of old thieves converted to [[good faith]]. The church is one of the four Palatine churches of Apulia (the others being the [[cathedral]]s of [[Acquaviva delle Fonti]] and [[Altamura#Main sights|Altamura]], and the church of [[Monte Sant'Angelo]] sul Gargano).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bari (town)|display=Bari|volume=3|page=400}}&lt;!-- Material on p401 not used --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bari Cathedral ====
[[Bari Cathedral]], dedicated to [[Saint Sabinus of Canosa]] (''San Sabino''), was begun in [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] in 1034, but was destroyed in the sack of the city of 1156. A new building was thus built between 1170 and 1178, partially inspired by that of San Nicola. Of the original edifice, only traces of the pavement are today visible in the [[transept]].

An example of Apulian [[Romanesque architecture]], the church has a simple [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] façade with three portals; in the upper part is a rose window decorated with monstruous and fantasy figures. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by sixteen columns with arcades. The [[crypt]] houses the relics of Saint Sabinus and the icon of the ''[[Madonna Odigitria]]''.

The interior and the façade were redecorated in [[Baroque]] style during the 18th century, but these additions were removed in a 1950s restoration.

==== Petruzzelli Theatre ====
The [[Teatro Petruzzelli|Petruzzelli Theatre]], founded in 1903, hosted different forms of live entertainment, or nineteenth century “Politeama”.  The theatre was all but destroyed in a fire on October 27, 1991. It was reopened in October 2009, after 18 years.

==== Swabian Castle ====
{{See also|Castello Svevo}}
[[File:Puglia Bari2.jpg|thumb|Swabian Castle]]
[[File:Bari BW 2016-10-19 12-32-30.jpg|thumb|Swabian Castle]]
[[File:Castle and Old Town of Bari - September 2017.jpg|thumb|The Old Town as seen from the Swabian Castle]]
The Norman-Hohenstaufen Castle, widely known as the ''Castello Svevo'' (Swabian Castle), was built by [[Roger II of Sicily]] around 1131. Destroyed in 1156, it was rebuilt by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]]. The castle now serves as a gallery for a variety of temporary exhibitions in the city.

==== Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari ====
The [[Pinacoteca Provinciale di Bari]] (Provincial Picture Gallery of Bari) is the most important art gallery in Apulia. It was first established in 1928 and contains many paintings from the 15th century up to the days of contemporary art.

==== The Russian Church ====
The [[Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas, Bari|Russian Church of Saint Nicholas]], in the Carrassi district of Bari, was built in the early 20th century to welcome Russian pilgrims who came to the city to visit the church of Saint Nicholas in the old city where the relics of the saint remain.

The city council and Italian national government were recently involved in a [[trade-off]] with the Putin government in [[Moscow]], exchanging the piece of land on which the church stands, for, albeit indirectly, a [[Barracks|military barracks]] near Bari's [[Bari Centrale railway station|central railway station]].

==== ''Barivecchia'' ====
''Barivecchia'', or Old Bari, is a sprawl of streets and passageways making up the section of the city to the north of the modern Murat area. Barivecchia was until fairly recently considered a [[no-go area]] by many of Bari's residents due to the high levels of [[Misdemeanor|petty crime]]. A large-scale redevelopment plan began with a new sewerage system, followed by the development of the two main squares, Piazza Mercantile and Piazza Ferrarese.

=== Demographics ===
{{As of|2015}}, there were 326,344 people residing in Bari (about 1.6&amp;nbsp;million live in the greater Bari area), located in the province of Bari, [[Apulia|Puglia]], of whom 47.9% were male and 52.1% were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Comuni-Italiani.it |title=Popolazione Bari 2001-2015 |language=it |url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/072/006/statistiche/recenti.html |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007}}, minors (children ages 18 and younger) totaled 17.90 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 19.08 percent.

===Migration===
According to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy.  Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes. Under 2% of migrants left Bari to go abroad and came to the city from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Russel |last2=Strachan |first2=Alan |last3=Mortimer |first3=Jill |title=The Urban Dimension of European Return Migration: The Case of Bari, Southern Italy |journal=Urban Studies |date=June 1985 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=219–235 |jstor=43192080 |doi=10.1080/00420988520080361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Fiera del Levante ===
The Fiera del Levante, held in September in the Fiera site on the west side of Bari city center, focuses on agriculture and industry,  There is also a &quot;Fair of Nations&quot; which displays handcrafted and locally produced goods from all over the world.

=== Cuisine and gastronomy ===
[[File:Orecchiette al Pomodoro.jpg|thumb|right|A dish of ''[[orecchiette]]''.]]

Bari's cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil and wine. The local cuisine is also enriched by the wide variety of fruit and vegetables produced locally. Local flour is used in homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous ''[[orecchiette]]'' ear-shaped pasta, ''recchietelle'' or ''strascinate'', ''chiancarelle'' (orecchiette of different sizes) and ''[[cavatelli]]''.

Homemade dough is also used for baked ''[[calzoni]]'' stuffed with onions, anchovies, capers and olives; fried ''[[panzerotti]]'' with mozzarella, simple ''focaccia alla barese'' with tomatoes, little savoury ''[[taralli]]'', friselle and ''sgagliozze'', fried slices of polenta, all make up the Bari culinary repertoire.

Vegetable minestrone, chick peas, [[Vicia faba|broad beans]], chicory, celery and fennel are also often served as first courses or [[side dish]]es.

Meat dishes and the local Barese ''[[ragù]]'' often include lamb and pork.

Pasta ''[[al forno]]'', a baked pasta dish, is very popular in Bari and was historically a Sunday dish, or a dish used at the start of [[Lent]] when all the rich ingredients such as eggs and pork had to be used for religious reasons. The recipe commonly consists of ''[[penne]]'' or similar tubular pasta shapes, a tomato sauce, small beef and pork meatballs and halved hard-boiled eggs. The pasta is then topped with ''[[mozzarella]]'' or similar cheese and then baked in the oven to make the dish have its trademark crispy texture.

Fresh fish and seafood are often eaten raw. Octopus, sea urchins and mussels feature heavily. Perhaps Bari's most famous dish is the oven-baked ''patate, riso e cozze'' (potatoes with rice and mussels).

Bari and the whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including [[Primitivo]], [[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], notably [[Moscato di Trani]].

=== Language ===
{{Main|Bari dialect}}

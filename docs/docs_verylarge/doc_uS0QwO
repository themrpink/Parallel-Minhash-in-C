===2008 report on universal postal service and the postal monopoly===

The Postal Act of 2006 required the [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] (PRC) to submit a report to the president and Congress on universal postal service and the postal monopoly in December 2008. The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.

On October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm USPS.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623183803/http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm |date=June 23, 2011 }}. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.

Obligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly &quot;would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly&quot;. Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a &quot;monopoly,&quot; because the enforcement of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1725}} leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and many other [[Metropolis|major metros]] one must get a background check from [[police]] and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post [[Advertising|commercial]] messages on [[private property]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Regarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either ''the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the &quot;base rate&quot; or &quot;base tariff&quot;)'' or ''the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.''

The Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. &quot;A more rigidly defined USO would  ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses,&quot; according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.

===Competitors===

[[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) directly compete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages. Due to the postal monopoly, they are not allowed to deliver non-urgent letters and may not directly ship to U.S. Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations. However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;smartpost&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost® Shipping &amp; Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | access-date=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405161604/http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mailinno&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations – Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | access-date=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114221/http://upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | archive-date=May 5, 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept. [[DHL Express]] was the third major competitor until February 2009, when it ceased domestic delivery operations in the United States.

A variety of other [[:Category:Transportation companies of the United States|transportation companies in the United States]] move cargo around the country, but either have limited geographic scope for delivery points, or specialize in items too large to be mailed. Many of the thousands of [[courier]] companies focus on same-day delivery, for example, by [[bicycle messenger]].

Although USPS and FedEx are direct competitors, USPS contracts with FedEx for air transport of 2–3 Day Priority Mail &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm|title=Priority Mail - USPS|website=www.usps.com|access-date=2013-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901230349/https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm|archive-date=2013-09-01|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Priority Mail Express (typically delivered overnight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-express.htm|title=Priority Mail Express - USPS|website=www.usps.com|access-date=2017-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126061907/https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-express.htm|archive-date=2017-01-26|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative transmission methods===

The Post Office Department owned and operated the first public [[telegraph line]]s in the United States, starting in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore, and eventually extending to New York, Boston, Buffalo, and Philadelphia. In 1847, the telegraph system was privatized, except for a period during World War I, when it was used to accelerate the delivery of letters arriving at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Telegraph: Early Postal Role |website=Postal History |publisher=USPS |date=July 2008 |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf |access-date=2014-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531004552/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-31 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1942 and 1945, &quot;[[V-Mail]]&quot; (for &quot;Victory Mail&quot;) service was available for [[military mail]]. Letters were converted into [[microfilm]] and reprinted near the destination, to save room on transport vehicles for military cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/v-mail.pdf |website=Postal History |title=V-Mail |publisher=USPS |date=July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508223612/https://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/VMail.pdf |archive-date=2009-05-08 |access-date=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Western Union in co-operation with the Postal Service introduced the &quot;[[Mailgram]]&quot;, a special type of [[telegram]] offered by Western Union intended for bulk mailing to multiple addressees.  The sender would contact WU and submit to them the message to be sent and a list of addressees to mail the requested Mailgrams to.  The message and address data were then sent electronically over Western Union's terrestrial network normally used for standard telegrams, with WU's [[Westar 1]] satellite used instead starting in 1974 with its launch, for Mailgram transmission to participating Postal Service centers, who would then print and mail the Mailgrams to the requested addressees.

Similar to WU's Mailgrams was Electronic Computer Originated Mail, offered by the Postal Service from 1982 to 1985. Also known as [[E-COM]],  it too was used for bulk mailings. Text was transmitted electronically to one of 25 post offices nationwide. The Postal Service would print the mail and put it in special envelopes bearing a blue E-COM logo. Delivery was assured within 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/ecom.pdf |title=E-COM, Electronic Computer Originated Mail |date=July 2008 |access-date=July 8, 2011 |publisher=USPS |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508223733/https://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/ECOM.pdf |archive-date=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve accuracy and efficiency, the Postal Service introduced the [[Intelligent Mail barcode|Intelligent Mail program]] to complement the ZIP code system. This system, which was intended to replace the deprecated [[POSTNET]] system, allows bulk mailers to use pre-printed bar codes to assist in mail delivery and sorting. Additional features, called Enhanced, or Full-Service, Intelligent Mail Barcodes allow for mail tracking of bulk mail through the postal system up to the final delivery Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usps.com/election-mail/creating-imb-election-mail-kit.pdf|title=Intelligent Mail|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830001120/https://www.usps.com/election-mail/creating-imb-election-mail-kit.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the universal service requirement and the postal monopoly===

Critics of the universal service requirement and the statutory postal monopoly include several professional economists advocating for the privatization of the mail delivery system, or at least a relaxation of the universal service model that currently exists.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, Rick. &quot;Do Vital Economists Reach a Policy Conclusion on Postal Reform?&quot; (April 2004).

* First, basic economics implies that rural customers are unlikely to be without service under competition; they would simply have to pay the true cost of delivery to them, which may or may not be lower than under monopoly.
* Second, basic notions of fairness imply that the cross-subsidy should be eliminated. To the extent that people make choices about where they live, they should assume the costs of that decision.
* Third, there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to ensure service to sparsely populated areas. The government could easily award competitive contracts to private firms for that service.
* Fourth, early concerns that rural residents of the United States would somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are simply unfounded. ...

Furthermore, some economists have argued that because public enterprises may pursue objectives different than [[profit maximization]], they might have more of an incentive than profit-maximizing firms to behave anticompetitively through policies such as predatory pricing, misstating costs, and creating barriers to entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sappington|first=David E.

===Postal Inspection Service===
The [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] (USPIS) is one of the oldest [[law enforcement agencies]] in the U.S. Founded by [[Benjamin Franklin]] on August 7, 1775, its mission is to protect the Postal Service, its employees, and its customers from crime and protect the nation's mail system from criminal misuse.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= https://www.uspis.gov/about/history-of-uspis/ |title=History of USPIS
|access-date=16 August 2020 |website=United States Postal Inspection Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postal Inspectors enforce over 200 federal laws providing for the protection of mail in [[Criminal procedure|investigations of crimes]] that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the postal system or postal employees.

The USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and seizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non-urgent mail through overnight delivery competitors. According to the [[American Enterprise Institute]], a private conservative [[think tank]], the USPIS raided [[Equifax]] offices in 1993 to ascertain if the mail they were sending through [[FedEx|Federal Express]] was truly &quot;extremely urgent&quot;. It was found that the mail was not, and Equifax was fined $30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/publication/opportunities-for-anticompetitive-behavior-in-postal-services/ |title=Opportunities for Anticompetitive Behavior in Postal Services |access-date=2016-01-02 |last=Geddes |first=Rick |date=June 1, 2003 |publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109121159/http://www.aei.org/publication/opportunities-for-anticompetitive-behavior-in-postal-services/ |archive-date=January 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/26424/why-cant-you-start-rival-post-office|title=Why Can't You Start a Rival Post Office?|date=19 November 2010|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001335/http://mentalfloss.com/article/26424/why-cant-you-start-rival-post-office|archive-date=17 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of Inspector General===
The [[United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) was authorized by law in 1996. Prior to the 1996 legislation, the Postal Inspection Service performed the duties of the OIG. The inspector general, who is independent of postal management, is appointed by and reports directly to the nine [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|presidentially appointed]], [[United States Senate|Senate]]–[[Advice and consent|confirmed]] members of the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]].

The primary purpose of the OIG is to prevent, detect and report fraud, waste and program abuse, and promote efficiency in the operations of the Postal Service. The OIG has &quot;oversight&quot; responsibility for all activities of the Postal Inspection Service.

The format of a return address is similar. Though some [[style manual]]s recommend using a comma between the city and state name when typesetting addresses in other contexts, for optimal automatic character recognition, the Post Office does not recommend this when addressing mail. The official recommendation is to use all upper case block letters with proper formats and abbreviations, and leave out all punctuation except for the [[hyphen]] in the ZIP+4 code. If the address is unusually formatted or illegible enough, it will require hand-processing, delaying that particular item. The USPS publishes the entirety of their postal addressing standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm USPS postal addressing standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828111410/http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm |date=2005-08-28 }}.

[[Postal address verification]] tools and services are offered by the USPS and third party companies to help ensure mail is deliverable by fixing formatting, appending information such as ZIP code and validating the address is a valid [[Postal address verification#Delivery Point Validation|delivery point]].

====Delivery Point Validation====
Delivery Point Validation (DPV) provides the highest level of address accuracy checking. In a DPV process, the address is checked against the AMS data file to ensure that it exists as an active delivery point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delivery Point Validation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations|url=https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs04/chp2-027.html|publisher=USPS|access-date=9 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155826/https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs04/chp2-027.html|archive-date=16 September 2016|url-status=live}} 2004 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations Chapter 2 Postal Operations&lt;/ref&gt; The USPS does not offer DPV validation on their website; however, there are companies that offer services to perform DPV verification.

All unused [[U.S. postage stamps]] issued since 1861 are still valid as postage at their indicated value. Stamps with no value shown or denominated by a letter are also still valid, although the value depends upon the particular stamp. For some stamps issued without a printed value, the current value is the original value. But some stamps beginning in 1988 or earlier, including ''Forever Stamps'' (issued from April 2007) and all first-class, first-ounce stamps issued from January 21, 2011, the value is the current value of a first-class-mail first-ounce stamp. The USPS calls these Forever Stamps but the generic name is [[non-denominated postage]].

Forever stamps are sold at the First-Class Mail postage rate at the time of purchase, but will always be valid for First-Class Mail, up to {{convert|1|oz|g}}, no matter how rates rise in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713081643/http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/19/190818.shtml Postal Rates Set to Go Up on May 14].

====Postage meters====
{{Main|Postage meter}}

A postage meter is a mechanical device used to create and apply physical evidence of postage (or franking) to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps.

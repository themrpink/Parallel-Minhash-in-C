John's life was a great inspiration for his grandson the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|George Gordon Byron]], though they never met. The poet both drew from his grandfather's experiences in his writing, using his 'Narrative' for the shipwreck scene in [[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]], and wrote of the kinship he felt in having such a turbulent, unlucky life: he wrote in an epistle to his half-sister [[Augusta Leigh]] that &quot;he had no rest at sea, nor I on shore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brand|first=Emily|title=The Fall of the House of Byron|publisher=John Murray|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== In fiction ==

John Byron's experiences in the Anson voyage form the basis of the novel ''[[The Unknown Shore]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]]. It closely follows Byron's account in ''The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron'' (1768).

In [[The Dark Design]], John Byron is a crewmember of the schooner ''The Razzle Dazzle''.

'''Lewis Wallace''' (April 10, 1827{{spaced ndash}}February 15, 1905) was an American lawyer, [[Union Army|Union]] general in the [[American Civil War]], [[governor of New Mexico|governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]], politician, diplomat, and author from [[Indiana]]. Among his novels and biographies, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), a bestselling novel that has been called &quot;the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=Humanities&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amy Lifson|title=Ben-Hur: The Book That Shook the World|journal=Humanities|volume=30|issue=6|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities

Wallace's military career included service in the [[Mexican–American War]] and the American Civil War. He was appointed Indiana's [[Adjutant General|adjutant general]] and commanded the [[11th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]. Wallace, who attained the rank of major general, participated in the [[Battle of Fort Donelson]], the [[Battle of Shiloh]], and the [[Battle of Monocacy]]. He also served on the military commission for the trials of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln#Conspirators' trial|Lincoln assassination conspirators]], and presided over the trial of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant of the [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison camp]].

Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army, before returning to the United States. Wallace was appointed [[governor of New Mexico|governor]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]] (1878–81) and served as U.S. minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1881–85). Wallace retired to his home in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he continued to write until his death in 1905.

==Early life and education==
Lewis &quot;Lew&quot; Wallace was born on April 10, 1827, in [[Brookville, Indiana|Brookville]], [[Indiana]]. He was the second of four sons born to Esther French Wallace (née Test) and [[David Wallace (governor)|David Wallace]].&lt;ref name=McKee206&gt;McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew's father, a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] in [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; left the military in 1822 and moved to Brookville, where he established a law practice and entered Indiana politics. David served in the Indiana General Assembly and later as the state's [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana|lieutenant governor]], and [[governor of Indiana|governor]], and as a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 82, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew Wallace's maternal grandfather was circuit court judge and Congressman [[John Test]].

In 1832 the family moved to [[Covington, Indiana]], where Lew's mother died from tuberculosis on July 14, 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 1; Boomhower, pp. 14, 16; McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1836, David married nineteen-year-old [[Zerelda G. Wallace|Zerelda Gray Sanders Wallace]], who later became a prominent [[suffragist]] and [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] advocate. In 1837, after David's election as governor of Indiana, the family moved to [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 82, 85; Boomhower, p. 19; Stephens, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow3&gt;Morrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington, but he much preferred the outdoors. Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read, but he was a discipline problem at school.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 9 and 15, and Morrow, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, at the age of nine, Lew joined his older brother in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he briefly attended the preparatory school division of  [[Wabash College]], but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, when Wallace was thirteen, his father sent him to a private academy at [[Centerville, Indiana]], where his teacher encouraged Lew's natural affinity for writing. Wallace returned to [[Indianapolis]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Gronert71&gt;Gronert, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 9, 20–21; McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842, after his father refused to pay for more schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace found a job copying records at the [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] clerk's office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse.&lt;ref&gt;McKee, ''The Early Life of Lew Wallace'', p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the Marion Rifles, a local militia unit, and began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 2–3, 13; Boomhower, pp. 3, 9, 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace said in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion, but he did believe &quot;in the Christian conception of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=Humanities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1846, at the start of the [[Mexican–American War]], the nineteen-year-old Wallace was studying law at his father's law office, but left that pursuit to establish a recruiting office for the Marion Volunteers in Indianapolis. He was appointed a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]], and on June 19, 1846, mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers (also known as Company H, 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 4; Boomhower, p. 3, 26–27; Morrow, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] while serving in the army of [[Zachary Taylor]], but Wallace personally did not participate in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, pp. 536–37; Woodworth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace was mustered out of the volunteer service on June 15, 1847,&lt;ref name=Eicher551&gt;Eicher, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Indiana, where he intended to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Wallace and William B. Greer operated a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] newspaper, ''The Free Soil Banner,'' in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.imcpl.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/fsb &quot;Free Soil Banner&quot;], digitized by the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1848 Wallace met [[Susan Wallace|Susan Arnold Elston]] at the Crawfordsville home of [[Henry Smith Lane]], Wallace's former commander during the Mexican War.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan was the daughter of Major Isaac Compton Elston, a wealthy Crawfordsville merchant, and Maria Akin Elston, whose family were Quakers from upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan accepted Wallace's marriage proposal in 1849, and they were married in Crawfordsville on May 6, 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallaces had one son, Henry Lane Wallace, who was born on February 17, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early law and military career==
Wallace was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in February 1849, and moved from Indianapolis to [[Covington, Indiana]], where he established a law practice. In 1851 Wallace was elected prosecuting attorney of [[Indiana's 1st congressional district]],&lt;ref name=Gronert71/&gt; but he resigned in 1853 and moved his family to [[Crawfordsville, Indiana|Crawfordsville]], in [[Montgomery County, Indiana]]. Wallace continued to practice law and was elected as a Democrat to a two-year term in the [[Indiana Senate]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 9, 11, 13; Boomhower, pp. 41, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes388&gt;Forbes, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow9&gt;Morrow, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1849 to 1853, his office was housed in the [[Fountain County Clerk's Building]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SHAARD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html|title=Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) |publisher=Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology |format=Searchable database|accessdate=October 1, 2015}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/23210/N/Fountain_CO_Clerks_Bldg__Nom.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Fountain County Courthouse |accessdate=October 1, 2015|author1=Carol Ann Freese |author2=Nancy Wagner |date=December 2001}} and Accompanying photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

While living in Crawfordsville, Wallace organized the Crawfordsville Guards Independent Militia, later called the Montgomery Guards. During the winter of 1859–60, after reading about elite units of the [[French Army]] in [[Algeria]], Wallace adopted the [[Zouave]] uniform and their system of training for the group. The Montgomery Guards would later form the core of his first military command, the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Forbes388/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 14; Boomhower, pp. 4, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ben-hur.com/meet-lew-wallace/timeline/ Timeline from the General Lew Wallace Study and Museum.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War service==
Wallace, a staunch supporter of the Union, became a member of the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican party]],&lt;ref name=Forbes388/&gt; and began his full-time military career soon after the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]], on April 12, 1861. Indiana's governor, the Republican [[Oliver P. Morton]], asked Wallace to help recruit Indiana volunteers for the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;Morsberger and Morseberger, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace, who also sought a military command, agreed to become the state's [[Indiana Adjutant General|adjutant general]] on the condition that he would be given command of a regiment of his choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;swansburg20130326&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/03/ben_hur_and_lew_wallace_how_the_scapegoat_of_shiloh_became_one_of_the_best.single.html |title=The Passion of Lew Wallace |work=Slate |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2013 |author=Swansburg, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana's quota of six regimental units was filled within a week,&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, pp. 2, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallace took command of the [[11th Indiana Infantry Regiment|11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], which was mustered into the Union army on April 25, 1861. Wallace received his formal commission as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Union army the following day.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 1861, Wallace went with the 11th Indiana to [[Cumberland, Maryland]], and on June 12, the regiment won a minor battle at [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]], [[Virginia]], (in present-day [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It was misdated on Wallace's official report. See Stephens, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|swansburg20130326}} The rout boosted morale for Union troops and led to the Confederate evacuation of [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 1861, Wallace was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Army volunteers]] and given command of a brigade.&lt;ref name=Eicher551/&gt;

===Forts Henry and Donelson===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Henry|Battle of Fort Donelson}}
On February 4 and 5, 1862, prior to the advance against [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]], Union troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and a flotilla of Union ironclads and [[timberclad warship|timberclad]] gunboats under the command of Flag Officer [[Andrew Hull Foote]] made their way toward the Confederate fort along the [[Tennessee River]] in western [[Tennessee]]. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]]'s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]], surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.&lt;ref name=Stephens45-47&gt;Stephens, pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort Donelson Feb15pm.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing Wallace's counterattack at [[Fort Donelson]] (1862)]]
Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], was concerned that Confederate reinforcements would try to retake the two forts when the Union troops moved overland toward [[Fort Donelson]], so Wallace was left in command at Fort Henry to keep the forts secure.&lt;ref name=Boom50&gt;Boomhower, 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Displeased to have been left behind,{{r|swansburg20130326}} Wallace prepared his troops to move out at a moment's notice. The order came at midnight on February 13. Wallace arrived along the Cumberland River the following day and was placed in charge of the 3rd [[division (military)|Division]]. Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.&lt;ref name=Boom50/&gt;

During the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and in Grant's absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft's brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant's authority to take the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant later approved of Wallace's actions. See Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 62; Ferraro, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C. F. Smith were promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] for their efforts.&lt;ref name=Eicher773&gt;Eicher, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace, who was age thirty-four at the time of his promotion, became the youngest major general in the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 67–68; Boomhower, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiloh===
{{Main|Battle of Shiloh}}
[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr6pm.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, afternoon of April 6, 1862]]
Wallace's most controversial command came at the [[battle of Shiloh]], where he continued as the 3rd Division commander under Maj. Gen. Grant.

What was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 129; Stephens, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 65, 72; Ferraro, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. [[John Milton Thayer|John M. Thayer]]'s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L. Smith]]'s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump's Landing, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 83; Ferraro, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 83–84; Boomhower, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 71, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 72, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 86; Boomhower, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 85; Boomhower, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, v. I, pp. 336–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}

After a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 82, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2 and 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 87–88; Boomhower, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}

Wallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 80, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line. Two of Wallace's batteries with the aid of a battery from the 1st Illinois Light Artillery were the first to attack at about 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 93, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The March of Lew Wallace's Division to Shiloh.&quot; In [http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/books/battles/index.cfm ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War''], vol. 1, edited by Robert Underwood Johnson and Clarence C. Buel. New York: Century Co., 1884–1888. pp. 608–10. {{OCLC|2048818}}. (Johnson and Buel list no author for this article, but indicate it was based on material from Wallace.)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman's and Wallace's troops helped force the Confederates to fall back, and by 3 p.m. the Confederates were retreating southwest, toward Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Timothy B. Smith conceded that on the second day Wallace's division sustained far fewer casualties (296) than any of Buell's three divisions. However, Smith argued that the number of casualties does not always show the effectiveness of troops. Wallace had his soldiers lie down when they were under fire, which minimized casualties. He also maneuvered his division so that it turned the Confederate left flank.{{sfn|Smith|2014|pp=347–348}} Wallace advanced his division at 6:30 am, reached the south side of Tilghman Branch about 8:00 am, and occupied a commanding ridge by 9:00 am, all with little opposition. Here he paused to wait for Union troops to appear on his left. Up to this point, Wallace's movements were slow.{{sfn|Smith|2014|pp=254–257}} Once Grant's and Buell's soldiers reached the Confederate main line of defense they were stopped in heavy fighting. Noting that the Confederate left did not reach as far as Owl Creek, Wallace wheeled his division to outflank the enemy line. Finding Wallace's troops to their left and rear, the left-hand Confederate brigade hurriedly fell back. This unhinged the entire line and the Confederate troops soon retreated to a second position around noon.{{sfn|Smith|2014|pp=362–365}} At around 1:00 pm, Wallace worked a few regiments around the Confederate left flank, forcing their withdrawal to a third position.{{sfn|Smith|2014|pp=380–381}} After the Confederates left the battlefield, Wallace's division went the farthest south, but he pulled his troops back before going into camp that evening.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=393}}

===Shiloh controversy===
[[File:Lew Wallace (ca. 1865).jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace]]
At first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, pp. 105–6, and Boomhower, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.&lt;ref name=Stephens107-8&gt;Stephens, pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, to whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders&quot;, and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; ordering him to &quot;tell him to come up at once&quot; and that &quot;if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once&quot;. When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, &quot;Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.&quot; Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.&lt;ref&gt;[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 112; Morrow, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.&lt;ref name=Morrow9/&gt; He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.&lt;ref name=Stephens107-8/&gt; On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 131–34, 138, and 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.&lt;ref name=Stephens232&gt;Stephens, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferraro147&gt;Ferraro, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter &quot;modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ferraro147 /&gt; While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens232&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, v. I, pp. 351–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's article in the February 1885 issue of ''Century'' became the basis of his chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were published in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace's actions on the first day of battle.&lt;ref name=Ferraro147 /&gt; Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: &quot;If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt; Wallace's account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of ''Ben-Hur'', Wallace continued to lament, &quot;Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.&quot;{{r|swansburg20130326}}

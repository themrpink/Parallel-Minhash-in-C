[[File:LvMS-Lvm.jpg|thumb|right|In [[volcanic]] rocks, [[fine-grained]] plagioclase can display a 'microlitic' texture of many small [[crystal]]s.]]

'''Plagioclase''' is a series of [[Silicate minerals#Tectosilicates|tectosilicate]] (framework silicate) [[mineral]]s within the [[feldspar]] group. Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition, plagioclase is a continuous [[solid solution]] series, more properly known as the '''plagioclase feldspar''' series.  This was first shown by the German mineralogist [[Johann F. C. Hessel|Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel (1796–1872)]] in 1826.  The series ranges from [[albite]] to [[anorthite]] [[Endmember (mineralogy)|endmember]]s (with respective compositions NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), where [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] [[atoms]] can substitute for each other in the mineral's [[crystallography|crystal lattice]] structure. Plagioclase in hand samples is often identified by its [[Crystal twinning|polysynthetic crystal twinning]] or 'record-groove' effect.

Plagioclase is a major constituent mineral in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], and is consequently an important diagnostic tool in [[petrology]] for identifying the composition, origin and evolution of [[igneous rock]]s. Plagioclase is also a major constituent of [[Geology of the Moon#Lunar rocks|rock in the highlands of the Earth's moon]]. Analysis of [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer|thermal emission spectra]] from the surface of [[Mars]] suggests that plagioclase is the most abundant mineral in the crust of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Distribution and variation of plagioclase compositions on Mars | author=Milam, K. A.| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets | year=2010 | volume=115 | issue=E9 | doi=10.1029/2009JE003495|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πλάγιος}} ({{transl|grc|plágios}}, &quot;oblique&quot;) + {{lang|grc|κλᾰ́σῐς}} ({{transl|grc|klásis}}, &quot;fracture&quot;), in reference to its two [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] angles.

==Plagioclase series members==
The composition of a plagioclase feldspar is typically denoted by its overall fraction of [[anorthite]] (%An) or [[albite]] (%Ab), and readily determined by measuring the plagioclase crystal's [[refractive index]] in crushed [[grain mount]]s, or its ''[[ Extinction (optical mineralogy) |extinction angle]]'' in [[thin section]] under a [[Polarization (waves)|polarizing]] [[microscope]]. The extinction angle is an optical characteristic and varies with the albite fraction (%Ab). There are several named plagioclase feldspars that fall between albite and anorthite in the series. The following table shows their compositions in terms of constituent anorthite and albite percentages.

===Endmembers===

*[[Anorthite]] was named by [[Gustav Rose]] in 1823 from the Ancient Greek meaning oblique, referring to its triclinic crystallization. Anorthite is a comparatively rare mineral but occurs in the basic plutonic rocks of some [[Orogeny|orogenic]] [[calc-alkaline]] suites.
*[[Albite]] is named from the [[Latin]] ''albus'', in reference to its unusually pure white color. It is a relatively common and important rock-making mineral associated with the more acid rock types and in [[pegmatite]] [[dike (geology)|dikes]], often as the variety Cleavelandite with rarer minerals like [[tourmaline]] and [[beryl]].

===Intermediate members===
The intermediate members of the plagioclase group are very similar to each other and normally cannot be distinguished except by their optical properties. The specific gravity in each member (albite 2.62) increases 0.02 per 10% increase in anorthite (2.75).

*[[Bytownite]], named after the former name for [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada (Bytown), is a rare mineral occasionally found in more [[basic rock]]s.

[[Image:labradorite detail.jpg|thumb|130px|Labradorite displaying typical iridescent effect termed labradorescence. (unknown scale)]]
*[[Labradorite]] is the characteristic feldspar of the more basic rock types such as diorite, gabbro, andesite, or basalt and is usually associated with one of the [[pyroxene]]s or [[amphibole]]s. Labradorite frequently shows an [[iridescence|iridescent]] display of colors due to light refracting within the lamellae of the crystal. It is named after [[Labrador]], where it is a constituent of the [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] igneous rock [[anorthosite]] which is composed almost entirely of plagioclase. A variety of labradorite known as [[spectrolite]] is found in [[Finland]].
*[[Andesine]] is a characteristic mineral of rocks such as diorite which contain a moderate amount of [[silica]] and related [[volcanics]] such as [[andesite]].
*[[Oligoclase]] is common in [[granite]], [[syenite]], [[diorite]], and [[gneiss]]. It is a frequent associate of [[orthoclase]]. The name oligoclase is derived from the Greek for little and fracture, in reference to the fact that its cleavage angle differs significantly from 90°. [[Sunstone]] is mainly oligoclase (sometimes albite) with flakes of [[hematite]].

'''''The Godfather''''' is a [[crime novel]] by American author [[Mario Puzo]]. Originally published in 1969 by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], the novel details the story of a fictional [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family in [[New York City]] (and [[Long Beach, New York]]), headed by [[Vito Corleone]]. Puzo's [[Dedication (publishing)|dedication]] for ''The Godfather'' is &quot;''For Anthony Cleri''&quot;. The novel's [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] is by the French author [[Honoré de Balzac]]: &quot;Behind every great fortune there is a crime.&quot; The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955 and provides the back story of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood.

The first in a [[The Godfather (book series)|series of novels]], ''The Godfather'' is noteworthy for introducing Italian words like ''[[consigliere]]'', ''[[caporegime]]'', ''[[Cosa Nostra]]'', and ''[[omertà]]'' to an English-speaking audience.  It inspired a [[The Godfather|1972 film of the same name]]. Two film sequels, including new contributions by Puzo himself, were made in [[The Godfather Part II|1974]] and [[The Godfather Part III|1990]]. The first two films are widely held in high esteem as examples of the cinematic arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt_year.php |title=Top Movies - Best Movies at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top|title=IMDb Top Rated Movies|first=IMDb|last=Users|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The [[Corleone family]] fights a mob war with the Five Families of the [[New York City|New York]] Mafia in the years after [[World War II]]. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug dealer Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo, Corleone's two sons, Santino (&quot;Sonny&quot;) and Michael, must run the family business with the help of ''[[consigliere]]'' Tom Hagen and the two ''[[caporegimes]]'' Clemenza and Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, a police officer on the drug lord's payroll, the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder and Michael's promotion to the head of the family. Under his [[Retirement|retired]] father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a plan to relocate the Corleone family's power base to [[Las Vegas]]. This culminates in the murder of all of the family's enemies, including his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder. Michael then sells the family's businesses in New York and moves the family to Las Vegas.

==Main characters==

The Corleone family patriarch is [[Vito Corleone]] (The Don), whose surname ([[Italian language|Italian]] for &quot;Lionheart&quot;) recalls the town of [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]]. His birth name is Vittorio Andolini, but after emigrating to [[United States|America]], he changed it to the name of his home village as one of his few acts of sentimentality. Vito fathered four children: [[Santino &quot;Sonny&quot; Corleone]], [[Fredo Corleone|Frederico &quot;Fredo&quot; Corleone]], [[Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Corleone]], and [[Connie Corleone|Constanzia &quot;Connie&quot; Corleone]]. He also has an informally adopted son, [[Tom Hagen|Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Hagen]], who became the Corleone Family's ''[[consigliere]]'' (counselor). Vito Corleone is also [[Godparent|godfather]] to the famous singer and movie star [[Johnny Fontane]]. The godfather referred to in the title is generally taken to be Vito. However, the story's main character is Michael Corleone. The novel's central storyline details Michael's destiny to succeed his father as the head of the family empire, despite his desire to lead an [[American Dream|Americanized life]] with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]].

The Corleone family is a criminal organization with national influence, notably [[Protection racket|protection]], [[gambling]] and [[labor union|union]] racketeering. Serving as the Don's [[underboss]] is his oldest son, Santino. The operational side of the organization is headed by two ''[[caporegime]]s'', [[Peter Clemenza|Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Clemenza]] and [[Salvatore Tessio]]. Other significant members of the organization include enforcers Luca Brasi and Albert Neri and upcoming soldier Rocco Lampone.

==Reception==
The novel remained on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=&quot;The Godfather&quot; Turns 40 |work=CBS News|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-godfather-turns-40/3/ | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=July 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717004801/http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-godfather-turns-40/3/ |archive-date=July 17, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|The Godfather}}

The [[1972 in film|1972]] film adaptation of the novel was released with [[Marlon Brando]] as Don Vito Corleone and [[Al Pacino]] as Michael Corleone, directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Mario Puzo assisted with both the writings of the screenplay and other production tasks. The film grossed approximately $269 million worldwide and won various awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], five [[Golden Globe]]s and one [[Grammy]]. The film is considered to be tremendously significant in cinematic history. The sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' won six [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s, and became the first sequel to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

The film's plot follows the novel except for such details as backstories of some characters that are excluded, although they were filmed. Some of this footage was included in later re-edited versions such as, &quot;The Godfather Saga.&quot; The subplot involving Johnny Fontane in [[Hollywood]] was not filmed. The most significant deviation of the film from the novel was that the latter had a more positive ending than the film in which Kay Corleone accepts Michael's decision to take over his father's business. The film ends with Kay's realization of Michael's callousness, a theme that would develop in the [[The Godfather Part II|second]] and [[The Godfather Part III|third]] films, which are largely not based on the original novel. Vito Corleone's backstory appeared in the second film, with his character portrayed by [[Robert De Niro]].

===Video game adaptation of the film===
{{Main|The Godfather (2006 video game)}}

The video game company [[Electronic Arts]] released a [[video game]] adaptation of ''The Godfather'' film on March 21, 2006. The player assumes the role of a &quot;soldier&quot; in the family. Prior to his death, [[Marlon Brando]] provided some [[Voice-over|voice work]] for [[Vito Corleone|Vito]], which was eventually deemed unusable and was dubbed over by a Brando impersonator.  [[Francis Ford Coppola]] said in April 2005 that he was not informed of Paramount's decision to allow the game to be made and he did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6121958.html Godfather film director whacks Godfather game]'' - by Tor Thorsen, [[GameSpot]], April 8, 2005, Retrieved April 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Pacino]] declined to participate, and his likeness was replaced with a different depiction of [[Michael Corleone]].

==Sequels==
In 1984, Puzo's literary sequel to ''[[The Godfather]]'' was published. Titled ''[[The Sicilian]]'', it chronicles the life of &quot;Giuliano&quot; ([[Salvatore Giuliano]]) but the Corleone family is featured heavily throughout, [[Michael Corleone]] in particular. Chronologically this story sits between Michael's exile to [[Sicily]] in 1950 and his return to the United States. For copyright reasons, the Corleone family involvement was cut from the [[Michael Cimino]] [[The Sicilian (film)|film adaptation]], which is not considered part of the [[The Godfather (film series)|'' Godfather'' film series]].

In 2004, [[Random House]] published a sequel to Puzo's ''The Godfather'', ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'', by [[Mark Winegardner]]. A further sequel by Winegardner, ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', was released in 2006. These novels continue the story from Puzo's novel.

''The Godfather Returns'' picks up the story immediately after the end of Puzo's ''The Godfather''. It covers the years 1955 to 1962, as well as providing significant backstory for Michael Corleone's character prior to the events of the first novel. The events of the film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' all take place within the timeframe of this novel, but are only mentioned in the background. The novel contains an appendix that attempts to correlate the events of the novels with the events of the films.

''The Godfather's Revenge'' covers the years 1963 to 1964.

Continuing Puzo's habit, as seen in ''The Godfather'', of featuring characters who are close analogs of real-life events and public figures (as Johnny Fontane is an analog of [[Frank Sinatra]]), Winegardner features in his two ''Godfather'' novels analogs of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph]], [[John F. Kennedy|John]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], as well as alleged organized crime figure [[Carlos Marcello]] (Carlo Tramonti). In ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'', Winegardner also dramatizes the [[Apalachin Meeting|sweep of organized crime arrests]] that took place in [[Apalachin, New York]], in 1957.

Winegardner uses all of the characters from the Puzo novels and created a few of his own, most notably Nick Geraci, a Corleone [[soldato|soldier]] who plays a pivotal role in the sequel novels. Winegardner further develops characters from the original novel, such as [[Fredo Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]], and Johnny Fontane.

In 2012, a prequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Mario Puzo titled ''[[The Family Corleone]]'', was written by [[Edward Falco|Ed Falco]]. It tells the story of how [[Vito Corleone]] rises to Don and how [[Sonny Corleone]] and [[Tom Hagen]] enter the family business.

==Literary reference==
The Corleone family closely resembles the Karamazov family in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'': a powerful father, an impulsive oldest son, a philosophical son, a sweet-tempered son, and an adopted stepson who is maintained as an employee. [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Le Père Goriot]]'' (1835) has been the inspiration for notable lines that have gained wide popularity in cinema history. Similarly, Puzo opened his 1969 novel with an epigraph popularly attributed to Balzac:  &quot;Behind every great fortune there is a crime.&quot; The saying is most likely evolved over time from Balzac's original text: &quot;The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out because it was properly executed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/09/fortune-crime/#more-7188 Quote Investigator]: Comédie Humaine by Honoré de Balzac, Edited by George Saintsbury, Old Goriot (Le Père Goriot)  (1896), Translated by Ellen Marriage, Quote Page 124, J. M. Dent and Co., London and New York. &quot;Le secret des grandes fortunes sans cause apparente est un crime oublié, parce qu’il an été proprement fait. 1834, Revue de Paris, Volume 12, Le Père Goriot by Honoré de Balzac, Seconde Partie: L’entrée dans le monde, Start Page 237, Quote Page 258, Au Bureau De La Revue De Paris, Paris, France.

&quot;I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse&quot; was included in both the original Puzo novel and in the [[The Godfather|film adaptation]]. It is the second-ranking cinematic quote included in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] (2005) by the [[American Film Institute]]. Its origin may be from the same work to which Balzac is credited with the opening epigraph. Balzac wrote of [[Vautrin]] telling Eugene: &quot;In that case, I will make you an offer that no one would decline.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literaturepage.com/read/balzac-father-goriot-104.html (Father Goriot, page 104 in Chapter 1); &quot;Dans ces conjunctures, Je vais vous faire une proposition Que personne ne refuserait.

==Real-life influences==
Large parts of the novel are based upon reality, notably the history of the so-called &quot;[[Five Families]]&quot;, the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] organization in New York and the surrounding area. The novel also includes many allusions to real-life mobsters and their associates. For example, Johnny Fontane is based on [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref&gt;

{{For|Elvish languages in general|Elvish languages}}
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] [[Constructed languages|constructed]] many '''Elvish languages'''. These were the various languages spoken by the Elves of Middle-earth as they developed as a society throughout the Ages.  In his pursuit for realism and in his love of language, Tolkien was especially fascinated with the development and evolution of language through time.  Tolkien created two almost fully developed languages, and a dozen more in various beginning stages as he studied and reproduced the way that language adapts and morphs.  A [[philology|philologist]] by profession, he spent much time on [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]]. In the collection of letters he had written, posthumously published by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher John Tolkien]], he even stated that he began his stories that were within this  [[secondary world]], the realm of [[Middle-earth]],  not with the characters or narrative as one would assume, but with a created set of languages.  The stories and characters serve to be the conduits to make those languages come to life. Inventing language was always a crucial piece to Tolkien's mythology and world-building. 

&quot;''The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows''&quot; -[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |authorlink=Humphrey Carpenter |last2=Tolkien |first2=Christopher |author2link=Christopher Tolkien |title=The Letters of J. R. R.

Tolkien also created scripts for his Elvish languages, of which the best known are the [[Sarati]], the [[Tengwar]], and the [[Cirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hostetter 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hostetter |first=Carl F. |authorlink=Carl F.

== External history ==
[[File:Namarie First Stanza Tengwar.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The first stanza of Tolkien's [[Quenya]] poem &quot;[[Namárië]]&quot;, written in his [[Tengwar]] script.]] 

J. R. R. Tolkien began to construct his first ''Elvin tongue'' c. 1910–1911 while he was at the [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and which he later named ''[[Quenya]]'' (c. 1915). At that time, Tolkien was already familiar with [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Italian, Spanish, and several [[Germanic languages#History|ancient Germanic]] languages, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Norse]] and [[Old English]]. He had invented several [[cryptography|cryptographic codes]] (one called '''Animalic'''), and two or three constructed languages (one called '''Naffarin'''). He then discovered [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which he described many years later as &quot;like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite intoxicated me.&quot;&lt;ref group=T&gt;Letter number 214, [[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;/ref&gt; He had started his study of the Finnish language to be able to read the [[Kalevala]] epic.

{{quote|The ingredients in Quenya are various, but worked out into a self-consistent character not precisely like any language that I know. Finnish, which I came across when I first begun to construct a 'mythology' was a dominant influence, but that has been much reduced [now in late Quenya]. It survives in some features: such as the absence of any consonant combinations initially, the absence of the voiced stops ''b, d, g'' (except in ''mb, nd, ng, ld, rd'', which are favoured) and the fondness for the ending ''-inen, -ainen, -oinen'', also in some points of grammar, such as the inflexional endings ''-sse'' (rest at or in), ''-nna'' (movement to, towards), and ''-llo'' (movement from); the personal possessives are also expressed by suffixes; there is no gender.&lt;ref group=T&gt;From a letter to W. R. Matthews, dated 13–15 June 1964, published in ''Parma Eldalamberon'' 17, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien with his Quenya pursued a double aesthetic goal: &quot;classical and inflected&quot;.&lt;ref group=T&gt;Parma Eldalamberon 17, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; This urge, in fact, was the motivation for his creation of a 'mythology'. While the language developed, he needed speakers, history for the speakers and all real dynamics, like war and migration: &quot;It was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of 'history' for Elvish tongues&quot;.&lt;ref group=T&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R ''The Lord of the Rings'' &quot;Foreword to the Second Edition&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl F. Hostetter|Hostetter, Carl F]]. [http://www.elvish.org/articles/EASIS.pdf &quot;Elvish as She Is Spoke&quot;]. Republished with permission from [http://www.marquette.edu/library/information/news/2006/jrrt_proceedings.html ''The Lord of the Rings 1954–2004: Scholarship in Honor of Richard E. Blackwelder''] (Marquette, 2006), ed. [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elvish languages underwent countless revisions in grammar, mostly in [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] and the [[pronoun|pronominal system]]. The Elven vocabulary was not subject to sudden or extreme change; except during the first conceptual stage c.&amp;nbsp;1910–c.&amp;nbsp;1920. Tolkien sometimes changed the &quot;meaning&quot; of an Elvish word, but he almost never disregarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elven etymology was in a constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new [[etymology|etymons]] for his Elvish vocabulary.

From the outset, Tolkien used [[comparative philology]] and the [[tree model]] as his major tools in his constructed languages. He usually started with the phonological system of the [[proto-language]] and then proceeded in inventing for each [[daughter language]] the many mechanisms of sound change needed.

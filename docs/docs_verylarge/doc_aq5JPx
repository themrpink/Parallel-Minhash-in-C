'''Norman Granz''' (August 6, 1918&amp;nbsp;– November 22, 2001) was an American [[jazz]] record producer and concert promoter. He founded the record labels [[Clef Records|Clef]], [[Norgran Records|Norgran]], Down Home, [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Pablo Records|Pablo]]. Granz was acknowledged as &quot;the most successful impresario in the history of jazz&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Granz obituary&quot;&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1363458/Norman-Granz.html &quot;Norman Granz&quot; (obituary)], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', November 26, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Granz is also known for his anti-racist position and for integrating audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freedland, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/26/guardianobituaries2 &quot;Norman Granz: Verve record label founder who gave jazz respectability and integrated audiences&quot;], ''The Guardian'', November 26, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Los Angeles, Granz was the son of [[Moldovan Jews|Jewish]] immigrants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Michael|last= Freedland|title= Norman Granz - Verve record label founder who gave jazz respectability and integrated audiences |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 25, 2001 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/26/guardianobituaries2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Tiraspol]]. After school, he began work as a stock clerk on the Los Angeles stock exchange. When America joined the Second World War, he was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Force. Subsequently, he was posted to the Morale branch, the department charged with troops' entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman Granz obituary&quot;/&gt; 
He then emerged into the public view when he organised [[desegregated]] jam sessions at the Trouville Club in Los Angeles, which he later expanded when he staged a memorable concert at the Philharmonic Auditorium in [[Los Angeles]] on Sunday, July 2, 1944, under the heading of &quot;[[Jazz at the Philharmonic]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/norman-granz-729533.html Obituary Norman Granz]. ''The Independent''. London. November 25, 2001. Retrieved November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the concert, &quot;A Jazz Concert at the Philharmonic Auditorium&quot;, had been shortened by the printer of the advertising supplements to &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot;. Only one copy of the very first concert program is known to exist. Norman Granz had organised the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert with about $300 of borrowed money.

Later known as JATP, the ever-changing group recorded and toured extensively, with Granz producing some of the first live [[jam session]] recordings to be distributed to a wide market.

After several JATP concerts in Los Angeles in 1944 and 1945, Granz began producing JATP concert tours, from late fall of 1945 to 1957 in USA and Canada, and from 1952 in Europe. They featured swing and bop musicians and were among the first high-profile performances to feature racially integrated bands. Granz actually cancelled some bookings rather than have the musicians perform for segregated audiences. He recorded many of the JATP concerts, and from 1945 to 1947 sold/leased the recordings to Asch/Disc/Stinson Records (record producer [[Moses Asch]]'s labels).

In 1948 Granz signed an agreement with [[Mercury Records]] for the promotion and the distribution of the JATP recordings and other recordings. After the agreement expired in 1953 he issued the JATP recordings and other recordings on Clef Records (founded 1946) and Norgran Records (founded 1953). Down Home Records was intended for traditional jazz works. Jazz at the Philharmonic ceased touring the United States and Canada, after the JATP concerts in the fall of 1957, apart from a North American Tour in 1967.

==Personal life==
Granz married three times. In 1950, he married Loretta (née Snyder) Sullivan from Michigan; they had a daughter together, Stormont Granz, who was disabled due to lack of oxygen during the birth.&lt;ref name=Hershorn /&gt; Loretta was previously married and had a child, Sydney Sullivan Hamed, whom Granz adopted.&lt;ref name=Hershorn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Loretta Granz Obituary |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 22, 2013 |url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=loretta-granz&amp;pid=167014898 |quote=Loretta Granz passed away peacefully in Beverly Hills, CA. She led a wonderful life doing what she loved. She is survived by two daughters and a son-in-law, Sheridan Sullivan (Amir Hamed) and Stormont Granz.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in 1953 and divorced in 1955.&lt;ref name=Hershorn /&gt; In 1965, he married Hannelore Granz, a former airline stewardess from Germany.&lt;ref name=Hershorn&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SxH9ybqdMC&amp;pg=hannelore|first=Ted|last=Hershorn|authorlink=|title=Norman Granz: The Man Who Used Jazz for Justice|pages= |publisher=University of California Press|date=October 17, 2011|isbn=9780520949775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Court Rebuff to Impresario's Wife London |publisher=The Kansas City Times|date=April 26, 1968 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/58665376/ whom |quote=Granz and his 26-year-old German-born wife, Hannelore, have been involved in divorce proceedings brought in Switzerland. Mrs. Granz had asked the high court to impound the collection on the grounds that she was entitled to a communal share. The court said no, holding that Switzerland does not recognize such communal property claims, as California does, for example. The Granzs were married in Las Vegas in 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he married Grete Lyngby from Denmark.&lt;ref name=Hershorn /&gt;

He died of cancer on November 22, 2001 at the age of 83 in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Severo |title=Norman Granz, Who Took Jazz Out of Smoky Clubs and Put It in Concert Halls, Dies at 83 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/27/arts/norman-granz-who-took-jazz-smoky-clubs-put-it-concert-halls-dies-83.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 27, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==

Many of the names that made history in jazz signed with one of Norman Granz's labels, including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Count Basie]], [[Louie Bellson]],  [[Benny Carter]], [[Buck Clayton]], [[Buddy DeFranco]], [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Johnny Hodges]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Hank Jones]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Anita O'Day]] (the first artist to sign with Verve), [[Charlie Parker]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Flip Phillips]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[Sonny Stitt]], [[Slim Gaillard]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Ben Webster]] and [[Lester Young]].

Granz saw to it that his musicians were well paid. In the segregated society of the 1940s, he insisted on equal pay and accommodation for white and black musicians. He refused to take his hugely popular concerts to places which were segregated, even if he had to cancel concerts, thereby sacrificing considerable sums of money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt;

In 1944, Granz and [[Gjon Mili]] produced the jazz film ''[[Jammin' the Blues]]'', which starred Lester Young, Illinois Jacquet, Barney Kessel, [[Harry Edison]], [[Jo Jones]], [[Sidney Catlett]], [[Marlowe Morris]], and [[Marie Bryant]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt;

It was in 1956 that the popular singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]] finally joined Norman Granz's label. Granz had been her manager for some time, and unified his activities under the common label of [[Verve Records]]. Granz became Fitzgerald's manager, and remained so until the end of her career. Fitzgerald's memorable series of eight ''[[The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks|Songbooks]]'', together with the duet series (notably Armstrong-Peterson, Fitzgerald-Basie, Fitzgerald-Pass and Getz-Peterson) achieved wide popularity and brought acclaim to the label and to the artists. Granz was also the manager of [[Oscar Peterson]],  another lifelong friend.
In 1959, Norman Granz moved to Switzerland. In December 1960, [[Verve Records]] was sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

Granz founded his last label, [[Pablo Records]], in 1973; in 1987, he sold it to [[Fantasy Records]].

==Opposing racism==
Norman Granz opposed [[racism]] and fought many battles for his artists, many of whom were black. In 1955, in [[Houston]], Texas, he removed signs that previously designated &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Negro&quot; restrooms, outside the auditorium where two concerts were to be performed by Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie. Between the two shows, Ella and Dizzy and [[Illinois Jacquet]] were shooting small-stakes dice in the dressing room to kill time, when the local police barged in and arrested them. After some negotiations, the artists were allowed to perform the second show and later were formally released on $50 bail. Granz, incensed by the incident, insisted on successfully fighting the charges, which cost him over $2,000.&lt;ref name=Hershorn&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SxH9ybqdMC&amp;pg=hannelore|first=Ted|last=Hershorn|authorlink=|title=Norman Granz: The Man Who Used Jazz for Justice|pages= |publisher=[[University of California]] Press|date=October 17, 2011|isbn=9780520949775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oscar Peterson]] recounted how Granz once insisted that white cabdrivers take his black artists as customers while a policeman pointed a loaded pistol at his stomach. Granz also was among the first to pay white and black artists the same salary and to give them equal treatment even in minor details, such as dressing rooms.

Granz also spearheaded the fight to desegregate the hotels and casinos in [[Las Vegas]], arguing that it was unfair that black artists could perform on the stages, but could not stay or gamble at the hotels, or even enter through the front doors.

Granz was also interested in art, developing relationships with [[Pablo Picasso]], whom he met in 1968.&lt;ref name=Hershorn&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SxH9ybqdMC&amp;pg=hannelore|first=Ted|last=Hershorn|authorlink=|title=Norman Granz: The Man Who Used Jazz for Justice|pages= |publisher=[[University of California]] Press|date=October 17, 2011|isbn=9780520949775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed look at Granz, his career, and his legacy can be found in Tad Hershorn's book ''Norman Granz: The Man Who Used Jazz for Justice'' (2011).

'''Caracalla''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|r|ə|ˈ|k|æ|l|ə}} {{respell|KARR|ə|KAL|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Caracalla|accessdate=2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 April 188&amp;nbsp;– 8 April 217), formally known as '''Antoninus''' (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), was [[Roman emperor]] from 198 to 217. He was a member of the [[Severan dynasty]], the elder son of [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Julia Domna]]. Co-ruler with his father from 198, he continued to rule with his brother [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]], emperor from 209, after their father's death in 211. His brother was murdered by the [[Praetorian Guard]] later that year, supposedly under orders from Caracalla himself, who then reigned afterwards as sole ruler of the [[Roman Empire]]. He found administration to be mundane, leaving those responsibilities to his mother, [[Julia Domna]], to attend to. Caracalla's reign featured domestic instability and external invasions by the [[Germanic people]]s.

Caracalla's reign became notable for the [[Antonine Constitution]] ({{lang-la|Constitutio Antoniniana}}), also known as the Edict of Caracalla, which granted [[Roman citizenship]] to all [[Peregrinus (Roman)|free men]] throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. The edict gave all the enfranchised men Caracalla's adopted [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]: &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;. Domestically, Caracalla became known for the construction of the [[Baths of Caracalla]], which became the second-largest baths in Rome; for the introduction of a new Roman currency named the ''[[antoninianus]]'', a sort of double ''[[denarius]]''; and for the massacres he ordered, both in Rome and elsewhere in the empire. In 216, Caracalla began [[Parthian war of Caracalla|a campaign against the Parthian Empire]]. He did not see this campaign through to completion due to his assassination by a disaffected soldier in 217. [[Macrinus]] succeeded him as emperor three days later.

The ancient sources portray Caracalla as a tyrant and as a cruel leader, an image that has survived into modernity. [[Dio Cassius]] ({{circa}} 155 – {{circa}} 235) and [[Herodian]] ({{circa}} 170 – {{circa}} 240) present Caracalla as a soldier first and an emperor second. In the 12th century, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, the works of French painters revived images of Caracalla due to apparent parallels between Caracalla's tyranny and that ascribed to [[Louis XVI of France]] ({{reign | 1774 | 1792}}). Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as an evil ruler, painting him as one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.

== Names ==
Caracalla's name at birth was Lucius [[Septimia gens|Septimius]] Bassianus. He was renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus at the age of seven as part of his father's attempt at union with the families of [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabbernee|first1=William|last2=Lampe|first2=Peter|title=Pepouza and Tymion: The Discovery and Archaeological Exploration of a Lost Ancient City and an Imperial Estate|date=2008|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-020859-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hammond|1957|pp=35–36}} According to the 4th century historian [[Aurelius Victor]] in his ''Epitome de Caesaribus'', he became known by the [[agnomen]] &quot;Caracalla&quot; after a [[Gaul|Gallic]] hooded tunic that he habitually wore and made fashionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; He may have begun wearing it during his campaigns on the Rhine and Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Dio generally referred to him as Tarautas, after a famously diminutive and violent [[gladiator]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phang|first1=Sara|title=Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88269-9|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caracalla was born in [[Lugdunum]], [[Gaul]] (now [[Lyon]], France), on 4{{nbsp}}April 188 to [[Septimius Severus]] ({{Reign|193|211}}) and [[Julia Domna]], thus giving him [[Punics|Punic]] paternal ancestry and [[Arabs|Arab]] maternal ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shahid|first=Irfan|title=Rome and the Arabs|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|year=1984|isbn=0-88402-115-7|location=Georgetown, Washington D.C.|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a slightly younger brother, [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]], with whom Caracalla briefly ruled as co-emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Greece and Rome|last=Gagarin|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Rome|last=Dunstan|first=William, E.|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caracalla was five years old when his father was acclaimed ''[[Augustus (title)|augustus]]'' on 9 April 193.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooley|first=Alison E.|url={{googlebooks|VlghAwAAQBAJ|plainurl=y}}|title=The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-521-84026-2|page=495-496|author-link=Alison E. Cooley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Caesar'' ===
In early 195, Caracalla's father Septimius Severus had himself adopted posthumously by the deified emperor (''[[divus]]'') [[Marcus Aurelius]] ({{Reign|161|180}}); accordingly, in 195 or 196 Carcalla was given the imperial rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]'', adopting the name ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar'', and was pronounced {{Lang-la|imperator destinatus}} (or {{Lang-la|designatus|label=none}}) in 197, possibly on his birthday, 4 April, and certainly before 7 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; He thus became part of the well-remembered [[Antonine dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kienast|first=Dietmar|title=Römische Kaisertabelle: Grundzüge einer römischen Kaiserchronologie|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|year=2017|isbn=978-3-534-26724-8|place=Darmstadt|pages=156-161|chapter=Caracalla|ref={{sfnref|Kienast}}|orig-year=1990|lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-''augustus'' ===
Caracalla's father appointed Caracalla joint ''augustus'' and full emperor from 28 January 198.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Severans: the Changed Roman Empire|last=Grant|first=Michael|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1996|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cooley|2012|p=495}} This was the day of Septimius Severus's [[Roman triumph|triumph]] was celebrated, in honour of his victory over the [[Parthian Empire]] in the [[Roman–Persian Wars]]; he had successfully sacked the Parthian capital, [[Ctesiphon]], after winning the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (198)|Battle of Ctesiphon]], probably in October 197.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kienast|first=Dietmar|title=Römische Kaisertabelle: Grundzüge einer römischen Kaiserchronologie|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|year=2017|isbn=978-3-534-26724-8|place=Darmstadt|pages=149-155|chapter=Septimius Severus|ref={{sfnref|Kienast}}|orig-year=1990|lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded [[tribunician power]] and the title of ''[[imperator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In inscriptions, Caracalla is given from 198 the title of the chief priesthood, ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; His brother Geta was proclaimed ''nobilissimus caesar'' on the same day, and their father Septimius Severus was awarded the victory name ''Parthicus Maximus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]], [[Fulvia Plautilla]], a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Rome|last=Dunstan|first=William, E.|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding took place between the 9 and the 15 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt;

On 28 January 207, Caracalla celebrated his ''decennalia'', the tenth anniversary of the beginning of his reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt; 208 was the year of his third and Geta's second consulship.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt;'' Geta was himself granted the rank of ''augustus'' and tribunician powers in September or October 209.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

During the reign of his father, Caracalla's mother Julia Domna had played a prominent public role, receiving titles of honour such as &quot;Mother of the camp&quot;, but she also played a role behind the scenes helping Septimius administer the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|url=https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold/page/76|title=How Rome fell: death of a superpower|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-16426-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold/page/76 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as ambitious,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunstan|first=William|title=Ancient Rome|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Domna surrounded herself with thinkers and writers from all over the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunstan|first=William|title=Ancient Rome|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Caracalla was mustering and training troops for his planned Persian invasion, Julia remained in Rome, administering the empire. Julia's growing influence in state affairs was the beginning of a trend of emperors' mothers having influence, which continued throughout the Severan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael|title=The Severans: the Changed Roman Empire|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1996|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign as senior emperor ==
On 4{{nbsp}}February 211, Septimius Severus died, leaving his two sons and co-''augusti'' to rule the empire. On the death of his father, Caracalla adopted his father's ''[[cognomen]]'', Severus, and assumed the chief priesthood as ''pontifex maximus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt; His name became ''Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Pius Augustus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot; /&gt;

=== Geta as co-''augustus'' ===

During the journey back to Rome with their father's ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the [[Bosphorus]] to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was to rule in the west and Geta was to rule in the east. They were persuaded not to do this by their mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

=== Geta's murder ===
On 26 December 211, at a reconciliation meeting arranged by their mother, Geta was assassinated by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]] loyal to Caracalla. Geta died in his mother's arms. It is widely accepted, and clearly most likely, that Caracalla ordered the assassination himself, as the two had never been on favourable terms with one another, much less after succeeding their father.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; 

Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters and ordered a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Rome|last=Dunstan|first=William, E.|publisher=Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7425-6832-7|pages=405–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Rome Fell: death of a superpower|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-16426-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold/page/70 70–71]|url=https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold/page/70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geta's image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, and it became a capital offence to speak or write Geta's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mutilation and transformation: damnatio memoriae and Roman imperial portraiture|last=Varner|first=Eric, R.|publisher=Brill Academic|year=2004|isbn=90-04-13577-4|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the ''damnatio memoriae'', an estimated 20,000 people were massacred.&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt; Those killed were Geta's inner circle of guards and advisers, friends, and other military staff under his employ.&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot; /&gt;

When Geta died in 211, Julia Domna's responsibilities increased, because Caracalla found administrative tasks to be mundane.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt; She may have taken on one of the more important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuori|first=Kaius|date=2016|title=Judge Julia Domna?

She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla.&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt; The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt;

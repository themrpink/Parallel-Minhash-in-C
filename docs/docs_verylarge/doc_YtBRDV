The re-integration of the kitchen and the living area went hand in hand with a change in the perception of cooking: increasingly, cooking was seen as a [[Art|creative]] and sometimes social act instead of work.  And there was a rejection by younger home-owners of the standard suburban model of separate kitchens and dining rooms found in most 1900–1950 houses.  Many families also appreciated the trend towards open kitchens, as it made it easier for the parents to supervise the children while cooking and to clean up spills. The enhanced status of cooking also made the kitchen a prestige object for showing off one's wealth or cooking professionalism. Some [[architect]]s have capitalized on this &quot;object&quot; aspect of the kitchen by designing freestanding &quot;kitchen objects&quot;. However, like their precursor, Colani's &quot;kitchen satellite&quot;, such futuristic designs are exceptions.

Another reason for the trend back to open kitchens (and a foundation of the &quot;kitchen object&quot; philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared. Whereas prior to the 1950s most cooking started out with raw ingredients and a meal had to be prepared from scratch, the advent of [[frozen meal]]s and pre-prepared [[convenience food]] changed the cooking habits of many people, who consequently used the kitchen less and less. For others, who followed the &quot;cooking as a social act&quot; trend, the open kitchen had the advantage that they could be with their guests while cooking, and for the &quot;creative cooks&quot; it might even become a stage for their cooking performance.

The &quot;Trophy Kitchen&quot; is equipped with very expensive and sophisticated appliances which are used primarily to impress visitors and to project social status, rather than for actual cooking.

===Ventilation===
{{main|Kitchen ventilation}}

The ventilation of a kitchen, in particular a large restaurant kitchen, poses certain difficulties that are not present in the ventilation of other kinds of spaces. In particular, the air in a kitchen differs from that of other rooms in that it typically contains grease, smoke and odours.

==Materials==
The Frankfurt Kitchen of 1926 was made of several materials depending on the application. The modern built-in kitchens of today use [[particle board]]s or MDF, decorated with a variety of materials and finishes including wood veneers, lacquer, glass, melamine, laminate, ceramic and eco gloss. Very few manufacturers produce home built-in kitchens from stainless-steel. Until the 1950s, steel kitchens were used by architects, but this material was displaced by the cheaper particle board panels sometimes decorated with a steel surface.

==Domestic kitchen planning==
[[File:Beecher kitchen.jpg|thumb|Beecher's &quot;model kitchen&quot; brought early [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] principles to the home]]
[[File:Food over a kitchen - 20111001.jpg|thumb|Food in a kitchen pantry]]
[[File:Walnut-solid-floor.jpg|thumb|Block kitchen]]
Domestic (or residential) kitchen design is a relatively recent discipline. The first ideas to optimize the work in the kitchen go back to [[Catharine Beecher]]'s ''A Treatise on Domestic Economy'' (1843, revised and republished together with her sister [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] as ''The American Woman's Home'' in 1869). Beecher's &quot;model kitchen&quot; propagated for the first time a systematic design based on early [[ergonomics]]. The design included regular shelves on the walls, ample work space, and dedicated storage areas for various food items. Beecher even separated the functions of preparing food and cooking it altogether by moving the stove into a compartment adjacent to the kitchen.

[[Christine Frederick]] published from 1913 a series of articles on &quot;New Household Management&quot; in which she analyzed the kitchen following [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] principles of efficiency, presented detailed time-motion studies, and derived a kitchen design from them. Her ideas were taken up in the 1920s by architects in Germany and [[Austria]], most notably [[Bruno Taut]], Erna Meyer, [[Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky]] and [[Benita Otte]], who designed the first fitted kitchen for the [[Haus am Horn]], which was completed in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Moore | first = Rowan | title = Bauhaus at 100: its legacy in five key designs | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2019-01-21 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/jan/21/bauhaus-at-100-its-legacy-in-five-key-designs | access-date = 2019-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar design principles were employed by Schütte-Lihotzky for her famous [[Frankfurt kitchen]], designed for [[Ernst May]]'s ''Römerstadt'', a social housing project in Frankfurt, in 1927.

While this &quot;work kitchen&quot; and variants derived from it were a great success for tenement buildings, home owners had different demands and did not want to be constrained by a {{convert|6.4|m2|adj=on}} kitchen. Nevertheless, kitchen design was mostly ad-hoc following the whims of the architect. In the [[United States|U.S.]], the &quot;Small Homes Council&quot;, since 1993 the &quot;Building Research Council&quot;, of the School of Architecture of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] was founded in 1944 with the goal to improve the state of the art in home building, originally with an emphasis on standardization for cost reduction. It was there that the notion of the ''[[Kitchen Work Triangle|kitchen work triangle]]'' was formalized: the three main functions in a kitchen are storage, preparation, and cooking (which Catharine Beecher had already recognized), and the places for these functions should be arranged in the kitchen in such a way that work at one place does not interfere with work at another place, the distance between these places is not unnecessarily large, and no obstacles are in the way. A natural arrangement is a [[triangle]], with the refrigerator, the sink, and the stove at a vertex each.

This observation led to a few common kitchen forms, commonly characterized by the arrangement of the kitchen cabinets and sink, stove, and refrigerator:
* A ''single-file kitchen'' (also known as a one-way galley or a straight-line kitchen) has all of these along one wall; the work triangle degenerates to a line. This is not optimal, but often the only solution if space is restricted. This may be common in an attic space that is being converted into a living space, or a studio apartment.
* The ''double-file kitchen (or two-way galley)'' has two rows of cabinets at opposite walls, one containing the stove and the sink, the other the refrigerator. This is the classical work kitchen and makes efficient use of space.
* In the ''L-kitchen'', the cabinets occupy two adjacent walls. Again, the work triangle is preserved, and there may even be space for an additional table at a third wall, provided it does not intersect the triangle.
* A ''U-kitchen'' has cabinets along three walls, typically with the sink at the base of the &quot;U&quot;. This is a typical work kitchen, too, unless the two other cabinet rows are short enough to place a table at the fourth wall.
* A ''G-kitchen'' has cabinets along three walls, like the U-kitchen, and also a partial fourth wall, often with a double basin sink at the corner of the G shape. The G-kitchen provides additional work and storage space, and can support two work triangles. A modified version of the G-kitchen is the ''double-L'', which splits the G into two L-shaped components, essentially adding a smaller L-shaped island or peninsula to the L-kitchen.
* The ''block kitchen (or island)'' is a more recent development, typically found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing &quot;island&quot;, separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or the rest of the family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.

In the 1980s, there was a backlash against industrial kitchen planning and cabinets with people installing a mix of work surfaces and free standing furniture, led by kitchen designer [[Johnny Grey]] and his concept of the &quot;unfitted kitchen&quot;. Modern kitchens often have enough informal space to allow for people to eat in it without having to use the formal [[dining room]]. Such areas are called &quot;breakfast areas&quot;, &quot;breakfast nooks&quot; or &quot;breakfast bars&quot; if the space is integrated into a kitchen counter. Kitchens with enough space to eat in are sometimes called &quot;eat-in kitchens&quot;. During the 2000s, flat pack kitchens were popular for people doing [[DIY]] renovating on a budget. The flat pack kitchens industry makes it easy to put together and mix and matching doors, bench tops and cabinets. In flat pack systems, many components can be interchanged.

==Other types==
[[File:Canteen kitchen.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] kitchen]]
[[Restaurant]] and [[Cafeteria|canteen]] kitchens found in [[hotel]]s, [[hospital]]s, educational and work place facilities, army barracks, and similar institutions are generally (in developed countries) subject to [[public health]] laws. They are inspected periodically by public health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.

Canteen kitchens (and castle kitchens) were often the places where new technology was used first. For instance, [[Benjamin Thompson]]'s &quot;energy saving stove&quot;, an early 19th-century fully closed iron stove using one fire to heat several pots, was designed for large kitchens; another thirty years passed before they were adapted for domestic use.

As of 2017, restaurant kitchens usually have tiled walls and floors and use stainless steel for other surfaces (workbench, but also door and drawer fronts) because these materials are durable and easy to clean. Professional kitchens are often equipped with gas stoves, as these allow [[Cook (profession)|cooks]] to regulate the heat more quickly and more finely than electrical stoves. Some special appliances are typical for professional kitchens, such as large installed [[deep fryer]]s, [[Steaming|steamers]], or a [[bain-marie]]. [[File:Food tech room Marling.JPG|thumb|right|The Food Technology room at [[Marling School]] in [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] ([[Gloucestershire]], UK)]]

The [[fast food]] and [[convenience food]] trends have changed the manner in which restaurant kitchens operate. Some of these type restaurants may only &quot;finish&quot; convenience food that is delivered to them, or just reheat completely prepared meals. At the most they may [[grilling|grill]] a [[hamburger]] or a [[steak]]. But in the early 21st century, c-stores (convenience stores) are attracting greater market share by performing more food preparation on-site and better customer service than some fast food outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.qsrmagazine.com/exclusives/c-stores-eating-your-lunch |author= Blank, Christine|title=C-Stores Eating Your Lunch|journal=QSR Magazine|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kitchens in [[railway]] [[dining car]]s have presented special challenges: space is limited, and, personnel must be able to serve a great number of meals quickly. Especially in the early history of railways, this required flawless organization of processes; in modern times, the [[microwave oven]] and prepared meals have made this task much easier. Kitchens aboard [[ship]]s, [[aircraft]] and sometimes [[Railroad car|railcars]] are often referred to as [[Galley (kitchen)|galleys]]. On [[yacht]]s, galleys are often cramped, with one or two burners fueled by an [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]] bottle. Kitchens on [[cruise ship]]s or large [[warship]]s, by contrast, are comparable in every respect with restaurants or canteen kitchens.

On passenger [[airliner]]s, the kitchen is reduced to a [[pantry]].  The crew's role is to heat and serve in-flight meals delivered by a [[catering]] company. An extreme form of the kitchen occurs in space, ''e.g.'', aboard a [[Space Shuttle]] (where it is also called the &quot;galley&quot;) or the [[International Space Station]]. The [[astronaut]]s' food is generally completely prepared, [[Dehydration|dehydrated]], and sealed in plastic pouches before the flight. The kitchen is reduced to a rehydration and heating module.

Outdoor areas where food is prepared are generally not considered kitchens, even though an outdoor area set up for regular food preparation, for instance when [[camping]], might be referred to as an &quot;outdoor kitchen&quot;. An outdoor kitchen at a [[campsite]] might be placed near a well, water pump, or water tap, and it might provide tables for food preparation and cooking (using portable campstoves). Some campsite kitchen areas have a large tank of [[propane]] connected to burners, so that campers can cook their meals. Military camps and similar temporary settlements of [[nomad]]s may have dedicated kitchen tents, which have a vent to enable cooking smoke to escape.

In schools where home economics, [[food technology]] (previously known as &quot;[[domestic science]]&quot;), or [[culinary arts]] are taught, there are typically a series of kitchens with multiple equipment (similar in some respects to [[laboratory|laboratories]]) solely for the purpose of teaching. These consist of multiple workstations, each with its own [[oven]], [[sink]], and kitchen utensils, where the teacher can show students how to prepare food and cook it.

==By region==
===China===

Kitchens in China are called {{lang|zh|chúfáng(厨房)}}. More than 3000 years ago, the ancient Chinese used the [[Ding (vessel)|ding]] for cooking food.  The ding was developed into the [[wok]] and pot used today. Many Chinese people believe that there is a [[Kitchen God]] who watches over the kitchen for the family. According to this belief, the god returns to heaven to give a report to the [[Jade Emperor]] annually about this family behavior. Every Chinese New Year Eve, families will gather together to pray for the kitchen god to give a good report to heaven and wish him to bring back good news on the fifth day of the New Year. 
  
The most common cooking equipment in Chinese family kitchens and restaurant kitchens are woks, steamer baskets and pots. The fuel or heating resource was also important technique to practice the cooking skills. Traditionally  Chinese were using wood or straw as the fuel to cook food. A Chinese chef had to master flaming and heat radiation to reliably prepare traditional recipes. Chinese cooking will use a pot or wok for pan frying, stir frying, deep frying or boiling.

===Japan===
{{main|Japanese kitchen}}
Kitchens in Japan are called '''Daidokoro''' (台所; lit. &quot;kitchen&quot;). Daidokoro is the place where food is prepared in a [[Housing in Japan|Japanese house]]. Until the [[Meiji era]], a kitchen was also called ''kamado'' (かまど; lit. [[stove]]) and there are many sayings in the [[Japanese language]] that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house and the term could even be used to mean &quot;family&quot; or &quot;household&quot; (similar to the English word &quot;hearth&quot;). When separating a family, it was called ''Kamado wo wakeru'', which means &quot;divide the stove&quot;. ''Kamado wo yaburu'' (lit. &quot;break the stove&quot;) means that the family was bankrupt.

===India===

[[File:Traditional way of making food.jpg|thumb|Traditional way of making food]]
In India, a kitchen is called a &quot;Rasoi&quot; (in Hindi\Sanskrit)  or a &quot;Swayampak ghar&quot; in Marathi, and there exist many other names for it in the various regional languages. Many different methods of cooking exist across the country, and the structure and the materials used in constructing kitchens have varied depending on the region. For example, in north and central India, cooking used to be carried out in clay ovens called &quot;Chulha&quot;s, fired by wood, coal or dried cowdung. In households where members observed vegetarianism, separate kitchens were maintained to cook and store vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Religious families often treat the kitchen as a sacred space. Indian kitchens are built on an Indian architectural science called vastushastra. The Indian kitchen vastu is of utmost importance while designing a kitchens in India. Modern-day architects also follow the norms of vastushastra while designing Indian kitchens across the world.

While many kitchens belonging to poor families continue to use clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric cooktops are rarer since they consume a great deal of electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by biogas and solar energy as fuel. World's largest solar energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inhabitat.com/world%E2%80%99s-largest-solar-kitchen-in-india-can-cook-upto-38500-meals-per-day/|title=World’s Largest 38500-meal Solar Kitchen in India|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India is encouraging domestic biogas plants to support the kitchen system.

'''Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus''', born '''Gaius Caecilius''' or '''Gaius Caecilius Cilo''' (61 – c. 113), better known as '''Pliny the Younger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɪ|n|i}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03kv0cl|title=Pliny the Younger|website=In Our Time|publisher=BBC Radio 4|host=Melvyn Bragg|date=12 Dec 2013|access-date=26 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of [[Ancient Rome]]. Pliny's uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], helped raise and educate him.

Pliny the Younger wrote hundreds of letters, of which 247 survive, and which are of great historical value. Some are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian [[Tacitus]]. Pliny served as an [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|imperial magistrate]] under [[Trajan]] (reigned 98–117),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bennett, Julian |title=Trajan: Optimus Princeps: A Life and Times|location=New York &amp; London|publisher=Routledge|date= 1997|pages= 113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his letters to Trajan provide one of the few surviving records of the relationship between the imperial office and provincial governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780192801463|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1750?rskey=6JozU6&amp;result=5|editor=John W.

Pliny rose through a series of civil and military offices, the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. He was a friend of the historian [[Tacitus]] and might have employed the biographer [[Suetonius]] on his staff. Pliny also came into contact with other well-known men of the period, including the philosophers [[Artemidorus]] and [[Euphrates the Stoic]], during his time in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shelton | first = Jo-Ann | title = The Women of Pliny's Letters | publisher = Rutledge | series = Women of the Ancient World Series | year = 2013 | location = New York, NY | pages = 159–161 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BtWZrdKZpi8C | isbn = 978-0-203-09812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Childhood===
[[File:Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot - Como and Lake Como.jpg|thumb|right|''Como and [[Lake Como]] in 1834'', painted by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]]]

Pliny the Younger was born in ''Novum Comum'' ([[Como]], Northern [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]]) around 61 AD, the son of [[Caecilia (gens)|Lucius Caecilius Cilo]], born there, and his wife Plinia Marcella, a sister of [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salway&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Salway, B. |date=1994|title=Journal of Roman Studies|volume=84|pages= 124–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of [[Roman Senate|Senator]] and landowner Gaius Caecilius, revered his uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]] (who at this time was extremely famous around the Roman Empire), and provided sketches of how his uncle worked on the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Letters'' 3.5.8–12. See English translation ([https://www.livius.org/pi-pm/pliny/pliny_e2.html Plinius the Elder (2)]) and Latin text ([http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep3.html C. PLINII CAECILII SECVNDI EPISTVLARVM LIBER TERTIVS]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cilo died at an early age, when Pliny was still young.  As a result, the boy probably lived with his mother. His guardian and preceptor in charge of his education was [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} famed for quelling a revolt against [[Nero]] in 68 AD. 
After being first tutored at home, Pliny went to Rome for further education. There he was taught [[rhetoric]] by [[Quintilian]], a great teacher and author, and Nicetes Sacerdos of Smyrna. It was at this time that Pliny became closer to his uncle Pliny the Elder. When Pliny the Younger was 17 or 18, his uncle Pliny the Elder died attempting to rescue victims of the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Vesuvius eruption]], and the terms of the Elder Pliny's will passed his estate to his nephew. In the same document, the younger Pliny was [[adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] by his uncle. As a result, Pliny the Younger changed his name from ''Gaius Caecilius Cilo'' to ''Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus'' (his official title was ''Gaius Plinius Luci filius Caecilius Secundus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radice, Betty |title=The Letters of the Younger Pliny|publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1975|page =13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Younger Pliny Reproved.jpg|thumb|left|'' The Younger Pliny Reproved'', colourized copperplate print by Thomas Burke (1749–1815)]]

There is some evidence that Pliny had a sibling. A memorial erected in Como (now {{CIL|5|5279}}) repeats the terms of a will by which the ''[[aedile]]'' Lucius Caecilius Cilo, son of Lucius, established a fund, the interest of which was to buy oil (used for soap) for the baths of the people of Como. The trustees are apparently named in the inscription: &quot;L. Caecilius Valens and P. Caecilius Secundus, sons of Lucius, and the ''contubernalis'' Lutulla.&quot; The word ''contubernalis'' describing Lutulla is the military term meaning &quot;tent-mate&quot;, which can only mean that she was living with Lucius, not as his wife. The first man mentioned, L. Caecilius Valens, is probably the older son. Pliny the Younger confirms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters|chapter=I.8, To Saturninus|quote=I am compelled to the discourse of my own largesse, as well as those of my ancestors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was a trustee for the largesse &quot;of my ancestors&quot;. It seems unknown to Pliny the Elder, so Valens' mother was probably not his sister Plinia; perhaps Valens was Lutulla's son from an earlier relationship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Marriages===
Pliny the Younger married three times, firstly, when he was very young (about 18), to a stepdaughter of Veccius Proculus, who died at age 37; secondly, at an unknown date, to the daughter of Pompeia Celerina; and thirdly to Calpurnia, daughter of Calpurnius and granddaughter of [[Calpurnius Fabatus]] of [[Como|Comum]]. Letters survive in which Pliny recorded this last marriage taking place, his attachment to Calpurnia, and his sadness when she miscarried their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pliny|title=Letters|pages=8.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Pliny is thought to have died suddenly during his convention  in [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia-Pontus]], around 113 AD, since no events referred to in his letters date later than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Donna.W|title=Suetonius The Caesars|year=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis/Cambridge|isbn=978-1-60384-313-3|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Pliny was by birth of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank, that is, a member of the aristocratic order of ''equites'' (knights), the lower (beneath the [[Roman Senate|senatorial order]]) of the two Roman aristocratic orders that monopolised senior civil and military offices during the early Empire. His career began at the age of 18 and initially followed a normal equestrian route. But, unlike most equestrians, he achieved entry into the upper order by being elected [[Quaestor]] in his late twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pliny: A Self-Portrait in Letters'', The Folio Society, London (1978), Intro. pp.9–11&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Career summary|Career summary]] below.)

Pliny was active in the Roman legal system, especially in the sphere of the Roman [[centumviral court]], which dealt with inheritance cases. Later, he was a well-known prosecutor and defender at the trials of a series of provincial governors, including [[Baebius Massa]], governor of [[Baetica]]; Marius Priscus, governor of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]; Gaius Caecilius Classicus, governor of [[Baetica]]; and most ironically in light of his later appointment to this province, [[Gaius Julius Bassus]] and Varenus Rufus, both governors of [[Bithynia and Pontus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pliny: A Self-Portrait in Letters'', Intro. pp.10–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny's career is commonly considered as a summary of the main Roman public charges and is the best-documented example from this period, offering proof for many aspects of imperial culture. Effectively, Pliny crossed all the principal fields of the organization of the early Roman Empire. It is an achievement for a man to have not only survived the reigns of several disparate emperors, especially the much-detested [[Domitian]], but also to have risen in rank throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''op. cit.'', Intro. p.15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Pliny wrote his first work, a [[tragedy]] in [[Greek language|Greek]], at age 14.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;quin etiam quattuordecim natus annos Graecam tragoediam scripsi.&quot;: ''Epistulae'' VII. iv&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the course of his life, he wrote numerous poems, most of which are lost. He was also known as a notable ''[[orator]]''; though he professed himself a follower of [[Cicero]], Pliny's prose was more magniloquent and less direct than [[Cicero]]'s.

Pliny's only oration that now survives is the ''Panegyricus Traiani''. This was delivered in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in 100 and is a description of [[Trajan]]'s figure and actions in an adulatory and emphatic form, especially contrasting him with the Emperor [[Domitian]]. It is, however, a relevant document that reveals many details about the Emperor's actions in several fields of his administrative power such as taxes, justice, military discipline, and commerce. Recalling the speech in one of his letters, Pliny shrewdly defines his own motives thus:
{{quote|I hoped in the first place to encourage our Emperor in his virtues by a sincere tribute and, secondly, to show his successors what path to follow to win the same renown, not by offering instruction but by setting his example before them. To proffer advice on an Emperor's duties might be a noble enterprise, but it would be a heavy responsibility verging on insolence, whereas to praise an excellent ruler (''optimum principem'') and thereby shine a beacon on the path posterity should follow would be equally effective without appearing presumptuous.&lt;ref&gt;Epistulae III. xviii, here translated by Betty Radice, ''The Letters of the Younger Pliny'', Penguin Classics (1975), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

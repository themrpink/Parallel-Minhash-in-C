Portland is where national [[Prohibition]] started. Portland mayor and temperance leader [[Neal Dow]] led Maine to ban alcohol sales in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/maine-first-state-try-prohibition-180963503/|title=Why Was Maine the First State to Try Prohibition?|last=Eschner|first=Kat|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law led to the [[Portland Rum Riot]] in 1855. Canned corn was developed in Portland by the N. Winslow company. By 1852 the Winslow's Patent Hermetically Sealed Green Corn was a commercial success and the company became a world leader in the canning industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainememory.net/bin/Features?fn=53&amp;fmt=list&amp;n=1&amp;supst=Exhibits&amp;mr=all|title=Maine Memory Network Exhibit - Canning: A Maine Industry|website=www.mainememory.net|access-date=2020-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainelegacy.com/14.html|title=Civil War Canning Pioneer Winslow's Cannery / Union Army Contractors|website=www.mainelegacy.com|access-date=2020-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's [[Amato's]] Italian delicatessen claims to be the birthplace of the [[Italian sandwich]], called &quot;an Italian&quot; by locals, which Amato's first served in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatscookingamerica.net/History/HoagieSubmarinePoBoy.htm|title=History Hoagie Sandwich, History Submarine Sandwich, History Po' Boys Sandwich, Poor Boy Sandwich, History Dagwood Sandwich, History Italian Sandwich|date=|publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An historic B&amp;M Baked Beans plant built in 1913 remains in operation on the waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2017/05/14/for-150-years-this-company-knows-beans/|title=Take a look inside the 150-year-old B&amp;M Beans factory in Portland|last=McCanna|first=Ben|date=2017-05-14|website=Press Herald|access-date=2020-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has adopted a [[council-manager government|council-manager style government]] that is detailed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080228100402/http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf city charter]. The citizens of Portland are represented by a nine-member [[Portland, Maine City Council|city council]] which makes policy, passes ordinances, approves appropriations, appoints the city manager and oversees the municipal government. The city council of nine members is elected by the citizens of Portland. The city has five voting districts, with each district electing a city [[councillor|councilor]] to represent their neighborhood interests for a three-year term. There are also four members of the city council who are elected [[at-large]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf|title= City of Portland Code of Ordinances, Charter Rev. 7-01-09  |accessdate=September 10, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191418/http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 until 2011, city councilors chose one of themselves each year to serve as [[Mayor of Portland, Maine|Mayor of Portland]], a primarily ceremonial position. On November 2, 2010, Portland voters narrowly approved a measure that allowed them to elect the mayor. On November 8, 2011, former State Senator and candidate for U.S. Congress [[Michael F. Brennan]] was elected as mayor. On December 5, 2011, he was sworn in as the first citizen-elected mayor in 88 years (see [[Portland, Maine mayoral election, 2011]]). The office of mayor is a four-year position that earns a salary of 150% of the city's median income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxmaine.com/news/politics/Portland-Elected-Mayor-Measure-Passes-106603518.html|title=Portland Elected Mayor Measure Passes|publisher=|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current mayor is [[Kate Snyder]], who defeated incumbent mayor [[Ethan Strimling]] in the [[2019 Portland, Maine mayoral election]].

A [[city manager]] is appointed by the city council. The city manager oversees the daily operations of the city government, appoints the heads of city departments, and prepares annual budgets. The city manager directs all city agencies and departments, and is responsible for the executing laws and policies passed by the city council.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The current city manager is [[Jon Jennings]].

Aside from the main city council, there is also an elected school board for the [[Portland Public Schools (Maine)|Portland Public School system]].

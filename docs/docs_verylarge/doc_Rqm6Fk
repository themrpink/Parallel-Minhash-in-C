===Molniya orbit===
{{Main|Molniya orbit}}

Geostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator. This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes, affecting connectivity and causing [[multipath interference]] (caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna).

Thus, for areas close to the North (and South) Pole, a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, Molniya orbit satellites have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem.

Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellite's position above the horizon. Thus, a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees.)

The Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.

The first satellite of the [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] series was launched on April 23, 1965 and was used for experimental [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of TV [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signals]] from a Moscow [[uplink]] station to [[downlink]] stations located in [[Siberia]] and the Russian Far East, in [[Norilsk]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Magadan]] and [[Vladivostok]]. In November 1967 Soviet engineers created a unique [[system]] of national TV [[television network|network]] of [[satellite television]], called [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]], that was based on Molniya satellites.

===Polar orbit===
{{Main|Polar orbit}}

In the United States, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations of
NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) 
NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes; for example, METSAT for meteorological satellite, EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program, and METOP for meteorological operations.

These orbits are sun synchronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day. For example, the satellites in the NPOESS (civilian) orbit will cross the equator, going from south to north, at times 1:30 P.M., 5:30 P.M., and 9:30 P.M.

== Structure ==
Communications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems:

* Communication Payload, normally composed of [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]], [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], and switching systems
* Engines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit
* A [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem]] used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the sun
* Power subsystem, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of [[solar cell]]s, and batteries that maintain power during [[solar eclipse]]
* Command and Control subsystem, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life-cycle.

The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite. Each service (TV, Voice, Internet, radio) requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission. This is typically known as link budgeting and a [[network simulator]] can be used to arrive at the exact value.

== Frequency Allocation for satellite systems ==
Allocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried out under the auspices of the [http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx International Telecommunication Union (ITU).]
To facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions:
*Region 1: Europe, Africa, the Middle East, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and Mongolia
*Region 2: North and South America and Greenland
*Region 3: Asia (excluding region 1 areas), Australia, and the southwest Pacific

Within these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services, although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by satellites are:
* [[Fixed-satellite service|Fixed satellite service (FSS)]] 
* [[Direct-broadcast satellite|Broadcasting satellite service (BSS)]]
* [[Mobile-satellite service]]
* [[Satellite navigation|Radionavigation-satellite service]]
* [[Weather satellite|Meteorological-satellite service]]

== Applications ==

=== Telephony ===
{{main|Satellite phone}}
[[File:Iridium satellite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]] satellite]]
The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental [[long distance telephony]]. The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite.  The downlink follows an analogous path.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s through the use of [[fiber-optics]] caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century.

Satellite communications are still used in many applications today. Remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service, need satellite telephones. There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example large regions of [[South America]], [[Africa]], Canada, [[China]], Russia, and [[Australia]]. Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]. Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea, a back up for hospitals, military, and recreation. Ships at sea, as well as planes, often use satellite phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iridium.com/IridiumConnected/IridiumAtWork/Maritime.aspx Connected | Maritime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815171540/http://iridium.com/IridiumConnected/IridiumAtWork/Maritime.aspx |date=2013-08-15 }}. Iridium. Retrieved on 2013-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means. On a large scale, often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area. There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system. In this example, almost any type of satellite can be used. Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-Earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleport]] connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network .

=== Television ===
{{main|Satellite television}}
As television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] comsats.  Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: [[Direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS), and [[Fixed Service Satellite]] (FSS).

The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the [[SES Astra|Astra]], [[Eutelsat]], and [[Hotbird]] spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.

[[Fixed Service Satellite]]s use the [[C band (IEEE)|C band]], and the lower portions of the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming, [[remote broadcast|live shot]]s, and [[backhaul (broadcasting)|backhaul]]s), as well as being used for [[distance learning]] by schools and universities, [[business television]] (BTV), [[Videoconferencing]], and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends.

[[Free-to-air]] satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band. The [[Intelsat Americas 5]], [[Galaxy 10R]] and [[AMC 3]] satellites over [[North America]] provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band [[transponder]]s.

The American [[Dish Network]] [[Direct-broadcast satellite|DBS]] service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their [[SuperDish]] antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s &quot;must-carry&quot; regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry [[HDTV]] channels.

A [[direct broadcast satellite]] is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS [[satellite dish]]es (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]. DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented ([[Direct-To-Home]]) satellite TV services, such as [[DirecTV]], DISH Network and Orby TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orby TV (United States)|url=https://www.satlaunch.org/packages-orby-tv-117w.htm|access-date=9 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, [[Bell Satellite TV]] and [[Shaw Direct]] in Canada, [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in the UK, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[New Zealand]] and [[DSTV]] in South Africa.

Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5 m) in diameter for K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band, and 12 feet (3.6 m) or larger for C band).  They use [[linear polarization]] for each of the transponders' RF input and output (as opposed to [[circular polarization]] used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of [[TVRO]] (TeleVision Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band form for the now-defunct [[Primestar]] satellite TV service.

Some satellites have been launched that have transponders in the [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]], such as DirecTV's [[SPACEWAY-1]] satellite, and [[Anik (satellite)|Anik F2]]. NASA and [[ISRO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSAT-14|url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/gsat-14.aspx|publisher=ISRO|access-date=16 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108052813/http://www.isro.org/satellites/gsat-14.aspx|archive-date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian GSLV successfully lofts GSAT-14 satellite|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/01/indian-gslv-launch-gsat-14-communications-satellite/|access-date=16 January 2014|newspaper=NASA Space Flight|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also launched experimental satellites carrying K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band beacons recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16748|title=DIRECTV's Spaceway F1 Satellite Launches New Era in High-Definition Programming; Next Generation Satellite Will Initiate Historic Expansion of DIRECTV|publisher=SpaceRef|access-date=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (on which the antenna is mounted) is situated.  These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some [[recreational vehicle]] owners.  Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by [[JetBlue Airways]] for DirecTV (supplied by [[LiveTV]], a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
{{main|Satellite radio}}
Satellite radio offers audio [[broadcast]] services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.

A satellite radio or subscription radio (SR) is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.

Satellite radio offers a meaningful alternative to ground-based radio services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services, such as SiriusXM, and Worldspace, allow listeners to roam across an entire continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere they go. Other services, such as Music Choice or Muzak's satellite-delivered content, require a fixed-location receiver and a dish antenna. In all cases, the antenna must have a clear view to the satellites. In areas where tall buildings, bridges, or even parking garages obscure the signal, repeaters can be placed to make the signal available to listeners.

Initially available for broadcast to stationary TV receivers, by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with the arrival of two satellite radio systems in the United States: Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings. Later they merged to become the conglomerate SiriusXM.

Radio services are usually provided by commercial ventures and are subscription-based. The various services are proprietary signals, requiring specialized hardware for decoding and playback. Providers usually carry a variety of news, weather, sports, and music channels, with the music channels generally being commercial-free.

In areas with a relatively high population density, it is easier and less expensive to reach the bulk of the population with terrestrial broadcasts. Thus in the UK and some other countries, the contemporary evolution of radio services is focused on Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) services or HD Radio, rather than satellite radio.

===Amateur radio===
{{main|Amateur radio satellite}}
[[Amateur radio]] operators have access to amateur satellites, which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] or [[VHF]] radio equipment and highly directional [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] such as [[Yagi antenna|Yagi]]s or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the [[X.25]] or similar protocols.

=== Internet access ===
{{main|Satellite Internet access}}
After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the [[Internet]] via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas, and cannot access a [[broadband]] connection, or require high availability of services.

=== Military ===
{{main|Military communications satellite}}
{{Further|X Band Satellite Communication}}
Communications satellites are used for [[military communications]] applications, such as [[Global Command and Control System]]s. Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the [[MILSTAR]], the [[DSCS]], and the [[FLTSATCOM]] of the United States, [[NATO]] satellites, [[United Kingdom]] satellites (for instance [[Skynet (satellite)|Skynet]]), and satellites of the former [[Soviet Union]]. India has launched its first Military Communication satellite [[GSAT-7]], its transponders operate in [[UHF]], [[F band (NATO)|F]], [[C band (IEEE)|C]] and {{Ku band}} bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-s-first-military-satellite-poor-country-satellite-put-into-earth-s-orbit-414080 India's first 'military' satellite GSAT-7 put into earth's orbit]. NDTV.com (2013-09-04). Retrieved on 2013-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically military satellites operate in the [[UHF]], [[Super High Frequency|SHF]] (also known as [[X-band]]) or [[Extremely high frequency|EHF]] (also known as [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]]) frequency bands.

===Data collection===
Near-ground [[in situ]] [[environmental monitoring]] equipment (such as [[weather station]]s, [[weather buoy]]s, and [[radiosondes]]), may use satellites for one-way [[data transmission]] or two-way [[telemetry]] and [[telecontrol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer 2002 pp. 311–328&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Kramer | first=Herbert J. | title=Observation of the Earth and Its Environment | chapter=Data Collection (Messaging) Systems | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | location=Berlin, Heidelberg | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-642-62688-3 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-56294-5_4 | pages=311–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be based on a secondary payload of a [[weather satellite]] (as in the case of [[GOES]] and [[METEOSAT]] and others in the [[Argos (satellite system)|Argos system]]) or in dedicated satellites (such as [[SCD (satellite)|SCD]]). The data rate is typically much lower than in [[satellite Internet]] access.

'''Cripple Creek''' is the [[List of cities and towns in Colorado#Statutory city|Statutory City]] that is the [[county seat]] of [[Teller County, Colorado|Teller County]], [[Colorado]], United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city population was 1,189 at the [[2010 United States Census]].  Cripple Creek is a former gold mining camp located {{convert|44|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] near the base of [[Pikes Peak]].  The [[Cripple Creek Historic District]], which received [[National Historic Landmark]] status in 1961, includes part or all of the city and the surrounding area.  The city is now a part of the [[Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

For many years, Cripple Creek's high valley, at an elevation of {{convert|9494|ft}}, was considered no more important than a cattle pasture. Many prospectors avoided the area after the ''Mount Pisgah hoax'', a mini gold rush caused by [[Salting (confidence trick)|salting]] (adding gold to worthless rock).&lt;ref&gt;Dan Plazak ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-87480-840-7}} (contains a chapter on the Mt. Pisgah hoax).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 20th of October, 1890, Robert Miller &quot;Bob&quot; Womack discovered a rich ore and the last great Colorado [[gold rush]] began. Thousands of prospectors flocked to the region, and before long [[Winfield Scott Stratton]] located the famous [[Stratton's Independence Mine and Mill|Independence lode]], one of the largest gold strikes in history. In three years, the population increased from five hundred to ten thousand.  Although $500 million worth of gold ore was dug from Cripple Creek, Womack died penniless on 10 August 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womacknet.com/features/bobwomack.html Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Womack of Colorado] by Joyce and Linda Womack.

In 1896, Cripple Creek suffered two disastrous fires. The first occurred on April 25, destroying half of the city, including much of the business district. Four days later, another fire destroyed much of the remaining half. The city was rebuilt in a period of a few months; most historic buildings today date back to 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/co-cripplecreek2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230228/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/co-cripplecreek2.html |archivedate=May 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}.

By 1900, Cripple Creek and its sister city, [[Victor, Colorado|Victor]], were substantial mining communities.

During the 1890s, many of the miners in the Cripple Creek area joined a miners' union, the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM). A [[Cripple Creek miners' strike of 1894|significant strike took place in 1894]], marking one of the few times in history that a sitting governor called out the [[Colorado National Guard|national guard]] to protect miners from [[anti-union violence]] by forces under the control of the mine owners. By 1903, the allegiance of the state government had shifted, and Governor [[James Hamilton Peabody|James Peabody]] sent the [[Colorado National Guard]] into Cripple Creek with the goal of destroying union power in the gold camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/colorado-governor-sends-militia-to-cripple-creek ''history.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; The WFM strike of 1903 and the governor's response precipitated the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], a struggle that took many lives.

Since the 1970s, the county has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) [[Zoning in the United States|zoning]] plan that requires developers to include [[affordable housing]] in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The goal is to create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more [[revenue]]. Montgomery County was one of the first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, but many other areas have since followed suit.

==Politics and government==
[[File:Montgomery County Courthouse, Maryland (January 2006).jpg|thumb|The former Montgomery County Courthouse in [[Rockville, Maryland]], in January 2006, which served as the county courthouse from 1931 to 1982. The building now houses a state district court after the county court was moved to the Montgomery County Judicial Center.]]

Montgomery County was granted a charter form of government in 1948.

The present [[County Executive]]/[[County Council]] form of government of Montgomery County dates to November 1968 when the voters changed the form of government from a [[County Commission]]/[[County manager (United States)|County Manager]] system, as provided in the original 1948 home rule Charter.

The [[Montgomery County Police Department (Maryland)|Montgomery County Police Department]] provides county-wide law enforcement services, although several cities including Rockville and Gaithersburg maintain their own police departments to complement MCPD.  Maryland State Police patrol Interstate highways 495 (the &quot;Beltway&quot;) and 270 and assist county and city police in investigation of some major crimes.

===County executives===
[[File:Montgomery County Judicial Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Montgomery County Judicial Center courthouse in Rockville, Maryland, in May 2010.]]
The office of the county executive was established in 1970. The first executive was James P. Gleason. The current executive is Marc Elrich, who was sworn in for his first term on December 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barrios |first1=Jennifer |title=Elrich promises change, 'more just society,' as he becomes Montgomery executive |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/marc-elrich-to-be-sworn-in-as-montgomery-county-executive/2018/12/02/eee584c8-ecde-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html |access-date=December 3, 2018 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=December 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204035446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/marc-elrich-to-be-sworn-in-as-montgomery-county-executive/2018/12/02/eee584c8-ecde-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html |archive-date=December 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

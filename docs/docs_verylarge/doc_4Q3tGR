===''The Red Badge of Courage'' (1951)===
Huston's next film, ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (1951 film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' (1951), was of a completely different subject: war and its effect on soldiers. While in the army during World War II, he became interested in [[Stephen Crane]]'s classic [[American Civil War]] novel of the same title.  For the starring role, Huston chose World War II hero [[Audie Murphy]] to play the young Union soldier who deserts his company out of fear, but later returns to fight alongside them. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was concerned that the movie seemed too antiwar for the postwar period. Without Huston's input, they cut down the running time of the film from eighty-eight minutes to sixty-nine, added narration, and deleted what Huston felt was a crucial scene.&lt;ref name=Morsberger/&gt;

The movie did poorly at the box office. Huston suggests that it was possibly because it &quot;brought war very close to home.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations with the Great Moviemakers of Hollywood's Golden Age'', New York. Alfred A. Knopf (2006), pp. 335–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Huston recalls that at the preview showing, before the film was halfway through, &quot;damn near a third of the audience got up and walked out of the theater.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; Despite the &quot;butchering&quot; and weak public response, film historian Michael Barson describes the movie as &quot;a minor masterpiece.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barson&gt;Barson, Michael. ''The Illustrated Who's Who of Hollywood Directors, Vol 1: The Sound Era'' Noonday Press (1995), pp. 208–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The African Queen'' (1951)===
[[File:The African Queen, Bogart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Humphrey Bogart in ''The African Queen'' (1951)]]
Before ''The Red Badge of Courage'' opened in theaters, Huston was already in Africa shooting ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), a story based on [[C. S. Forester]]'s popular novel. It starred [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in a combination of romance, comedy and adventure. Barson calls it &quot;one of the most popular Hollywood movies of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barson/&gt; The film's producer, [[Sam Spiegel]], urged Huston to change the ending to allow the protagonists to survive, instead of dying. Huston agreed, and the ending was rewritten. It became Huston's most successful film financially, and &quot;it remains one of his finest works.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morsberger/&gt; Huston was nominated for two Academy Awards—[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Bogart, meanwhile, won his only Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his role as Charlie Allnut.

Hepburn wrote about her experiences shooting the film in her memoir, ''The Making of the African Queen: Or How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall, and Huston and almost lost my mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn, Katharine.

=== House Committee on Un-American Activities period ===
In 1952 Huston moved to Ireland as a result of his &quot;disgust&quot; at the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; and the &quot;moral rot&quot; he felt was created by investigation and hearings by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC), which had affected many of his friends in the movie industry. Huston had, with friends including director [[William Wyler]] and screenwriter [[Philip Dunne (writer)|Philip Dunne]], established the &quot;Committee for the First Amendment&quot;, as a response to the ongoing government investigations into communists within the film industry. The HUAC was calling numerous filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors to testify about any past affiliations.&lt;ref name=Barson/&gt;

He later  described in general the types of people who were alleged communists:
{{quote|The people who did get caught up in it were, for the most part, well-intentioned boobs from a poor background. A number of them had come from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and out in Hollywood, they sort of felt guilty for living the good life. Their social conscience was more acute than the next fellow's.&lt;ref name=Playboy&gt;Grobel, Lawrence. &quot;Playboy Interview with John Huston&quot;, ''Playboy'' magazine, September 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Moby Dick'' (1956)===
Huston took producing, writing, and directing credits for his next two films: ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952); and ''[[Beat the Devil (film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953).  ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), however, was written by [[Ray Bradbury]], although Huston had his name added to the screenplay credit after the completion of the project.  Although Huston had personally hired Bradbury to adapt [[Herman Melville]]'s novel into a screenplay, Bradbury and Huston did not get along during pre-production. Bradbury later dramatized their relationship in the short story &quot;[[Banshee (short story)|Banshee]]. When this was adapted as an episode of ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]],'' [[Peter O'Toole]] played the role based on John Huston.&lt;ref&gt;''Ray Bradbury: An American Icon.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury wrote more poems, essays, and stories on his time in Ireland, but was reluctant to write a book because he did not want to gossip about Huston. It was not until after he read Katharine Hepburn's memoir, ''The Making of the African Queen,'' that he decided that he could write &quot;a book which is fair, which presents the Huston that I loved along with the one that I began to fear on occasion.&quot; He published ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a novel about his time in Ireland with Huston, almost 40 years after he wrote the screenplay for ''Moby Dick''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray. ''Green Shadows, White Whale.'' Harper Perennial, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huston had been planning to film [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' for the previous ten years, and originally thought the role would be an excellent part for his father, [[Walter Huston]]. After his father died in 1950, Huston chose [[Gregory Peck]] to play the starring role of Captain Ahab.  The movie was filmed over a three-year period on location in Ireland, where Huston was living. The fishing village of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] was recreated along the waterfront; the sailing ship in the film was fully constructed to be seaworthy; and three 100-foot whales were built out of steel, wood, and plastic.  But the film failed at the box office. Critics such as [[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]] suggested that the movie lacked the &quot;mysticism of the book&quot; and thereby &quot;loses its significance.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt;

===''The Misfits'' (1961)===
[[File:Marilyn Monroe Misfits.jpg|thumb|Marilyn Monroe (center), Clark Gable (right), filming in 1961 for ''The Misfits'']]
Of Huston's next five films, only ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), gained critical approval.&lt;ref name=Freer&gt;Freer, Ian. ''Moviemakers'' Quercus (2009), pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have since noted the &quot;retrospective atmosphere of doom&quot; which is associated with the film. [[Clark Gable]], the star, died of a heart attack a few weeks after the filming was completed; [[Marilyn Monroe]] never finished another film, and died a year later after being suspended during the filming of ''[[Something's Got to Give]]''; and costars [[Montgomery Clift]] (1966) and [[Thelma Ritter]] (1969) also died over the next decade. But two of the ''Misfits'' stars, [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], lived another 50 years. During the filming, Monroe was sometimes taking prescribed drugs, which led to her arriving late on the set. Monroe also sometimes forgot her lines. Monroe's personal problems eventually led to the breakup of her marriage to playwright [[Arthur Miller]], the scriptwriter, &quot;virtually on set.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; Miller dramatized the making of ''The Misfits'' in his final play, ''[[Finishing the Picture]]'', where Huston is represented as the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/11/theater/reviews/some-like-it-hot-some-like-it-painted-in-words.html | first=Ben | last=Brantley | title=Theater Review: Some Like It Hot, Some Like It Painted in Words | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huston later commented about this period in Monroe's career: &quot;Marilyn was on her way out. Not only of the picture, but of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

===''Freud: the Secret Passion'' (1962)===
He followed ''The Misfits'' with ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]'', a film quite different from most of his others. Besides directing, he also narrates portions of the story. Film historian [[Stuart M. Kaminsky]] notes that Huston presents [[Sigmund Freud]], played by [[Montgomery Clift]], &quot;as a kind of savior and messiah&quot;, with an &quot;almost Biblical detachment.&quot; As the film begins, Huston describes Freud as a &quot;kind of hero or God on a quest for mankind&quot;:&lt;ref name=Kaminsky&gt;Kaminsky, Stuart M. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers: Directors'' 3rd ed., St. James Press (1997), pp. 459–463.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the story of Freud's descent into a region as black as hell, man's unconscious, and how he let in the light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huston explains how he became interested in psychotherapy, the subject of the film:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I first got into that through an experience in a hospital during the war, where I made a documentary about patients suffering from battle neuroses. I was in the army and made the picture &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;. That experience started my interest in psychotherapy, and to this day Freud looms as the single huge figure in that field.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:El-set-mismaloya.jpg|thumb|Huston's ''Night of the Iguana'' set on Mismaloya Beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico]]

===''The Night of the Iguana'' (1964)===
For his next film, Huston again traveled to [[Puerto Vallarta]], Mexico, after meeting an architect, Guillermo Wulff, who owned property and businesses in the town. The filming took place in a beach cove called [[Mismaloya]], about thirty minutes south of town. Huston adapted [[The Night of the Iguana|the stage play]] by [[Tennessee Williams]].  The film stars [[Richard Burton]] and [[Ava Gardner]], and was nominated for several Academy Awards.  Production attracted intense worldwide media attention, due to Burton bringing his celebrity mistress, actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] (who was still married to singer [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] at the time) to Puerto Vallarta. Huston liked the town where filming took place so much that he bought a house near there, as did Burton and Taylor. Guillermo Wulff and Huston became friends and always spent time together while Huston was in town, more frequently at Wulff's El Dorado Restaurant on Los Muertos Beach.

===''The Bible: In the Beginning'' (1966)===
Producer [[Dino De Laurentis]] traveled to Ireland to ask Huston to direct ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning]]''. Although De Laurentis had ambitions for a broader story, he realized that the subject could not be adequately covered and limited the story to less than the first half of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Huston enjoyed directing the film, as it gave him a chance to indulge his love of animals. Besides directing he also played the role of [[Noah]] and the voice of God.  ''The Bible'' earned rentals of $15 million in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finler |first=Joel Waldo |year=2003 |title=The Hollywood Story |publisher=Wallflower Press |isbn=978-1-903364-66-6 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rvVhEJmbfrsC&amp;pg=PA358#v=twopage 358–359]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it [[1966 in film|the second highest-grossing film of 1966]]. However, because of its bloated budget of $18 million (which made it the most expensive movie of Huston's career&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt;), [[20th Century Fox]] ended up losing $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. and Neale, S.

Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huston enjoyed describing details about the filming:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every morning before beginning work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch her and she would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started to walk away from her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: &quot;Don't stop!&quot; I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.&lt;ref name=Huston/&gt;{{rp|317}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Involvement with the Irish film industry===
{{quote|I think the politicians who supported building the studio can take consolation in the fact that it's brought a lot of money to Ireland. We're spending more than a million dollars in Ireland and we wouldn't be here if it weren't for Ardmore.

While working on ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), Huston took interest in the Irish film industry, which had historically struggled to attain domestic or international success. There were rumours that he would buy Ireland's premiere film location, [[Ardmore Studios]] in Bray, County Wicklow. In 1967, Huston gave [[Taoiseach]] [[Jack Lynch]] a tour of Ardmore and asked to form a committee to help foster a productive Irish film industry. Huston served on the resulting committee with Irish filmmakers and journalists.&lt;ref name=Eireannach /&gt;

Lynch also ultimately agreed to offer tax breaks to foreign production companies if they shot on location in Ireland, and signed the Film Act of 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Irish Film: The Force is with us | work=[[Irish Independent]] | first=Joe | last=O'Shea | date=3 August 2014 | url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/movie-news/irish-film-the-force-is-with-us-30478303.html | access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huston was interviewed in Irish journalist [[Peter Lennon]]'s ''[[Rocky Road to Dublin (film)|Rocky Road to Dublin]]'' (1967), where he argued that it was more important for Irish filmmakers to make films in Ireland than for foreign production companies to make international films.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Peter. ''Rocky Road to Dublin''. Cinematography by Raoul Coutard, 17 May 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he shot ''[[Sinful Davey]]'' in Ireland using a mixed Irish and British cast.

===''Fat City'' (1972)===
After several films that were not well received, Huston returned to critical acclaim with ''[[Fat City (film)|Fat City]]''. Based on [[Leonard Gardner]]'s [[Fat City (novel)|1969 novel of the same name]], it was about an aging, washed-up alcoholic boxer in [[Stockton, California]] trying to get his name back on the map, while having a new relationship with a world-weary alcoholic. It also featured an [[Amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] trying to find success in boxing. The film was nominated for several awards. It starred [[Stacy Keach]], a young [[Jeff Bridges]], and [[Susan Tyrrell]]; she was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. [[Roger Ebert]] stated ''Fat City'' was one of Huston's best films, giving it four out of four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fat-city-1972 | title= Fat City :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews | date= January 1, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Man Who Would Be King'' (1975)===
Perhaps Huston's most highly regarded film of the 1970s, ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' was both a critical and commercial success.  Huston had been planning to make this film since the '50s, originally with his friends Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable. Eventually the lead roles went to [[Sean Connery]] and [[Michael Caine]]. The movie was filmed on location in North Africa. The film was praised for its use of old-fashioned escapism and entertainment. [[Steven Spielberg]] has cited the film as one of the inspirations for his film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.

===''Wise Blood'' (1979)===
After filming ''The Man Who Would Be King'', Huston took his longest break between directing films. He returned with an offbeat and somewhat controversial film based on the novel ''[[Wise Blood (film)|Wise Blood]]''. Here, Huston showed his skills as a storyteller, and boldness when it came to difficult subjects such as religion.

===''Under the Volcano'' (1984)===
[[Under the Volcano (film)|Huston's last film set in Mexico]] stars [[Albert Finney]] as an alcoholic ambassador during the beginnings of [[World War II]]. Adapted from the 1947 novel by [[Malcolm Lowry]], the film was highly praised by critics, most notably for Finney's portrayal of a desperate and depressed alcoholic. The film was a success on the independent circuit.

===''The Dead'' (1987)===
[[The Dead (1987 film)|John Huston's final film]] is an adaptation of the classic short story by [[James Joyce]]. This may have been one of Huston's most personal films, due to his citizenship in Ireland and his passion for classic literature. Huston directed most of the film from a wheelchair, as he needed an oxygen tank to breathe during the last few months of his life. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and was praised by critics. [[Roger Ebert]] eventually placed it in his Great Movies list; a section of movies he claimed to be some of the best ever made. Huston died nearly four months before the film's release date. In the 1996 [[RTÉ]] documentary ''John Huston: An t-Éireannach'', [[Anjelica Huston]] said that
&quot;it was very important for my father to make that film.&quot; She contends that Huston did not think that it was going to be his last film, but that it was his love letter to Ireland and the Irish.&lt;ref name= Eireannach /&gt;

==As an actor==
Earlier in his career, he had played bit parts in his own films, such as the unnamed rich American in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''. Towards the end of his career, Huston began to play more prominent roles in films by other directors.  In 1963, director [[Otto Preminger]] asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in ''[[The Cardinal]]'', and, writes author Philip Kemp, he &quot;virtually stole the picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role. He had a little participation (as did many others) in 1967's ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' as actor and director. He acted in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) as the film's master villain, and as President [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s secretary of state [[John Hay]] in ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]''. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously. &quot;It's a cinch,&quot; he once said, &quot;and they pay you damn near as much as you make directing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt;

Huston said he did not regard himself very highly as an actor, saying he was proud only of his performance in ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]].'' But he had also greatly enjoyed acting in ''[[Winter Kills (film)|Winter Kills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Robert Emmet ''John Huston: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers)'' (2001), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played the Lawgiver in ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]''.

Huston is famous to a generation of fans of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] stories as the voice of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] in the [[Rankin/Bass]] animated adaptations of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980).

Huston played the lead in [[Orson Welles]]'s last completed film ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]''.  In it he played an aging filmmaker named Jake Hannaford who was having great problems getting financing for his latest uncompleted film. Much of his portrayal was filmed in the spring of 1974 in [[Carefree, Arizona]], at Southwestern Studio and a nearby mansion. But due to political &lt;!--What were these?  --&gt;and financial complications, ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'' was not released until the fall of 2018.

==Movie themes==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I miss the order that old Hollywood had. It was much easier then to get a picture made than it is today. It's become a cliché that the studio people were picture makers then, but there is a large element of truth in it. They were people who wanted to make pictures, and they knew how to make them. They weren't accountants and bookkeepers, tax consultants and efficiency experts who don't know how to make pictures, or wheeler-dealers; that element just seems to have taken over today—promoters who just want to get a part of the action rather than people who want to make good movies.|source= —John Huston, ''Playboy'' interview, 1985&lt;ref&gt;Grobel, Lawrence. &quot;Playboy Interview with John Huston,&quot; ''Playboy'' magazine, September 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Huston's films were insightful about human nature and human predicaments. They also sometimes included scenes or brief dialogue passages that were remarkably prescient concerning environmental issues that came to public awareness in the future, in the period starting about 1970; examples include ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' and ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|The Night of the Iguana]]'' (1964). Huston spent long evenings carousing in the Nevada casinos after filming, surrounded by reporters and beautiful women, gambling, drinking, and smoking cigars.

According to Kaminsky, Huston's stories were often about &quot;failed quests&quot; by a group of different people. The group would persist in the face of poor odds, doomed at the outset by the circumstances created by an impossible situation.&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; However, some members of the doomed group usually survive, those who are &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot;, or someone who &quot;will sacrifice everything for self-understanding and independence&quot;. Those types of characters are exemplified by Bogart in ''The Maltese Falcon'', and Montgomery Clift in ''Freud.''

Another type of quest often seen in Huston's films involve a pair of potential lovers trying to face a hostile world.&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; Flint adds, however, that he &quot;bucked Hollywood's penchant for happy endings&quot;, and many of his stories ended with &quot;love unsatisfied&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

Film historian James Goodwin adds that in virtually all of his films, there is some type of &quot;heroic quest&amp;nbsp;– even if it involves questionable motives or destructive alliances&quot;. In addition, the quest &quot;is preferable to the spiritless, amoral routines of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=Morsberger/&gt; As a result, his best films, according to Flint, &quot;have lean, fast-paced scripts and vibrant plots and characterizations, and many of them deal ironically with vanity, avarice and unfulfilled quests&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

In the opinion of critics Tony Tracy and Roddy Flynn, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;what fundamentally fascinated Huston was not movies ''per se''&amp;nbsp;– that is, form&amp;nbsp;– but the human condition&amp;nbsp;... and literature offered a road map for exploring that condition.&quot; In many of his films, therefore, he tried to express his interest by developing themes involving some of the &quot;grand narratives&quot; of the twentieth century, such as &quot;faith, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, war and capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt;{{rp|3}}

To Jameson, all of Huston's films are adaptations, and he believes that through his films there was a &quot;cohesive world-view, not only thematically but also stylistically; there is the Huston look&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; The &quot;Huston look&quot; was also noted by screenwriter [[James Agee]], who adds that this &quot;look proceeds from Huston's sense of what is natural to the eye and his delicate, simple feeling for space relationships.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wakeman/&gt; In any case, notes Flint, Huston took &quot;uncommon care to preserve the writer's styles and values&amp;nbsp;... and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension&quot;, as he did in ''Red Badge of Courage,'' ''Moby Dick,'' and ''Under the Volcano.''&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

Religion is also a theme that runs through many of Huston's films. In ''The Night of the Iguana,'' Kaminsky notes how [[Richard Burton]], while preaching a sermon to his congregation, seems &quot;lost, confused, his speech is gibberish&quot;, and leads his congregation to turn away from him.  In other films, adds Kaminsky, religion is seen as &quot;part of the fantasy world&quot;, that the actors must overcome to survive physically or emotionally. &quot;These religious zealots counsel a move away from the pleasure of the world and human love, a world that Huston believes in,&quot; concludes Kaminsky.&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; Such religious themes were also seen in ''The Bible,'' and ''Wise Blood,'' for example.

To Barson, however, Huston was among the &quot;least consistent&quot; filmmakers, although he concludes that he was one of the &quot;most interesting directors of the past sixty years&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barson/&gt; Throughout his long career, many of his films did poorly and were criticized as a result. To a writer in 1972 he commented, &quot;Criticism isn't a new experience for me. Pictures that are now thought of as, forgive the term, classics, weren't all that well thought of at the time they came out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' magazine, August 4, 1972, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; After an interview a few years before he died, the reporter writes that &quot;Huston said he missed the major studio era when people savored making movies, not just money.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

According to [[Roger Ebert]], on his review of ''[[Fat City (film)|Fat City]]'', &quot;His fascination with underdogs and losers. The characters in Huston movies hardly ever set out to achieve what they're aiming for. Sam Spade, in ''The Maltese Falcon'', Huston's first film, ends up minus one partner and one woman he thought he could trust. Everyone is a loser in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', and the gold blows back into the dust and is lost in it. Ahab, in ''Moby Dick''. Marlon Brando's career Army officer in ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'', even Bogart and Hepburn in ''The African Queen'' – they all fall short of their plans. ''The African Queen'' does have a happy ending, but it feels tacked-on and ridiculous, and the Queen destroys itself in destroying the German steamer. So this ''[Fat City]'' is a theme we find in Huston's work, but rarely does he fit it to characters and a time and place so well as in ''Fat City''. Maybe that's because Huston knows the territory: he was a professional boxer himself for a while, and not a very good one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720101/REVIEWS/201010308/1023 Ebert, Roger].

(1989)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|495}}}}

[[George Stevens, Jr.]] notes that while many directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot:  &quot;I don't even know the editor of my films most of the time,&quot; Huston said.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; Actor [[Michael Caine]] also observed the same technique: &quot;Most directors don't know what they want so they shoot everything they can think of&amp;nbsp;— they use the camera like a machine gun. John uses it like a sniper.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; [[Danny Huston]] confirmed as much he recalled what Huston said to him as the then-youngster was fooling around with a [[Kodak]] Super 8: &quot;and I was shooting all these various things. He said, 'Stop it, stop doing that.' I said, 'What?' He said, 'When you go from left to right and right to left, what do you do?'  So I looked from left to right and right to left. I said, 'I give up. What do I do?' He said, 'You blink. That's a cut.'&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[https://entertainment.inquirer.net/99579/danny-huston-recounts-when-dad-john-was-god &quot;Danny Huston recounts when dad John was 'God'&quot;] by Ruben V.

Film writer Peter Flint pointed out other benefits to Huston's style: &quot;He shot economically, eschewing the many protective shots favored by timid directors, and edited cerebrally so that financial backers would have trouble trying to cut scenes.&quot; Huston shot most of his films on location, working &quot;intensely&quot; six days a week, and &quot;on Sundays, played equally intense poker with the cast and crew.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

When asked how he envisions his films while directing and what his goals are, Huston replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To me the ideal film&amp;nbsp;— which I've never succeeded in making&amp;nbsp;— would be as though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were projecting it yourself, seeing what you wish to see. This has a great deal in common with thought processes&amp;nbsp;... That's why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Kaminsky, much of Huston's vision probably came from his early experience as a painter on the streets of Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it for a year and a half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston's films &quot;reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; Huston explored the use of &quot;stylistic framing&quot;, especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, ''The Maltese Falcon'', for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, &quot;like canvases of paintings&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kaminsky/&gt; [[Anjelica Huston]] recalled that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards &quot;constantly... it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one... there was an extremely developed sensory quality about my father, he didn't miss a trick.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt;{{rp|20}}

To producer [[George Stevens, Jr.]], Huston symbolized &quot;intellect, charm and physical grace&quot; within the film industry. He adds, &quot;He was the most charismatic of the directors I knew, speaking with a soothing, melodic voice that was often mimicked, but was unique to him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

While driving on Sunset Boulevard on September 25, 1933, Huston struck and killed a pedestrian, a Brazilian dancer named Tosca Roulien. The resulting media frenzy forced Huston to retreat temporarily from public performance, and instead worked as a screenwriter. A subsequent inquest absolved Huston of any blame for the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=2011 |title=John Huston: Courage and Art |url=https://archive.org/details/johnhustoncourag0000meye |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Crown/Archetype |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnhustoncourag0000meye/page/40 40] |isbn=9780307590695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huston loved the outdoors, especially hunting while living in Ireland. Among his life's adventures before becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Besides sports and adventure, he enjoyed hard liquor and relationships with women. Stevens describes him as someone who &quot;lived life to its fullest&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; Barson even suggests that Huston's &quot;flamboyant life&quot; as a rebel would possibly make for &quot;an even more engaging tale than most of his movies&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barson/&gt;

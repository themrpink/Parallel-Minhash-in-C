'''Metamorphic rocks''' arise from the transformation of existing [[rock (geology)|rock]] types, in a process called [[metamorphism]], which means &quot;change in form&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/metamorphism?s=t Dictionary.com entry]. Retrieved 14 Jan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The original rock ([[protolith]]) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C) and pressure ({{convert|100|MPa|bar|lk=on}} or more), causing profound physical or chemical change. The protolith may be a [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[igneous rock|igneous]], or existing metamorphic rock.

Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]] and form 12% of the Earth's land surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Global geologic maps are tectonic speedometers – Rates of rock cycling from area-age frequencies | first1=Bruce H. | last1=Wilkinson | first2=Brandon J. | last2=McElroy | first3=Stephen E. | last3=Kesler | first4=Shanan E. | last4=Peters | first5=Edward D. | last5=Rothman | journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | year=2008 | volume=121 | issue=5–6 | pages=760–79 | doi=10.1130/B26457.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are classified by [[Rock microstructure|texture]] and by [[chemical]] and [[mineral]] assemblage ([[metamorphic facies]]). They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it. They can form from [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] processes such as continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion. They are also formed when rock is heated by the [[Intrusion (geology)|intrusion]] of hot molten rock called [[magma]] from the Earth's interior. The study of metamorphic rocks (now exposed at the Earth's surface following erosion and uplift) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the Earth's crust.
Some examples of metamorphic rocks are [[gneiss]], [[slate]], [[marble]], [[schist]], and [[quartzite]].

== Metamorphic minerals ==

Metamorphic minerals are those that form only at the high temperatures and pressures associated with the process of metamorphism. These minerals, known as [[index mineral]]s, include [[sillimanite]], [[kyanite]], [[staurolite]], [[andalusite]], and some [[garnet]].

Other minerals, such as [[olivine]]s, [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[mica]]s, [[feldspar]]s, and [[quartz]], may be found in metamorphic rocks, but are not necessarily the result of the process of metamorphism. These minerals formed during the [[crystallization]] of igneous rocks. They are stable at high temperatures and pressures and may remain chemically unchanged during the metamorphic process. However, all minerals are stable only within certain limits, and the presence of some minerals in metamorphic rocks indicates the approximate temperatures and pressures at which they formed.

The change in the particle size of the rock during the process of metamorphism is called [[Recrystallization (geology)|recrystallization]]. For instance, the small [[calcite]] crystals in the sedimentary rock [[limestone]] and [[chalk]] change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock [[marble]]; in metamorphosed sandstone, recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite, also known as metaquartzite, in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked. Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization. High temperatures allow the [[atom]]s and [[ion]]s in solid crystals to migrate, thus reorganizing the crystals, while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their point of contact.

== Foliation ==
[[Image:Migma ss 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|Folded foliation in a metamorphic rock from near [[Geirangerfjord]], [[Norway]]]]
{{main|Foliation (geology)}}
The layering within metamorphic rocks is called ''[[Foliation (geology)|foliation]]'' (derived from the [[Latin]] word ''folia'', meaning &quot;leaves&quot;), and it occurs when a rock is being shortened along one axis during  recrystallization. This causes the platy or elongated crystals of minerals, such as [[mica]] and [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], to become rotated such that their long axes are perpendicular to the orientation of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them.

Textures are separated into foliated and non-foliated categories. Foliated rock is a product of differential stress that deforms the rock in one plane, sometimes creating a plane of [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]]. For example, [[slate]] is a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from [[shale]]. Non-foliated rock does not have planar patterns of strain.

Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Where a rock has been subject to differential stress, the type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a [[mudstone]], the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: slate is a  very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism, while [[phyllite]] is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism, [[schist]] is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism, and [[gneiss]] coarse to very coarse-grained, found in areas of high-grade metamorphism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wicander &amp; Munroe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l7FfgRr1TwC&amp;q=shale+phyllite+slate+schist+mudrock+metamorphism&amp;pg=PA175 | title=Essentials of Geology | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wicander R. &amp; Munroe J. | year=2005 | pages=174–77 | isbn=978-0495013655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.

Another important mechanism of metamorphism is that of chemical reactions that occur between minerals without them melting. In the process atoms are exchanged between the minerals, and thus new minerals are formed. Many complex high-temperature reactions may take place, and each mineral assemblage produced provides us with a clue as to the temperatures and pressures at the time of metamorphism.

Metasomatism is the drastic change in the bulk chemical composition of a rock that often occurs during the processes of metamorphism. It is due to the introduction of chemicals from other surrounding rocks. Water may transport these chemicals rapidly over great distances. Because of the role played by water, metamorphic rocks generally contain many elements absent from the original rock, and lack some that originally were present. Still, the introduction of new chemicals is not necessary for recrystallization to occur.

== Types of metamorphism ==

===Contact metamorphism===
[[Image:Eozoon01.jpg|thumb|A contact metamorphic rock made of interlayered [[calcite]] and [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] from the [[Precambrian]] of Canada. Once thought to be a [[pseudofossil]] called ''[[Eozoön]] canadense''.  Scale in mm.]]
[[File:Rock contact metamorphism eng big text.jpg|thumbnail]]
'''Contact metamorphism''' is the name given to the changes that take place when magma is injected into the surrounding solid rock ([[country rock (geology)|country rock]]). The changes that occur are greatest wherever the magma comes into contact with the rock because the temperatures are highest at this boundary and decrease with distance from it. Around the igneous rock that forms from the cooling magma is a metamorphosed zone called a ''contact metamorphism aureole''. Aureoles may show all degrees of metamorphism from the contact area to unmetamorphosed (unchanged) country rock some distance away. The formation of important [[ore]] minerals may occur by the process of [[metasomatism]] at or near the contact zone.

When a rock is contact altered by an igneous intrusion it very frequently becomes more indurated, and more coarsely crystalline. Many altered rocks of this type were formerly called hornstones, and the term ''[[hornfels]]'' is often used by geologists to signify those
fine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. A [[shale]] may become a dark [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]] hornfels, full of tiny plates of brownish [[biotite]]; a [[marl]] or impure [[limestone]] may change to a grey, yellow or greenish lime-silicate-hornfels or siliceous [[marble]], tough and splintery, with abundant [[augite]], [[garnet]], [[wollastonite]] and other minerals in which [[calcite]] is an important component.  A [[diabase]] or [[andesite]] may become a diabase hornfels or andesite hornfels with development of new hornblende and biotite and a partial recrystallization of the original feldspar.  [[Chert]] or [[flint]] may become a finely crystalline quartz rock; [[sandstone]]s lose their [[clastic]] structure and are converted into a mosaic of small close-fitting grains of quartz&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in a metamorphic rock called [[quartzite]].

If the rock was originally banded or [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] (as, for example, a laminated sandstone or a foliated calc-[[schist]]) this character may not be obliterated, and a banded hornfels is the product; [[fossil]]s even may have their shapes preserved, though entirely recrystallized, and in many contact-altered [[lava]]s the [[Vesicular texture|vesicles]] are still visible, though their contents have usually entered into new combinations to form minerals that were not originally present.  The minute structures, however, disappear, often completely, if the thermal alteration is very profound. Thus small grains of quartz in a shale are lost or blend with the surrounding particles of clay, and the fine ground-mass of lavas is entirely reconstructed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

By recrystallization in this manner peculiar rocks of very distinct types are often produced.  Thus shales may pass into [[cordierite]] rocks, or may show large crystals of [[andalusite]] (and [[chiastolite]]), [[staurolite]], [[garnet]], [[kyanite]] and [[sillimanite]], all derived from the aluminous content of the original shale.  A considerable amount of [[mica]] (both muscovite and biotite) is often simultaneously formed, and the resulting product has a close resemblance to many kinds of schist.  Limestones, if pure, are often turned into coarsely crystalline marbles; but if there was an admixture
of clay or sand in the original rock such minerals as garnet, [[epidote]], [[idocrase]], wollastonite, will be present.  Sandstones when greatly heated may change into coarse quartzites composed of large clear grains of quartz.  These more intense stages of alteration are not
so commonly seen in igneous rocks, because their minerals, being formed at high temperatures, are not so easily transformed or recrystallized.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In a few cases rocks are fused and in the dark glassy product minute crystals of [[spinel]], sillimanite and [[cordierite]] may separate out.  Shales are occasionally thus altered by basalt [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], and feldspathic sandstones may be completely vitrified.  Similar changes may be induced in shales by the burning of [[coal]] seams or even by an ordinary furnace.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

There is also a tendency for [[metasomatism]] between the igneous magma and sedimentary country rock, whereby the chemicals in each are exchanged or introduced into the other.  Granites may absorb fragments of shale or pieces of basalt.  In that case, hybrid rocks called [[skarn]] arise, which don't have the characteristics of normal igneous or sedimentary rocks.  Sometimes an invading granite magma permeates the rocks around, filling their joints and planes of bedding, etc., with threads of quartz and feldspar. This is very exceptional but instances of it are known and it may take place on a large scale.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Petrology |volume=21 |page=332–33 |inline=1 |first=John Smith |last=Flett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional metamorphism===
[[Image:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]
[[File:Dynamo metamorf eng text.png|thumbnail|Dynamic metamorphism|272x272px]]
'''Regional metamorphism''', also known as '''dynamic metamorphism''', is the name given to changes in great masses of rock over a wide area. Rocks can be metamorphosed simply by being at great depths below the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure caused by the immense weight of the rock layers above. Much of the lower continental crust is metamorphic, except for recent igneous intrusions. Horizontal tectonic movements such as the collision of continents create [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]], and cause high temperatures, pressures and deformation in the rocks along these belts. If the metamorphosed rocks are later uplifted and exposed by [[erosion]], they may occur in long belts or other large areas at the surface. The process of metamorphism may have destroyed the original features that could have revealed the rock's previous history. [[Recrystallization (geology)|Recrystallization]] of the rock will destroy the textures and [[fossil]]s present in sedimentary rocks. Metasomatism will change the original composition.

Regional metamorphism tends to make the rock more indurated and at the same time to give it a foliated, shistose or gneissic texture, consisting of a planar arrangement of the minerals, so that platy or prismatic minerals like mica and hornblende have their longest axes arranged parallel to one another.  For that reason many of these rocks split readily in one direction along mica-bearing zones ([[schist]]s).  In [[gneiss]]es, minerals also tend to be segregated into bands; thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral.  Along the mineral layers composed of soft or fissile minerals the rocks will split most readily, and the freshly split specimens will appear to be faced or coated with this mineral; for example, a piece of mica schist looked at facewise might be supposed to consist entirely of shining scales of mica.  On the edge of the specimens, however, the white folia of granular quartz will be visible.  In gneisses these alternating folia are sometimes thicker and less regular than in schists, but most importantly less micaceous; they may be lenticular, dying out rapidly.  Gneisses also, as a rule, contain more feldspar than schists do, and are tougher and less fissile.  Contortion or crumbling of the foliation is by no means uncommon; splitting faces are undulose or puckered.  Schistosity and gneissic banding (the two main types of foliation) are formed by directed pressure at elevated temperature, and to interstitial movement, or internal flow arranging the mineral particles while they are crystallizing&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in that directed pressure field.

Rocks that were originally sedimentary and rocks that were undoubtedly igneous may be metamorphosed into schists and gneisses. If originally of similar composition they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A [[quartz-porphyry]], for example, and a fine feldspathic sandstone, may both be metamorphosed into a grey or pink mica-schist.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

== Metamorphic rock textures ==
The five basic metamorphic  textures with typical rock types are '''slaty''' (includes [[slate]] and [[phyllite]]; the foliation is called &quot;slaty cleavage&quot;), '''schistose''' (includes [[schist]]; the foliation is called &quot;schistosity&quot;), '''gneissose''' ([[gneiss]]; the foliation is called &quot;gneissosity&quot;), '''granoblastic''' (includes [[granulite]], some [[marble]]s and [[quartzite]]), and '''hornfelsic''' (includes [[hornfels]] and [[skarn]]).

The '''National Security Act of 1947''' was a law enacting major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following [[World War II]]. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed [[James Forrestal]] as the first [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/images/forrestal-letter.jpg |title=Letter from James Forrestal to Chan Gurney |date=March 4, 1947 |series=Committee on Armed Services, Records of the U.S. Senate |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act merged the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] (renamed as the [[Department of the Army]]) and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[National Military Establishment]] (NME), headed by the Secretary of Defense. It also created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]], which separated the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] into its own service.  It also protected the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an independent service, under the Department of the Navy. 

Aside from the military reorganization, the act established the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the U.S.'s first peacetime non-military [[intelligence agency]].

== History ==
The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following [[World War II]]. The act and its changes, along with the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]], were major components of the Truman administration's [[Cold War]] strategy. The bill signing took place aboard Truman's [[VC-54]]C presidential aircraft ''Sacred Cow'', the first aircraft used for the role of [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1845 Fact Sheets : National Security Act of 1947 : National Security Act of 1947&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114142445/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1845 |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmed [[James Forrestal]] as the first [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; His power was initially limited and it was difficult for him to exercise the authority to make his office effective. This was later changed in the amendment to the act in 1949, creating what was to be the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinnard, Douglas. &quot;The Secretary of Defense in Retrospect.&quot; The Secretary of Defense.

== Actions ==

=== Military ===
The Act merged the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] (renamed as the [[Department of the Army]]) and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[National Military Establishment]] (NME), headed by the Secretary of Defense. It also created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]], which separated the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] into its own service.  It also protected the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an independent service, under the Department of the Navy. Initially, each of the three service secretaries maintained quasi-cabinet status, but the act was amended on August 10, 1949, to ensure their subordination to the Secretary of Defense. At the same time, the NME was renamed as the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The purpose was to unify the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a federated structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1947&quot;&gt;Cambone, Stephen A. &quot;The National Security Act of 1947– 26 July 1947.&quot; A New Structure for National Security Policy Planning.

'''''Chondrus crispus'''''—commonly called '''Irish moss''' or '''carrageen moss''' ([[Irish language|Irish]] ''carraigín'', &quot;little rock&quot;)—is a species of [[red algae]]  which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. In its fresh condition this [[protist]] is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide [[carrageenan]], which constitutes 55% of its dry weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10% dry weight protein and about 15% dry weight [[mineral]] matter, and is rich in [[iodine]] and [[sulfur]]. When softened in [[water]] it has a [[sea]]-like odour and because of the abundant cell wall polysaccharides it will form a [[Gelatin|jelly]] when boiled, containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of [[water]].

== Description ==
''Chondrus crispus'' is a relatively small sea alga, reaching up to a little more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length. It grows from a discoid [[holdfast (biology)|holdfast]] and branches four or five times in a dichotomous, fan-like manner. The morphology is highly variable, especially the broadness of the thalli. The branches are 2–15&amp;nbsp;mm broad and firm in texture, and the color ranges from  light to dark green, dark red, purple,  brown, yellowish, and white. The [[gametophyte]]s (see below) often show a blue [[iridescence]] at the tip of the fronds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Chris J.|last2=Wilts|first2=Bodo D.|last3=Vignolini|first3=Silvia|last4=Brodie|first4=Juliet|last5=Steiner|first5=Ullrich|last6=Rudall|first6=Paula J.|last7=Glover|first7=Beverley J.|last8=Gregory|first8=Thomas|last9=Walker|first9=Rachel H.|title=Structural colour in Chondrus crispus|journal=Scientific Reports|date=3 July 2015|volume=5|pages=11645|doi=10.1038/srep11645|pmid=26139470|pmc=5155586|bibcode=2015NatSR...511645C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fertile sporophytes show a spotty pattern. ''[[Mastocarpus stellatus]]'' (Stackhouse) Guiry is a similar species which can be readily distinguished by its strongly channelled and often somewhat twisted thalli. The [[cystocarp]]ic plants of ''Mastocarpus'' show reproductive papillae{{clarify|date=February 2010}}&lt;!--The article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilla only connotes these as existing on animals. --&gt; quite distinctively different from ''Chondrus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon and Irvine 77&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=P.

Irish moss is frequently used with ''Mastocarpus stellatus'' (''Gigartina mamillosa''), ''Chondracanthus acicularis '' (''G. acicularis''), and other [[seaweed]]s, which are all commonly found growing together. [[Carragheen]] and [[agar-agar]] are also used in Asia for [[Gelatin dessert|gelatin-like desserts]], such as [[almond jelly]]. Presently, the major source of carrageenan is tropical seaweeds of the genera ''[[Kappaphycus]]'' and ''[[Eucheuma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bixler | first1 = H.

In [[Ireland]] and parts of [[Scotland]] (where it is also known as ''(An) Cairgean'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]), it is boiled in milk and strained, before sugar and other flavourings such as vanilla, cinnamon, brandy, or whiskey are added.&lt;ref&gt;Feum à Feamainn (DVD, Scottish Gaelic), [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]]&lt;/ref&gt; The end product is a kind of jelly similar to [[pannacotta]], [[tapioca]], or [[blancmange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/gaelic/grd/anaraineachd/lusan/lusanachladaich.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070615184122/http://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/gaelic/grd/anaraineachd/lusan/lusanachladaich.htm |archivedate=2007-06-15 }} '''Lusan a' Chladaich''' (Western Isles Council, Scottish Gaelic site)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], ''Gracilaria'' spp. are boiled with cinnamon and milk to make a thick drink called Irish moss that is believed to be an [[aphrodisiac]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia A Mitchell.

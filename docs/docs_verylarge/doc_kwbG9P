'''Neorealism''' or '''structural realism''' is a theory of [[international relations]] that says [[Power (international relations)|power]] is the most important factor in international relations. It was first outlined by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in his 1979 book ''[[Theory of International Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Sagan|2004|p={{Nowrap|91 n.4}}}}, Waltz's book remains &quot;the seminal text of neorealism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberalism]], neorealism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory for the last three decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powell 1994 313&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|1994|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Neorealism emerged from the North American discipline of [[political science]], and reformulates the classical [[Realism in international relations|realist]] tradition of [[E. H. Carr]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[George Kennan]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]. 

Neorealism is subdivided into [[defensive realism|defensive]] and [[offensive realism|offensive neorealism]].

==Origins==
Neorealism is an ideological departure from [[Hans Morgenthau]]'s writing on [[Classical realism (international relations)|classical realism]]. Classical realism originally explained the machinations of [[international politics]] as being based on [[human nature]], and therefore subject to the ego and emotion of world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Hans J. ''Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace'', 5th Edition, Revised. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978, pp. 4–15)&lt;/ref&gt; Neorealist thinkers instead propose that [[structural]] constraints—not strategy, egoism, or motivation—will determine behavior in international relations. [[John Mearsheimer]] made significant distinctions between his version of [[offensive neorealism]] and Morgenthau in his book titled ''[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=November 2018}}

==Theory==
Structural realism holds that the nature of the international structure is defined by its ordering principle (anarchy), units of the system (states), and by the distribution of capabilities (measured by the number of great powers within the international system), with only the last being considered an independent variable with any meaningful change over time. The anarchic ordering principle of the international structure is [[decentralized]], meaning there is no formal central [[authority]]; every sovereign state is formally equal in this system. These states act according to the logic of [[egoism]], meaning states seek their own interest and will not subordinate their interest to the interests of other states.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tragedy of Great Power Politics|last=Mearsheimer|first=John J.|publisher=Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0393020250|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofgreatpo00mear/page/3 3]|quote=Three features of the international system combine to cause states to fear one another: 1) The absence of a central authority that sits above states and can protect them from each other (anarchy), 2) the fact that states always have some offensive military capability, and 3) the fact that states can never be certain about other states' intentions. Given this fear - which can never be wholly eliminated - states recognize that the more powerful they are relative to their rivals, the better their chances of survival.|url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofgreatpo00mear/page/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States are assumed at a minimum to want to ensure their own survival as this is a prerequisite to pursue other goals. This driving force of survival is the primary factor influencing their behavior and in turn ensures states develop [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] [[military]] capabilities for [[foreign interventionism]] and as a means to increase their relative power. Because states can never be certain of other states' future intentions, there is a lack of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] between states which requires them to be on guard against relative losses of power which could enable other states to threaten their survival. This lack of trust, based on uncertainty, is called the [[security dilemma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

States are deemed similar in terms of needs but not in capabilities for achieving them. The positional placement of states in terms of abilities determines the distribution of capabilities. The structural distribution of capabilities then limits [[cooperation]] among states through fears of [[relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] made by other states, and the possibility of dependence on other states. The desire and relative abilities of each state to maximize relative power constrain each other, resulting in a '[[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]', which shapes international relations. It also gives rise to the '[[security dilemma]]' that all nations face. There are two ways in which states balance power: internal balancing and external balancing. Internal balancing occurs as states grow their own capabilities by increasing economic growth and/or increasing military spending. External balancing occurs as states enter into alliances to check the power of more powerful states or alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neorealists contend that there are essentially three possible systems according to changes in the distribution of capabilities, defined by the number of great powers within the international system. A [[unipolarity|unipolar system]] contains only one great power, a bipolar system contains two great powers, and a multipolar system contains more than two great powers. Neorealists conclude that a bipolar system is more stable (less prone to great power war and systemic change) than a multipolar system because balancing can only occur through internal balancing as there are no extra great powers with which to form alliances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 1979 132_133&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|1979|pp=132–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is only internal balancing in a bipolar system, rather than external balancing, there is less opportunity for miscalculations and therefore less chance of great power war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 1979 133&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|1979|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is a simplification and a theoretical ideal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys 2012&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Humphreys|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive realism===
{{main|Defensive realism}}
Structural realism has become divided into two branches, defensive and offensive realism, following the publication of Mearsheimer's 'The Tragedy of Great Power Politics' in 2001. Waltz's original formulation of neorealism is now sometimes called Defensive Realism, while Mearsheimer's modification of the theory is referred to as Offensive Realism. Both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete, but Defensive Realism posits that most states concentrate on maintaining their security (i.e. states are security maximizers), while Offensive Realism claims that all states seek to gain as much power as possible (i.e. states are power maximizers).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mearsheimer 2001&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mearsheimer|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offensive realism===
{{main|Offensive realism}}
Offensive realism, developed by Mearsheimer differs in the amount of power that states desire. Mearsheimer proposes that states maximize relative power ultimately aiming for regional hegemony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mearsheimer 2001&quot;/&gt;

==Scholarly debate==

===Within realist thought===
While neorealists agree that the structure of the international relations is the primary impetus in seeking security, there is disagreement among neorealist scholars as to whether states merely aim to survive or whether states want to maximize their relative power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mearsheimer|1995|p={{Nowrap|11 n.27}}, {{Nowrap|16 n.27}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mearsheimer 2001&quot;/&gt; The former represents the ideas of [[Kenneth Waltz]], while the latter represents the ideas of [[John Mearsheimer]] and offensive realism.
Other debates include the extent to which states balance against power (in Waltz's original neorealism and classic realism), versus the extent to which states balance against threats (as introduced in Stephen Walt's 'The Origins of Alliances' (1987)), or balance against competing interests (as introduced in Randall Schweller's 'Deadly Imbalances' (1998)).

===With other schools of thought===
Neorealists conclude that because war is an effect of the anarchic structure of the [[international relations|international system]], it is likely to continue in the future. Indeed, neorealists often argue that the ordering principle of the international system has not fundamentally changed from the time of [[Thucydides]] to the advent of [[nuclear warfare]]. The view that long-lasting [[peace]] is not likely to be achieved is described by other theorists as a largely pessimistic view of [[international relations]]. One of the main challenges to neorealist theory is the [[democratic peace theory]] and supporting research, such as the book ''[[Never at War]]''. Neorealists answer this challenge by arguing that democratic peace theorists tend to pick and choose the definition of [[democracy]] to achieve the desired empirical result. For example, the Germany of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Dominican Republic]] of [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], and the [[Chile]] of [[Salvador Allende]] are not considered to be &quot;democracies of the right kind&quot; or the conflicts do not qualify as wars according to these theorists. Furthermore, they claim several wars between democratic states have been averted only by causes other than ones covered by democratic peace theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 2001 5_41&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2001|pp=5–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of democratic peace theory see the spreading of democracy as helping to mitigate the effects of [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 2000 4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2000|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With enough democracies in the world, [[Bruce Russett]] thinks that it &quot;may be possible in part to supersede the 'realist' principles (anarchy, the security dilemma of states) that have dominated practice {{Nowrap|...}} since at least the seventeenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russett 1993 24&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Russett|1993|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mueller]] believes that it is not the spreading of democracy but rather other conditions (e.g., power) that bring about democracy and peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 2000 9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2000|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In consenting with Mueller's argument, Kenneth Waltz notes that &quot;some of the major democracies—Britain in the nineteenth century and the United States in the twentieth century—have been among the most powerful states of their eras.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waltz 2000 9&quot;/&gt;

One of the most notable schools contending with neorealist thought, aside from neoliberalism, is the [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist]] school, which is often seen to disagree with the neorealist focus on power and instead emphasises a focus on ideas and identity as an explanatory point for international relations trends. Recently, however, a school of thought called the English School merges neo-realist tradition with the constructivist technique of analyzing social norms to provide an increasing scope of analysis for International Relations.

__NOTOC__
Year '''2 BC''' was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] or [[Common year starting on Friday|Friday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[common year starting on Wednesday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Augustus]] and [[Marcus Plautius Silvanus|Silvanus]]''' (or, less frequently, '''year 752 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 2 BC for this year has been used since the early [[medieval period]], when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

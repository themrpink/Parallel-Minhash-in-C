In [[grammar]], the '''inessive case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ine'''}}; from Latin ''inesse'' &quot;to be in or at&quot;) is a [[locative case|locative]] [[grammatical case]].  This case carries the basic meaning of &quot;in&quot;: for example, &quot;in the house&quot; is &quot;talo·ssa&quot; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], &quot;maja·s&quot; in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], &quot;куд·са&quot; (kud·sa) in [[Moksha language|Moksha]], &quot;etxea·n&quot; in [[Basque language|Basque]], &quot;nam·e&quot; in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], &quot;sāt·ā&quot; in [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and &quot;ház·ban&quot; in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

In Finnish the inessive case is typically formed by adding &quot;ssa/ssä&quot;.  Estonian adds &quot;s&quot; to the genitive stem. In Moksha, &quot;са&quot; (sa) is added.  In Hungarian, the [[Affix|suffix]] &quot;ban/ben&quot; is most commonly used for inessive case, although many others, such as &quot;on/en/ön&quot; and others are also used, especially with [[cities]].

In the Finnish language, the inessive case is considered the first (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] the second) of the six locative cases, which correspond to [[wikt:locational|locational]]  [[preposition]]s in [[English (language)|English]].  The remaining five cases are:
{{Wiktionary|inessive case}}
* [[Elative case]] (&quot;out of&quot;)
* [[Illative case]] (&quot;into&quot;)
* [[Allative case]] (&quot;onto&quot;)
* [[Adessive case]] (&quot;on&quot;)
* [[Ablative case]] (&quot;from&quot;)

==Finnish==

The Finnish inessive uses the suffix -ssa or -ssä (depending on [[vowel harmony]]). It is usually added to nouns and associated adjectives.

It is used in the following ways:

* Expressing the static state of being in something.
::asumme Suome'''ssa''' = ''we live in Finland''

* (with time expressions) stating how long something took to be accomplished or done
:possible English translations include ''in, within''
::kahde'''ssa''' vuode'''ssa''' = ''within 2 years, during 2 years''

* when two things are closely connected
:English translations can include ''on'' in phrases of this type
::Katja Lehtinen puhelime'''ssa''' = ''Katja Lehtinen on the phone''
::sormus on sorme'''ssa'''ni = ''the ring is on my finger''

*as an existensial clause with the verb ''olla'' (to be), to express possession of objects
::sanomalehde'''ssä''' on 68 sivua = ''the newspaper has 68 pages''

*with the verb ''käydä'', ''vierailla''
::minä käyn baari'''ssa''' = ''I visit the bar''

{{Other uses|Elative (disambiguation){{!}}Elative}}

In [[grammar]], the '''elative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ela'''}}; from Latin ''efferre'' &quot;to bring or carry out&quot;) is a [[Locative case|locative]] [[grammatical case]] with the basic{{huh|date=February 2016}} meaning &quot;out of&quot;.
==Usage==
===Uralic languages===
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the elative is typically formed by adding &quot;[[wikt: -sta|sta/stä]]&quot;, in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] by adding &quot;[[wikt:-st|-st]]&quot; to the genitive stem and &quot;-õst&quot; in [[Livonian language|Livonian]]. In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the suffix &quot;[[wikt: -ból|-ból/-ből]]&quot; expresses the elative:

&quot;talosta&quot; - &quot;out of the house, from the house&quot; (Finnish &quot;talo&quot; = &quot;house&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;majast&quot; - &quot;out of the house, from the house&quot; (Estonian &quot;maja&quot; = &quot;house&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;házból&quot; - &quot;out of the house&quot; (Hungarian &quot;ház&quot; = &quot;house&quot;)

In some [[dialect]]s of [[colloquial Finnish]] it is common to drop the final [[vowel]] of the elative ending, which then becomes identical to the elative [[morpheme]] of Estonian; for example: &quot;''talost''&quot;.

===Russian===
In some rare cases the elative still exists in contemporary Russian, though it was used more widely in 17-18th cc. texts: и́з лес'''у''' (out of the forest), кровь и́з нос'''у''' (blood from the nose), из Яросла́вл'''ю''' (from Yaroslavl).

Other locative cases are:
*[[Inessive case]] (&quot;in&quot;)
*[[Illative case]] (&quot;into&quot;)
*[[Adessive case]] (&quot;on&quot;)
*[[Allative case]] (&quot;onto&quot;)
*[[Ablative case]] (&quot;off&quot;)
*[[Delative case]] (&quot;off of a surface&quot;)

In [[grammar]], the '''illative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ill'''}}; from Latin ''illatus'' &quot;brought in&quot;) is a [[grammatical case]] used in the [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]],  and [[Hungarian language]]s. It is one of the [[locative case|locative]] cases, and has the basic meaning of &quot;into (the inside of)&quot;. An example from Hungarian is &quot;a házba&quot; (into the house, with &quot;a ház&quot; meaning &quot;the house&quot;). An example from Estonian is &quot;majasse&quot; and &quot;majja&quot; (into the house), formed from &quot;maja&quot; (a house). An example from Finnish is &quot;taloon&quot; (into the house), formed from &quot;talo&quot; (a house). An example from Lithuanian is &quot;laivan&quot; (into the boat) formed from &quot;laivas&quot; (boat).

==In Finnish==
The case is formed by adding ''-hVn'', where 'V' represents the last vowel, and then removing the 'h' if a simple [[long vowel]] would result. For example, ''talo + Vn'' becomes ''taloon'' with a simple long 'oo'; cf. ''maa + hVn'' becomes ''maahan'', without the elision of 'h'. This unusually complex way of adding a suffix can be explained by its reconstructed origin: a [[voiced palatal fricative]]. (Modern Finnish has lost [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] and [[fricative]]s other than 'h' or 's'.) In the dialect of [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Pohjanmaa]], the 'h' is not removed; one says ''talohon''.

The other locative cases in Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are:
*[[Inessive case]] (&quot;in&quot;)
*[[Elative case]] (&quot;out of&quot;)
*[[Adessive case]] (&quot;on&quot;)
*[[Allative case]] (&quot;onto&quot;)
*[[Ablative case]] (&quot;from&quot;)

==In Lithuanian==
The illative case, denoting direction of movement, is now less common in the standard language but is common in the spoken language, especially in certain dialects. Its singular form, heard more often than the plural, appears in books, newspapers, etc. Most Lithuanian nouns can take the illative ending, indicating that from the descriptive point of view the illative still can be treated as a case in Lithuanian. Since the beginning of the 20th century it isn't included in the lists of standard Lithuanian cases in most grammar books and textbooks, and the prepositional construction į+[[Accusative case|accusative]] is more frequently used today to denote direction. The illative case was used extensively in older Lithuanian; the first Lithuanian grammar book, by [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], mentions both illative and į+accusative but calls the usage of the illative &quot;more elegant&quot;. Later, it has often appeared in the written texts of the authors who grew up in [[Dzukija]] or Eastern [[Aukštaitija]], such as [[Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius]].

The illative case in Lithuanian has its own [[ending (linguistics)|ending]]s, which are different for each declension paradigm, although quite regular, compared with some other Lithuanian cases. An ending of the illative always ends with ''n'' in the singular, and ''sna'' is the final part of an ending of the illative in the plural.

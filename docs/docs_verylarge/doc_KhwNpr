'''Hapi''', sometimes transliterated as '''Hapy''', is one of the [[Four sons of Horus]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]], depicted in funerary literature as protecting the throne of [[Osiris]] in the Underworld. Hapi was the son of [[Heru-ur]] and [[Isis]] or [[Serqet]]. He is not to be confused with [[Hapi (Nile god)|another god of the same name]]. He is commonly depicted with the head of a [[hamadryas baboon]], and is tasked with protecting the lungs of the deceased, hence the common depiction of a hamadryas baboon head sculpted as the lid of the [[canopic jar]] that held the lungs. Hapi is in turn protected by the goddess [[Nephthys]].&lt;ref&gt;David B. O'Connor, Eric H. Cline, ''Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign'', University of Michigan Press 1998, {{ISBN|0-472-08833-5}}, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; When his image appears on the side of a coffin, he is usually aligned with the side intended to face north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 88&quot;&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. &lt;cite&gt;The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. p.88 Thames &amp; Hudson. 2003. {{ISBN|0-500-05120-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When embalming practices changed during the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] and the mummified organs were placed back inside the body, an amulet of Hapi would be included in the body cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 88&quot;/&gt;

Since drowning was the form of death associated with the lungs, the deity gained the name geese, in reference to floating on water. The spelling of his name includes a [[hieroglyph]] which is thought to be connected with steering a boat, although its exact nature is not known.  For this reason he was sometimes connected with navigation, although early references call him the great runner, as below from Spell 521 of the [[Coffin Texts]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are the great runner; come, that you may join up my father N and not be far in this your name of Hapi, for you are the greatest of my children – so says Horus&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Oliver Faulkner, &lt;cite&gt;The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts&lt;/cite&gt;, p.521. David Brown Book Company 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Spell 151 of the [[Book of the Dead]] he is given the following words to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have come that I may be your protection, O N; I have knit together your head and your members, I have smitten your enemies beneath you, and I have given you your head forever.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Oliver Faulkner, &lt;cite&gt;The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts&lt;/cite&gt;, David Brown Book Company 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As one of the four pillars of Shu and one of the four rudders of heaven he was associated with the North, and is specifically referenced as such in Spell 148 in the Book of the Dead.

{{History of printing}}
'''Movable type''' (US English; '''moveable type''' in British English) is the system and [[technology]] of [[printing]] and [[typography]] that uses movable [[Sort (typesetting)|components]] to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual [[alphanumeric characters]] or [[punctuation marks]]) usually on the medium of [[paper]].

The world's first movable type printing technology for printing [[paper]] [[books]] was made of [[porcelain]] materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] by the inventor [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051).&lt;ref name=&quot;needhamb&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Needham |first = Joseph |title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4 |year = 1994 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |page = 14 |isbn = 9780521329958 |quote = Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant book printed with movable metal type, [[Jikji]], was printed in [[Korea]] in 1377 during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

The diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia. The development of the printing press in Europe may have been influenced by various sporadic reports of movable type technology brought back to Europe by returning business people and missionaries to China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frances&amp;Joseph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Franklin Carter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot;/&gt; Some of these [[medieval European]] accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] and [[Bodleian Library|Oxford University]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = Zhou | year = 1994 | title = Diffusion of Movable Type in China and Europe: Why Were There Two Fates? | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–173 | doi = 10.1177/001654929405300301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the metal movable-type [[printing press]] in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]] and [[hand mould]]. The small number of [[alphabet]]ic characters needed for European languages was an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]]—and these materials remained standard for 550 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|477017|Printing (publishing)}} Retrieved&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[alphabetic script]]s, movable-type [[page setting]] was quicker than [[woodblock printing]]. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of [[printing presses]] spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, Elizabeth L., ''The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and due to its effectiveness, its [[Global spread of the printing press|use spread around the globe]].

The 19th-century invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.

== Precursors to movable type ==
=== Letter punch and coins ===
[[File:Tetradrachm 5th century BC athens detail.jpg|right|thumb|Movable type traces its origins to the punches used to make [[coin]]s: the reverse face of a [[Tetradrachm]] [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greek coin]] from [[Athens]], 5th century BC, featuring various letters and the owl symbol of [[Athena]].]]

The technique of imprinting multiple copies of [[symbol]]s or [[glyph]]s with a master ''type'' punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in [[Sumer|ancient Sumer]]. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. [[Cylinder seal]]s were used in [[Mesopotamia]] to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clair&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clair|first1=Kate|last2=Busic-Snyder|first2=Cynthia |title=A Typographic Workbook: A Primer to History, Techniques, and Artistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf0iDYCr6w0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-39988-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to &quot;sign&quot; documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'') on wax or clay—a miniature forerunner of [[rotogravure|rotogravure printing]] used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto [[coin]]s and [[token coin|tokens]].

The [[graphic design|designs]] of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiwork—salient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ''ad infinitum''. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with [[ink]] on [[paper]], but &quot;published&quot; in metal—a more durable medium—and survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

=== Seals and stamps ===

[[File:PhaistosDiskLarge.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of the [[Phaistos Disc]]]]

Seals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the [[Mesopotamia]]n cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]], dating from the [[2nd millennium BC]], has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.&lt;ref name=&quot;brickstamps&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sass|first=Benjamin|last2=Marzahn|first2=Joachim |title=Aramaic and Figural Stamp Impressions on Bricks of the Sixth Century B.C. from Babylon|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06184-1|pages=11, 20, 160|quote=&quot;the latter has cuneiform signs that look as if made with a movable type, and impressions from Assur display the same phenomenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enigmatic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Phaistos Disc of c. 1800–1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic &quot;seals&quot; into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert E. Brekle&quot;&gt;Herbert E. Brekle, &quot;Das typographische Prinzip&quot;, ''Gutenberg-Jahrbuch'', Vol. 72 (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;58–63 (60f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes |first = C. Michael |last=Hogan |title=Knossos Fieldnotes |website=The Modern Antiquarian |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] is a medieval example of movable type stamps being used.

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, an early woodblock-printed book, AD 868 ([[British Museum]])]]

Following the invention of [[paper]] during the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]], writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172–178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, did sealing print and [[monotype]] appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.

[[Woodblock printing]], invented by about the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]], worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the [[Song Dynasty]], woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.

=== Ceramic movable type ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇/畢昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Man&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Man |first=John |title=The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world |year=2002 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-0-7472-4504-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gutenbergrevolut0000manj }} A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

{{quote|When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.

If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsien&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Tsien |first = Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |title = Paper and Printing |volume = vol. 5 part 1 |series = Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China'' |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1985 |isbn = 978-0-521-08690-5 |pages = 201–217}}; also published in Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1193, [[Zhou Bida]], an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂雜記》).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yinong&quot;&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐憶農《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were &quot;fragile&quot; and &quot;not practical for large-scale printing&quot; and &quot;short lived&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=Pow-Key |title=Early Korean Printing |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=96–103 |jstor=595851 |doi=10.2307/595851}}&lt;/ref&gt; was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775–1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was &quot;as hard and tough as horn&quot;; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn. But similar to metal type, ceramic type did not hold Chinese ink well, and had an added disadvantage of uneven matching of the type which could sometimes result from the uneven changes in size of the type during the baking process.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Civilization'', volume 5 part 1, Joseph Needham, 1985, Cambridge University Press, page 221. {{ISBN|0 521 08690 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yinong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jixing&quot;&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

=== Wooden movable type ===


[[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) of [[Song dynasty]] also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = Dream Pool Essays|title-link = Dream Pool Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德縣志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore down the character faces, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Man&quot; /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Man&quot; /&gt; In 1322, a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (馬称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooden movable types and printed the 43-volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大學衍義》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版叢書》) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], and completed in one year.

====Evangelization====
Pope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to [[Eastern Africa]] beginning in 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the [[White Fathers|White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)]] came to Uganda and others went to Tanganyika (present day Tanzania) and Rwanda.
In 1887, he approved the foundation of [[Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo]], which were organized by the [[Bishop of Piacenza]], [[Giovanni Battista Scalabrini]]. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.

===Theology===
{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}
[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Benno |last=Kühne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}
The pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869–1870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after he allegedly had a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,&lt;ref name=queen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885, he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506&lt;/ref&gt; He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomism====
As pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (&quot;Eternal Father&quot;), which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism, the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas – as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.

Pope Leo XIII then created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe,'' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]. Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.

====Consecrations====
[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sister]] from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863–1899 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he had received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899), he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.

The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and countries had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, the consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.

====Scriptures====
In his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out 50 years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====
Pope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches and stated that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed that in his encyclical &quot;Orientalium Dignitas&quot; of 1894 and wrote, &quot;The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.&quot;

====Theological research====
[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]
Leo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a 20-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mariology====
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}
His predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of his dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in 11 encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]] because he promulgated Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the 50th anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity and calls her [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]]. While allowing the title &quot;Mediatrix&quot;, recent popes, following on the Second Vatican Council, have warned away from the term &quot;co-redemptrix&quot; as derogating from the one mediator, Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frederick William Faber|url=http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BfwCAAAAQAAJ|title=The foot of the Cross; or, The sorrows of Mary|date=1858|publisher=Thomas Richardson and Son|isbn=|location=|pages=448|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Co-Redemptrix as Dogma? : University of Dayton, Ohio|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/co-redemptrix-as-dogma.php|access-date=2020-07-07|website=udayton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Pope Francis on &quot;Co-Redemptrix&quot;|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/12/pope-calls-idea-of-declaring-mary-co-redemptrix-foolishness/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-07|website=cruxnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social teachings====
{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}

=====Church and state=====
Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, but he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it &quot;is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man.&quot; Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====''Rerum novarum''=====
[[File:Charles M. Johnson, Pope Leo XIII, 1899, NGA 86079.jpg|thumb|Charles M. Johnson, ''Pope Leo XIII'', 1899, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]
[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1900]]
His encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities; the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', for the first time, addressed social inequality and social justice issues with papal authority by focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]]'s ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', the [[social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]]'s ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]]'s ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum,'' and [[Pope Francis]]' ''[[Laudato si']]'' on the use of the goods of creation.

Leo had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought. (See [[list of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].)

===Audiences===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of 57 years of service in the Vatican (1901–1958).]]
One of the first audiences that Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him the young seminarian Giacomo Della Chiesa, the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.

On a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Thérèse of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told that it would prolong the audience too much, she wrote in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, &quot;Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you. In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!&quot; Leo XIII answered, &quot;Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.&quot; Thérèse replied, &quot;Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!&quot; Finally, the Pope said, &quot;Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''&quot; [italics hers]. Two guards lifted her (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door, where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.

==Death==
[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]
Leo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,&lt;ref&gt;John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; the second longest-lived pope ever behind [[Pope Benedict XVI]] ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest reigning pope (25 years), exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, Pius IX (31 years).

[[Charles A. Finn]], a priest of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] and at his own death the oldest priest in the United States, served as a Mass officer at his funeral.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/03/08/Monsignor-Charles-A-Finn-the-oldest-Roman-Catholic-priest/8775384411600/ |title=Monsignor Charles A. Finn, the oldest Roman Catholic priest... |date=8 March 1982 |accessdate=30 January 2019 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo XIII was entombed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] only very briefly after his funeral, but was later moved instead to the very ancient [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924.

The '''Scyphozoa''' are an exclusively marine class of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescyphozoan.ucmerced.edu/|title=The Scyphozoan|last=Dawson|first=Michael N|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the '''true [[jellyfish]]''' (or &quot;true jellies&quot;). It may include the extinct fossil group the [[Conulariida]], whose affinities are uncertain and widely debated.

The class name Scyphozoa comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[skyphos]]'' (σκύφος), denoting a kind of drinking cup and alluding to the cup shape of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Towle |first1=Albert |title=Modern biology |date=1989 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0030139192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scyphozoans have existed from the earliest [[Cambrian]] to the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

==Biology== 
Most species of Scyphozoa have two life-history phases, including the planktonic [[medusa (biology)|medusa]] or [[jellyfish]] form, which is most evident in the warm summer months, and an inconspicuous, but longer-lived, bottom-dwelling polyp, which seasonally gives rise to new medusae. Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramp1961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P. L.|year=1961|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|volume=40|pages=1–469|doi=10.1017/s0025315400007347}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically range from {{convert|2|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} in diameter, but the largest species, ''[[Cyanea capillata]]'' can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|0}} across. Scyphomedusae are found throughout the world's oceans, from the surface to great depths; no Scyphozoa occur in freshwater (or on land).

As medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called [[nematocysts]]. The nematocysts are located throughout the tentacles that radiate downward from the edge of the umbrella dome, and also cover the four or eight oral arms that hang down from the central mouth. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain [[plankton]] from the water.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 139–149|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
Scyphozoans usually display a four-part symmetry and have an internal gelatinous material called [[mesoglea]], which provides the same structural integrity as a skeleton. The mesoglea includes mobile amoeboid cells originating from the epidermis.

Scyphozoans have no durable hard parts, including no head, no skeleton, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, P., Halgedahl, S.L., Hendriks, J.R., Jarrad, R.D., Marques, A.C., Collins, A.G., and Lieberman, B.S., 2007, [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001121 Exceptionally preserved jellyfishes from the Middle Cambrian]. PLOSONE Issue 10: e1121, p.1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H.G., 1947, Preservation of fossil jellyfish: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, v. 58, p. 1221.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine jellyfish can consist of as much as 98% water, so are rarely found in fossil form.

Unlike the [[hydrozoan]] jellyfish, Hydromedusae, Scyphomedusae lack a vellum, which is a circular membrane beneath the umbrella that helps propel the (usually smaller) Hydromedusae through the water. However, a ring of muscle fibres is present within the mesoglea around the rim of the dome, and the jellyfish swims by alternately contracting and relaxing these muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M., and Fautin, D., 2001, Animal Diversity Web: University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, &quot;[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Scyphozoa.html Scyphozoa]., Accessed: September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The periodic contracting and relaxing propels the jellyfish through the water, allowing it to escape predation or catch its prey.

The mouth opens into a central stomach, from which four interconnected [[diverticulum|diverticula]] radiate outwards. In many species, this is further elaborated by a system of radial canals, with or without an additional ring canal towards the edge of the dome. Some genera, such as ''[[Cassiopea]]'', even have additional, smaller mouths in the oral arms. The lining of the digestive system includes further stinging nematocysts, along with cells that secrete [[digestive enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The nervous system usually consists of a distributed net of cells, although some species possess more organised nerve rings. In species lacking nerve rings, the nerve cells are instead concentrated into small structures called ''[[rhopalia]]''. There are between four and sixteen of these small lobes arranged around the rim of the umbrella, where they coordinate the muscular action allowing the animal to move. Each rhopalium is typically associated with a pair of sensory pits, a [[statocyst]], and sometimes a pigment-cup [[ocellus]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg|thumb|right|The developmental stages of [[scyphozoan]] jellyfish's life cycle:&lt;br&gt;'''1–3''' Larva searches for site&lt;br&gt;'''4–8''' Polyp grows&lt;br&gt;'''9–11''' Polyp [[strobilation|strobilates]]&lt;br&gt;'''12–14''' Medusa grows|alt=Illustration of two life stages of seven jelly species]]
Most species appear to be [[gonochorists]], with separate male and female individuals. The [[gonad]]s are located in the stomach lining, and the mature [[gamete]]s are expelled through the mouth. After fertilization, some species brood their young in pouches on the oral arms, but they are more commonly planktonic.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

===Growth and development===
The fertilized egg produces a [[planula]]r larva which, in most species, quickly attaches itself to the sea bottom. The larva develops into the hydroid stage of the lifecycle, a tiny sessile polyp called a scyphistoma. The scyphistoma reproduces asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either transforming into a medusa, or budding several medusae off from its upper surface via a process called [[strobilation]]. The medusae are initially microscopic and may take years to reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

==Commercial importance==
Scyphozoa include the moon jelly ''[[Aurelia aurita]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17486542&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berking S, Herrmann K |title=Compartments in Scyphozoa |journal=Int. J. Dev. Biol. |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=221–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17486542 |doi=10.1387/ijdb.062215sb |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the order Semaeostomeae, and the enormous ''[[Nemopilema nomurai]]'', in the order Rhizostomeae, found between Japan and China and which in some years causes major fisheries disruptions.

The jellyfish fished commercially for food are Scyphomedusae in the order [[Rhizostomeae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1011879821323|last=Omori|first=Makoto|author2=Eiji Nakano |year=2001|title=Jellyfish fisheries in southeast Asia|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=451|issue=1/3|pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most rhizostome jellyfish live in warm water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramp1961&quot; /&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Although the Scyphozoa were formerly considered to include the animals now referred to as the classes [[Cubozoa]] and [[Staurozoa]], they now include just three [[Extant taxon|extant]] orders (two of which are in Discomedusae, a subclass of Scyphozoa).&lt;ref name=Daly&gt;Daly, Brugler, Cartwright, Collins, Dawson, Fautin, France, McFadden, Opresko, Rodriguez, Romano &amp; Stake (2007). ''[http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p182.pdf The phylum Cnidaria: A review of phylogenetic patterns and diversity 300 years after Linnaeus.]'' Zootaxa 1668: 127–182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WoRMS&gt;{{WoRMS |id=135220 |title=Scyphozoa |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 extant species are recognized at present, but the true diversity is likely to be at least 400 species.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt;

In 1866 the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] gave Italy the opportunity, as an ally of [[Prussia]], to take [[Veneto]], and Padua was also annexed to the recently formed [[Kingdom of Italy]].

===Italian rule===
Annexed to [[Italy]] during 1866, Padua was at the centre of the poorest area of [[Northern Italy]], as [[Veneto]] was until the 1960s. Despite this, the city flourished in the following decades both economically and socially, developing its industry, being an important agricultural market and having a very important cultural and technological centre as the University. The city hosted also a major military command and many regiments.

===The 20th century===
When Italy entered [[World War I]] on 24 May 1915, Padua was chosen as the main command of the [[Italian Army]]. The king, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele III]], and the [[Commander-in-chief|commander in chief]], Cadorna, went to live in Padua for the period of the war. After the defeat of Italy in the battle of [[Kobarid|Caporetto]] in autumn 1917, the front line was situated on the river Piave. This was just {{convert|50|-|60|km|0|abbr=on}} from Padua, and the city was now in range of the Austrian artillery. However, the [[Military of Italy|Italian military]] command did not withdraw. The city was bombed several times (about 100 civilian deaths). A memorable feat was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio|Gabriele D'Annunzio]]'s flight to [[Vienna]] from the nearby San Pelagio Castle air field.

A year later, the threat to Padua was removed. In late October 1918, the Italian Army won the decisive [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], and the Austrian forces collapsed. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|armistice was signed at Villa Giusti]], Padua, on 3 November 1918.

During the war, industry grew rapidly, and this provided Padua with a base for further post-war development. In the years immediately following World War I, Padua developed outside the historical town, enlarging and growing in population, even if labor and social strife were rampant at the time.

As in many other areas in Italy, Padua experienced great social turmoil in the years immediately following World War I. The city was shaken by strikes and clashes, factories and fields were subject to occupation, and war veterans struggled to re-enter civilian life. Many supported a new political way, [[fascism]]. As in other parts of Italy, the [[National Fascist Party]] in Padua soon came to be seen as the defender of property and order against revolution. The city was also the site of one of the largest fascist mass rallies, with some 300,000 people reportedly attending one speech by [[Benito Mussolini]].

New buildings, in typical [[fascist architecture]], sprang up in the city. Examples can be found today in the buildings surrounding Piazza Spalato (today Piazza Insurrezione), the railway station, the new part of City Hall, and part of the Bo Palace hosting the University.

Following Italy's defeat in the [[World War II|Second World War]] on 8 September 1943, Padua became part of the [[Italian Social Republic]], a [[puppet state]] of the Nazi occupiers. The city hosted the Ministry of Public Instruction of the new state, as well as military and militia commands and a [[Military airbase|military airport]]. The Resistenza, the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]], was very active against both the new fascist rule and the Nazis. One of the main leaders of the Resistenza in the area was the University vice-chancellor Concetto Marchesi.

From December 1943 to the end of the war, [[Bombing of Padua in World War II|Padua was bombed 24 times by Allied aircraft]]; the heaviest raids were the ones on 16 and 30 December 1943 (each of which caused 300 victims), 7 February 1944 (300 victims), 11 March 1944 (over 300 tons of bombs dropped by 111 bombers), 22 and 23 March 1944, 20 April 1944 (180 victims), 22 February and 12 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giuliocesaro.it/pdf/storici/012%20Bombardamenti%20aerei%20Padova.pdf Bombardamenti aerei sulla città di Padova e provincia, 1943-1945]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mattinopadova.gelocal.it/padova/cronaca/2013/03/11/news/11-marzo-69-anni-fa-il-bombardamento-che-distrusse-gli-eremitani-1.6679035 11 marzo, 69 anni fa il bombardamento che distrusse gli Eremitani]&lt;/ref&gt; The worst hit areas were the railway station (the target of most raids) and the northern district of Arcella, where 96 % of all buildings were destroyed; overall, 950 homes were destroyed and 1,400 damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/padova_res-8da8cd0a-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt; During one of these bombings, the [[Church of the Eremitani]], with frescoes by [[Andrea Mantegna]], was destroyed, considered by some [[History of art|art historians]] to be Italy's biggest wartime cultural loss. The [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]] and the [[University of Padua|University]] also suffered damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/padova_res-8da8cd0a-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt; Some 2,000 inhabitants of Padua were killed by the raids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giuliocesaro.it/pdf/storici/012%20Bombardamenti%20aerei%20Padova.pdf Bombardamenti aerei sulla città di Padova e provincia, 1943-1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 1945, the partisans started the final insurrection against the Germans and Fascists; in the subsequent fighting, 224 partisans and 497 Germans were killed. 5,000 German troops, including three generals, surrendered to the partisans in Padua, and another 10,000 in the surrounding area; on 28 April New Zealand troops (2nd New Zealand Division) of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] entered the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=wUMQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT712&amp;lpg=PT712&amp;dq=generale+arnim+padova&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pzts4tNu2b&amp;sig=ACfU3U3zOy_QGBuiA5Ga4qhLlRVP-aDHoA&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW-Z3sz8nnAhURhlwKHT_gAd0Q6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=generale%20arnim%20padova&amp;f=false I nemici di Mussolini: Storia della Resistenza armata al regime fascista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mattinopadova.gelocal.it/padova/cronaca/2017/04/24/news/quel-28-aprile-1945-ecco-come-fu-liberata-padova-1.15244441 Quel 28 aprile 1945, ecco come fu liberata Padova]&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth]] War Cemetery is located in the west part of the city, commemorating the sacrifice of these troops.

After the war, the city developed rapidly, reflecting Veneto's rise from being the poorest region in northern Italy to one of the richest and most economically active regions of modern Italy.

[[File:Giotto, diavolo.jpg|thumb|right|''Last Judgment'' by [[Giotto]], part of the [[Scrovegni Chapel]].]]
[[File:Exterior of Palazzo della Ragione (Padua).jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo della Ragione]]]]
* The [[Scrovegni Chapel]] (Italian: ''Cappella degli Scrovegni'') is Padua's most notable sight. It houses a cycle of frescoes completed in 1305 by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets| doi = 10.1023/A:1017022722457|year=1999|last1=Bellinati|first1=Claudio|volume=85/86|pages=45–50 |title=The Moon in the 14th Century Frescoes in Padova }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned by [[Enrico degli Scrovegni]], a wealthy banker, as a private chapel once attached to his family's palazzo. It is also called the &quot;Arena Chapel&quot; because it stands on the site of a Roman-era arena. The fresco cycle details the life of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and has been acknowledged by many to be one of the most important fresco cycles in the world for its role in the development of European painting. It also includes one of the earliest representations of a kiss in the history of art (Meeting at the Golden Gate, 1305). Entrance to the chapel is an elaborate ordeal, as it involves spending 15 minutes prior to entrance in a climate-controlled, airlocked vault, used to stabilize the temperature between the outside world and the inside of the chapel. This is intended to protect the frescoes from moisture and mold.
* The [[Palazzo della Ragione]], with its great hall on the upper floor, is reputed to have the largest roof unsupported by columns in Europe; the hall is nearly rectangular, its length {{convert|81.5|m|2|abbr=on}}, its breadth {{convert|27|m|2|abbr=on}}, and its height {{convert|24|m|2|abbr=on}}; the walls are covered with [[allegory|allegorical]] [[fresco]]es; the building stands upon arches, and the upper storey is surrounded by an open loggia, not unlike that which surrounds the basilica of [[Vicenza]]. The Palazzo was begun in 1172 and finished in 1219. In 1306, Fra Giovanni, an Augustinian friar, covered the whole with one roof. Originally there were three roofs, spanning the three chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition walls remained till the fire of 1420, when the Venetian architects who undertook the restoration removed them, throwing all three spaces into one and forming the present great hall, the ''Salone''. The new space was refrescoed by Nicolo' Miretto and [[Stefano da Ferrara]], working from 1425 to 1440. Beneath the great hall, there is a centuries-old market.
* In the [[Piazza dei Signori, Padua|Piazza dei Signori]] is the loggia called the ''Gran Guardia'', (1493–1526), and close by is the ''Palazzo del Capitaniato'', the residence of the Venetian governors, with its great door, the work of [[Giovanni Maria Falconetto]], the Veronese architect-sculptor who introduced [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance architecture]] to Padua and who completed the door in 1532. Falconetto was the architect of [[Alvise Cornaro]]'s garden loggia, (''Loggia Cornaro''), the first fully Renaissance building in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xloggia.html |title=Loggia Cornaro |publisher=Boglewood.com |access-date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby stands the Cathedral, remodelled in 1552 after a design of [[Michelangelo]]. It contains works by Nicolò Semitecolo, [[Francesco Bassano the Younger|Francesco Bassano]] and Giorgio Schiavone. The nearby Baptistry, consecrated in 1281, houses the most important frescoes cycle by [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]].[[File:Sant'Antonio (Padua) - Facade.jpg|thumb|The [[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua]].]][[File:Padua5.jpg|thumb|The Basilica of St. Giustina, facing the great ''piazza'' of Prato della Valle.]]
* The [[Teatro Verdi (Padova)|Teatro Verdi]] is host to performances of operas, musicals, plays, ballets, and concerts.
* The most celebrated of the Paduan churches is the ''[[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua|Basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova]]'', locally known as &quot;Il Santo&quot;. The bones of the saint rest in a chapel richly ornamented with carved marble, the work of various artists, among them [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]] and Falconetto. The basilica was begun around the year 1230 and completed in the following century. Tradition says that the building was designed by [[Nicola Pisano]]. It is covered by seven cupolas, two of them pyramidal. There are also four cloisters. The belltower has eight bells in C.
* [[Donatello]]'s [[Erasmo of Narni|equestrian statue]] of the Venetian general Gattamelata ([[Erasmo of Narni|Erasmo da Narni]]) can be found on the piazza in front of the ''[[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua|Basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova]]''. It was cast in 1453, and was the first full-size [[Equestrian sculpture|equestrian]] bronze cast since antiquity. It was inspired by the [[Marcus Aurelius]] [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian sculpture]] at the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]].
* Not far from the Gattamelata statue are the St. George Oratory (13th century), with frescoes by [[Altichiero]], and the ''Scuola di S. Antonio'' (16th century), with frescoes by [[Titian|Tiziano]] ([[Titian]]).
* One of the best known symbols of Padua is the ''[[Prato della Valle]]'', a {{convert|90000|m2|2|abbr=on}} elliptical square. This is one of the biggest in Europe. In the centre is a wide garden surrounded by an oval canal, lined by 78 statues portraying illustrious citizens. It was created by Andrea Memmo in the late 18th century. Memmo once resided in the monumental 15th-century ''Palazzo Angeli'', which now houses the [[Museum of Precinema]].
* [[Abbey of Santa Giustina]] and adjacent Basilica. In the 15th century, it became one of the most important monasteries in the area, until it was suppressed by Napoleon in 1810. In 1919 it was reopened. The tombs of several saints are housed in the interior, including those of Justine, [[St. Prosdocimus]], [[Maximus the Confessor|St. Maximus]], St. Urius, [[Felicitas of Padua|St. Felicita]], St. Julianus, as well as relics of the Apostle St. Matthias and the Evangelist [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]]. This is home to some art, including the ''Martyrdom of St. Justine'' by [[Paolo Veronese]]. The complex was founded in the 5th century on the tomb of the namesake saint, [[Justina of Padua|Justine of Padua]]. The belltower has eight bells in B.
* The [[Church of the Eremitani]] is an Augustinian church of the 13th century, containing the tombs of Jacopo (1324) and [[Ubertino I da Carrara|Ubertinello]] (1345) da Carrara, lords of Padua, and the chapel of SS James and Christopher, formerly illustrated by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s frescoes. This was largely destroyed by the Allies in [[World War II]], because it was next to the Nazi headquarters. The old monastery of the church now houses the [[Musei Civici di Padova]] (town archeologic and art museum).
* [[Santa Sofia Church (Padua)|Santa Sofia Church]] is probably Padova's most ancient church. The crypt was begun in the late 10th century by Venetian craftsmen. It has a basilica plan with Romanesque-Gothic interior and Byzantine elements. The apse was built in the 12th century. The edifice appears to be tilting slightly due to the soft terrain.
[[File:Botanical Garden (Orto Botanico), Padua-112029.jpg|thumb|Botanical Garden (Orto Botanico).]]
* The church of ''San Gaetano'' (1574–1586) was designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], on an unusual octagonal plan. The interior, decorated with polychrome marbles, houses a ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Andrea Riccio|Andrea Briosco]], in Nanto stone.
* The 16th-century, Baroque [[Padua Synagogue]]
* At the centre of the historical city, the buildings of [[Palazzo del Bò]], the centre of the [[University of Padua]]
* The City Hall, called Palazzo Moroni, the wall of which is covered by the names of the Paduan dead in the different wars of Italy and which is attached to the Palazzo della Ragione;
* The [[Pedrocchi Café|Caffé Pedrocchi]], built in 1831 by architect [[Giuseppe Jappelli]] in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] with Egyptian influence. This café has been open for almost two centuries. It hosts the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] museum, and the near building of the ''Pedrocchino'' (&quot;little Pedrocchi&quot;) in [[Gothic Revival architecture|neogothic style]].
* The city centre is surrounded by the {{cvt|11|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}}  [[Defensive wall|city walls]], built during the early 16th century, by architects that include [[Michele Sanmicheli]]. There are only a few ruins left, together with two gates, of the smaller and inner 13th-century walls. There is also a castle, the Castello. Its main tower was transformed between 1767 and 1777 into an [[Observatory|astronomical observatory]] known as ''Specola''. However the other buildings were used as prisons during the 19th and 20th centuries. They are now being restored.
* The [[Ponte San Lorenzo]], a [[Roman bridge]] largely underground, along with the ancient [[Ponte Molino (Padua)|Ponte Molino]], [[Ponte Altinate]], [[Ponte Corvo (bridge)|Ponte Corvo]] and [[Ponte S. Matteo]].

===Villas===
In the neighbourhood of Padua are numerous noble villas. These include:
* ''[[Villa Molin]]'', in the Mandria fraction, designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] in 1597.
* ''[[Villa Mandriola]]'', (17th century), at [[Albignasego]]
* ''Villa Pacchierotti-Trieste ''(17th century), at Limena
* ''Villa Cittadella-Vigodarzere'' (19th century), at Saonara
* ''Villa Selvatico da Porto ''(15th–18th century), at [[Vigonza]]
* ''Villa Loredan'', at Sant'Urbano
* ''[[Villa Contarini]]'', at [[Piazzola sul Brenta]], built in 1546 by [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] and enlarged in the following centuries, is the most important.

Padua has long been acclaimed for its [[University of Padua|university]], founded in 1222. Under the rule of Venice the university was governed by a board of three patricians, called the ''Riformatori dello Studio di Padova''.
The list of notable professors and alumni is long, containing, among others, the names of [[Pietro Bembo|Bembo]], [[Sperone Speroni]], the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Gabriele Falloppio|Fallopius]], Fabrizio d'Acquapendente, [[Galileo Galilei]], [[William Harvey]], [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], [[Reginald Pole|Reginald, later Cardinal Pole]], [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]], [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] and [[Jan Zamoyski]].
It is also where, in 1678, [[Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia]] became the first woman in the world to graduate from university.
The university hosts the oldest [[Anatomical theatre|anatomy theatre]], built in 1594.

The university also hosts the oldest [[botanical garden]] (1545) in the world. The botanical garden [[Orto botanico di Padova|Orto Botanico di Padova]] was founded as the garden of curative herbs attached to the University's faculty of medicine. It still contains an important collection of rare plants.

The place of Padua in the history of art is nearly as important as its place in the history of learning. The presence of the university attracted many distinguished artists, such as [[Giotto]], [[Filippo Lippi|Fra Filippo Lippi]] and [[Donatello]]; and for native art there was the school of [[Francesco Squarcione]], whence issued [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]].

Padua is also the birthplace of the celebrated architect [[Andrea Palladio]], whose 16th-century [[Palladian villas of the Veneto|villas]] in the area of Padua, [[Venice]], [[Vicenza]] and [[Treviso]] are among the most notable of Italy and they were often copied during the 18th and 19th centuries; and of [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]], adventurer, engineer and [[List of Egyptologists|egyptologist]].

The sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] produced his first work in Padua, one of which is among the statues of Prato della Valle (presently a copy is displayed in the open air, while the original is in the Musei Civici).

The Antonianum is settled among Prato della Valle, the Basilica of Saint Anthony and the Botanic Garden. It was built in 1897 by the Jesuit fathers and kept alive until 2002. During World War II, under the leadership of P. Messori Roncaglia SJ, it became the center of the resistance movement against the [[Nazis]]. Indeed, it briefly survived P. Messori's death and was sold by the Jesuits in 2004.

Padua also plays host to the majority of ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' by William Shakespeare and in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' Benedick is named as &quot;Signior Benedick of Padua&quot;.

[[Paolo De Poli]], painter and [[Vitreous enamel|enamellist]], author of decorative panels and design objects, 15 times invited to the [[Venice Biennale]] was born in Padua. The [[electronic music|electronic]] musician [[Tying Tiffany]] was also born in Padua.

==Economy==
The industrial area of Padova was created in the eastern part of the city in 1946; it is now one of the biggest industrial zones in Europe, having an area of 11&amp;nbsp;million sqm. The main offices of 1,300 industries are based here, employing 50,000 people. In the industrial zone, there are two [[railway station]]s, one [[port|fluvial port]], three truck terminals, two highway exits and a lot of connected services, such as hotels, [[post office]]s and directional centres.

==Transport==

=== By car ===
By [[Automobile|car]], there are 2 motorways (autostrade in Italian): A4 Brescia-Padova, connecting it to Verona (then to [[Brenner Pass]], [[Innsbruck]] and [[Bavaria]]) and [[Milan]] (then [[Switzerland]], [[Turin]] and [[France]]); A4 Padova-Venezia, to [[Venice]] then [[Belluno]] (for [[Dolomites]] holiday resorts like [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]]) [[Trieste]] and [[Tarvisio]] (for [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]); A13 Bologna-Padova, to [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] (then [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy|South Italy]]). Roads connect Padua with all the large and small centers of the region. A [[Tangenziale di Padova|motorway]] with more than 20 exits surrounds the city, connecting districts and the small towns of the surrounding region.

===By rail===
Padua has two [[railway station]]s open to passengers. The main station ''[[Padova railway station|Stazione di Padova]]'' has 11 platforms and is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;Padova Centrale&quot;; it is one of the biggest stations in Italy. More than 450 trains per day leave Padova. The station is used by over 20&amp;nbsp;million passengers per year. Other railway stations are ''[[Ponte di Brenta railway station|Padova Ponte di Brenta]]'' (soon to be closed), Padova San Lazzaro (planned), Padova Campo di Marte, with no passenger service once used as a freight station which could become one of the stations of the &quot;Servizio Ferroviario Metropolitano Regionale&quot;. From Padova, [[High-speed rail|high speed train]]s connect to [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]; one can reach Milan in 1h and 51&amp;nbsp;min, Rome in 3 hours an 0&amp;nbsp;min and Venice in 20&amp;nbsp;min. There are also international day trains to Zurich and Munich, and overnight sleeper services to Paris and Dijon (Thello), Munich and Vienna (ÖBB).

The station was opened in 1842 when the service started on the first part of the [[Milan–Venice railway]] (the &quot;Imperial Regia Ferrovia Ferdinandea&quot;) built from Padua to Marghera through Mestre. Porta Marghera is a major port of the Venetian area.

Railways enthusiasts can visit the Signal Box A (Cabina A), preserved by the &quot;Società Veneta Ferrovie&quot; (a society named after the former public works and railway company, based in &quot;Piazza Eremitani&quot; in Padua) association.

===By aeroplane===
Padua is approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]] which is the nearest airport with regular commercial service. Padua is also serviced by the [[Verona Villafranca Airport]], [[Treviso Airport]] and [[Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport]].

The [[Padua Airport|Gino Allegri]], or ''Aeroporto civile di Padova &quot;Gino Allegri&quot;'', is no longer served by regularly scheduled flights. Padua is, however, the home of one of Italy's four [[Area Control Centre]]s.

===Public transport===
[[File:Padova-Translohr-cnr.jpg|thumb|Translohr in Padua]]

Urban [[public transport]] includes public buses together with a new [[Translohr]] guided tramway (connecting Albignasego, in the south of Padua, with Pontevigodarzere in the north of the city, thanks to the [[Trams in Padua|new line]] built in 2009) and private [[Taxicab|taxis]].

The city centre is partly closed to vehicles, except for residents and permitted vehicles. There are some [[Parking lot|car parks]] surrounding the district. In this area, as well, there are some streets and squares restricted to pedestrian and bicycle use only.

Padua has approximately 40 bus lines, which are served by new buses (purchased in 2008-9).

The [[Veneto]] Region is building a regional rail line ([[S-Bahn]]-like system) around the city with 15 new stations. Its name will be ''SFMR'' and it will reach the [[province of Venice]].

Other recent developments in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following the invention of the laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. [[Magnetic pulse welding]] (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. [[Friction stir welding]] was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mel Schwartz|title=Innovations in Materials Manufacturing, Fabrication, and Environmental Safety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpCs0AoQOBoC&amp;pg=PA300|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-8215-9|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due to the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Electric, pp. 1.1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Some of the most common current welding methods are:
*[[Shielded metal arc welding]] (SMAW), also known as &quot;stick welding.&quot;
*[[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (GTAW), also known as TIG (tungsten, inert gas).
*[[Gas metal arc welding]] (GMAW), also known as MIG (metal, inert gas).
*[[Flux-cored arc welding]] (FCAW), very similar to MIG.
*[[Submerged arc welding]] (SAW), usually called Sub Arc.
*[[Electroslag welding]] (ESW), a highly productive process for thicker materials.

==Processes==

===Arc===
{{Main|Arc welding}}
These processes use a [[welding power supply]] to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either [[direct current]] (DC) or [[alternating current]] (AC), and consumable or non-consumable [[electrode]]s. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-[[inert gas]], known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.

====Power supplies====
To supply the electrical power necessary for arc welding processes, a variety of different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant [[electrical current|current]] power supplies and constant [[voltage]] power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc is directly related to the voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of current used plays an important role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged [[anode]] will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian and Schmid, p. 780&lt;/ref&gt; Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Electric, p. 5.4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a [[square wave]] pattern instead of the normal [[sine wave]], making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Weman, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Processes====
One of the most common types of arc welding is [[shielded metal arc welding]] (SMAW);&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman63&quot;&gt;Weman, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from [[redox|oxidation]] and contamination by producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman63&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:US Navy 090114-N-9704L-004 Hull Technician Fireman John Hansen lays beads for welding qualifications.jpg|thumb|left|Shielded metal arc welding]]

The process is versatile and can be performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman63&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cary103&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman63&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of [[cast iron]], stainless steel, aluminum, and other metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cary103&quot; /&gt;

[[Gas metal arc welding]] (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a semi-automatic or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.&lt;ref name=&quot;LE5.43&quot;&gt;Lincoln Electric, p. 5.4-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A related process, [[flux-cored arc welding]] (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire consisting of a steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is more expensive than the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Weman, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (GTAW), or tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a non-consumable [[tungsten]] electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman31&quot;&gt;Weman, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method is characterized by a stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman31&quot; /&gt;

GTAW can be used on nearly all weldable metals, though it is most often applied to [[stainless steel]] and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in [[bicycle]], aircraft and naval applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman31&quot; /&gt; A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method can be used on a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is [[plasma cutting]], an efficient steel cutting process.&lt;ref&gt;Weman, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Submerged arc welding]] (SAW) is a high-productivity welding method in which the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined with the use of a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Weman, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Other arc welding processes include [[atomic hydrogen welding]], [[electroslag welding]] (ESW), [[electrogas welding]], and [[stud arc welding]].&lt;ref&gt;Weman, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; ESW is a highly productive, single pass welding process for thicker materials between 1 inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) and 12 inches (300&amp;nbsp;mm) in a vertical or close to vertical position.

===Gas welding===
{{main|Oxy-fuel welding and cutting}}

The most common gas welding process is oxyfuel welding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman26&quot; /&gt; also known as oxyacetylene welding. It is one of the oldest and most versatile welding processes, but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman26&quot; /&gt;

The equipment is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in [[oxygen]] to produce a welding flame temperature of about 3100&amp;nbsp;°C (5600&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman26&quot; /&gt; The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, which can lead to greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman26&quot; /&gt;

===Resistance===
{{Main|Resistance welding}}

Resistance welding involves the generation of heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 [[Ampere|A]]) is passed through the metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot;&gt;Weman, pp. 80–84&lt;/ref&gt; In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Spot welder.miller.triddle.jpg|thumb|Spot welder]]
[[Spot welding]] is a popular resistance welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot; /&gt; Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include [[efficient energy use]], limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by [[industrial robot]]s. A specialized process, called [[shot welding]], can be used to spot weld stainless steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot; /&gt;

Like spot welding, [[seam welding]] relies on two electrodes to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, making it possible to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot; /&gt; Other resistance welding methods include [[butt welding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = John Jernberg| title = Forging| page = [https://archive.org/details/forgingmanualpr00jerngoog/page/n38 26]| publisher = American Technical society| year = 1919| url = https://archive.org/details/forgingmanualpr00jerngoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[flash welding]], [[projection welding]], and [[upset welding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8084&quot; /&gt;

===Energy beam===
Energy beam welding methods, namely [[laser beam welding]] and [[electron beam welding]], are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications.&lt;!--Reference is at the end of the paragraph--&gt; The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both have a very high energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking.&lt;!--Reference at the end of the paragraph--&gt; Developments in this area include [[laser-hybrid welding]], which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, [[cladding (metalworking)|laser cladding]], and [[x-ray welding]].&lt;ref&gt;Weman, pp. 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state===
[[File:Solid-state welding processes - AWS A3.0 2001.svg|thumb|300px|right|Solid-state welding processes [[classification chart]]&lt;ref&gt;AWS A3.0:2001, Standard Welding Terms and Definitions Including Terms for Adhesive Bonding, Brazing, Soldering, Thermal Cutting, and Thermal Spraying, American Welding Society (2001), p. 117. {{ISBN|0-87171-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the first welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods do not involve the melting of the materials being joined. One of the most popular, [[ultrasonic welding]], is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8990&quot;&gt;Weman, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment and methods involved are similar to that of resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8990&quot; /&gt;

Another common process, [[explosion welding]], involves the joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The energy from the impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only a limited amount of heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, including bonding aluminum to carbon steel in ship hulls and stainless steel or titanium to carbon steel in petrochemical pressure vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman8990&quot; /&gt;

Other solid-state welding processes include [[friction welding]] (including [[friction stir welding]] and [[friction stir spot welding]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;&gt;

==Geometry==&lt;!-- &quot;Butt joint (welding)&quot; redirects here --&gt;
{{Main|Welding joint}}
[[Image:Common Joint Types ZP.svg|left|thumb|Common welding joint types – (1) Square butt joint, (2) V butt joint, (3) Lap joint, (4) T-joint]]

Welds can be geometrically prepared in many different ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the [[cruciform joint]]). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming the shape of a U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Many welding processes require the use of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes can also be used to make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=19, 103, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Welded butt joint x-section.svg|thumb|The cross-section of a welded butt joint, with the darkest gray representing the weld or fusion zone, the medium gray the heat-affected zone, and the lightest gray the base material.]]
After welding, a number of distinct regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the [[heat-affected zone]], the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal in this area is often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=401–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
{{main|Weld quality assurance}}
[[Image:Pipe root weld with HAZ.jpg|thumb|The blue area results from oxidation at a corresponding temperature of {{convert|600|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. This is an accurate way to identify temperature, but does not represent the HAZ width. The HAZ is the narrow area that immediately surrounds the welded base metal.]]

Many distinct factors influence the strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the [[weldability]] of the base material, filler material, and flux material, the design of the joint, and the interactions between all these factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman6062&quot;&gt;Weman, pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; To test the quality of a weld, either [[destructive testing|destructive]] or [[nondestructive testing]] methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of [[welding defect]]s include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.

The metalworking industry has instituted [[List of welding codes|specifications and codes]] to guide [[welders]], [[weld inspectors]], [[engineers]], managers, and property owners in proper welding technique, design of welds, how to judge the quality of [[Welding Procedure Specification]], how to judge the skill of the person performing the weld, and how to ensure the quality of a welding job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weman6062&quot; /&gt; Methods such as [[visual inspection]], [[radiography]], [[ultrasonic testing]], [[phased-array ultrasonics]], [[dye penetrant inspection]], [[magnetic particle inspection]], or [[industrial computed tomography]] can help with detection and analysis of certain defects.

===Heat-affected zone===
The heat-affected zone (HAZ) is a ring surrounding the weld in which the temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the [[heat-treatment]] properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The [[thermal diffusivity]] of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Electric, pp. 6.1-5–6.1–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian and Schmid, pp. 821–22&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \left(\frac{V \times I \times 60}{S \times 1000} \right) \times
\mathit{Efficiency}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' = heat input ([[kilojoule|kJ]]/mm), ''V'' = voltage ([[Volt|V]]), ''I'' = current (A), and ''S'' = welding speed (mm/min). The efficiency is dependent on the welding process used, with shielded metal arc welding having a value of 0.75, gas metal arc welding and submerged arc welding, 0.9, and gas tungsten arc welding, 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;Weman, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of alleviating the stresses and brittleness created in the HAZ include [[Heat treating#Stress relieving|stress relieving]] and [[Tempering (metallurgy)#Welded steel|tempering]].&lt;ref&gt;''How To Weld'' By Todd Bridigum - Motorbook 2008 Page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifetime extension with aftertreatment methods===
[[Image:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Example: High Frequency Impact Treatment for lifetime extension]]
The durability and life of dynamically loaded, welded steel structures is determined in many cases by the welds, in particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions by [[grinding (abrasive cutting)]], [[shot peening]], [[High Frequency Impact Treatment]], etc. the durability of many designs increase significantly.

==Metallurgy==

Most solids used are engineering materials consisting of crystalline solids in which the atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which is known as a [[lattice structure]]. The only exception is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large organic molecules.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lancaster|first=J.F.|title=Metallurgy of welding|url=https://archive.org/details/metallurgyofweld0000lanc|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Abington Pub.|location=Abington, Cambridge|isbn=1-85573-428-1|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystalline solids cohesion is obtained by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent]]. To form an ionic bond, either a [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] or [[chemical bond|bond]]ing electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged [[ions]]. The bonding in the static position is when the ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in [[tension (physics)|tension]] force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under [[compressive]] force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

Covalent bonding takes place when one of the constituent atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically [[brittle]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

[[Metallic bonding]] can be classified as a type of covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms are of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically [[ductile]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

Three of the most commonly used crystal lattice structures in metals are the [[body-centred cubic]], [[face-centred cubic]] and [[close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed hexagonal]]. Ferritic [[steel]] has a body-centred cubic structure and [[austenitic steel]], [[non-ferrous metals]] like [[aluminium|aluminum]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] have the face-centred cubic structure.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

Ductility is an important factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's [[yield strength]]. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in [[fracture toughness]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

A reduction in fracture toughness may also be attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a reduction in temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing [[Fiber|fibrous]]. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the [[microscope]]. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

Fracture toughness is measured using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, of which the dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring fracture toughness by the following: The Charpy impact test per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448–1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lancaster&quot; /&gt;

==Unusual conditions==
[[File:Working Diver 01.jpg|thumb|left|Underwater welding]]

While many welding applications are done in controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used in a wide variety of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and [[vacuum]]s (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by [[Russia]]n cosmonauts during the [[Soyuz 6]] mission, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the [[International Space Station]], which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=677–683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety issues==
[[Image:AlfredPalmerwelder1.jpg|thumb|Arc welding with a welding helmet, gloves, and other protective clothing]]

Welding can be dangerous and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/AWS Z49.1: &quot;Safety in Welding, Cutting, and Allied Processes&quot; (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; this is why it is classified as a [[hot work]] process. To prevent injury, [[welder]]s wear [[personal protective equipment]] in the form of heavy [[leather]] [[glove]]s and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Synthetic clothing such as polyester should not be worn since it may burn, causing injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/maritime/sltc/ships/hotwork/hazard_burnshock1.html|title=Safety and Health Injury Prevention Sheets (SHIPS) {{!}} Process: Hot Work - Welding, Cutting and Brazing - Hazard: Burns and Shocks {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2019-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called [[arc eye]] or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the [[cornea]] and can burn the [[retina]]s of the eyes. [[Goggle]]s and [[welding helmet]]s with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a [[polyvinyl chloride]] plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but cannot replace the [[filter (optics)|filter]] glass used in helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=42, 49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welders are often exposed to dangerous gases and [[Particle|particulate]] matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce [[smoke]] containing particles of various types of [[oxide]]s. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the [[toxicity]] of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles have the ability to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, [[ozone]], and fumes containing [[heavy metals]], can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cary5262&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Helzer|2005|pp=52–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to [[manganese]] welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (&lt;0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/welding/ Welding and Manganese: Potential Neurologic Effects].

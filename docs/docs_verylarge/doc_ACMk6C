The [[Roman Iron Age]] in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the [[Roman Empire]]. In material culture this is reflected by a few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas—Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands—had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|pp=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|Europe in the 9th century]]

The name &quot;Estonia&quot; occurs first in a form of [[Aestii]] in the 1st century AD by [[Tacitus]]; however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area. In the Northern Sagas (9th century) the term started to be used to indicate the Estonians.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_uralic_language_family_facts_myths_and_statistics&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

According to the 5th-century Roman historian [[Cassiodorus]], the people known to Tacitus as the Aestii were the Estonians. The extent of their territory in early medieval times is disputed, but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the [[Sami people|Lapps]] (known at the time as Finns) in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Pennick|1995|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassiodorus mentions Estonia in his book V.

In the 1st centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (''kihelkond'') and the county (''maakond''). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: [[Saare County|Saaremaa]] (Osilia), [[Läänemaa]] (Rotalia or Maritima), [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]] (Harria), [[Rävala]] (Revalia), [[Virumaa]] (Vironia), [[Järvamaa]] (Jervia), [[Sakala County|Sakala]] (Saccala), and [[Ugandi County|Ugandi]] (Ugaunia).&lt;ref name=&quot;estonia_and_the_estonians&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

[[Varbola Stronghold]] was one of the largest circular rampart fortresses and trading centers built in Estonia, [[Harju County]] ({{lang-la|Harria}}) at the time.

In the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the [[Vikings]] from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.
With the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually led to the [[Baltic crusades]].
The east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: first the [[Livs]], [[Latvians|Letts]] and [[Estonians]], then the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] and the [[Finns]] underwent defeat, [[baptism]], [[military occupation]] and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_northern_crusades&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

{{Main|Livonian Crusade}}

Estonia was one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1193 [[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagan]]s in Northern Europe. The [[Northern Crusades]] from Northern Germany established the stronghold of [[Riga]] (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of [[Livonians|Livs]] and [[Latvians|Letts]], the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] and their recently converted allies won a major battle in which the Estonian commander [[Lembitu]] was killed. The period of the several Northern Crusade battles in Estonia between 1208 and 1227 is also known as the period of the ancient Estonian fight for independence.

==Danish Estonia==
{{Main|Danish Estonia}}
[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|left|150px|thumb|[[Livonia]] in 1260]]
Northern Estonia was conquered by Danish crusaders led by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Waldemar II]], who arrived in 1219 on the site of the Estonian town of Lindanisse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/7/0518.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / 2/7|publisher=[[Project Runeberg]]|language=Danish|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Tallinn]]) at (Latin) ''Revelia'' (Estonian) ''Revala'' or ''[[Rävala]]'', the adjacent ancient Estonian county. The Danish Army defeated the Estonians at the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]].

The Estonians of [[Harria]] started a rebellion in 1343 ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]). The province was occupied by the [[Livonian Order]] as a result. In 1346, the Danish dominions in Estonia ([[Harria]] and [[Vironia]]) were sold for 10&amp;nbsp;000 [[mark (unit)|marks]] to the [[Livonian Order]].

===Swedish coastal settlements===
The first written mention of the [[Estonian Swedes]] comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of [[Haapsalu]]. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called &quot;Coastal Swedes&quot; (''Rannarootslased'' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), or according to their settlement area [[Ruhnu]] Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the expression ''aibofolke'' (&quot;island people&quot;), and called their homeland ''[[Aiboland]]''.

The ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, [[Hiiumaa]] Island, the west coast and smaller islands ([[Vormsi]], [[Noarootsi]], Sutlepa, Riguldi, [[Osmussaar]]), the northwest coast of the Harju District ([[Nõva Parish|Nõva]], [[Vihterpalu]], [[Kurkse]], the [[Pakri Peninsula]] and the [[Pakri Islands]]), and [[Naissaar]] Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been [[Haapsalu]] and Tallinn.

In earlier times Swedes also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of [[Läänemaa]], the eastern part of [[Harjumaa]] and the western part of [[Virumaa]].

==Terra Mariana==

[[File:Narva Hermanni kindlus, 21. juuli 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hermann castle, Narva|[[Hermann Castle]], Narva, was one of the Teutonic Order's castles in Estonia.]]
In 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]]. After the conquest, all the remaining local pagans of Estonia were ostensibly [[Christianity|Christianized]]. An ecclesiastical state [[Terra Mariana]] was established. The conquerors exercised control through a network of strategically located [[List of castles in Estonia|castles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison| first= Dick| authorlink= |title= Gud vill det! – Nordiska korsfarare under medeltid| url= |accessdate= |year= 2005| publisher= Ordfront| location= |language= Swedish| isbn= 978-91-7441-373-1|pages=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Livland 15jh.png|thumb|right|150px|Livonian Confederation in the 15th century]]
The territory was then divided between the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Order]], the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]] (in Estonian: ''Tartu piiskopkond'') and the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]] (in Estonian: ''Saare-Lääne piiskopkond''). The northern part of Estonia – more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) – was a nominal possession of [[Denmark]] until 1346. [[Tallinn]] (Reval) was given the [[Lübeck law|Lübeck Rights]] in 1248 and joined the [[Hanseatic League]] at the end of the 13th century. In 1343 the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and four elected Estonian &quot;kings&quot; were killed in [[Paide]] during peace negotiations in 1343. Vesse, the rebel King of Saaremaa, was hanged in 1344.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Despite local rebellions and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovian]] invasions in 1481 and 1558, the local [[Low German]]-speaking upper class continued to rule Estonia. By the end of the Middle Ages, these [[Baltic Germans]] had established themselves as the governing elite in Estonia, both as traders and the urban middle-class in the cities, and as landowners in the countryside, through a network of [[manorialism|manorial]] estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Mauno| editor1-last= Jokipii|title= Baltisk kultur och historia|year= 1992|language= Swedish| isbn= 91-34-51207-1|pages= 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Reformation===
The [[Protestant Reformation]] in Europe that began in 1517 with [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) spread to Estonia in the 1520s. The Reformation in Estonia was inspired and organized by local and Swedish secular and religious authorities – especially after the end of the Livonian War in 1582. [[Lutheranism]] spread literacy among the young, and it transformed religious art. However, the peasants were traditionalists and were more comfortable with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new religion. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the [[Last Supper]], but images and statues of the [[list of saints|saints]] had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Krista Kodres, &quot;Church and art in the First Century of the reformation in Estonia: Towards Lutheran orthodoxy,&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (2003) 28#3 pp 187–203. online&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German elite]] promoted Lutheranism, and language, education, religion and politics were greatly transformed. Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of [[Latin]], and the first book was printed in Estonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/reform.html| title=Protestant Reformation in the Baltic| last=Harrison| first=Rachelle| date=June 2000| publisher=[[University of Washington]]| accessdate=2009-09-20| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903024306/http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/reform.html| archivedate=3 September 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division of Estonia in the Livonian War==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
{{Main|Livonian War}}
During the [[Livonian War]] in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control, while southern Estonia briefly came under the control of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 1580s. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of [[Duchy of Estonia (1561–1721)|Estonia]] in the north and [[Livonia]] in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early 20th century.

[[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] asked for help of [[Gustav I of Sweden]], and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] also began direct negotiations with Gustavus, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustavus I Vasa died. The chances for success of [[Magnus von Lyffland]] and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 and 1570. In the former case he had been recognised as their [[Monarch|sovereign]] by the [[Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek]] and the [[Bishopric of Courland]], and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]]; the [[Bishopric of Reval]] with the [[Harrien]]-[[Wierland]] [[gentry]] were on his side; and the [[Livonian Order]] conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the principality of Estonia. Then, along with [[Archbishop]] [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] of the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and his [[Coadjutor archbishop|coadjutor]] [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg|Christoph von Mecklenburg]], Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] became king, he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with [[Muscovy]] and spoke to the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of [[Reval]] city. He offered them goods to submit to him, as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561, they submitted to him, contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess [[Catherine Jagiellon]]. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to [[Finland]], Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly and lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of [[Riga]]. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his [[inheritance]] of [[Holstein]]. After Sweden [[military occupation|occupied]] Reval, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562, in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between the [[Free City of Lübeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568, Erik XIV became [[insane]], and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden, and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], know that he was ready for peace. On 13 December 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the [[Livonian War]] a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called &quot;Peace Party&quot;. Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with [[Ivan the Terrible]], proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.

[[File:Livland 15jh.png|right|350px|thumb|Livonia, as shown in the map of 1573 of Joann Portantius]]

The Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces – scattered bands of household troops (''Hofleute'') under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 ([[Battle of Pärnu]] and [[Siege of Reval, 1565]]), in 1570–1571 ([[Siege of Reval, 1570–1571]]; 30 weeks), and in 1574–1576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of [[Lääne County|Wiek]] to the [[monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]] and the loss of the territory to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]]). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Rzeczpospolita]]. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

Having rejected peace proposals from its enemies, [[Ivan the Terrible]] found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when the [[Crimean Khanate]] devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down Moscow (see [[Russo-Crimean Wars]]), the drought and epidemics had fatally affected the economy, the policy of [[oprichnina]] had thoroughly disrupted the government, while the [[Grand Principality of Lithuania]] [[Union of Lublin|had united with]] the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], supported by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1576). Batory replied with a series of three [[offensive (military)|offensive]]s against Muscovy, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook [[Polotsk]]. During the second, in 1580, with a 29,000-strong army he took [[Wielkie Łuki|Velikie Luki]], and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the [[Siege of Pskov]]. Frederick II had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike [[Sweden]] and Poland. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]] in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish–Lithuanian control of [[Ducatus Ultradunensis]] only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]] died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]] and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[Œsel]], [[Denmark]] was out of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] by 1585. In 1598 [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] was divided into:
* [[Wenden Voivodeship]] (''województwo wendeńskie'', [[Kieś]])
* [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] (''województwo dorpackie'', [[Dorpat]])
* [[Parnawa Voivodeship]] (''województwo parnawskie'', [[Parnawa]])

[[File:sweden2.gif|thumb|right|120px|Formation of the Swedish Empire, 1560–1660]]
During 1582–83 southern Estonia ([[Livonia]]) became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

==Estonia in the Swedish Empire==
{{Main|Swedish Estonia}}
The [[Duchy of Estonia (1561–1721)|Duchy of Estonia]] placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] and [[Poland]] as the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.

[[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]] was conquered from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by 1629 in the [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–29)|Polish–Swedish War]]. By the [[Treaty of Oliva]] between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the [[Northern Wars]] the [[House of Vasa|Polish–Lithuanian king]] renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day [[Latvia]] ([[Vidzeme]] region).

In 1631, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the nobility to grant the peasantry greater [[autonomy]], and in 1632 established a [[printing press]] and [[University of Tartu|university]] in the city of [[Tartu]].

==Estonia in the Russian Empire (1710–1917)==
[[File:Europa1899.JPG|150px|thumb|Europe in 19th century]]

Sweden's defeat by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] resulted in the [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710, confirmed by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, [[Lutheran]] church, local and town governments, and education remained mostly German until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.

The Russian era from the 1720s to the [[First World War]] was the golden age of the German elites. They owned most of the land and businesses, controlled the [[serfs]], dominated all the cities, and got along quite well with the Russian imperial authorities.  Unrest and rebellion was uncommon. The Germans were Lutherans, and so were the vast majority of the Estonian population, but the Germans had full control of the Lutheran churches. [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Protestant missionaries made an impact in the eighteenth century, and translated the complete Bible into Estonian. The Germans complained, so the imperial government banned the Moravians from 1743 to 1764. A theological faculty opened at the [[University of Dorpat]] (Tartu), with German professors. The local German gentry controlled the local churches and rarely hired Estonian graduates, but they made their mark as intellectuals and Estonian nationalists. In the 1840s, there was a movement of Lutheran peasants into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The [[tsardom of Russia|czar]] discouraged them when he realized they were challenging the local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' (195) 197–98&lt;/ref&gt; The German character of the Lutheran churches alienated many nationalists, who emphasized the secular in their subcultures. For example, [[choral societies]] offered a secular alternative to church music.&lt;ref&gt;Hank Johnston, &quot;Religion and Nationalist Subcultures in the Baltics,&quot; ''[[Journal of Baltic Studies]]'' (1992) 23#2 pp 133–148.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Album von Dorpat, TKM 0031H 05, crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Tartu|Tartu University]] (Universität Dorpat) in 1860, during its 'Golden Age']]

By 1819, the [[Baltic provinces]] were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the local national identity and culture as Estonia was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-19th century.

Tartu was a multicultural crossroads with strong representation of Russians, Germans and Estonians. Orthodox, Lutherans and [[Jews]], scientists and humanists, all were quite active at the city's [[University of Tartu|university]]. The students seemed uninterested in the [[Russification]] programs introduced in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Neil Taylor| title=Baltic Cities| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNsH-uJkUekC&amp;pg=PA84| year=2008| publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] | pages=84–85| isbn=9781841622477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Estophile enlightenment period (1750–1840)===
{{Main|Estophilia}}

Educated German immigrants and local [[Baltic Germans]] in Estonia, educated at German universities, introduced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality. The [[French Revolution]] provided a powerful motive for the enlightened local upper class to create literature for the peasantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstophileDictionary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Although Baltic Germans by and large regarded the future of the Estonians as being a fusion with the Baltic Germans, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers written in Estonian for the mass public.

===National awakening===
{{Main|Estonian national awakening}}
A cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.

1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of [[Russification]]. The impact of this was that many of the [[Baltic German]] legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian – a good example of this is the [[University of Tartu]].

As the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal [[suffrage|franchise]], and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

With the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[World War I]], [[Russian Provisional Government|Russia's Provisional Government]] granted national autonomy to a [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|unified Estonia]] in April. The [[Governorate of Estonia]] in the north (corresponding to the historic [[Danish Estonia]]) was united with the northern part of the [[Governorate of Livonia]]. Elections for a provisional parliament, ''[[Maapäev]]'', was organized, with the [[Menshevik]] and [[Bolshevik]] factions of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Estonian Bolshevik leader [[Jaan Anvelt]] violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maapäev in a coup d'état, forcing the Maapäev underground.

In February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the [[German Empire]], mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian [[Red Army]]'s retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council Maapäev issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EDoI1918&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |title=Estonian Declaration of Independence |date=24 February 1918 |work=www.president.ee |publisher=Estonian National Council |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522173844/http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pärnu]] on 23 February 1918.

After the collapse of the short-lived [[puppet government]] of the [[United Baltic Duchy]] and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an [[Estonian Provisional Government]] retook office. A military invasion by the Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918–1920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of the Red Army by February 1919. On 5–7 April 1919 the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected.

On 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the [[Russian SFSR]]. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The first [[Constitution of Estonia]] was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.

In nearby [[History of Finland|Finland]] similar circumstances resulted in a bloody civil war. Despite repeated threats from fascist movements, Finland became and remained a free democracy under the rule of law. By contrast Estonia, without a civil war, started as a democracy and was turned into a dictatorship in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Siaroff, &quot;Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland,&quot; ''[[Canadian Journal of Political Science]]'' Vol. 32, No. 1 (Mar. 1999), pp. 103–124 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a [[sovereign state]]. Economically and socially, [[land reform]] in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the [[Baltic nobility]] were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. Estonia's principal markets became [[Scandinavia]], the United Kingdom, and western Europe, with some exports to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]].

The first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a [[parliamentary]] form of government. The parliament (''[[Riigikogu]]'') consisted of 100 members elected for three-year terms. Between 1920 and 1934, Estonia had 21 governments.

A mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary [[Vaps Movement]] emerged in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBVaps&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623213/Vaps| title=Vaps| year = 2009| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1933 a [[referendum]] on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBVaps&quot;/&gt; The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a [[presidential system|presidential form of government]] and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive coup d'état on 12 March 1934, by [[Head of State of Estonia|Head of State]] [[Konstantin Päts]], who then established his own authoritarian rule until a new constitution came to force. During the [[Era of Silence]], political parties were banned, and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]] by Päts. The Vaps Movement was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an [[amnesty]] and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.

The interwar period was one of great cultural advancement.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to [[minority group]]s comprising at least 3,000 persons, including [[Jew]]s (see [[history of the Jews in Estonia]]). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly &quot;700-year German rule&quot; as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.

Estonia had pursued a policy of [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], but it was of no consequence after the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Finland]]), with Estonia falling in the Soviet &quot;[[sphere of influence]]&quot;. After the invasion of Poland, the [[Orzeł incident]] took place when Polish submarine [[ORP Orzeł (1938)|ORP ''Orzeł'']] looked for shelter in [[Tallinn]] but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of &quot;helping them escape&quot; and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country—an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.

Following the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], warships of the [[Red Navy]] appeared off Estonian ports on 24 September 1939, and Soviet bombers began a threatening patrol over [[Tallinn]] and the nearby countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;TM091939&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=9 October 1939|title=RUSSIA: Moscow's Week|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762664,00.html|accessdate=2009-09-20|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow demanded Estonia assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pabriks|Purs|Lane|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement on 28 September 1939.

'''Raymond Kanelba''' (1897–1960), also known as ''Rajmund Kanelba'', was a 20th-century [[Poland|Polish]] painter.

He was born in [[Warsaw]] and educated there as well as in [[Vienna]] and [[Paris]]. He was strongly influenced by the [[Paris School|école de Paris]] but with rather realistic and anti-impressionist style.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1926 his works were on display in [[Salon des Indépendants]] and [[Salon d'Automne]] and in 1952 he had a large exposition of his paintings in [[New York City]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

Rajmund Kanelba lived most of his life in [[France]] but died in [[London]].

[[File:Unit-interval.svg|thumb|The unit interval as a [[subset]] of the [[real line]]]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''unit interval''' is the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}}, that is, the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[real number]]s that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.  It is often denoted ''{{math|I}}'' (capital letter &lt;big&gt;&lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/big&gt;). In addition to its role in [[real analysis]], the unit interval is used to study [[homotopy theory]] in the field of [[topology]].

In the literature, the term &quot;unit interval&quot; is sometimes applied to the other shapes that an interval from 0 to 1 could take: {{open-closed|0,1}}, {{closed-open|0,1}}, and {{open-open|0,1}}.  However, the notation ''{{math|I}}'' is most commonly reserved for the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}}.

== Properties ==

The unit interval is a [[complete metric space]], [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[extended real number line]]. As a [[topological space]], it is [[compact space|compact]], [[contractible]], [[connectedness|path connected]] and [[Locally connected space|locally path connected]]. The [[Hilbert cube]] is obtained by taking a topological product of countably many copies of the unit interval. 

In [[mathematical analysis]], the unit interval is a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] analytical [[manifold]] whose boundary consists of the two points 0 and 1. Its standard [[orientability|orientation]] goes from 0 to 1. 

The unit interval is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] and a [[complete lattice]] (every subset of the unit interval has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]).

===Cardinality===
{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

The ''size'' or ''[[cardinality]]'' of a set is the number of elements it contains.

The unit interval is a [[subset]] of the [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. However, it has the same size as the whole set: the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Since the real numbers can be used to represent points along an [[Real line|infinitely long line]], this implies that a [[line segment]] of length 1, which is a part of that line, has the same number of points as the whole line. Moreover, it has the same number of points as a square of [[area]] 1, as a [[cube]] of [[volume]] 1, and even as an unbounded ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Space filling curve]]).

The number of elements (either real numbers or points) in all the above-mentioned sets is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]], as it is strictly greater than the number of [[natural number]]s.

== Generalizations ==
The interval [&amp;minus;1,1], with length two, demarcated by the positive and negative units, occurs frequently, such as in the [[range of a function|range]] of the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine and the [[hyperbolic function]] tanh. This interval may be used for the [[domain of a function|domain]] of [[inverse function]]s. For instance, when θ is restricted to [&amp;minus;π/2, π/2] then sin(θ) is in this interval and arcsine is defined there.

Sometimes, the term &quot;unit interval&quot; is used to refer to objects that play a role in various branches of mathematics analogous to the role that [0,1] plays in homotopy theory.  For example, in the theory of [[quiver (mathematics)|quiver]]s, the (analogue of the) unit interval is the graph whose vertex set is {0,1} and which contains a single edge ''e'' whose source is 0 and whose target is 1.  One can then define a notion of [[homotopy]] between quiver [[homomorphism]]s analogous to the notion of homotopy between [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps.

== Fuzzy logic ==
In [[logic]], the unit interval [0,1] can be interpreted as a generalization of the [[Boolean domain]] {0,1}, in which case rather than only taking values 0 or 1, any value between and including 0 and 1 can be assumed. Algebraically, negation (NOT) is replaced with &lt;math&gt;1-x&lt;/math&gt; ; conjunction (AND) is replaced with multiplication (&lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;); and disjunction (OR) is defined, per [[De Morgan's laws]], as &lt;math&gt;1-(1-x)(1-y)&lt;/math&gt; .

Interpreting these values as logical [[truth value]]s yields a [[multi-valued logic]], which forms the basis for [[fuzzy logic]] and [[probabilistic logic]]. In these interpretations, a value is interpreted as the &quot;degree&quot; of truth – to what extent a proposition is true, or the probability that the proposition is true.

'''Houyhnhnms''' are a fictional race of intelligent horses described in the last part of [[Jonathan Swift]]'s satirical 1726 novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. The name is pronounced either {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|ɪ|n|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɪ|n|əm}}.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Jones: ''English Pronouncing Dictionary.'' Cambridge/New York/Melbourne: Cambridge University Press 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-45272-4}}, {{ISBN|0-521-45903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift apparently intended all words of the Houyhnhnm language to echo the neighing of horses.

==Description==
[[File:Map of Houyhnhnms land.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Houyhnhnms Land (original map, Pt IV, ''Gulliver's Travels''), showing its location south of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (Australia).]]
Gulliver's visit to the Land of the Houyhnhnms is described in Part IV of his ''Travels'', and its location illustrated on the map at the start of Part IV.&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels'' (GT), part IV, ch 1: Oxford World Classic (OWC) p206&lt;/ref&gt;

The map shows Houyhnhnms Land to be south of Australia; it indicates [[Edel Land District|Edels Land]] and [[Cape Leeuwin|Lewins Land]] to the north, and [[Nuyts Land District|Nuyts Land]] to the north-east, on the mainland with the islands of [[St Francis Island|St Francis]] and [[St Peter Island (South Australia)|St Pieter]] further east, and Sweers, [[Maatsuyker Island|Maatsuyker]] and [[De Witt Island|De Wit]] islands to the east. The map is somewhat careless with the scale, however; Edels Land to Lewins Land are shown adjacent, while in reality they are some 1000&amp;nbsp;km apart, while the sweep of the Great Australian Bight, from Cape Leeuwin, Australia's south-westerly point to the [[Maatsuyker Islands]], off the southern tip of [[Tasmania]], is over 3000&amp;nbsp;km.

Gulliver describes the land as &quot;divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted but naturally growing&quot;, with a &quot;great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;GT Pt IV, ch 1: OWC p208&lt;/ref&gt;

The Houyhnhnms are rational [[equine]] beings and are masters of the land, contrasting strongly with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], savage [[humanoid]] creatures who are no better than  beasts of burden, or livestock. Whereas the Yahoos represent all that is bad about humans, Houyhnhnms have a settled, calm, reliable and rational society. Gulliver much prefers the Houyhnhnms' company to the Yahoos', even though the latter are biologically closer to him.

==Interpretation==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[File:The Servants Drive a Herd of Yahoos into the Field, from Gulliver's Travels.jpg|thumb|Houyhnhnms driving a herd of [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
[[File:Gulliver-taking-his-final-leave-of-the-land-of-the-houyhnhnms-sawrey-gilpin.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver Taking His Final Leave of the Land of the Houyhnhnms'', [[Sawrey Gilpin]], 1769]]
It is possible to interpret the Houyhnhnms in a number of different ways. One interpretation could be a sign of Swift's [[Liberalism in Europe|liberal]] views on race, or one could regard Gulliver's preference (and his immediate division of Houyhnhnms into color-based hierarchies) as absurd and the sign of his self-deception. It is now generally accepted that the story involving the Houynhnhnms embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the meaning of his existence in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jan, Firdaus|first=K. M., Shabam|title=Perspectives on Gulliver's Travels|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a modern context the story might be seen as presenting an early example of [[animal rights]] concerns, especially in Gulliver's account of how horses are cruelly treated in his society and the reversal of roles. The story is a possible inspiration for [[Pierre Boulle]]'s novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]''.

Book IV of ''Gulliver's Travels'' is the keystone, in some ways, of the entire work,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and critics have traditionally answered the question whether Gulliver is insane (and thus just another victim of Swift's satire) by questioning whether or not the Houyhnhnms are truly admirable. &lt;ref&gt;W. B. Carnochan: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4173404?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Williams: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2871830?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt; Gulliver loves the land and is obedient to a race that is not like his own. The Houyhnhnm society is based upon reason, and only upon [[logic|reason]], and therefore the horses practice [[eugenics]] based on their analyses of benefit and cost. They have no religion and their sole morality is the defence of reason, and so they are not particularly moved by pity or a belief in the intrinsic value of life. Gulliver himself, in their company, builds the sails of his skiff from &quot;Yahoo skins&quot;. The Houyhnhnms' lack of passion surfaces during the scheduled visit of &quot;a friend and his family&quot; to the home of Gulliver's master &quot;upon some affair of importance&quot;. On the day of the visit, the mistress of his friend and her children arrive very late. She made no excuses &quot;first for her husband&quot; who had passed just that morning and she had to remain to make the proper arrangements for a &quot;convenient place where his body should be laid&quot;. Gulliver remarked that &quot;she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest&quot;. A further example of the lack of humanity and emotion in the Houyhnhnms is that their laws reason that each couple produce two children, one male and one female. In the event that a marriage produced two offspring of the same sex, the parents would take their children to the annual meeting and trade one with a couple who produced two children of the opposite sex. This was viewed as his spoofing and or criticising the notion that the &quot;ideal&quot; family produces children of both sexes. [[George Orwell]] viewed the Houyhnhnm society as one whose members try to be as close to dead as possible while alive and matter as little as possible in life and death.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell: ''[http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/swift/english/e_swift Politics vs. Literature — An examination of Gulliver's travels]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand, the Houyhnhnms have an orderly and peaceful society. They have philosophy and a language that is entirely free of political and ethical nonsense. They have no word for a ''lie'' (and must substitute a circumlocution: &quot;to say a thing which is not&quot;). They also have a form of art that is derived from nature. Outside ''Gulliver's Travels'', Swift had expressed longstanding concern over the corruption of the [[English language]], and he had proposed language reform. He had also, in ''[[Battle of the Books]]'' and in general in ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', expressed a preference for the Ancients (Classical authors) because their art was based directly upon nature, and not upon other art.

On the other hand, Swift was profoundly mistrustful of attempts at reason that resulted in either [[hubris]] (for example, the Projectors satirised in ''A Tale of a Tub'' or in Book III of ''Gulliver's Travels'') or immorality (such as the speaker of ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', who offers an entirely logical and wholly immoral proposal for [[cannibalism]]). The Houyhnhnms embody both the good and the bad side of reason, for they have the pure language Swift wished for and the amorally rational approach to solving the problems of humanity (Yahoos); the extirpation of the Yahoo population by the horses is very like the speaker of ''A Modest Proposal''.

In the shipping lanes he is rescued by a [[Pedro de Mendez|Portuguese sea captain]], a level-headed individual albeit full of concern for others, whose temperament at one level appears intermediate between the calm, rational Houyhnhnms of Houyhnhnmland and the norm of corrupt, European humanity, which Gulliver no longer distinguishes from Houyhnhnmland's wild Yahoos. Gulliver can speak with him, and though now disaffected from all humanity, he began to tolerate his company. Gulliver is returned to his home and family, finds their smell and look intolerable and all his countrymen no better than &quot;Yahoos&quot;, purchases and converses with two stabled horses, tolerating the stable boy, and assures the reader of his account's utter veracity.

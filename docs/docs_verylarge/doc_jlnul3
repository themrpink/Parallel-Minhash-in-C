===Storage===
After combining, the oats are transported to the farmyard using a grain truck, semi, or [[road train]], where they are [[Screw conveyor|auger]]ed or [[conveyor|conveyed]] into a [[grain bin|bin]] for storage. Sometimes, when there is not enough bin space, they are augered into portable grain rings, or piled on the ground. Oats can be safely stored at 12–14% moisture; at higher moisture levels, they must be [[aerate]]d or dried.

===Yield and quality===
[[File:Avena sativa 004.JPG|thumb|left|Oat seeds]]

In the United States, No.1 oats weigh {{convert|36|lb/USbu|0}}; No. 2 oats must weigh {{convert|33|lb/USbu|0}}. No.3 oats must weigh at least {{convert|30|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}}. If {{convert|27|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}}, they are graded as No.4, and oats under {{convert|27|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}} are graded as &quot;light weight&quot;. 

In Canada, No.1 oats weigh {{convert|42.64|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}}; No.2 oats must weigh {{convert|40.18|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}}; No.3 oats must weigh at least {{convert|38.54|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}} and if oats are lighter than {{convert|36.08|lb/USbu|0|abbr=on}} they do not make No.4 oats and have no grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/oggg-gocg/07/oggg-gocg-7e-eng.htm|title=Oats – Chapter 7 – Official Grain Grading Guide – 5 / 7 |publisher=Grainscanada.gc.ca |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oats are bought and sold and yields on the basis of a bushel equal to {{convert|32|lb|1|disp=x| (}} or {{convert|32|lb/USbu|abbr=on|0|disp=output only}}) in the United States, and a bushel equal to {{convert|34|lb|1|disp=x| (}} or {{convert|34|lb/USbu|abbr=on|0|disp=output only}}) in Canada. &quot;Bright oats&quot; were sold on the basis of a bushel equal to {{convert|48|lb|1|disp=x| (}} or {{convert|48|lb/USbu|abbr=on|0|disp=output only}}) in the United States.

Yields range from {{convert|60|to(-)|80|USbu/acre}} on marginal land, to {{convert|100|to(-)|150|USbu/acre}} on high-producing land. The average production is 100 bushels per acre, or 3.5 tonnes per hectare. Straw yields are variable, ranging from one to three tonnes per hectare, mainly due to available nutrients and the variety used (some are short-strawed, meant specifically for straight combining).

=== Genetics and breeding ===
''Avena sativa'' is an [[Polyploidy#Allopolyploidy|allohexaploid]] plant with 3 ancestral [[genomes]] (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latta |first1=Robert G. |last2=Bekele |first2=Wubishet A. |last3=Wight |first3=Charlene P. |last4=Tinker |first4=Nicholas A. |title=Comparative linkage mapping of diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid Avena species suggests extensive chromosome rearrangement in ancestral diploids |journal=Scientific Reports |date=23 August 2019 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=12298 |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-48639-7 |pmid=31444367 |pmc=6707241 |bibcode=2019NatSR...912298L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hexaploid genome is challenging to sequence and the [https://avenagenome.org/ oat genome seqencing project] is focusing on diploid species at first. Species within [[Avena]] can [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridize]] and [[genes]] [[introgression|introgressed]] from other &quot;A&quot; genome species has contributed with many valuable traits, like [[Rust_(fungus)|crown rust]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maughan |first1=Peter J. |last2=Lee |first2=Rebekah |last3=Walstead |first3=Rachel |last4=Vickerstaff |first4=Robert J. |last5=Fogarty |first5=Melissa C. |last6=Brouwer |first6=Cory R. |last7=Reid |first7=Robert R. |last8=Jay |first8=Jeremy J. |last9=Bekele |first9=Wubishet A. |last10=Jackson |first10=Eric W. |last11=Tinker |first11=Nicholas A. |last12=Langdon |first12=Tim |last13=Schlueter |first13=Jessica A. |last14=Jellen |first14=Eric N. |title=Genomic insights from the first chromosome-scale assemblies of oat (Avena spp.) diploid species |journal=BMC Biology |date=22 November 2019 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=92 |doi=10.1186/s12915-019-0712-y |pmid=31757219 |pmc=6874827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to do introgression of traits in oats from very wide [[Hybrid_(biology)#Taxonomy|intergeneric hybridization]]. In contrast to [[wheat]], oats sometimes retain [[chromosomes]] from [[maize]] or [[pearl millet]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal| issn = 0032-0889| volume = 125| issue = 3| pages = 1216–1227| last1 = Kynast| first1 = Ralf G| last2 = Riera-Lizarazu| first2 = Oscar| last3 = Vales| first3 = M Isabel| last4 = Okagaki| first4 = Ron J| last5 = Maquieira| first5 = Silvia B| last6 = Chen| first6 = Gang| last7 = Ananiev| first7 = Evgueni V| last8 = Odland| first8 = Wade E| last9 = Russell| first9 = Charles D| last10 = Stec| first10 = Adrian O| title = A complete set of maize individual chromosome additions to the oat genome| journal = Plant Physiology| date = 2001| doi = 10.1104/pp.125.3.1216| pmid = 11244103| pmc = 65602}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00497-012-0205-4| issn = 2194-7961| volume = 26| issue = 1| pages = 25–32| last1 = Ishii| first1 = Takayoshi| last2 = Tanaka| first2 = Hiroyuki| last3 = Eltayeb| first3 = Amin Elsadig| last4 = Tsujimoto| first4 = Hisashi| title = Wide hybridization between oat and pearl millet belonging to different subfamilies of Poaceae| journal = Plant Reproduction| date = 2013-03-01| s2cid = 16650726}} &lt;/ref&gt;
These wide crosses are typically made in order to generate [[doubled haploid]] breeding material where the rapid loss of the alien chromosomes from the unrelated pollen donor results in a plant with only a single set of chromosomes (a [[haploid]]).
The [[addition lines]] with alien chromosomes can be used as a source for novel traits in oats, for example has research on Oat-Maize-Addition lines (OMAs) been used to map genes involved in [[C4 photosynthesis]]. In order to obtain [[mendelian]] inheritance of these novel traits, also [[Radiation_hybrid_mapping|radiation hybrid]] lines have been established, where maize chromosome segments have been introgressed in the oat genome. Interestingly, these techniques which potentially transfers thousands of genes from a species that is very distantly related is not considered a [[GMO]] according to the [[European Union]] definition, since sexual hybridization and radiation-induced introgression are explicitly excluded from the definition.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/jsfa.9227| issn = 0022-5142| volume = 99| issue = 1| pages = 8–12| last = Halford| first = Nigel G| title = Legislation governing genetically modified and genome‐edited crops in Europe: the need for change| journal = Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture| date = 2019-01-15| pmid = 29952140| pmc = 6492171}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
{{unsourced section|date=June 2020}}
[[File:Porridge oats.JPG|thumb|right|[[Porridge]] oats before cooking]]

Oats processing is a relatively simple process:

===Cleaning and sizing===
Upon delivery to the milling plant, the oats are cleaned, removing the chaff and items such as rocks, metal, oversized materials, and other grains.  Oats of different sizes de-hull at differing velocities.  So, once impurities have been removed, the raw oats are separated by width and length into different classifications before de-hulling.

===Dehulling===
Centrifugal acceleration is used to separate the outer hull from the inner oat groat. Oats are fed by gravity onto the centre of a horizontally spinning impeller, which accelerates them towards an outer mill ring. Groats and hulls are separated on impact. The lighter oat hulls are then aspirated away, while the denser oat groats are taken to the next step of processing. Oat hulls can be used as feed or as a biomass fuel and are often used within the oat processing line to power solid fuel boilers for steam and power generation. Excess oat hulls are generally pelletised before being provided as feed.

===Kilning===
The unsized oat groats pass through a heat and moisture treatment to balance moisture for optimal storage conditions and to deactivate self catalysing enzyme activity. Oat groats are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins to break down the fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an [[Off-flavours|off-flavour]] or [[rancidity]]. Depending on temperature, humidity and moisture content, de-hulled oats can begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity rapidly if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.

===Sizing of groats===
Many whole oat groats break during the dehulling process, leaving the following types of groats to be sized and separated for further processing: whole oat groats, coarse steel cut groats, steel cut groats, and fine steel cut groats. Groats are sized and separated using screens, shakers and indent screens. After the whole oat groats are separated, the remaining broken groats get sized again into the three groups (coarse, regular, fine), and then stored. &quot;Steel cut&quot; refers to all sized or cut groats. When not enough broken groats are available to size for further processing, whole oat groats are sent to a cutting unit with steel blades that evenly cut groats into the three sizes above.

===Final processing===
Three methods are used to make the finished product:

====Flaking====
This process uses two large smooth or corrugated rolls spinning at the same speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance, before which the cut groats are conditioned for flaking via steam injection. After flaking, the oats are then dried to a sufficient moisture for storage and transport. Oat flake thickness is a key control point dependant of the type of oat flakes to be produced. Typically, the flakes produced are either instant, quick or traditional whole rolled oats and range in size from 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Oat bran milling====
This process takes the oat groats through several roll stands to flatten and separate the bran from the flour (endosperm). The two separate products (flour and bran) get sifted through a gyrating sifter screen to further separate them. The final products are oat bran and debranned oat flour.

====Whole flour milling====
This process takes oat groats straight to a grinding unit (stone or hammer mill) and then over sifter screens to separate the coarse flour and final whole oat flour. The coarser flour is sent back to the grinding unit until it is ground fine enough to be whole oat flour. This method is used often in India and other countries. In India, whole grain oat flour ('''jai''') is used to make Indian bread known as '''jarobra''' in [[Himachal Pradesh]].

====Preparation at home====
Oat flour can be ground for small scale use by pulsing [[rolled oats]] or old-fashioned (not quick) oats in a [[food processor]] or spice mill.&lt;ref&gt;The Sparkpeople cookbook: love your food, lose the weight, Galvin, M., Romnie, S., May House Inc, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-4019-3132-2}}, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-oat-flour.htm &quot;What is oat flour?&quot;] wiseGeek.com.

'''Rye''' (''Secale cereale'') is a [[Poaceae|grass]] grown extensively as a [[grain]], a [[cover crop]] and a [[forage]] crop. It is a member of the wheat [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] ([[Triticeae]]) and is closely related to both [[wheat]] (''Triticum'') and [[barley]] (genus ''Hordeum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/plantsciences/uwplant/forages/small-grains/rye.html|title=Forage Identification: Rye|date=September 26, 2017|website=University of Wyoming: Department of Plant Sciences|access-date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rye grain is used for [[flour]], [[rye bread|bread]], [[rye beer|beer]], [[crispbread]], some [[rye whiskey|whiskeys]], some [[vodka]]s, and animal [[fodder]]. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to [[rolled oats]].

Rye is a [[Cereal|cereal grain]] and should not be confused with [[Lolium|ryegrass]], which is used for lawns, pasture, and hay for livestock.

Rye is one of a number of species that grow wild in central and eastern [[Turkey]] and in adjacent areas. Domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at a number of [[Neolithic]] sites in Asia Minor ([[Anatolia]], now Turkey), such as the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] [[Can hassan|Can Hasan III]] near [[Çatalhöyük]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hillman |first1 = Gordon |title = On the Origins of Domestic rye: Secale Cereale: The Finds from Aceramic Can Hasan III in Turkey |journal = Anatolian Studies |date = 1978 |volume = 28 |pages = 157–174 |doi = 10.2307/3642748 |jstor = 3642748 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidhu&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sidhu |first1 = Jagdeep |last2 = Ramakrishnan|first2 = Sai Mukund|first3 = Ali|last3 = Shaukat|first4 = Bernado|last4 = Amy|last5 = Bai| first5 = Guihua| last6 = Sidrat| first6 = Abdullah| last7 = Ayana| first7 = Girma| last8 = Sehgal| first8 = Sunish|title = Assessing the genetic diversity and characterizing genomic regions conferring Tan Spot resistance in cultivated rye |journal = PLOS ONE |date = 2019 |volume = 14 |issue = 3 |pages = e0214519 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0214519 |pmid = 30921415 |pmc = 6438500|bibcode = 2019PLoSO..1414519S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is otherwise absent from the archaeological record until the [[Bronze Age]] of central Europe, c. 1800–1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZoharyHopf2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Zohary |first1 = Daniel |last2 = Hopf |first2 = Maria |last3 = Weiss |first3 = Ehud |title = Domestication of Plants in the Old World: The Origin and Spread of Domesticated Plants in Southwest Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1hHSYoqY-AwC&amp;pg=PA62 |date = 2012 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford |isbn = 978-0-19-954906-1 |page = 62 |via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that rye traveled west from Asia Minor as a minor admixture in wheat (possibly as a result of [[Vavilovian mimicry]]), and was only later cultivated in its own right.&lt;ref name=&quot;McElroy 2014 pp. 207–216&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=McElroy | first=J.

Since the [[Middle Ages]] people have cultivated rye widely in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. It serves as the main [[bread]] cereal in most areas east of the [[France–Germany border]] and north of [[Hungary]]. In Southern Europe, it was cultivated on marginal lands.

Winter rye is any breed of rye planted in the fall to provide ground cover for the winter. It grows during warmer days of the winter when sunlight temporarily warms the plant above freezing, even while there is general snow cover. It can be used to prevent the growth of [[winter-hardy]] weeds,&lt;ref name=&quot;weed manage&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Burgos |first1 = Nilda R. |last2 = Talbert |first2 = Ronald E. |last3 = Kuk |first3 = Yong In |editor1-last = Sing |editor1-first = Harinder P. |editor2-last = Batish |editor2-first = Daisy Rani |editor3-last = Kohli |editor3-first = Ravinder Kumar |title = Handbook of Sustainable Weed Management |date = 2006 |publisher = Haworth Press, Inc |location = New York |isbn = 978-1-56022-957-5 |page = 110 |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Az-qoHPCnvYC&amp;pg=PA110 |chapter = Grass-legume mixed cover crops for weed management }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can either be harvested as a bonus crop or tilled directly into the ground in spring to provide more organic matter for the next summer's crop. It is sometimes used in [[winter garden]]s and is a common [[nurse crop]].

Rye is grown primarily in Eastern, Central and Northern [[Europe]]. The main rye belt stretches from northern [[Germany]] through [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] into central and northern [[Russia]]. Rye is also grown in North America ([[Canada]] and the United States), in South America ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]), in Oceania ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]), in Turkey, in [[Kazakhstan]] and in northern [[China]].

Production levels of rye have fallen in most of the producing nations, as of 2012. For instance, production of rye in Russia fell from 13.9 million metric tons (t) in 1992 to 2.1 t in 2012. Corresponding figures for other countries are as follows: Poland – falling from 5.9 t in 1992 to 2.9 t in 2005; Germany – 3.3 t to 3.9 t; Belarus – 3.1 t to 1.1 t; China – 1.7 t to 0.7 t.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/commodity.html?lang=en&amp;item=71&amp;year=2005 |title = Major Food and Agricultural Commodities and Producers: Countries by Commodity |work = FAO.org |publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date = 2005 |access-date = January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World trade of rye is low compared with other grains such as wheat. The total export of rye for 2016 was $186M&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/show/all/100200/2016/ OEC - Countries that export Rye (2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; compared with $30.1B for wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/show/all/100190/2016/ OEC - Countries that export Wheat except durum wheat, and meslin (2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland consumes the most rye per person at 32.4&amp;nbsp;kg/capita (2009). Nordic and Baltic countries are also very high. The EU in general is around 5.6&amp;nbsp;kg/capita. The entire world only consumes 0.9&amp;nbsp;kg/capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ryeandhealth.org/statistics-a-usage Statistics and Usage - www.ryeandhealth.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rye grain is refined into a [[flour]]. Rye flour is high in [[gliadin]] but low in [[glutenin]]. It therefore has a lower [[gluten]] content than [[wheat]] flour. It also contains a higher proportion of [[soluble fiber]]. [[Alkylresorcinol]]s are phenolic lipids present in high amounts in the bran layer (e.g. [[pericarp]], [[Testa (botany)|testa]] and [[aleurone]] layers) of wheat and rye (0.1–0.3% of dry weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Suzuki |first1 = Yoshikatsu |last2 = Esumi |first2 = Yasuaki |last3 = Yamaguchi |first3 = Isamu |date = 1999 |title = Structures of 5-alkylresorcinol-related analogues in rye |journal = Phytochemistry |volume = 52 |issue = 2 |pages = 281–289 |doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00196-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rye bread]], including [[pumpernickel]], is made using rye flour and is a widely eaten food in Northern and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakkerijmuseum.nl/kalwiblo/index.php?t=2&amp;h=5&amp;s=8#Minderwaardig &quot;Grains: Rye&quot;]   ('''in Dutch''') bakkerijmuseum.nl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rye bread&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Prättälä |first1 = Ritva |last2 = Helasoja |first2 = Ville |last3 = Mykkänen |first3= Hannu |title = The consumption of rye bread and white bread as dimensions of health lifestyles in Finland |journal = Public Health Nutrition |date = 2000 |volume = 4 |issue = 3 |pages = 813–819 |doi = 10.1079/PHN2000120 |pmid = 11415489 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rye is also used to make [[crisp bread]].

Rye grain is used to make alcoholic drinks, such as [[rye whiskey]] and [[rye beer]]. Other uses of rye grain include [[kvass]] and an [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] known as rye extract. Rye [[straw]] is used as [[bedding (animals)|livestock bedding]], as a [[cover crop]] and [[green manure]] for [[soil amendment]], and to make [[craft]]s such as [[corn dolly|corn dollies]].

==  Physical characteristics ==
Physical properties of rye affect attributes of the final food product such as seed size and surface area, and porosity. The surface area of the seed directly correlates to the drying and heat transfer time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Jouki, Mohammad; Emam-Djomeh, Zahra; and Khazaei, Naimeh (2012) &quot;Physical Properties of Whole Rye Seed (Secale cereal),&quot; International Journal of Food Engineering: Vol. 8: Iss. 4, Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller seeds have increased heat transfer, which leads to lower drying time. Seeds with lower amounts of porosity also have lower tendencies to lose water during the process of drying.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Written after his first daughter's birth, he distilled his feelings about being married and a father for the first time: &quot;Blue days, all of them gone; nothing but blue skies, from now on.&quot;&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt; The song was introduced by Belle Baker in ''Betsy'', a Ziegfeld production.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It became a hit recording for [[Ben Selvin]] and one of several Berlin hits in 1927. It was performed by [[Al Jolson]] in the first feature sound film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', that same year. In 1946, it returned to the top 10 on the charts with [[Count Basie]] and [[Benny Goodman]]. In 1978, [[Willie Nelson]] made the song a no. 1 country hit, 52 years after it was written.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;&quot;[[Puttin' On the Ritz]]&quot; (1928)
An instant standard with one of Berlin's most &quot;intricately syncopated choruses&quot;, this song is associated with [[Fred Astaire]], who sang and danced to it in the 1946 film ''Blue Skies''. The song was written in 1928 with a separate set of lyrics and was introduced by [[Harry Richman]] in 1930 of the same name. In 1939, [[Clark Gable]] sang it in the movie ''Idiot's Delight''. In 1974 it was featured in the movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mel Brooks]], and was a no. 4 hit for the techno artist [[Taco Ockerse|Taco]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_W5QnO5UGk|title=Taco - Puttin on the Ritz (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was used for a [[flash mob]] wedding event in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNXd3wX_USc|title=Flashmob Moscow (Russia) : Putting on the ritz 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;&quot;Marie&quot; (1929)
This waltz-time song was a hit for [[Rudy Vallée]] in 1929, and in 1937, updated to a four-quarter-time [[swing music|swing]] arrangement, was a top hit for [[Tommy Dorsey]]. It was on the charts at no. 13 in 1953 for [[The Four Tunes]] and at no. 15 for [[the Bachelors]] in 1965, 36 years after its first appearance.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;&quot;Say It Isn't So&quot; (1932)
Rudy Vallée performed it on his radio show, and the song was a hit for [[George Olsen]], [[Connee Boswell]] (she was still known as Connie), and [[Ozzie Nelson]]'s band. [[Aretha Franklin]] produced a single of the song in 1963, 31 years later.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Furia notes that when Vallée first introduced the song on his radio show, the &quot;song not only became an overnight hit, it saved Vallée's marriage: The Vallées had planned to get a divorce, but after Vallée sang Berlin's romantic lyrics on the air, &quot;both he and his wife dissolved in tears&quot; and decided to stay together.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;

;&quot;I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (1937)
Performed by [[Dick Powell]] in the 1937 film ''On the Avenue''. Later it had four top-12 versions, including by [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], who took it to no. 1.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

The song was written by Berlin twenty years earlier, but he filed it away until 1938 when [[Kate Smith]] needed a patriotic song to mark the 20th anniversary of [[Armistice Day]], celebrating the end of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Its release near the end of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], which had by then gone on for nine years, enshrined a &quot;strain of official patriotism intertwined with a religious faith that runs deep in the American psyche,&quot; stated ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-87&quot;/&gt;

Berlin's daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, states that the song was actually &quot;very personal&quot; for her father, and was intended as an expression of his deep gratitude to the nation for merely &quot;allowing&quot; him, an immigrant raised in poverty, to become a successful songwriter.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{YouTube|9p-h-Ml-cXU|&quot;Irving Berlin Spotlight Interview&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;To me,&quot; said Berlin, &quot;'God Bless America' was not just a song but an expression of my feeling toward the country to which I owe what I have and what I am.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Galewitz, Herb.

The song was heard after September 11, 2001, as U.S. senators and congressmen stood on the capitol steps and sang it after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It is often played by sports teams such as major league baseball. The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hockey team started playing it before crucial contests. When the 1980 [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|U.S. Olympic hockey team]] pulled off the &quot;greatest upset in sports history,&quot; referred to as the &quot;[[Miracle on Ice]]&quot;, the players spontaneously sang it as Americans were overcome by patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, John U.

====Other songs====
Though most of his works for the Broadway stage took the form of revues—collections of songs with no unifying plot—he did write a number of book shows. ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929) was a light comedy with a cast featuring, among others, the [[Marx Brothers]]. ''[[Face the Music (musical)|Face the Music]]'' (1932) was a political satire with a book by [[Moss Hart]], and ''[[Louisiana Purchase (musical)|Louisiana Purchase]]'' (1940) was a satire of a Southern politician obviously based on the exploits of [[Huey Long]]. ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933) was a revue, also with book by Moss Hart, with a theme: each number was presented as an item in a newspaper, some of them touching on issues of the day. The show yielded a succession of hit songs, including &quot;[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]&quot; sung by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb, &quot;[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]]&quot; (presented as the weather forecast), &quot;Harlem on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;[[Supper Time]]&quot;, a song about racial violence inspired by a newspaper headline about a lynching, sung by [[Ethel Waters]]. She once said about the song, &quot;If one song can tell the whole tragic history of a race, 'Supper Time' was that song. In singing it I was telling my comfortable, well-fed, well-dressed listeners about my people...those who had been slaves and those who were now downtrodden and oppressed.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/hiseyeisonsparro00wate_0| title=His eye is on the sparrow: an autobiography| last1=Waters| first1=Ethel| author2=Charles Samuels| date=March 22, 1992| publisher=Da Capo Press| isbn=978-0306804779| edition=1st| location=New York| url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II patriotism—&quot;This is the Army&quot; (1943)====
[[File:Irving Berlin aboard the USS Arkansas, 944.jpg|thumb|Irving Berlin singing and conducting aboard [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS Arkansas]], 1944]]
Berlin loved his country, and wrote many songs reflecting his patriotism. Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] requested a song to inspire Americans to buy [[war bond]]s, for which he wrote &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; He assigned all royalties to the [[United States Treasury Department]]. He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: &quot;Angels of Mercy&quot; for the [[American Red Cross]]; &quot;Arms for the Love of America&quot;, for the [[Army Ordnance Department]]; and &quot;I Paid My Income Tax Today,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/57008.html Danny Kaye's Musical Tribute to the Income Tax], George Mason's History News Network, November 14, 2008, retrieved April 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; again to Treasury.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

When the United States joined [[World War II]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Berlin immediately began composing a number of patriotic songs. His most notable and valuable contribution to the war effort was a stage show he wrote called &quot;[[This Is The Army (musical)|This Is The Army]]&quot;. It was taken to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and then on to [[Washington, D.C.]] (where President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attended). It was eventually shown at military bases throughout the world, including London, North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and Pacific countries, sometimes in close proximity to battle zones. Berlin wrote nearly three dozen songs for the show which contained a cast of 300 men. He supervised the production and traveled with it, always singing &quot;[[Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning]]&quot;. The show kept him away from his family for three and a half years, during which time he took neither salary nor expenses, and turned over all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The play was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1943, directed by [[Michael Curtiz]], co-starring [[Joan Leslie]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], who was then an army lieutenant. [[Kate Smith]] also sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe.&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett/&gt; The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army,&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the [[Medal for Merit]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]]. His daughter, [[Mary Ellin Barrett]], who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of &quot;[[This is the Army]]&quot; on Broadway, remembered that when her father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier's garb to sing &quot;Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,&quot; he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes. She adds that he was in his mid-50s at the time, and later declared those years with the show were the &quot;most thrilling time of his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/books/books-of-the-times-recalling-the-somber-man-behind-so-many-happy-songs.html &quot;BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Recalling the Somber Man Behind So Many Happy Songs&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (book review), January 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1946)====
The grueling tours Berlin did performing &quot;This Is The Army&quot; left him exhausted, but when his old and close friend [[Jerome Kern]], who was the composer for [[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|&quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;]], died suddenly, producers [[Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]] persuaded Berlin to take over composing the score.

{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=What distinguishes Berlin is the brilliance of his lyrics. 'You Can't Get a Man With a Gun'—that's as good a comic song as has ever been written by anybody. You look at the jokes and how quickly they're told, and it still has a plot to it. It's sophisticated and very underrated.|source= — composer-lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]]&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/magazine/conversations-with-sondheim.html &quot;Conversations With Sondheim&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]],'' March 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGB7yTZEZE4|title=Betty Hutton sings &quot;You Can't Get A Man With A Gun&quot;|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Loosely based on the life of sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]], the music and lyrics were written by Berlin, with a book by [[Herbert Fields]] and his sister [[Dorothy Fields]], and directed by [[Joshua Logan]]. At first Berlin refused to take on the job, claiming that he knew nothing about &quot;[[hillbilly]] music&quot;, but the show ran for 1,147 performances and became his most successful score. It is said that the showstopper song, &quot;[[There's No Business Like Show Business (song)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]&quot;, was almost left out of the show altogether because Berlin mistakenly thought that Rodgers and Hammerstein didn't like it. However, it became the &quot;ultimate uptempo show tune.&quot;

On the origin of another of the play's leading songs, Logan described how he and Hammerstein privately discussed wanting another duet between Annie and Frank. Berlin overheard their conversation, and although the show was to go into rehearsal within days, he wrote the song [[Anything You Can Do (song)|&quot;Anything You Can Do&quot;]] a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudOp3XGZNA| title=Ethel Merman, Joshua Logan, 90th Birthday Tribute to Irving Berlin| publisher=YouTube| access-date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer commented about the play's score, that &quot;its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines that have been copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt; Singer and musicologist, Susannah McCorkle writes that the score &quot;meant more to me than ever, now that I knew that he wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters.&quot;&lt;ref name=McCorkle&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McCorkle |first=Susannah |title=Always: A Singer's Journey Through the Life of Irving Berlin |magazine=American Heritage |date=November 1998 |volume=49 |pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} Historian and composer [[Alec Wilder]] says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was &quot;a profound shock.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;{{rp|94}}

Apparently the &quot;creative spurt&quot; in which Berlin turned out several songs for the score in a single weekend was an anomaly. According to his daughter, he usually &quot;sweated blood&quot; to write his songs.&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett/&gt; ''Annie Get Your Gun'' is considered to be Berlin's best musical theatre score not only because of the number of hits it contains, but because its songs successfully combine character and plot development. The song &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business&quot; became &quot;[[Ethel Merman]]'s trademark.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

====Final shows====
Berlin's next show, ''[[Miss Liberty]]'' (1949), was disappointing, but ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' in 1950, starring [[Ethel Merman]] as Sally Adams, a Washington, D.C. socialite, loosely based on the famous Washington hostess [[Perle Mesta]], fared better, giving him his second greatest success. Berlin made two attempts to write a musical about his friend, the colorful [[Addison Mizner]], and Addison's [[con man]] brother [[Wilson Mizner|Wilson]]. The first was the uncompleted ''The Last Resorts'' (1952); a manuscript of Act I is in the [[Library of Congress]]. ''[[Wise Guy (musical)|Wise Guy]]'' (1956) was completed but never produced, although songs have been published and recorded on ''The Unsung Irving Berlin'' (1995). After a failed attempt at retirement, in 1962, at the age of 74, he returned to Broadway  with ''[[Mr. President (musical)|Mr. President]]''. Although it ran for eight months, (with the premiere attended by President [[John F. Kennedy]]), it was not one of his successful plays.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

Afterwards, Berlin officially announced his retirement and spent his remaining years in New York. He did, however, write one new song, &quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding,&quot; for the 1966 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' starring [[Ethel Merman]]. Though he lived 23 more years, this was one of Berlin's final published compositions.

Berlin maintained a low profile through the last decades of his life, almost never appearing in public after the late 1960s, even for events held in his honor. However, he continued to maintain control of his songs through his own music publishing company, which remained in operation for the rest of his life.

==Film scores==

===1920s–1950s===

In 1927, his song &quot;[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]&quot;, was featured in the first feature-length [[talkie]], ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', with [[Al Jolson]]. Later, movies such as ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935) became the first of a series of distinctive film musicals by Berlin starring performers [[Bing Crosby]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Alice Faye]]. ''Top Hat'' featured a brand new score, as did several more, including ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[On the Avenue]]'' (1937), ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938), and ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939). Starting with ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'' (1938), he often blended new songs with existing ones from his catalog. He continued this process with the films ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942), ''[[Blue Skies (1946 film)|Blue Skies]]'' (1946) and ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Fred Astaire]], and ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====&quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942)====
The 1942 film ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' introduced &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot;, one of the most recorded songs in history. First sung in the film by [[Bing Crosby]] (along with [[Marjorie Reynolds]], whose voice was dubbed by [[Martha Mears]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-marjorie-reynolds-1278697.html| title=Obituary: Marjorie Reynolds| date=1997-02-15| work=The Independent| location=London| access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it has sold over 50 million records and stayed no. 1 on the pop and R&amp;B charts for 10 weeks. Crosby's version is the [[List of best selling singles|best-selling single]] of all time. Music critic [[Stephen Holden]] credits this partly to the fact that &quot;the song also evokes a primal nostalgia—a pure childlike longing for roots, home and childhood—that goes way beyond the greeting imagery.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] also notes that the song was even more significant having been released soon after America entered [[World War II]]: [it] &quot;connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth....&quot;&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Poet [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote, &quot;We have learned to be a little sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. &quot;I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When we sing that we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace.&quot;&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

&quot;White Christmas&quot; won Berlin the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Music in an Original Song, one of seven Oscar nominations he received during his career. In subsequent years, it was re-recorded and became a top-10 seller for numerous artists: [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jo Stafford]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[The Ravens]] and [[The Drifters]]. It would also be the last time a Berlin song went to no. 1 upon its release.

Berlin is the only Academy Award presenter and Academy Award winner to open the &quot;envelope&quot; and read his or her own name (for &quot;White Christmas&quot;). This result was so awkward for Berlin (since he had to present the Oscar to himself) that the Academy changed the rules of protocol the following year to prevent this situation from arising again.

Talking about Irving Berlin's &quot;White Christmas&quot;, composer–lyricist Garrison Hintz stated that although songwriting can be a complicated process, its final result should sound simplistic. Considering the fact that &quot;White Christmas&quot; has only eight sentences in the entire song, lyrically Mr. Berlin achieved all that was necessary to eventually sell over 100 million copies and capture the hearts of the American public at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Ascap magazine article, Tribute to Irving Berlin December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songwriting methods==
According to Saul Bornstein (a.k.a. Sol Bourne, Saul Bourne), Berlin's publishing company manager, &quot;It was a ritual for Berlin to write a complete song, words and music, every day.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilder&gt;Wilder, Alec. ''American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950'', Oxford Univ. Press (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}} Berlin said that he &quot;did not believe in inspiration,&quot; and felt that although he may be gifted in certain areas, his &quot;most successful compositions were the &quot;result of work.&quot; He said that he did most of his work under pressure. He would typically begin writing after dinner and continue until 4 or 5 in the morning. &quot;Each day I would attend rehearsals,&quot; he said, &quot;and at night write another song and bring it down the next day.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-1916/&gt;

Not always certain about his own writing abilities, he once asked a songwriter friend, [[Victor Herbert]], whether he should study composition. &quot;You have a natural gift for words and music,&quot; Mr. Herbert told him. &quot;Learning theory might help you a little, but it could cramp your style.&quot; Berlin took his advice. Herbert later became a moving force behind the creation of ASCAP, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. In 1914, Berlin joined him as a charter member of the organization that has protected the royalties of composers and writers ever since.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; In 1920, Irving Berlin became a member of [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]], the French Society of Authors, Composers, and Publishers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In later years, Berlin emphasized his conviction, saying that &quot;it's the lyrics that makes a song a hit, although the tune, of course, is what makes it last.&quot;&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt;{{rp|234}} He played almost entirely in the key of [[F-sharp major|F sharp]] so that he could stay on the black notes and owned three [[transposing piano]]s so as to change keys by moving a lever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2664/if-irving-berlin-could-not-read-or-write-music-how-did-he-compose|title=The Straight Dope: If Irving Berlin couldn't read or write music, how did he compose?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Berlin eventually learned to write music, he never changed his method of dictating songs to a &quot;musical secretary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Irving Berlin reader|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Sears, Benjamin.|isbn=978-0195383744|location=New York|oclc=708648754}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Berlin never learned to play in more than one key and used two special pianos (his first piano, purchased second-hand in 1909, was made by Weser Brothers, augmented in 1921 by a second from Somner Brothers) with transposing levers to change keys. Berlin demonstrated his transposing keyboard during a television show with Dinah Shore, and the piano was placed on display in Belgium's Red Star Line Museum in 2013, on loan from the Emmet family. A second transposing piano is on loan from the Peters family to the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia.}}

As a result, Wilder says that many admirers of the music of [[Jerome Kern]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Cole Porter]] were unlikely to consider Berlin's work in the same category because they forgot or never realized that Berlin wrote many popular tunes, such as &quot;Soft Lights and Sweet Music,&quot; &quot;Supper Time,&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek.&quot; Some are even more confused because he also wrote more romantic melodies, such as &quot;What'll I Do?&quot; and &quot;Always.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt; Wilder adds that &quot;in his lyrics as in his melodies, Berlin reveals a constant awareness of the world around him: the pulse of the times, the society in which his is functioning. There is nothing of the hothouse about his work, urban though it may be.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;

==Music styles==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote=His music has that vitality—both rhythmic and melodic—which never seems to lose any of its exuberant freshness; it has that rich, colorful melodic flow which is ever the wonder of all those of who, too, compose songs; his ideas are endless.|source= — composer [[George Gershwin]]&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;Wyatt, Robert; Johnson, John A. ''The George Gershwin Reader'', Oxford Univ. Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}}}}

Composer [[Jerome Kern]] recognized that the essence of Irving Berlin's lyrics was his &quot;faith in the American vernacular&quot; and was so profound that his best-known songs &quot;seem indivisible from the country's history and self-image.&quot; Kern, along with [[George Gershwin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and [[Cole Porter]] brought together Afro-American, Latin American, rural pop, and European operetta.&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

Berlin, however, did not follow that method. Instead, says music critic [[Stephen Holden]], Berlin's songs were always simple, &quot;exquisitely crafted street songs whose diction feels so natural that one scarcely notices the craft....they seem to flow straight out of the rhythms and inflections of everyday speech.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt; It led composer [[George Gershwin]] to claim that he learned from Berlin that ragtime, which later became jazz, &quot;was the only musical idiom in existence that could aptly express America.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Among Berlin's contemporaries was Cole Porter, whose music style was often considered more &quot;witty, sophisticated, [and] dirty,&quot; according to musicologist [[Susannah McCorkle]]. Of the five top songwriters, only Porter and Berlin wrote both their own words and music. However, she notes that Porter, unlike Berlin, was a [[Yale]]-educated and wealthy Midwesterner whose songs were not successful until he was in his thirties. She notes further that it was &quot;Berlin [who] got Porter the show that launched his career.&quot;&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|76}}

===Marriages=== &lt;!-- Dorothy Goetz redirects here --&gt;
In February 1912, after a brief whirlwind courtship, he married 20-year-old Dorothy Goetz of [[Buffalo, New York]], the sister of one of Berlin's collaborators, [[E. Ray Goetz]]. During their honeymoon in [[Havana]], she contracted [[typhoid fever]], and doctors were unable to treat her illness when she returned to New York. She died July 17 of that year and was buried in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2828 |title=Dorothy Goetz Berlin |publisher=Find a Grave |year=1998 |access-date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left with [[writer's block]] for months after Goetz's death, he eventually wrote his first ballad, &quot;[[When I Lost You]],&quot; to express his grief.

Years later in the 1920s, he fell in love with a young heiress, Ellin Mackay, the daughter of [[Clarence Mackay]], the socially prominent head of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, and an author in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Krebs| first1=Albin| title=Ellin Berlin, 85, a Novelist, Dies; The Songwriter's Wife of 62 Years| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/30/obituaries/ellin-berlin-85-a-novelist-dies-the-songwriter-s-wife-of-62-years.html| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=July 30, 1988| page=32, Sec. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Berlin was Jewish and she was a Catholic of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent, their life was followed in every possible detail by the press, which found the romance of an immigrant from the Lower East Side and a young heiress a good story.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

They met in 1924, and her father opposed the match from the start. He went so far as to send her off to Europe to find other suitors and forget Berlin. However, Berlin wooed her with letters and song over the airwaves such as  &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;[[All Alone (Irving Berlin song)|All Alone]],&quot; and she wrote him daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Irving Berlin: a daughter's memoir| first=Mary Ellin| last=Barrett| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| year=1995| isbn=978-0671711498| pages=98–99; 123–124| quote=All three of us would share our father's agnosticism and sidestep our husbands' faiths. ...If I can picture my father, the nonbeliever, it is listening to the reading, learning just like me, for he had long ago forgotten the story, pleased that this is what my mother and I are doing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Philip Furia]] writes that newspapers rumored they were engaged before she returned from Europe, and some Broadway shows even performed skits of the &quot;lovelorn songwriter.&quot; After her return, she and Berlin were besieged by the press, which followed them everywhere. ''Variety'' reported that her father vowed that their marriage &quot;would only happen 'over my dead body.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt; As a result, they decided to elope and were married in a simple civil ceremony at the Municipal Building away from media attention.

The wedding news made the front-page of ''[[The New York Times]]''. The marriage took her father by surprise, and he was stunned upon reading about it. The bride's mother, however, who was at the time divorced from Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the dictates of her own heart. Berlin had gone to her mother's home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE7D81539E633A25756C0A9679C946795D6CF Ellin Mackay Wed to Irving Berlin; Surprises Father]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 1, January 5, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrett&quot; /&gt;

There followed reports that the bride's father now disowned his daughter because of the marriage. In response, Berlin gave the rights to &quot;Always&quot;, a song still played at weddings, to her as a wedding present.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuriaWood1998&quot; /&gt; Ellin Mackay was thereby guaranteed a steady income regardless of what might happen with the marriage. For years, Mackay refused to speak to the Berlins, but they reconciled after the Berlins lost their first son, Irving Berlin Jr., on Christmas Eve in 1928, less than one month after he was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuriaWood1998&quot; /&gt;

Their marriage remained a love affair and they were inseparable until she died in July 1988 at the age of 85. They had four children during their 63 years of marriage: Irving, who died in infancy on Christmas Day 1928; [[Mary Ellin Barrett]], Elizabeth Irving Peters and Linda Louise Emmet.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

===Lifestyle===
In 1916, in the earlier phase of Berlin's career, producer and composer [[George M. Cohan]], during a toast to the young Berlin at a [[New York Friars' Club|Friar's Club]] dinner in his honor, said, &quot;The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn't turned his head. He hasn't forgotten his friends, he doesn't wear funny clothes, and you will find his watch and his handkerchief in his pockets, where they belong.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-1916&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9904EED71739E233A25751C0A9679C946796D6CF &quot;The Story of Irving Berlin&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 2, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furia says that throughout Berlin's life he often returned on foot to his old neighborhoods in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], and the [[Bowery]].&lt;ref name=Furia&gt;Furia, Philip.

George Frazier of ''Life'' magazine found Berlin to be &quot;intensely nervous,&quot; with a habit of tapping his listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back&quot; and &quot;picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal.&quot; While listening, &quot;he leans forward tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell.... For a man who has known so much glory,&quot; writes Frazier, &quot;Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice.&quot;&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

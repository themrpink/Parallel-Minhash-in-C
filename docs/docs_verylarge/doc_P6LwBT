[[Paolo Veronese]] (1528–1588) was about as prolific as Tintoretto, with works that celebrated the Venetian state,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosand, 107&quot;&gt;Rosand, 107&lt;/ref&gt; as well as decorating houses of Venetian nobles. He decorated large portions of the [[Doge's Palace|Palazzo Ducale]] and the decoration of many villas [[Andrea Palladio|Palladian]], including [[Villa Barbaro]].

[[Jacopo Bassano]] (1517–1592) and [[Lorenzo Lotto]] were active in the mainland, and reflected some of the influences of [[Milan|Milanese painters]] with the introduction of images taken from real life, enriched by a touch of drama.

[[File:VillaCornaro 2007 07 14 front 1.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Cornaro]].]]
In architecture, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), born in [[Padua]], completed some highly influential works, including [[Palladian Villas of Veneto|Villas]] in the mainland, in [[Province of Vicenza|Vicenza]], [[Province of Padua|Padua]] and [[Province of Treviso|Treviso]]. In Venice, he designed the [[Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore]], the [[Il Redentore]], and [[Zitelle]] on the island of [[Giudecca]]. Palladian Villa architecture, in masterpieces such as [[Villa Emo]], [[Villa Barbaro]], [[Villa Capra]], and [[Villa Foscari]], evoked the imagined grandeur of antique classical Roman villas. This aesthetic, through his publications, proved popular and underwent a revival in the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] period. In his villas, the owner shall permit the control over production activities of the surrounding countryside by structuring the functional parts, such as [[porch]], close to the central body. In the case of Villa Badoer, the open barn, formed by a large circular colonnade, enclosing the front yard in front of the villa allows you to create a space that recalls the ancient idea of the [[Forum Romanum]], and bringing all campaign activities to gravitate in front of the villa itself.

[[File:Psyche revived Louvre MR1777.jpg|thumb|''[[Antonio Canova]]'s [[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss|Psyche Revived by Love's Kiss]]''.]]

The research style of Palladio has created an architectural movement called [[Palladianism]], which has had strong following in the next three centuries, inspiring architects, some of them his direct students, including [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], after the death of the teacher who completed several works, including the first [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]].

[[File:Venice 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] in Venice]]

The 18th-century [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian school]] comprises many artists. Important painters include [[Giambattista Tiepolo]], his son [[Giandomenico Tiepolo|Giandomenico]], [[Giambattista Piazzetta]], [[Niccolò Bambini]], [[Pietro Longhi]], [[Marco Ricci|Marco]] and [[Sebastiano Ricci]], [[Sebastiano Bombelli]], [[Gianantonio Fumiani]], [[Gaspare Diziani]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], and the architect/painter [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]].

Sculptors include [[Gianmaria Morlaiter|Morlaiter]], [[Filippo Parodi]], [[Bernard Torretti]] and his nephew [[Giuseppe Torretti]], and at the end of the republic [[Antonio Canova]]. Some other important artists are the architects [[Girolamo Frigimelica]], [[Giorgio Massari]], [[Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto|Scalfarotto]], and [[Tommaso Temanza]]; the carver [[Andrea Brustolon]]; playwrights [[Carlo Goldoni]] and [[Gaspare Gozzi]]; the poets [[Alessandro Labia]] and [[George Whisker]]; and composers [[Benedetto Marcello]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

[[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1696–1770), described as &quot;the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman.&quot;{{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}} was a [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]], who together with [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Canaletto]], [[Giovan Battista Piazzetta]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] formed the ultimate group of traditional great Venetian [[old master]] painters of that period. [[perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] played a central role in Tiepolo's representations, and was forced beyond the usual limits in his ceiling decorations depicting levitating figures viewed from below.

Another characteristic feature of Venetian art is [[landscape painting]], which sees in [[Giovanni Antonio Canal|Canaletto]] (1697–1768) and [[Francesco Guardi]] (1712–1793) the two leading figures. Canaletto's rigorous perspective studies make for an almost &quot;photographic&quot; reality, in contrast to Guardi's more subjective [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]].

[[Antonio Canova]] (1757–1822), born in [[Possagno]], was the greatest of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] artists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Neo-Classical&quot;, ''The Dictionary of Art'': volume XXII, ed. Jane Turner, in thirty-four volumes, 1996. Grove's Dictionaries Inc., New York, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tempio Canoviano|Temple of Possagno]], which he designed, financed, and partly-built himself,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Martineau &amp; Andrew Robinson, ''The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century.'' Yale University Press, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; is among landmarks of neo-classical architecture. His most important works include ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss|Psyche Revived by Love's Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]''.

After the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|fall of the Republic of Venice in 1796]], every city in Veneto created its own form of art. Important was, however, the role of [[Accademia di Belle Arti (Venezia)|Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice]], who was able to attract many young artists from the surrounding territory.

Among the many artists which were important in modern ages were [[Guglielmo Ciardi]], who incorporated the experience of [[macchiaioli]] movement, uniting the typical colour of the classic Venetian school, and yet bringing out from his paintings a chromatic essence, [[Giacomo Favretto]], who too as Ciardi, enhanced the colour, which was sometimes very pronounced, painter [[Frederick Zandomeneghi]], who deviates from the tradition of Venetian colouring to venture in a style similar to French impressionism, and finally [[Luigi Nono (painter)|Luigi Nono]], whose works feel realistic, even if, in addition to painting genre scenes, includes portraits of finity for psychological enhancement.

===Education===
Veneto hosts one of the oldest universities in the world, the [[University of Padua]], founded in 1222. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] investigations&lt;ref&gt;Oecd-Pisa 2005, Il livello di competenza dei quindicenni italiani in matematica, lettura, scienze e problem solving – Prima sintesi dei risultati di Pisa 2003, pag.7, also available on [http://www.invalsi.it/ www.invalsi.it]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813045440/http://www.invalsi.it/ |date=2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show that school education achievements in North-Eastern Italy (whose population comes mainly from Veneto) are the highest in Italy. In 2003 the university had approximately 65,000 students.

===Language===
{{Main|Venetian language}}
Most of the people of Veneto speak Italian along with widespread usage of local varieties of the Venetian language. Within Venetian there are distinct sub-groups centered on the major cities, and distinctions are also found between rural and urban  dialects and those spoken in northern mountainous areas and on the plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Payne |first1=Elinor |title=Rises and rise-plateau-slumps in Trevigiano |journal=Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics |date=2005 |volume=2 |pages=173–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venetian dialects are classified as [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]]. Linguists identify five major types of Venetian: an Eastern or Coastal (Venice) group, a Central (Padua, Vicenza, Polesine) group, a Western (Verona) group, a North-Central (Treviso) group, and a Northern (Belluno, Feltre, Agordo, Cadore, [[Zoldo Alto]]) group of dialects. All dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees, are descended from [[Vulgar Latin]] and influenced to varying degrees by the [[Italian language]]. Venetian is attested as a written language in the 13th century.

The language of Venice enjoyed substantial prestige in the days of the [[Venetian Republic]], when it attained the status of a [[lingua franca]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Notable Venetian-language authors include the playwrights [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707–1793) and [[Carlo Gozzi]] (1720–1806), while [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502–1542) is best known for his rustic comedies &quot;cast in mainland peasant ''Pavan'' 'Paduan'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuttle |first=Edward F.|editor1-last=Maiden |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Parry |editor2-first=Mair |title=The Dialects of Italy|date=1997 |chapter=The Veneto|page=263|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ladin language|Ladin]], also Romance, is spoken in parts of the [[province of Belluno]], especially in the municipalities of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]], while [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] (Germanic) is spoken in two villages (Roana and Giazza respectively) of the [[Seven Communities]] and the [[Thirteen Communities]]. These are two historical groups of villages of Cimbric origin, which for a long time formed two distinct &quot;commonwealths&quot; under the rule of the Republic of Venice, among others. Furthermore, in the area around [[Portogruaro]] people speak [[Friulian language|Furlan]].

As the region does not enjoy a special status of autonomy, [[minority language]]s are not granted any form of official recognition. A motion to recognise Venetian as an official [[regional language]] has been approved by the [[Regional Council of Veneto|regional Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/leggi/2007/07lr0008.html?numLegge=8&amp;annoLegge=2007&amp;tipoLegge=Alr |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Leggi Regionali |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Venetian literature}}
[[Venetian literature]] is the corpus of [[literature]] in [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the [[vernacular]] language of the region which roughly corresponding to [[Venice]] from the 12th century. The Venetian literature, after an initial period of splendour in the 16th century with the success of artists such as [[Ruzante]], reaches its maximum zenith in the 18th century, thanks to its maximum exponent, dramatist [[Carlo Goldoni]]. Subsequently, the literary production in Venetian undergoes a period of decline following the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|collapse of the Republic of Venice]], succeeding anyway during the 20th century to reach peaks with wonderful lyrical poets such as [[Biagio Marin]] of Grado.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Venetian cuisine}}
[[File:PoetiGold.jpg|thumb|upright|A Golden bottle of ''[[Prosecco]]'']]
Cuisine is an important part of the culture of Veneto, and the region is home to some of the most recognisable dishes, desserts and wines in Italian, European and worldwide cuisine.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Veneto|Music of Venice}}
Veneto, and in particular [[Venice]] and [[Verona]], are important Italian musical centres, home to a vibrant musical life.

The city of Venice in Italy has played an important role in the development of the [[music of Italy]]. The Venetian state—i.e. the medieval Maritime Republic of Venice—was often popularly called the &quot;Republic of Music&quot;, and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that &quot;In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Touring Club p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Padova]], musical ensembles such as the ''Amici della Musica di Padova'', the ''Solisti Veneti'' and the Padova-Veneto Symphony are found. Concerts are often held in the historic [[Loggia Comaro]], built in 1524. As well, the city is the site of the Teatro delle Maddalene, the Teatro delle Grazie, the Giuseppe Verdi Theater, and the [[Cesare Pollini]] music conservatory.

[[Rovigo]] is the site of the [[Teatro Sociale]], built in 1819. In the 20th century it was the venue for the career beginnings of [[Tullio Serafin]], [[Beniamino Gigli]] and [[Renata Tebaldi]]. The town of Rovigo is also the site of the Francesco Vanezza music conservatory.

The city of [[Verona]] is the site of the Roman amphitheater known as the &quot;Arena&quot; which has been hosting musical events since the 16th century, but more recently the spectacular outdoor staging of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Aida]], an event staged for the first time in 1913. The city also has the Felice Evaristo Dall'Abaco music conservatory;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''[[Dolomites]]'''&lt;/div&gt;
They were inscribed in 2009. They are located for the most part in the province of [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]], the rest in [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] (all in north-eastern [[Italy]]). Conventionally they extend from the [[Adige]] [[river]] in the west to the [[Piave River|Piave]] valley ([[Pieve di Cadore]]) in the east. The northern and southern borders are defined by the [[Puster Valley]] and the Sugana Valley (Val Sugana). But the Dolomites spread also over the Piave river (''Dolomiti d'Oltrepiave'') to the east; and far away over the Adige river to the west is the ''Brenta'' Group (Western Dolomites); there is also another smaller group called ''Piccole Dolomiti'' (Small Dolomites) located between the Provinces of Trento and [[Province of Vicenza|Vicenza]] (see the map).

[[Vicenza]] and the [[Palladian Villas of Veneto]] are a number of [[Palladio|Palladian]] villas which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. UNESCO inscribed the site on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/712 |title=UNESCO World heritage site number 712 |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |access-date=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the site was called &quot;Vicenza, City of Palladio&quot; and only buildings in the immediate area of [[Vicenza]] were included. Various types of buildings were represented including the [[Teatro Olimpico]], ''[[Palazzo|palazzi]]'' and a few [[villa]]s. Most of Palladio's surviving villas lay outside the site. However, in 1996 the number of [[Palladian]] villas included in the site was expanded to include those in other parts of Veneto. The site was given its present name.

The term villa was used to describe a country house. Often rich families in Veneto also had a house in town called a palazzo. In most cases the owners named their palazzi and villas with the family surname, hence there is both a [[Palazzo Chiericati]] in Vicenza and a [[Villa Chiericati]] in the countryside, similarly there is a [[Ca' Foscari|Palazzo Foscari]] in [[Venice]] and a [[Villa Foscari]] in the countryside. Somewhat confusingly there are multiple [[Villa Pisani|Villas Pisani]], including two by Palladio.

There are these sorts of villas all over the Venetian plain, but especially in the provinces of [[Treviso]], [[Padua]], [[Vicenza]] and [[Venice]]. The date of construction of these villas ranges from the 15th to the 19th century. There are approximately five thousand Ville Venete, of which 1,400 are declared of historical and monumental interest.

Apart from the numerous Palladian villas, of which 24 are protected by [[UNESCO]], there are many villas spread across Veneto, mainly from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Many of them are museums, public institutions or private residences.
The 24 Palladian villas which are part of [[UNESCO]]:
* [[Villa Almerico Capra]], also called &quot;La Rotonda&quot; ([[Vicenza]])

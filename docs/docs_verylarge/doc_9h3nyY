Saints and popes have emphasized the meditative and contemplative elements of the rosary and provided specific teachings for how the rosary should be prayed, for instance the need for &quot;''focus,'' ''respect,'' ''reverence'' and ''purity of intention''&quot; during rosary recitations and contemplations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winston-Allen |first=Anne |title=Stories of the Rose: The Making of the Rosary in the Middle Ages |date=1997 |publisher=[[Penn State University Press]] |isbn=0-271-01631-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUJ2B8FME6MC|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixteenth century onwards, Rosary recitations often involved &quot;picture texts&quot; that assisted meditation. Such imagery continues to be used to depict the mysteries of the rosary. Catholic saints have stressed the importance of meditation and contemplation. Scriptural meditations concerning the rosary are based on the Christian tradition of [[Lectio Divina]], (literally ''divine reading'') as a way of using the [[Gospel]] to start a conversation between the person and Christ. [[Padre Pio]], a rosary devotee, said: &quot;''Through the study of books one seeks God; by meditation one finds him.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Liz. ''The Rosary: A Path into Prayer,'' 2004 {{ISBN|0-8294-2024-X}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

References to the Rosary have been part of a number of reported [[Marian Apparitions]] spanning two centuries. The reported messages from these apparitions have influenced the spread of Rosary devotion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Shamon, Albert J. M., ''The Power of the Rosary,'' CMJ Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|1-891280-10-4}} p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John D. ''Beads and prayers: the rosary in history and devotion,'' 2002 {{ISBN|0-86012-320-0}} p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Quamquam pluries]]'' Pope Leo XIII related Rosary devotions to [[Saint Joseph]] and granted [[indulgence]]s for adding a prayer to St. Joseph to the Rosary during the month of October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15081889_quamquam-pluries_en.html Vatican website: ''Quamquam pluries'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Praying the Rosary may be prescribed by priests as a type of [[penance]] after [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]]. (Penance is not generally intended as a &quot;punishment&quot;; rather, it is meant to encourage meditation upon and spiritual growth from past sins.&lt;ref&gt;No penance is meant as punishment, according to the Catechism: [https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a4.htm Catechism, the Sacrament of Penance]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
{{Main|History of the Rosary}}

Knotted [[prayer rope]]s were used in [[early Christianity]]; the [[Desert Fathers]] are said to have created the first such, using knots to keep track of the number of times they said the Jesus prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXL8CwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22desert+fathers%22+%22Knotted+prayer+ropes+%22|title=Linking Your Beads: The Rosary's History, Mysteries, Prayers|last=Kasten|first=Patricia Ann|date=2011|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|isbn=978-1612785424|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pious tradition, the concept of the Rosary was given to [[Saint Dominic]] in an apparition of the [[Virgin Mary]] during the year 1214 in the church of [[Prouille]], though in fact it was known from the ninth century in various forms. This Marian apparition received the title of [[Our Lady of the Rosary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;Beebe, Catherine, ''St. Dominic and the Rosary'' {{ISBN|0-89870-518-5}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century it was promoted by [[Alanus de Rupe]] (aka Alain de la Roche or Blessed Alan of the Rock), a Dominican priest and theologian, who established the &quot;[[fifteen rosary promises]]&quot; and started many [[Confraternity of the Rosary|rosary confraternities]].

According to [[Herbert Thurston]], it is certain that in the course of the twelfth century and before the birth of St. Dominic, the practice of reciting 50 or 150 Ave Marias had become generally familiar.  According to 20th century editions of the Catholic Encyclopedia, the story of St. Dominic's devotion to the Rosary and supposed apparition of Our Lady of the Rosary does not appear in any documents of the Church or Dominican Order prior to the writings of Blessed Alanus, some 250 years after Dominic.&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13184b.htm Thurston, Herbert, and Andrew Shipman. &quot;The Rosary.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 7 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; However recent scholarship by Donald H. Calloway, which has received the endorsement of some of the Church hierarchy, seeks to refute this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calloway | first=Donald |title=Champions of the Rosary |date=2016 |publisher=[[Marian Press]] |isbn=978-1596143432 |url=https://www.ignatius.com/Products/COR-P/champions-of-the-rosary.aspx}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Foley claimed that although Mary's giving the Rosary to St. Dominic is recognized as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the Order of Preachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1161 Foley, Leonard O.F.M., &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot;, ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of meditation during the praying of the Hail Mary is attributed to [[Dominic of Prussia]] (1382–1460), a [[Carthusian]] [[monk]] who termed it &quot;Life of Jesus Rosary&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rosenkranz/&gt; The German monk from [[Trier]] added a sentence to each of the 50 Hail Marys, using quotes from scriptures (which at that time followed the name &quot;Jesus,&quot; before the intercessory ending was added during the [[Counter-Reformation]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01246a.htm McNicholas, J.T. &quot;Alanus de Rupe&quot;. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1569, the papal bull [[Consueverunt Romani Pontifices]] by the Dominican [[Pope Pius V]] officially established the devotion to the rosary in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Scaperlanda, Maria Ruiz. ''The Seeker's Guide to Mary'', 2002 {{ISBN|0-8294-1489-4}} p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th to the early 20th century, the structure of the Rosary remained essentially unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thurston&quot; /&gt; There were 15 mysteries, one for each of the 15 decades. During the 20th century, the addition of the Fatima Prayer to the end of each decade became more common. There were no other changes until 2002, when [[John Paul II]] instituted five optional new Luminous Mysteries, although variations of these had already been proposed by the likes of St. Louis de Montfort and [[St. George Preca]] and were implemented during the mid-20th Century by figures such as [[Patrick Peyton]].

===Papal endorsements===
During the 16th century, [[Pope Pius V]] associated the rosary with the [[General Roman Calendar]] by instituting the Feast of Our Lady of Victory (later changed to [[Our Lady of the Rosary]]), which is celebrated on 7 October.

Pope [[Leo XIII]], known as &quot;The Rosary Pope,&quot; issued twelve [[encyclicals]] and five [[Ecclesiastical letter|apostolic letters]] concerning the rosary and added the invocation ''Queen of the most Holy Rosary'' to the Litany of Loreto. [[Pope Pius XII]] and his successors actively promoted veneration of the Virgin in [[Lourdes]] and [[Fátima, Portugal|Fatima]], which is credited with a new resurgence of the rosary within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=Rosenkranz/&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII]] deemed the rosary of such importance that on 28 April 1962, in an [[apostolic letter]] he appealed for the recitation of the Rosary in preparation for the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oecumenicum Concilium (1962)&quot;&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/johnxxiii/en/apost_letters/1962.index.html][[Pope John XXIII]]. ''Oecumenicum Concilium'', 28 April 1962&lt;/ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]] issued the Apostolic Letter ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'' which emphasized the Christocentric nature of the Rosary as a meditation on the life of Christ. He said: &quot;Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as by the hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JPII&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae.html|title=Rosarium Virginis Mariae on the Most Holy Rosary (October 16, 2002) {{!}} John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2008, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated that the Rosary was experiencing a new springtime: &quot;It is one of the most eloquent signs of love that the young generation nourish for Jesus and his Mother.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;ihmhermitage.stblogs.com/2008/05/15/benedict-xvi-on-the-rosary/&lt;/ref&gt; To Benedict XVI, the Rosary is a meditation on all the important moments of salvation history.

The [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments|Congregation for Divine Worship]]'s directory of popular piety and the liturgy emphasizes the Christian meditation/meditative aspects of the rosary, and states that the Rosary is essentially a contemplative prayer which requires &quot;tranquility of rhythm or even a mental lingering which encourages the faithful to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord's life.&quot;&lt;ref name=pietydiretory&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html ''Directory of popular piety and the liturgy'', §197, Congregation of Divine Worship, Vatican, 2001],&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for Divine Worship points out the role the Rosary can have as a formative component of spiritual life.

The theologian [[Romano Guardini]] described the Catholic emphasis on the Rosary as &quot;participation in the life of Mary, whose focus was Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosenkranz&gt;Rosenkranz, A Heinz. Marienlexikon, Eos, St. Ottilien, 1993, 555{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion was expressed earlier by Leo XIII who considered the rosary as way to accompany Mary in her contemplation of Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;Encyclical Jucunda Semper 8.9.1894 quoted in Marienlexikon,Eos St. Ottilien, 1988 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devotional growth===
{{see also|Catholic Mariology}}
[[File:Our Lady of Lourdes - Grotto of Lourdes - Lourdes 2014.JPG|thumb|right|[[Our Lady of Lourdes]] appearing at [[Lourdes]] with rosary beads.]]

The Rosary has been featured in the writings of Catholic figures from [[saint]]s to [[pope]]s and continues to be mentioned in reported Marian apparitions, with a number of promises attributed to the [[power of the rosary]].

According to Alan de la Roche, the Virgin Mary is reputed to have made 15 specific promises to Christians who pray the Rosary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosary-center.org/nconobl.htm Dominican Fathers on the Rosary]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifteen rosary promises]] range from protection from misfortune to meriting a high degree of glory in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theholyrosary.org/power.html Holyrosary.org]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John T. McNicholas says that during the time of the [[Penal Laws]] in Ireland when Mass was either infrequent or impossible, the Rosary became a substitute within the home.{{sfn|McNicholas|1917|p=343}} During the 18th century, the French priest Louis de Montfort elaborated on the importance of the rosary and its power in his book ''[[Secret of the Rosary]].'' He emphasized the [[power of the rosary]] and provided specific instructions on how it should be prayed, e.g. with ''attention,'' ''devotion,'' and ''modesty (reverence),'' with reflective pauses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montfort.org.uk/Writings/Rosary.html De Montfort, St. Louis-Marie. Secret of the Rosary, Forty-Fourth Rose (paragraph 127)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327085157/http://www.montfort.org.uk/Writings/Rosary.html |date=27 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the forces that encouraged the spread of the rosary during the 19th century among Catholics was the influence of the ''[[Rosary Pope]],'' a title given to Leo XIII (1878–1903) because he issued a record twelve [[encyclicals]] and five Apostolic Letters concerning the Rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily Rosary prayer during the month of October and, during 1883, added the invocation ''Queen of the most Holy Rosary'' to the Litany of Loreto.&lt;ref&gt;Lauretanische Litanei, Marienlexikon, Eos, St. Ottilien, 1988, p. 41{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XIII explained the importance of the Rosary as the one road to God from the faithful to the mother and from her to Christ and through Christ to the Father, and that the Rosary was a vital means to participate with the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt; This emphasis on the path ''through Mary to Christ'' has since been a key direction in Catholic Mariology, with Mariology being viewed as inherent in [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;At the center of this mystery, in the midst of this wonderment of faith, stands Mary. As the loving Mother of the Redeemer, she was the first to experience it: &quot;To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator!&quot; Pope John Paul II, in Redemptoris Mater, 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Pius XII ''Mystici corporis Christi''; John Henry Newman: ''Mariology is always christocentric,'' in Michael Testa, Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mariology Is Christology'' in Vittorio Messori, &quot;The Mary Hypothesis&quot; Rome, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosary as a family prayer was endorsed by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his encyclical ''[[Ingruentium malorum]]'': &quot;The custom of the family praying of the Holy Rosary is a most efficacious means.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ingruentium malorum,'' 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of prayers==

[[File:Rosary01.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The [[crucifix]] on a rosary.]]

===Basic structure===
The structure of the Rosary prayer, recited using the rosary beads, is as follows: {{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}}

The Rosary is begun on the short strand:
* The [[sign of the cross]] on the [[Crucifix]];
* The prayer &quot;[[Psalm 51|O Lord, open my lips]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Psalm|51:15|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psalm 70|O God, come to my aid; O Lord, make haste to help me]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Psalm|69:2|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; still on the Crucifix;
* The [[Apostles' Creed]], still on the Crucifix;
* The [[Lord's Prayer]] at the first large bead (for the needs of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and for the intentions of the [[pope]]);
* The [[Hail Mary]] on each of the next three beads (for the three [[theological virtues]]: [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]); and
* The [[Gloria Patri|Glory Be]] on the next large bead.
The praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each [[#Mysteries of the Rosary|mystery]]:

* Announce the mystery;
* The Lord's Prayer on the large bead;
* The Hail Mary on each of the ten adjacent small beads;
* The Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer on the space before the next large bead; and
To conclude:
* The [[Salve Regina]];
* The [[Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Loreto Litany]];
* Any further intentions; and
* The sign of the cross.

Instead of ending each decade with the ''Gloria Patri'', [[Pope Pius IX]] would add &quot;May the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of God [[Requiescat in pace|rest in peace]].&quot;{{sfn|McNicholas|1917|p=347}} The [[Fatima Prayers#Decade Prayer|Fatima Prayer]] is commonly said after the ''Gloria Patri'' as a pious addition, still on the large bead.

===Variations and common pious additions===
{{See also|Rosary-based prayers}}
Common pious additions to the Rosary occur after each decade and after recitation of the ''Hail Holy Queen''. Some Catholics recite the ''[[Fatima Prayers#Decade Prayer|Fatima Decade Prayer]]'' at the end of each decade, preceding or following the ''Glory Be''. Some add the [[Miraculous Medal]] prayer &quot;O Mary, conceived without sin...&quot; or the [[Avé de Fátima|Fatima Ave]] refrain (&quot;Ave, Ave, Ave Maria! Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!&quot;). Others add a praying of the pious [[Eucharistic]] prayer &quot;O Sacrament Most Holy, O Sacrament Divine, All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment Thine&quot; at the end of each decade in honor of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. In the practice of the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]], there is an additional decade for the intentions of the students or the Virgin Mary.

[[File:Rosario Irlandés.jpg|thumb|A single decade Irish rosary from penal times; such an abbreviated rosary could be hidden easily.]]
After the Hail, Holy Queen, many Catholics add the prayer &quot;O God, whose only begotten Son...&quot;, the [[prayer to Saint Michael]], and a prayer for the intentions of the Pope. In some cases, the [[Litany of Loreto]] may be recited at the end.

In the practice of the [[Dominican Order]], the beginning prayers of the rosary correspond to the beginning of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]:&lt;ref&gt;The pattern of the Dominican opening prayers can be found at [http://laici.op.org/eng/library/rosary.php The Dominican form of praying the Rosary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112211722/http://laici.op.org/eng/library/rosary.php |date=12 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
# Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee.
# Blessed art Thou among women, and Blessed is the Fruit of Thy Womb, Jesus.
# O Lord, open my lips.
# And my mouth will proclaim Your praise.
# [[Deus in adjutorium meum intende|Incline Your aid to me, O God]].
# O Lord, make haste to help me.
# Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosaryconfraternity.org/the-rosary/how-to-pray-the-rosary/ &quot;How to Say the Dominican Rosary&quot;, Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group recitation of the Rosary===
When a group recites the Rosary, it is customary that the prayers that constitute the decades are divided into two parts. The second part of the Our Father begins with &quot;Give us this day our daily bread ...&quot;; the second part of the Hail Mary begins with &quot;Holy Mary, Mother of God ...&quot;; and the second part of the Glory Be to the Father with &quot;As it was in the beginning....&quot; This lends itself to [[Antiphon|antiphonal prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholictradition.org/Classics/secret-rosary46.htm Montfort, Louis. &quot;Forty-sixth Rose: Group Recitation&quot;, ''The Secret of the Rosary'', Montfort Publications. New York, 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a leader may recite the first half of the prayer while the other participants recite the rest. In another style of praying the Rosary, the recitation of the first part of the prayers is sometimes entrusted to different persons while still maintaining the traditional Leader versus Congregation style of praying.

==Mysteries of the Rosary{{Anchor|Mysteries of the Rosary}}==
{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}

The Mysteries of the Rosary are meditations on episodes in the life and death of Jesus from the Annunciation to the Ascension and beyond. These are traditionally grouped by fives into themed sets known as the ''Joyful'' (or ''Joyous'') ''Mysteries'', the ''Sorrowful Mysteries'', and the ''Glorious Mysteries''.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}}

Typically, a spiritual goal known as a &quot;fruit&quot; is also assigned to each mystery. Below are listed from the appendix of [[Louis Marie de Montfort]]'s book ''[[Secret of the Rosary]]'' for the original 15 mysteries, with other possible fruits being listed in other pamphlets bracketed:

===Days of praying===
The full Rosary consists of praying all 15 mysteries, with the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious considered the minimal amount. Alternatively, a single set of five mysteries can be prayed each day, according to the following convention:

Rosary beads provide a physical method of keeping count of the number of Hail Marys said as the mysteries are contemplated.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}} The fingers are moved along the beads as the prayers are recited. By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is free to meditate on the mysteries. A five-decade rosary contains five groups of ten beads (a decade), with additional large beads before each decade.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Wills, ''The Rosary'', Viking Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-670-03449-5}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Hail Mary is said on the ten beads within a decade, while the Lord's Prayer is said on the large bead before each decade. A new mystery meditation commences at each of the large beads. Some rosaries, particularly those used by [[religious orders]], contain fifteen decades, corresponding to the traditional fifteen mysteries of the rosary. Both five- and fifteen-decade rosaries are attached to a shorter strand, which starts with a [[crucifix]], followed by one large bead, three small beads, and one large bead, before connecting to the rest of the rosary.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}} A five-decade rosary consists of a &quot;total&quot; of 59 beads.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Poe, [http://www.chanttherosary.com/appendices/rosary-parts/ &quot;Parts of the Rosary&quot;], ''TheChantRosary.com'', 2-4-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Although counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the Rosary do not require a set of beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on the fingers or by counting without any device at all.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}}

===Single-decade rosaries=== &lt;!--This section is linked from the redirect &quot;Rosary ring&quot;. If changed, please update accordingly. --&gt;
Single-decade rosaries can also be used: the devotee counts the same ring of ten beads repeatedly for every decade. During religious conflict in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)#Ascendancy rule 1691–1778|legal penalties]] were prescribed against practising Catholics. Small, easily hidden rosaries were thus used to avoid identification and became known as [[Irish penal rosary|Irish penal rosaries]].{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485–487}} Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used, such as a hammer to signify the [[Nail (relic)|nails of the cross]], cords to represent the [[Flagellation of Christ|scourging]], a chalice to recall the Last Supper, or a crowing [[rooster]] signifying the [[denial of Peter]].

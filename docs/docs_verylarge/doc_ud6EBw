A similar thing has happened in [[Florida]], where orchards of citrus trees no longer exist in either [[Citrus County, Florida|Citrus County]] or [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] because of bad winter freezes in some years. In both Florida and Texas, the citrus [[agriculture]] has been moved farther south in search of milder winters, and away from the periodic frosts.

During [[World War II]], Orange County was the home of a large amount of [[shipbuilding]] for the navies the United States and allied countries. The major shipbuilder, [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]], was located in the town of Orange, and among the [[warship]]s that it built were the {{USS|Aulick|DD-569}} (1942), the first warship built there, the {{USS|Pope|DE-134}} (1943), and the {{USS|Carpenter|DD-825}} (1945–46), the last warship built there. During the war, the Consolidate Steel Corporation employed as many as 20,000 people at its [[shipyard]] in Orange.

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|380|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|334|sqmi|abbr=on}} are land and {{convert|46|sqmi|abbr=on}} (12%) are covered by water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_48.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 5, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange County is bordered on its east by the Sabine River, on its southeast by Sabine Lake, and on the northwest by the [[Neches River]].

The geography of Orange County varies relatively little, with an elevation that reaches 33 ft (10 m) above [[sea level]] at very few points within the county. Orange County is very flat, and its soil is quite sandy, as could be expected in a county along the Gulf of Mexico. (Sandy soil is also common in southern Louisiana, [[Mississippi]], and [[Alabama]], and in western and southern [[Florida]].) Saltwater marshes occur in much of the southeastern part of Orange County that borders the Sabine River. The  [[Piney Woods]] are in the northern part of the county.

Orange County was formerly a center for the building of warships, and a large [[U.S. Navy]] ghost fleet ([[reserve fleet]]) still exists in Jefferson County - from which currently, many old warships are being cleaned of [[water pollution]] sources and then [[shipbreaking|scrapped]] for their metals, thus employment for residents of Orange County in [[shipbreaking]].

Newspapers published in the county include the twice-weekly ''[[The Orange Leader (Texas)|Orange Leader]]'' and weeklies including the Bridge City-based ''Penny Record'', ''County Record'', and ''[[Vidor, Texas|Vidor]] Vidorian''.

'''Zircon''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/zircon|title=Zircon definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|zircon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zircon|title=Definition of ZIRCON|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[mineral]] belonging to the group of [[nesosilicate]]s, and it is a source of the metal [[zirconium]]. Its chemical name is [[zirconium silicate]], and its corresponding chemical formula is [[Zirconium|Zr]][[Silicate|SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A common [[empirical formula]] showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr&lt;sub&gt;1–y&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Rare earth elements|REE]]&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1–x&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4x–y&lt;/sub&gt;. Zircon forms in [[silicate]] [[Melt (geology)|melts]] with large proportions of [[Incompatible element|high field strength incompatible elements]]. For example, [[hafnium]] is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%. The [[crystal structure]] of zircon is [[tetragonal]] [[crystal system]]. The natural colour of zircon varies between colourless, yellow-golden, red, brown, blue and green.

The name derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''zargun'', meaning &quot;gold-hued&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stwertka&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stwertka|first=Albert|title=A Guide to the Elements|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoelements00stwe|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guidetoelements00stwe/page/117 117–119]| isbn = 978-0-19-508083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is corrupted into &quot;[[jargoon]]&quot;, a term applied to light-colored zircons. The English word &quot;zircon&quot; is derived from ''Zirkon'', which is the German adaptation of this word.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|zircon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow, orange and red zircon is also known as &quot;[[hyacinth (gemstone)|hyacinth]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyacinth1&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hyacinth-gem | title=Hyacinth (gem) | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the flower ''[[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinthus]]'', whose name is of [[Ancient Greek]] origin.

==Properties==
[[Image:zircon microscope.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Optical microscope photograph; the length of the crystal is about 250 [[µm]]]]

Zircon is common in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of Earth. It occurs as a common [[accessory mineral]] in [[igneous rock]]s (as primary crystallization products), in [[metamorphic rock]]s and as detrital grains in [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in [[granitoid|granite]] rocks is about 0.1–0.3&amp;nbsp;mm, but they can also grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in mafic [[pegmatite]]s and [[carbonatite]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; Zircon is also very resistant to heat and corrosion.

Because of their [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] content, some zircons undergo [[metamictization]]. Connected to internal radiation damage, these processes partially disrupt the crystal structure and partly explain the highly variable properties of zircon. As zircon becomes more and more modified by internal radiation damage, the density decreases, the crystal structure is compromised, and the color changes.

Zircon occurs in many colors, including reddish brown, yellow, green, blue, gray and colorless.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;  The color of zircons can sometimes be changed by heat treatment. Common brown zircons can be transformed into colorless and blue zircons by heating to 800 to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Gemdat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemdat.org/gem-4421.html|title=Zircon gemstone information|website=www.gemdat.org|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geological settings, the development of pink, red, and purple zircon occurs after hundreds of millions of years, if the crystal has sufficient trace elements to produce [[F-Center|color centers]]. Color in this red or pink series is annealed in geological conditions above temperatures of around 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00054-9 |title=Integration of zircon color and zircon fission-track zonation patterns in orogenic belts: Application to the Southern Alps, New Zealand |journal=Tectonophysics |volume=349 |issue=1–4 |pages=203–219 |year=2002 |last1=Garver |first1=John I. |last2=Kamp |first2=Peter J.J. |bibcode=2002Tectp.349..203G |citeseerx=10.1.1.570.3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:ZirconUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|Sand-sized grains of zircon]]
Zircon is mainly consumed as an [[opacifier]], and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a28_543 |chapter=Zirconium and Zirconium Compounds |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2000 |last1=Nielsen |first1=Ralph |isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic [[zirconium]], although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including [[zirconium dioxide]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), one of the most [[refractory]] materials known.

Other applications include use in refractories and foundry casting and a growing array of specialty applications as zirconia and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mineralcommodities.com/products/|title=Products|website=Mineral Commodities Ltd|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zircon is one of the key minerals [[Radiometric dating|used]] by geologists for [[geochronology]].

Zircon is a part of the [[ZTR index]] to classify highly-[[weathering|weathered]] [[sediment]]s.
&lt;!-- This is not an application: 
*Large specimens are appreciated as [[gemstone]]s, owing to their high [[refractive index]]. (Zircon has a refractive index of approximately 1.95; [[diamond]]'s is approximately 2.4.)--&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Zirconium mineral concentrates - world production trend.svg|thumb|left|World production trend of zirconium mineral concentrates]]
Zircon is a common accessory to trace mineral constituent of most [[granite]] and [[felsic]] igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and is a common constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within [[mafic rock]]s and very rare within [[ultramafic]] rocks aside from a group of [[Ultrapotassic igneous rocks|ultrapotassic intrusive rocks]] such as [[kimberlite]]s, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.

* ''Individuals'' borrow money via bankers' [[loan]]s for short term needs or longer term mortgages to help finance a house purchase.
* ''Companies'' borrow money to aid short term or long term [[cash flow]]s. They also borrow to fund modernization or future business expansion. It is common for companies to use mixed packages of different types of funding for different purposes – especially where large complex projects such as company management buyouts are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;''The Business Finance Market: A Survey'' ISR/Google Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* ''[[Government]]s'' often find their spending requirements exceed their [[tax revenue]]s. To make up this difference, they need to borrow. Governments also borrow on behalf of nationalized industries, municipalities, local authorities and other public sector bodies. In the UK, the total borrowing requirement is often referred to as the [[Public sector net cash requirement]] (PSNCR).

Governments borrow by issuing [[Government bond|bonds]]. In the UK, the government also borrows from individuals by offering bank accounts and [[Premium Bond]]s. Government debt seems to be permanent. Indeed, the debt seemingly expands rather than being paid off. One strategy used by governments to reduce the ''[[Value (economics)|value]]'' of the debt is to influence ''[[inflation]]''.

''[[Municipality|Municipalities]] and [[Local government|local authorities]]'' may borrow in their own name as well as receiving funding from national governments. In the UK, this would cover an authority like Hampshire County Council.

''[[Government-owned corporation|Public Corporations]]'' typically include [[Nationalization|nationalized]] industries. These may include the postal services, railway companies and utility companies.

Many borrowers have difficulty raising money locally. They need to borrow internationally with the aid of [[Foreign exchange market]]s.

Borrowers having similar needs can form into a group of borrowers. They can also take an organizational form like Mutual Funds. They can provide mortgage on weight basis. The main advantage is that this lowers the cost of their borrowings.

==Derivative products==
During the 1980s and 1990s, a major growth sector in financial markets was the trade in so called '''[[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'''.

In the financial markets, stock prices, share prices, bond prices, currency rates, interest rates and dividends go up and down, creating ''[[risk#Risk in finance|risk]]''. Derivative products are financial products that are used to ''control'' risk or paradoxically ''exploit'' risk.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright and Vincenzo Quadrini. Money and Banking: “Chapter 2, Section 4: Financial Markets.” pp. 3 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON302-1.1-1st.pdf] Accessed June 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called financial economics.

Derivative products or instruments help the issuers to gain an unusual profit from issuing the instruments. For using the help of these products a contract has to be made. Derivative contracts are mainly 4 types:&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaik2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Khader Shaik|title=Managing Derivatives Contracts: A Guide to Derivatives Market Structure, Contract Life Cycle, Operations, and Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtedBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-6275-6|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Futures contract|Future]]
# [[Forward contract|Forward]]
# [[Option (finance)|Option]]
# [[Swap (finance)|Swap]]

Seemingly, the most obvious buyers and sellers of [[currency]] are importers and exporters of goods. While this may have been true in the distant past,{{When|date=February 2011}} when international trade created the demand for currency markets, importers and exporters now represent only 1/32 of foreign exchange dealing, according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Valdez, ''An Introduction To Global Financial Markets''&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture of foreign currency transactions today shows:
* Banks/Institutions
* Speculators
* Government spending (for example, military bases abroad)
* Importers/Exporters
* Tourists

==Analysis of financial markets==
: ''See [[Statistical analysis of financial markets]]'', ''[[statistical finance]]''

Much effort has gone into the study of financial markets and how prices vary with time. [[Charles Dow]], one of the founders of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]], enunciated a set of ideas on the subject which are now called [[Dow theory]]. This is the basis of the so-called [[technical analysis]] method of attempting to predict future changes. One of the tenets of &quot;technical analysis&quot; is that [[market trend]]s give an indication of the future, at least in the short term. The claims of the technical analysts are disputed by many academics, who claim that the evidence points rather to the [[random walk hypothesis]], which states that the next change is not correlated to the last change. The role of human psychology in price variations also plays a significant factor. Large amounts of volatility often indicate the presence of strong emotional factors playing into the price. Fear can cause excessive drops in price and greed can create bubbles. In recent years the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency program trading has seen the adoption of momentum, ultra-short term moving average and other similar strategies which are based on technical as opposed to fundamental or theoretical concepts of market behaviour.

The scale of changes in price over some unit of time is called the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]].
It was discovered by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] that changes in prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], but are rather modeled better by [[Levy function|Lévy stable distributions]]. The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time unit to a [[power law|power]] a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down are more likely than what one would calculate using a normal distribution with an estimated [[standard deviation]].

==Components of financial market==

===Based on market levels===
* '''Primary market''': A primary market is a market for new issues or new financial claims. Therefore, it is also called new issue market. The primary market deals with those securities which are issued to the public for the first time.
* '''Secondary market''': A market for secondary sale of securities. In other words, securities which have already passed through the new issue market are traded in this market. Generally, such securities are quoted in the stock exchange and it provides a continuous and regular market for buying and selling of securities.

Simply put, primary market is the market where the newly started company issued shares to the public for the first time through IPO (initial public offering). Secondary market is the market where the second hand securities are sold (security Commodity Markets).

===Based on security types ===
* '''Money market''': Money market is a market for dealing with the financial assets and securities which have a maturity period of up to one year. In other words, it's a market for purely short-term funds.
* '''Capital market''': A capital market is a market for financial assets that have a long or indefinite maturity. Generally, it deals with long-term securities that have a maturity period of above one year. The capital market may be further divided into (a) industrial securities market (b) Govt. securities market and (c) long-term loans market.

*&quot;&quot;Relation between Bonds and Commodity Prices&quot;&quot;:
With the increase in commodity prices, the cost of goods for companies increases. This increase in commodity prices level causes a rise in inflation.

*&quot;&quot;Relation between Commodities and Equities&quot;&quot;:
Due to the production cost remaining same, and revenues rising (due to high commodity prices), the operating profit (revenue minus cost) increases, which in turn drives up equity prices.

'''Compact Disc Digital Audio''' ('''CDDA''' or '''CD-DA'''), also known as '''Audio CD''', is the [[standardization|standard]] format for audio [[compact disc]]s. The standard is defined in the '''''Red Book''''', one of a series of [[Rainbow Books]] (named for their binding colors) that contain the [[specification (technical standard)|technical specifications]] for all CD [[content format|formats]].

== Standard ==
The ''Red Book'' specifies the physical parameters and properties of the CD, the optical parameters, deviations and error rate, modulation system ([[eight-to-fourteen modulation]], EFM) and error correction facility ([[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], CIRC), and the eight [[Compact disc subcode|subcode channels]]. These parameters are common to all compact discs and used by all logical formats: audio CD, [[CD-ROM]], etc. The standard also specifies the form of [[digital audio]] encoding (2-channel [[Signedness|signed]] 16-[[bit]] [[Pulse-code modulation|LPCM]] sampled at [[44,100 Hz]]). Although rarely used, the specification allows for discs to be mastered with a form of [[Emphasis (telecommunications)|emphasis]].

The first edition of the ''Red Book'' was released in 1980 by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]];&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto45-1&quot;/&gt; it was adopted by the Digital Audio Disc Committee and ratified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) Technical Committee 100, as an [[international standard]] in 1987 with the reference IEC 60908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto45-2&quot;/&gt; The second edition of IEC 60908 was published in 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto45-3&quot;/&gt; and it replaces the first edition, amendment 1 (1992) and the corrigendum to amendment 1. The IEC 60908 however does not contain all the information for extensions that is available in the Red Book, such as the details for [[CD-Text]], [[CD+G]] and [[CD+EG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edocpublish.com/resources-2/specifications/cd-logos/ Approved Compact Disc Logo configurations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html Specs for Freeware Developers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501075730/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html |date=1 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

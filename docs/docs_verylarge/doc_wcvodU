===Syntax===
Metafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an [[scientific notation|exponent part]]. All other tokens are classified as ''symbolic'', and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be ''capsule'' tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.

Except where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike [[TeX]], Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; are &quot;loners&quot; and only form single character tokens. For the character classes &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&gt;:|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;‘’&lt;/code&gt; (single quotes), &lt;code&gt;+-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/*\&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#&amp;@$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A–Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; starts a comment lasting until end of line.

A notable application of these rules is that &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. &lt;code&gt;em#&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pt#&lt;/code&gt;.

Delimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses. Besides to override priorities in expressions, delimiters are also required around certain kinds of macro arguments.

===Graphics===
Curves in Metafont are defined as [[cubic spline]]s rather than quadratic, for greater versatility at the cost of more complex arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Knuth|first=Donald|subject-link=Donald Knuth|interviewer=Advogato|title=Interview: Donald E. Knuth|url=http://www.advogato.org/article/28.html|date=January 25, 2000|access-date=January 13, 2016|quote=...the mathematics is really simple for a quadratic. The corresponding thing for a cubic is six times as complicated...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122043044/http://www.advogato.org/article/28.html|archive-date=January 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike more common outline font formats (such as [[TrueType]] or [[PostScript#Font handling|PostScript Type 1]]), a Metafont font is primarily made up of strokes with finite-width &quot;pens&quot;, along with filled regions. Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the [[Computer Modern]] family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual &quot;stroke&quot; of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the [[Roman type|Roman]] text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual &quot;strokes&quot;, which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.

Since the font shapes are defined by equations rather than directly coded numbers, it is possible to treat parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, [[serif]] size, and so forth as input parameters in each glyph definition (which then define not a single font, but a [[meta]]-font). Thus, by changing the value of one of these parameters at one location in the Metafont file, one can produce a consistent change throughout the entire font. Computer Modern Roman illustrates many uses of this feature; a typical TeX installation includes a number of versions of the font in sizes from 5pt to 17pt, with the stroke widths the same in all sizes (rather than increasing as the font is scaled up) and aspect ratios widening in the smaller sizes for increased legibility. In addition, the Computer Modern typewriter and [[sans-serif]] fonts are defined using essentially the same Metafont file as the Roman font, but with different global parameters.

==Use==
While well-known type designers, such as [[Hermann Zapf]], have collaborated with Knuth to create new fonts using Metafont, the system has not been widely adopted by professional type designers. Knuth attributes this to the fact that
&quot;asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E. Knuth, reproduced in TUGboat '''17 (4)''' (1996), 355–67. Citation is from page 361. Available online at [http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-4/tb53knuc.pdf ]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Hoefler]] commented that the Metafont system ultimately became &quot;a technology behind zero of your favourite fonts...Knuth's idea that letters start with skeletal forms is flawed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;skeletal forms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoefler |first1=Jonathan |title=Knuth's idea that letters start with skeletal forms is flawed. But his work is important and had lasting impact. |url=https://twitter.com/HoeflerCo/status/655557339987226624 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metafont system allows fonts to be processed in unusual ways; in 1982 Knuth showed how it could be used to morph fonts, with a [[serif]] font slowly transitioning into a [[sans-serif]] design over the course of a text.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Concept of a Meta-Font&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knuth|first1=Donald|title=The Concept of a Meta-Font|journal=Visible Language|date=1982|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–27|url=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/visiblelanguage/pdf/16.1/the-concept-of-a-meta-font.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Donald Knuth]] started work on font creation software in 1977, and produced the first version of Metafont in 1979. Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of [[TeX]], where the number [[asymptotically]] approaches ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' with each revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html#bugs|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character &quot;B&quot; of a font:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
%file name: beta.mf
%mode_setup;
% Define a beanlike shape for the character B
beginchar(&quot;B&quot;,11pt#,11pt#,0);
  % Setup coordinates as an equation system
  y1=y2=y3=0;
  y4=y5=y6=h;
  x1=x4=0;
  x2=x5=w;
  x3=x6=2*w;

  % Define pen
  pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;

  % Draw the character curve
  % z1 is the same as (x1, y1)
  draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;
endchar;

end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This yields the following glyph:

[[File:metafont-example-output.svg|284px]]

The above example will be processed with a command line such as:&lt;ref name=grandsir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/|title=METAFONT Tutorial|author=Christophe Grandsir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;mf '\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf';
gftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then it can be used in a LaTeX file such as&lt;ref name=grandsir/&gt; (all files should dwell in the same directory or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass{article}

\newfont{\letterbeta}{beta}
\newcommand{\otherbeta}{{\letterbeta B}}

\begin{document}
Let's try having a strange \otherbeta\ here.
\end{document}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The resulting PDF file should look like this:
[[File:Tex mf beta.pdf|187px]]

==Producing PostScript Type 1 fonts==
There are several tools for converting Metafont programs to [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts. Most make use of [[MetaPost]]'s ability to convert a subset of Metafont's language into [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] outlines, which can subsequently be converted to PostScript Type 1 fonts. Generating vector outlines of Metafont pen strokes is nontrivial, as the Metafont model of a glyph is a raster image and the exact outlines of most strokes are not [[Bézier curve]]s.{{NoteTag|Technically, Metafont ''does'' generate vector outlines as an intermediate step of rasterising a stroke, but those intermediate outlines are tailored to the current raster resolution and non-simple as curves, so they are very far from being usable as Type 1 outlines. An effect of the non-simplicity is spurious pixels on the concave side of a stroke that get a value of 2 rather than 1, however the automatic culling of pictures being shipped out as glyphs in a font normally prevents this from showing up in the final bitmap.}}

* The Polish [[JNS team]] developed [[METATYPE1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on MetaPost) for creating PostScript Type 1 fonts. Its big disadvantage is that no pens may be used which highly reduces the power of Metafont language. Initially, tool has been used by the Polish [[TeX|GUST]] typeface foundry to produce a modernized and extended variant of [[Computer Modern]], called [[Latin Modern]].
* [[mf2pt1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/mf2pt1/|title=CTAN: tex-archive/support/mf2pt1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also based on Metapost, was developed by Scott Pakin with some contributions from [[Werner Lemberg]]. It also has several limitations detailed in its manual, the most significant one being the restriction that each glyph must be drawn entirely from closed paths. In order to overcome the limitations of mf2pt1, the EPS output by Metapost can be post-processed with [[FontForge]], which is capable of interpreting complex PostScript paths generated by Metapost from Metafont's elliptic pens, and also capable of removing contour overlaps. Since FontForge supports scripting, this post-processing step can also be automated. This approach was used to produce Type 1 outlines for the [[MnSymbol]] mathematical font developed by Achim Blumensath; MnSymbol was designed as a companion to [[Minion (typeface)|Minion Pro]].
* [[MetaFog]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-3/tb48kinc.pdf|title=R. J. Kinch, &quot;MetaFog: converting Metafont shapes to contours&quot;, ''TUGboat'' '''16(3)''', 233–43 (1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proprietary converter that can analytically convert pen strokes, but it requires manual post processing to eliminate degenerate cases, and it is not publicly available. It can process only Metapost output.&lt;ref&gt;K. Píška, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The common approach to generate Type 1 fonts with pen strokes remains to generate a high-resolution bitmap and then using an [[autotracer]], implemented by packages such as [[mftrace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilypond.org/mftrace/ mftrace] – a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or TTF (TrueType) font. It is licensed under the GNU GPL. Created by Han-Wen Nienhuys. Versions prior to 1.0.5 were called 'pktrace'.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TeXtrace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pts.szit.bme.hu/textrace/ TeXtrace] – a collection of scripts for UNIX that convert any TeX font into a Type1 .pfb outline font immediately suitable for use with dvips, pdftex, acroread (and any many other programs). Created by Peter Szabo.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wayne Francis Carey'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/event-news/all-australian|title=All Australian - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 27 May 1971) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er who played with the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] and the [[Adelaide Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL).

A dual-premiership captain at North Melbourne, four-time North Melbourne best-and-fairest ([[Syd Barker Medal]]list) and seven-time [[All-Australian team|All-Australian]], Carey is nicknamed &quot;'''The King'''&quot;, or &quot;'''Duck'''&quot;. In 2001, he was named as [[centre half-forward]] and captain of [[North Melbourne Football Club#North Melbourne Team of the Century|North Melbourne's Team of the Century]], and in 2008 was named as Australian football's greatest ever player, as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book ''The Australian Game of Football'', which was released by the [[Australian Football League|League]] to celebrate 150 years of Australian rules football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike Sheahan's top 50 players&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsid=55909 |title=Mike Sheahan's top 50 players |publisher=AFL.com.au |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he left North Melbourne in disgrace after it was revealed he'd been having an extramarital affair with the wife of his then-teammate [[Anthony Stevens]]. He is also known for his legal problems, which include domestic violence charges and assault convictions.

From 2014 Carey has worked as a Friday night football commentator and ''[[Talking Footy]]'' panelist with [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]].

==Early life==
The son of Kevin and Lynne,&lt;ref name=Denton/&gt; Carey was one of five children who grew up in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/museum/collections/hall-of-fame/inductees/carey,-wayne#.UbusSti4zvg|title=Wayne Carey|work=Sporting Hall of Fame: Australian Rules Football|publisher=[[Museum of the Riverina]]|year=2010|access-date =26 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother and father separated when Carey was aged six, with his mother taking four&lt;ref name=Happell/&gt; of the children to [[Adelaide]], living in a [[homeless shelter]].&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;{{cite interview|last=Carey|first=Wayne|subject-link=Wayne Carey|interviewer=[[Andrew Denton]]|title=Wayne Carey|publisher=[[ABC1|ABCTV]]|location=Australia|date=31 March 2008|work=[[Enough Rope]]|access-date=15 June 2013|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2201719.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601040145/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2201719.htm|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carey's autobiography, his father was a violent man who had spent time at [[Mannus Correctional Centre]] and was troubled by alcoholism.&lt;ref name=Denton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Happell/&gt;&lt;ref name=CareyDT&gt;{{cite news|author=Carey, Wayne|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/carey-tells-of-violent-childhood/story-e6frexni-1225790901296|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]|title=Carey tells of violent childhood|date=25 October 2009|access-date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Kevin Carey retrieved the children from his estranged wife and they returned to Wagga Wagga.&lt;ref name=Happell/&gt;

Carey played [[rugby league]] as a junior,&lt;ref name=Happell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/wayne-carey-hell-and-back-20100602-wzsh.html|work=[[The Age]]|location=Australia|title=Wayne Carey: Hell and back|date=3 June 2010|first=Charles|last=Happell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began playing Australian rules football at the age of eight. At the age of thirteen, Carey returned to Adelaide,&lt;ref name=CareyDT/&gt; where he attended [[The Heights School (Australia)|The Heights School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2005/03/30/famous-alumni-on-lathams-hit-list/|work=[[Crikey]]|date=30 March 2005|title=Famous alumni on Latham's hit list|access-date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played junior football for [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey&quot;/&gt;

==Playing career: 1989–2004==

===AFL===

====VFL debut: 1987–1989====
In 1987, Carey was recruited by [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] after their CEO, [[Greg Miller (Australian footballer)|Greg Miller]], met with the [[Sydney Swans]]' football department to discuss the transfer to North Melbourne of [[John Longmire]], a highly regarded junior key-position player. Once that deal was concluded, Miller then inquired about Carey who, like Longmire, was zoned to the Swans due to having lived in New South Wales. He made a token offer of $10,000 as a transfer fee, to which the Swans surprisingly agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;docID=AGE041204116JD68RJ87|title=Tigers' history backs Miller|first=Rohan|last=Connolly|date=4 December 2004|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24288043-5001023,00.html|title=The Australian: Chasing down the Kangaroo|first=Tim|last=Morrissey|date=4 September 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 16-year-old, Carey made the move to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] and played for the North Melbourne under-19s, where he starred in their 1988 premiership side under coach [[Denis Pagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/163226|pages=40–41|journal=[[Football Record]]|year=1988|issue=Grand Final|title=Under 18 Teams: Grand Final}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey was promoted to the senior list prior to the 1989 season and, after recovering from dislocating his left shoulder in a practice match early in the year, made his first appearance for the seniors as an 18-year-old in round 11 of [[1989 VFL season|1989]] against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]].

====Rise to stardom: 1990–1992====
After playing only four games in his debut year, Carey burst onto the scene in 1990 as a goal-kicking [[centre half-forward]] and as support to their [[full forward]] in Longmire (who was that year's [[Coleman Medal]]list as the AFL's leading goal-kicker). Carey immediately drew the attention of the football world and built a reputation early in his career as an aggressive, big marking and long kicking key position player.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} That year, Carey would become the 1990 season runner up in North Melbourne's best and fairest, behind Longmire. In round 13, a then 19-year-old Carey took 8 marks, had 22 disposals and kicked 7 goals in a big win over Sydney. It was the first of many times Carey would dominate up forward for North.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 21 games in 1990 Carey averaged 5 marks, 14 disposals and 1.8 goals.

The 1991 season started very promisingly for Carey{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and after nine rounds he was averaging 7 marks, 16 disposals and 2.4 goals. At that stage he was leading North Melbourne's best and fairest and, despite still being a teenager, was arguably{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} the Kangaroos' most important player.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In Round 10 against [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]], Carey started brilliantly,{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} kicking two first quarter goals, before an injury to his right shoulder forced him to sit out the rest of that game and the next eight. He struggled to regain form when he returned for the last 5 rounds.

Early in [[1992 AFL season|1992]] Carey considered leaving North Melbourne and returning to Adelaide due to internal unrest within the leadership of the club. He was convinced to stay by the coaching staff{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and, in the latter half of the season, Carey began to show signs that he was destined for greatness.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the second half of 1992 Carey would put a string of outstanding performances to close the season out. By season's end Carey was dominating Centre Half Forward like no one else in the league,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} his play trademarked by big marks and long goals. He finished the year with an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} 7 goal performance against Fitzroy and averaged 10 marks, 20 disposals and 3.3 goals during North Melbourne's last 8 games. For the season, he averaged 7 marks, 18 disposals and 2.2 goals per game. Carey had his first top five finish in the [[Brownlow Medal]], claimed his first club best and fairest and was named club captain by new coach Denis Pagan ahead of the 1993 season.

====Captaincy: 1993–2001====
As captain, Carey led North Melbourne to the finals for eight consecutive years from 1993 to 2000. This streak included seven straight preliminary finals, three grand finals and two premierships (1996 and 1999). During this eight-year period, Carey played 170 games, averaged 8 marks and 19 disposals per game and kicked 524 goals at 3.1 per game. He won three further club best and fairests, was a five-time club leading goal kicker, [[All Australian]] centre half forward seven times, including four times as captain and once as vice-captain, and he was named [[Leigh Matthews Trophy|MVP]] by the [[AFL Players Association]] twice, in 1995 and 1998.

Carey was criticised{{By whom|date=August 2018}} widely for both his on and off field behaviour. On the field he was reported three times and suspended twice for a total of five weeks in 1994. An off the field charge of indecent assault in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Landers, Kim, &quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s2149663.htm Wayne Carey charged by police in Miami],&quot; ABC AM, Wednesday, 30 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; put a damper on his otherwise stellar form. Bookies had Carey as pre-count favourite for the [[Brownlow Medal]] on four separate occasions (1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), but many{{who|date=August 2018}} believe his on field arrogance and backchat to umpires were the primary reason he never claimed the game's highest individual honour.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====First years as captain and &quot;No Carey, No North&quot;: 1993–1995====
In [[1993 AFL season|1993]], at age 21, Carey was the second youngest club captain in VFL/AFL history.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Carey consistently won games off his own boot,{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} including a game against reigning premiers the [[West Coast Eagles]] at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]] in round 12, and then against that year's eventual premiers in Essendon in round 15, where he played a dominant{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} final quarter that marked him as an out-and-out champion.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After 15 rounds of the 1993 season, with North Melbourne on top of the AFL ladder, Carey was leading the club in marks, disposals and goals, before he was injured in their round 16 clash with Brisbane and did not play again until round 20. For the season he averaged 8 marks, 19 disposals and 3.4 goals per game. At the end of the season, Carey became the youngest ever All-Australian captain at 22 years of age and finished third in the Brownlow Medal count, after being outright favourite to take out the prestigious award. But for the freakish efforts of [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett]], many experts had Carey as the game's best player at the conclusion of the season, and he was runner-up behind [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Ablett]] in the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]].

The following year Carey appeared to have improved again. After round 6 of the [[1994 AFL season|1994 season]], Carey was averaging 12 marks, 21 disposals and 4.8 goals per game. This included a 17 mark, 26 disposal, 7 goal performance against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]], 13 marks, 21 disposals and 6 goals against [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] and a 15 mark, 21 disposal, 5 goals in a loss to the West Coast Eagles. Carey's mid season suspensions subdued him somewhat, before he turned it on again to dominate in the finals with two of the all-time great individual finals performances.

In the qualifying final against Hawthorn, Carey kicked the last goal of the final quarter to level the score and force the game into extra time. Carey then kicked the goal to seal the win during extra time and earn North Melbourne a week break before the preliminary final. He finished the game with 10 marks, 32 disposals and 4 goals in an inspiring performance. Two weeks later Carey was irrepressible in the preliminary final against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. With North down by four goals at half time, it was Carey's four third quarter goals that kept them in the game.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} He played a lone hand up forward with 14 marks, of which 10 were contested, 24 disposals and 6 goals, to once again have the scores level at full-time, before Geelong won by a goal, kicked after the final siren by Gary Ablett. Carey's 10 contested marks in the preliminary final were an all time AFL record at the time,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and his finals performances were made more impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} by the fact that he played both games with a torn calf muscle. &quot;In the 21 days between tearing the muscle and the end of the Geelong game, Wayne trained for approximately 10 minutes. To then be best on ground in two finals was nothing short of freakish, and a testament to his talent and commitment.&quot; Coach Denis Pagan later said of Carey's finals performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.on.net/~pwong/carey.htm |title=Wayne Carey v Melbourne |publisher=Users.on.net |date=30 July 1996 |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the season Carey averaged 9 marks, 19 disposals and 3.3 goals per game.

During the first two years of Carey's captaincy at North Melbourne, the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]] registered an impressive{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} 25 wins from the 35 home and away games in which Carey played. In contrast, they lost all but one of the seven games in which he was absent during the same period. Such was the influence that Carey had on games in which he played, and so much did the Kangaroos struggle in his absence that, in mid-1994, the phenomenon was given a name – 'No Carey, no North'.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

After leading North Melbourne to the [[Ansett Cup]] Premiership in the pre-season, Carey's reputation as the game's number one player continued to grow early in [[1995 AFL season|1995]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He kicked 18 goals in North's four pre-season games and was the dominant player on the ground on each occasion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} By mid season, Carey was an unbackable{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} favorite to take out the Brownlow Medal as he dominated games like none before him. Over nine games, from rounds 6 to 14, Carey averaged 11 marks, 22 disposals and 3.8 goals per game in a brilliant run of form. In round seven, he registered a career high 33 disposals against Fitzroy. His best games of the year, however, came later in the season, both against Premiership contenders [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. The first was in a come-from-behind last quarter win in round 19, and then four weeks later in a Qualifying Final win – Carey's third dominant finals game in succession. In both games Carey kicked five goals and had 25 and 22 disposals respectively. The season ended on a sour note for Carey, being well held{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} by Jakovich in the Semi-final and then [[AFL Team of the Century|full back of the century]] [[Stephen Silvagni]] in the Preliminary Final, where North Melbourne went down to eventual Premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]. For the season, Carey averaged 7 marks, 18 disposals and 2.6 goals per game, led the league in marks and contested marks and took out a host of individual awards from the media and [[AFL Players Association]] as the season's best player.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

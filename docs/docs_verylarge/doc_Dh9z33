==Spread of the Renaissance in Italy==
[[File:748CertosaPaviaChiesa.JPG|thumb|The Church of the [[Certosa di Pavia]], Lombardy]]
In the 15th century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture.

In [[Mantua]] at the court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], Alberti designed two churches, the [[Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]] and [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]].

[[Urbino]] was an important centre with the ancient [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|Ducal Palace]] being extended for [[Federico da Montefeltro]] in the mid 15th century. The Duke employed [[Luciano Laurana]] from [[Dalmatia]], renowned for his expertise at fortification. The design incorporates much of the earlier medieval building and includes an unusual turreted three-storeyed façade. Laurana was assisted by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Later parts of the building are clearly Florentine in style, particularly the inner courtyard, but it is not known who the designer was.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/828 Historic Centre of Urbino] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119121157/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/828 |date=19 January 2013 }}'', (retrieved 10-12-20123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferrara]], under the [[House of Este|Este]], was expanded in the late 15th century, with several new palaces being built such as the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] and [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] for [[Borso d'Este]].

In [[Milan]], under the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], the [[Certosa di Pavia]] was completed, and then later under the [[Sforza]], the [[Castello Sforzesco]] was built.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[Venetian Renaissance architecture]] developed a particularly distinct character because of local conditions. [[San Zaccaria]] received its Renaissance façade at the hands of [[Antonio Gambello]] and [[Mauro Codussi]], begun in the 1480s.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Kaminski, ''Art and Architecture of Venice'', 1999, Könemann, {{ISBN|3-8290-2657-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Maria Falconetto]], the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia Cornaro in the garden of [[Alvise Cornaro]].

In southern Italy, Renaissance masters were called to Naples by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] after his conquest of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in that city are the [[Cappella Caracciolo]], attributed to Bramante, and the [[Palazzo Orsini di Gravina]], built by [[Gabriele d'Angelo]] between 1513 and 1549.

==High Renaissance==

In the late 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as [[Bramante]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] and others showed a mastery of the revived style and ability to apply it to buildings such as churches and city palazzo which were quite different from the structures of ancient times. The style became more decorated and ornamental, statuary, domes and [[cupola]]s becoming very evident.
The architectural period is known as the &quot;High Renaissance&quot; and coincides with the age of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

===Bramante===
[[Donato Bramante]], (1444–1514), was born in [[Urbino]] and turned from painting to architecture, finding his first important patronage under [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, for whom he produced a number of buildings over 20 years. After the fall of [[Milan]] to the French in 1499, Bramante travelled to Rome where he achieved great success under papal patronage.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Milan Santa Maria della Crazie Bramante.jpg|thumb|The crossing of Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan (1490)]]

Bramante’s finest architectural achievement in Milan is his addition of crossing and choir to the abbey church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)]]. This is a brick structure, the form of which owes much to the Northern Italian tradition of square domed [[Baptistery|baptisteries]]. The new building is almost centrally planned, except that, because of the site, the chancel extends further than the transept arms. The hemispherical dome, of approximately 20 metres across, rises up hidden inside an octagonal [[drum (architecture)|drum]] pierced at the upper level with arched classical openings. The whole exterior has delineated details decorated with the local [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

In Rome Bramante created what has been described as &quot;a perfect architectural gem&quot;,&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; the [[San Pietro in Montorio#The_Tempietto|Tempietto]] in the Cloister of [[San Pietro in Montorio]]. This small circular temple marks the spot where St Peter was martyred and is thus the most sacred site in Rome. The building adapts the style apparent in the remains of the [[Temple of Vesta]], the most sacred site of Ancient Rome. It is enclosed by and in spatial contrast with the cloister which surrounds it. As approached from the cloister, as in the [[:File:Tempietto, links.jpg|picture above]], it is seen framed by an arch and columns, the shape of which are echoed in its free-standing form.

Bramante went on to work at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] where he designed the impressive [[Cortile del Belvedere]]. In 1506 his design for [[Pope Julius II]]’s rebuilding of [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] was selected, and the foundation stone laid. After Bramante’s death and many changes of plan, [[Michelangelo]], as chief architect, reverted to something closer to Bramante’s original proposal.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palais Farnese.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Farnese]], [[Rome]] (1534–1545). Designed by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Michelangelo]].]]

===Sangallo===
[[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] (1485–1546) was one of a family of [[Military engineering|military engineers]]. His uncle, [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] was one of those who submitted a plan for the rebuilding of St Peter’s and was briefly a co-director of the project, with [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Antonio da Sangallo also submitted a plan for St Peter’s and became the chief architect after the death of Raphael, to be succeeded himself by Michelangelo.

His fame does not rest upon his association with St Peter’s but in his building of the [[Farnese Palace]], “the grandest palace of this period”, started in 1530.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56&amp;nbsp;m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. It is also a building of beautiful proportion, unusual for such a large and luxurious house of the date in having been built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the stately repetition of finely detailed windows give a powerful effect, setting a new standard of elegance in palace-building. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. It is probably just as well that this impressive building is of brick; the travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Pandolfini, view 02 crop.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Pandolfini, Florence, by Raphael]]

===Raphael===
[[Raphael]] (1483–1520), born in [[Urbino]], trained under [[Perugino]] in [[Perugia]] before moving to Florence, was for a time the chief architect for St. Peter’s, working in conjunction with Antonio Sangallo. He also designed a number of buildings, most of which were finished by others. His single most influential work is the [[Palazzo Pandolfini]] in Florence with its two stories of strongly articulated windows of a &quot;[[Aedicula|tabernacle]]&quot; type, each set around with ordered pilasters, cornice and alternate arched and triangular pediments.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Mannerism==
{{main|Mannerism}}
'''Mannerism''' in architecture was marked by widely diverging tendencies in the work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], that led to the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]] in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.
[[File:Palazzo_Massimo_alle_Colonne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]].]]

===Peruzzi===
[[Baldassare Peruzzi]], (1481–1536), was an architect born in [[Siena]], but working in Rome, whose work bridges the [[High Renaissance]] and the Mannerist period.
His [[Villa Farnesina]] of 1509 is a very regular monumental cube of two equal stories, the bays being strongly articulated by orders of pilasters. The building is unusual for its frescoed walls.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Peruzzi’s most famous work is the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] in Rome. The unusual features of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street. It has in its ground floor a dark central [[portico]] running parallel to the street, but as a semi enclosed space, rather than an open loggia. Above this rise three undifferentiated floors, the upper two with identical small horizontal windows in thin flat frames which contrast strangely with the deep porch, which has served, from the time of its construction, as a refuge to the city’s poor.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Te Mantova 1.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Te]], Mantua]]

===Giulio Romano===
[[Giulio Romano]] (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, assisting him on various works for the Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico II Gonzaga]] at Mantua on the [[Palazzo Te]] (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden [[grotto]]es and extensive frescoes, he uses [[illusion|illusionistic effects]], surprising combinations of architectural form and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as ''“one of the first promoters of Mannerism”''.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] (1475–1564) was one of the creative giants whose achievements mark the High Renaissance. He excelled in each of the fields of painting, sculpture and architecture and his achievements brought about significant changes in each area. His architectural fame lies chiefly in two buildings: the interiors of the [[Laurentian Library]] and its lobby at the monastery of San Lorenzo in Florence, and [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

St. Peter's was &quot;the greatest creation of the Renaissance&quot;,&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; and a great number of architects contributed their skills to it. But at its completion, there was more of Michelangelo’s design than of any other architect, before or after him.

[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|St Peter's Basilica]]

====St. Peter's====
The plan that was accepted at the laying of the foundation stone in 1506 was that by [[Bramante]]. Various changes in plan occurred in the series of architects that succeeded him, but Michelangelo, when he took over the project in 1546, reverted to Bramante’s Greek-cross plan and redesigned the piers, the walls and the dome, giving the lower weight-bearing members massive proportions and eliminating the encircling aisles from the chancel and identical transept arms. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] says: &quot;Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen, converted its snowflake complexity into a massive, cohesive unity.&quot;&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

Michelangelo’s dome was a masterpiece of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive [[roof lantern]] supported, as at Florence, on ribs. For the exterior of the building he designed a [[giant order]] which defines every external bay, the whole lot being held together by a wide cornice which runs unbroken like a rippling ribbon around the entire building.

There is a wooden model of the dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the building had reached the height of the drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was [[Giacomo della Porta]]. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner and Gardener suggest that Michelangelo began with the idea of a pointed dome, as in Florence, then in his old age reverted to the lower silhouette, and that della Porta stuck to Michelangelo's original concept. Mignacca, on the other hand, suggests that the pointed dome was Michelangelo's final, and brilliant, solution to the apparent visual tension within the building.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|left|The vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]

====Laurentian Library====
Michelangelo was at his most Mannerist in the design of the vestibule of the [[Laurentian Library]], also built by him to house the [[Cosimo de' Medici|Medici]] collection of books at the convent of [[San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in Florence, the same San Lorenzo’s at which [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] had recast church architecture into a Classical mold and established clear formula for the use of [[Classical orders]] and their various components.

Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi’s components and bends them to his will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all the more so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.

The space is crowded and it is to be expected that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In the [[San Lorenzo, Florence|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console brackets. Pevsner says the &quot;Laurenziana [...] reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form&quot;.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldscheider, ''Michelangelo'', 1964, Phaidon.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Church of the Gesù, Rome crop.jpg|thumb|left|Il Gesù, designed by Giacomo della Porta.]]

===Giacomo della Porta===
[[Giacomo della Porta]], (c.1533–1602), was famous as the architect who made the dome of St. Peter's Basilica a reality. The change in outline between the dome as it appears in the model and the dome as it was built, has brought about speculation as to whether the changes originated with della Porta or with Michelangelo himself.

Della Porta spent nearly all his working life in Rome, designing villas, palazzi and churches in the Mannerist style. One of his most famous works is the façade of the [[Church of the Gesù]], a project that he inherited from his teacher [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]. Most characteristics of the original design are maintained, subtly transformed to give more weight to the central section, where della Porta uses, among other motifs, a low triangular [[pediment]] overlaid on a segmental one above the main door. The upper storey and its pediment give the impression of compressing the lower one. The center section, like that of Sant'Andrea at Mantua, is based on the [[triumphal arch]], but has two clear horizontal divisions like [[Santa Maria Novella]]. &lt;sup&gt;See Alberti above.&lt;/sup&gt; The problem of linking the aisles to the [[nave]] is solved using Alberti’s scrolls, in contrast to Vignola’s solution which provided much smaller brackets and four statues to stand above the paired pilasters, visually weighing down the corners of the building. The influence of the design may be seen in Baroque churches throughout Europe.

===Andrea Palladio===
[[Andrea Palladio]], (1508–80), &quot;the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance&quot;,&lt;ref name= BF /&gt; was, as a stonemason, introduced to Humanism by the poet [[Giangiorgio Trissino]]. His first major architectural commission was the rebuilding of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] at [[Vicenza]], in the [[Veneto]] where he was to work most of his life.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Larotonda2009.JPG|thumb|[[Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;]]]]
Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]] to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple [[peristyle]] form. When he used the triumphal arch motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif&lt;ref&gt;described by the architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva''&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as the Palladian Arch.

The best known of Palladio’s domestic buildings is [[Villa Capra]], otherwise known as &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, a centrally planned house with a domed central hall and four identical façades, each with a temple-like portico like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundram, Thomas Pape, Paolo Marton, ''Andrea Palladio'', Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-0271-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Villa Cornaro]], the projecting portico of the north façade and recessed loggia of the garden façade are of two [[Classical order|ordered]] stories, the upper forming a balcony.&lt;ref&gt;Branco Mitrovic and Stephen R. Wassell, ''Andrea Palladio: Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese'' (New York: Acanthus Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-926494-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the designing of a church façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking the aisles to the nave while maintaining and defining the structure of the building. Palladio’s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the [[church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

==Progression from Early Renaissance through to Baroque==
{{main|Baroque architecture}}
[[File:1993-1994-Giardino Giusti (Verona)-testo e photo Paolo Villa-nA2-tesi Accademia Belle Arti Bologna-portone di Palazzo Giusti.jpg|thumb|[[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]] with profile of man, [[Palazzo Giusti]], Verona, Italy]]
In Italy, there appears to be a seamless progression from Early Renaissance architecture through the High Renaissance and Mannerism to the Baroque style. Pevsner comments about the vestibule of the Laurentian Library that it &quot;has often been said that the motifs of the walls show Michelangelo as the father of the Baroque&quot;.

While continuity may be the case in Italy, it was not necessarily the case elsewhere. The adoption of the Renaissance style of architecture was slower in some areas than in others, as may be seen in England, for example. Indeed, as [[Pope Julius II]] was having the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] demolished to make way for the new, [[Henry VII of England]] was adding a glorious new chapel in the [[English Gothic architecture|Perpendicular Gothic]] style to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Likewise, the style that was to become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at about the time that the first fully Renaissance buildings were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in the broadest sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved in the direction of the Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.

In a similar way, in many parts of Europe that had few purely classical and ordered buildings like Brunelleschi’s Santo Spirito and Michelozzo’s Medici Riccardi Palace, Baroque architecture appeared almost unheralded, on the heels of a sort of Proto-Renaissance local style.&lt;ref name= Jan&gt;Janson, H.W., Anthony F. Janson (1997). ''History of Art'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.. {{ISBN|0-8109-3442-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Baroque and its replacement of traditional and more conservative Renaissance architecture was particularly apparent in the building of churches as part of the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

==Spread in Europe==
{{main|Northern Renaissance}}
The 16th century saw the economic and political ascendancy of France and Spain, and then later of England, Germany, Poland and Russia and the [[Low Countries]]. The result was that these places began to import the Renaissance style as indicators of their new cultural position. This also meant that it was not until about 1500 and later that signs of Renaissance architectural style began to appear outside Italy.

Though Italian architects were highly sought after, such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]] in France, [[Aristotile Fioravanti]] in [[Russia]], and [[Francesco Fiorentino]] in [[Poland]], soon, non-Italians were studying Italian architecture and translating it into their own idiom. These included [[Philibert de l'Orme]] (1510–1570) in France, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (died: 1567) in Spain, [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652) in England and [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) in Germany.&lt;ref name= Jan /&gt;

Books or ornament prints with [[engraving|engraved]] illustrations demonstrating plans and ornament were very important in spreading Renaissance styles in Northern Europe, with among the most important authors being [[Androuet du Cerceau]] in France, and [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] in the Netherlands, and [[Wendel Dietterlin]], author of ''Architectura'' (1593–94) in Germany.

===Baltic States===
[[File:House of Blackheads at Dusk 3, Riga, Latvia - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House of the Blackheads]] in [[Riga]], Latvia]]
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Architecture of Estonia}}
The Renaissance arrived late in what is today [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], the so-called [[Baltic States]], and did not make a great imprint architecturally. It was a politically tumultuous time, marked by the decline of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and the [[Livonian War]].

In Estonia, artistic influences came from Dutch, Swedish and Polish sources.&lt;ref name=toivo&gt;{{cite book |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810865716 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|Brotherhood of the Blackheads in Tallinn]] with a façade designed by [[Arent Passer]], is the only truly Renaissance building in the country that has survived more or less intact.&lt;ref name= &quot;Viirand&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Viirand| first = Tiiu| authorlink = | title = Estonia.

Latvian Renaissance architecture was influenced by Polish-Lithuanian and Dutch style, with [[Mannerism]] following from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] without intermediaries. [[St. John's Church, Riga|St. John's Church]] in the Latvian capital of [[Riga]] is example of an earlier Gothic church which was reconstructed in 1587–89 by the Dutch architect Gert Freze (Joris Phraeze). The prime example of Renaissance architecture in Latvia is the heavily decorated [[House of the Blackheads]], rebuilt from an earlier Medieval structure into its present Mannerist forms as late as 1619–25 by the architects A. and L. Jansen. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

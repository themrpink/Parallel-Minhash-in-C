Although Suva is on a peninsula, and almost surrounded by sea, the nearest beach is 40 kilometres (25&amp;nbsp;mi) away at Pacific Harbour and the nearby coast is lined by mangroves. A significant part of the city centre, including the old [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]] buildings, is built on reclaimed mangrove swamp.

===Central===
The Central Business District encompasses an area known as the Central Ward; one of Suva's six wards, Central occupies close to the whole south-western side of the Suva Peninsula.

===City wards===
The city's six wards beginning from the city centre, then north, then clockwise rotation.

# Central: city centre, CBD, nucleus of the city
# Tamavua: residential and urban area
# Cunningham: semi-urban and residential area
# Nabua: military base, Southern Division Police Headquarters, urban, residential, separate town centre, and industrial zone
# Samabula: urban, residential, separate town centre, university, and large industrial zones
# Muanikau: residential, urban, large sporting venues, university, and recreational areas

===Suva–Nausori Corridor===
Suva sits in the middle of an urban conurbation that stretches from [[Lami, Fiji|Lami]], to the immediate west of the city, along the Queens Highway and [[Nasinu]] town, on its eastern border all the way to the Rewa River, along the Kings Highway. This conurbation, sometimes known as the Suva Urban Complex, continues till [[Nausori]], over the Rewa River. The north of the city to its northeast contains the rainforest park areas of Colo-i-Suva and Sawani, along the Princes Road, connecting at the Rewa River Bridge. This entire conurbation, is generally referred to by locals as Suva, although it contains four local government areas. In formal reference, this complex has come to be known as the Suva–Nausori Corridor (where Lami is generally excluded) and is the most populous area in Fiji, with over 330,000 people.

Suva features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. However, as a trade-wind climate which besides knows occasional [[cyclone]]s, it is not equatorial. The city sees a copious amount of precipitation during the course of the year, with no true dry season due to no month having an average rainfall below {{convert|60|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Suva averages {{convert|3000|mm|0|abbr=in}} of precipitation annually with its driest month, July averaging {{convert|125|mm|2|abbr=on}}. In fact, during all 12 months of the year, Suva receives substantial precipitation, such that the term &quot;fine weather&quot; in a weather report simply means &quot;not actually raining&quot;. Like many other cities with a tropical rainforest climate, temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with an average high of about {{convert|28|°C|0}} and an average low of about {{convert|22|°C|0}}.

Suva has a markedly higher rainfall than [[Nadi]] and the western side of [[Viti Levu]], which is known to Suva citizens as &quot;the burning west&quot;. The second Governor of Fiji, [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Gordon]], allegedly remarked that it rained in Suva like he had seen nowhere else before and that there was hardly a day without rain. The most copious rainfall is observed from November to May, while the slightly cooler months from June to October are considerably drier.

==Demographics==
[[File:Suva, Fiji 52.jpg|thumb|People in Suva]]
Suva is a multiracial and multicultural city. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijians]] and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], the two principal ethnic groups of Fiji, comprise the bulk of Suva's population, and the city is home to the majority of Fiji's ethnic minority populations, which include Rotumans, Lauans, Rambians, Caucasians ([[Europeans in Oceania|Europeans]] or ''Kaivalagi''), part-Europeans (of European and Fijian descent), or Kailoma&quot; and [[Chinese in Fiji|Chinese]], amongst others. The most widely spoken language is English, but [[Fijian language|Fijian]], [[Hindi language|Hindustani]], and other languages are also spoken by their respective communities.

Suva boasts having representation of all major indigenous Pacific groups, and is sometimes referred to as the “[[New York City|New York]] of the Pacific&quot;. The city's reputation as a major economic centre in the region, and also its hosting of the [[University of the South Pacific]]'s main campus has led to an influx of Pacific migrants who study, work and live in the city and its boroughs.

==Municipal government==
{{Main|Suva City Council}}

Suva has [[Local government in Fiji|municipal]] status and is supposed to be governed by a [[Mayor|Lord Mayor]] and a 20-member [[city council]]. The Suva City Council is the municipal law-making body of the city of Suva, Fiji's capital. It consists of 20 Councillors, elected for three-year terms from four multi-member constituencies called wards. Councillors, who are elected by residents, landowners, and representatives of corporations owning or occupying rateable property in Suva, elect a Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor from among their own members; they serve one-year terms and are eligible for re-election.

In 2009, the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government dismissed all municipal governments throughout Fiji and appointed special administrators to run the urban areas. {{As of|2015}}, elected municipal government has not been restored. The special administrator of Suva, along with nearby [[Nasinu]], is [[Chandu Umaria]], a former Lord Mayor of Suva.&lt;ref name=&quot;RNZI_44529&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=44529 |title=Ba ex-mayor says Fiji municipal reform was expected |date=2 February 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==

[[File:Clock Tower Suva MatthiasSuessen-8428.jpg|thumb|Thurston Gardens, Suva]]

A well-known landmark is the [[Suva City Carnegie Library]], built in 1909 as well as many other colonial buildings.

The government buildings complex sits on what was once the flowing waters of a creek. It was drained in 1935 and over five kilometres of reinforced concrete pilings were driven into the creek bed to support the massive buildings to be erected. After the foundation stone was laid in 1937, the building was completed in 1939; a new wing was completed in 1967. [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], however, was moved to a new complex on [[Ratu Sukuna Road]] in 1992.

[[Government House, Suva|Government House]] was formerly the residence of Fiji's [[British Empire|colonial]] [[Governor of Fiji|Governors]] and, following independence in 1970, [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governors-General]]. It is now the official residence of Fiji's [[President of Fiji|President]]. Originally erected in 1882, it had to be rebuilt in 1928, following its destruction by lightning in 1921.

The Suva campus of the [[University of the South Pacific]] (USP) occupies what was once a New Zealand military base. It is the largest of the many USP campuses dotted throughout the South Pacific and the largest university in the [[Pacific Islands]] outside Hawaii. It offers courses which are internationally recognised and endorsed.

The [[Fiji Museum]], in [[Thurston Gardens]], was founded in 1904 and originally occupied the old town hall, but moved to its present location in 1954. The museum houses the most extensive collection of Fijian artefacts in the world, and is also a research and educational institution, specialising in archaeology, the preservation of Fiji's oral tradition, and the publication of material on Fiji's language and culture.

Suva has around 78 parks, these include the new [[Takashi Suzuki Garden]], [[Apted Park]] at [[Suva Point]] which is a popular spot for viewing sunrise and sunset, [[Thurston Gardens]] which was opened in 1913 and has flora from throughout the South Pacific.

Suva has many shopping and retail areas, notably Cumming street, which has since colonial times been a vibrant and colourful shopping area. Features of these streets include the original colonial buildings and narrow roads. More modern shopping malls, such as the Suva Central Shopping Mall, Mid-City Mall as well as MHCC are all part of the developments to give the city a modern and sophisticated look.

In December 2009, there was an addition to Suva's skyline with the opening of TappooCity valued at US$25.7&amp;nbsp;million (FJD50&amp;nbsp;million) a joint venture six-storey low-rise building project by FNPF &amp; Tappoo Group of Companies as Fiji's (and South Pacific's) largest department mall at present outside Australia &amp; New Zealand.

Construction work began in January 2011 for a FJD30&amp;nbsp;million mini-mall complex at Grantham Road behind the Sports-City Complex and close proximity to [[University of the South Pacific]], which will house restaurants, retail outlets and cinemas. Although construction was scheduled for end 2011, this complex will now be ready mid-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction works for a $30 million complex that will include a cinema has begun in Suva |url=https://fijisun.com.fj/main_page/view.asp?id=51605 |website=fijisun |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723094242/https://fijisun.com.fj/main_page/view.asp?id=51605 |archivedate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==


Unlike most cities and towns in Fiji and indeed many around the world, Suva did not grow around one industry but has gradually developed as a hub and the largest and most sophisticated city in the Pacific Islands. Fijians of Indian descent have largely shaped the economy of Fiji, contributing immensely to the growth of Suva and its status as the economic and political capital of Fiji. Suva is the commercial center of Fiji with most banks having their Pacific headquarters here, including [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] and the [[Westpac Bank]]. Most national financial institutions, [[non-governmental organisations]] and government ministries and departments are headquartered here. At one point both [[Air Pacific]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;World Airline Survey.&quot; ''[[Flight Global]]''. 10 April 1969. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200629.html?search=%22Air%20Micronesia%22 557].&lt;/ref&gt; (now called [[Fiji Airways]] and [[Air Fiji]])&lt;ref&gt;''World Airline Directory''. Flight International. 16–22 March 2004. &quot;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2004/2004-09%20-%200065.html 63].&quot; &quot;185 Victoria Parade, Suva, Fiji.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; were headquartered in Suva.

A large part of Fiji's [[shipping|international shipping]] is conducted at Suva's Kings Wharf as well as docking of international cruise ships, which has led to a growth in Suva's [[Tourism|tourism industry]]. Many services are provided in Suva and is the basis of Suva's industrial and commercial activity.

There are large industrial areas, the largest being at Walu Bay, where there is a saturation of factories and [[warehouses]] and import and export companies. This area contains many [[shipyards]] for ship building and repairs as well as container yards. There is a brewery and many printeries. Other notable industrial zones are located in Vatuwaqa, Raiwaqa and Laucala Beach.

There is a large commercial and shopping scene in Suva with streets such as Cumming Street and Victoria Parade being popular. There are many shopping complexes to visit and many markets.

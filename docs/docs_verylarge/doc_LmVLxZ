[[File:510 Giscon (Albatros-Klasse).jpg|thumb|right|''Giscon'' (510), a fast attack craft of the Tunisian Navy, photographed 21 October 2008]]
Established in 1959, the '''Marine nationale tunisienne''' (Tunisian National Navy) initially received French assistance, including advisory personnel and several small patrol vessels.&lt;ref name=TNLOC&gt;[[Library of Congress Country Study]], Tunisia, 300-301, via http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Tunisia%20Study_3.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514035012/http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Tunisia%20Study_3.pdf |date=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October 1973, the U.S. [[Edsall-class destroyer escort]] {{USS|Thomas J. Gary|DE-326}} was decommissioned in ceremonies at the Quai d'Honneur, Bizerte. Moments later, the ship was commissioned by the Tunisian Navy as the ''President Bourgiba''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]], [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t4/thomas_j_gary.htm Thomas J.

The most important additions to the fleet in the 1980s were three [[La Combattante III class fast attack craft]] armed with Exocet surface-to-surface missiles. Apart from these vessels, however, most of the fleet's units were old and capable of little more than coastal patrol duties.

During the 1960s and 1970s the navy was primarily involved in combating the smuggling of contraband, the illegal entry of un-
desirable aliens, and unauthorized emigration as well as other coastal security activities.&lt;ref name=TNLOC /&gt; In these matters the overall effort was shared with agencies of the Ministry of Interior, especially the customs agents and immigration personnel of the [[Surete Nationale]].

''President Bourgiba'' suffered a major fire on 16 April 1992 and later left operational service.
 
Today the Tunisian Navy reportedly has bases at [[Bizerte]], [[Kelibia]], [[La Goulette]], and [[Sfax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Anthony H.

The government of former President Ben Ali tightly controlled the press and broadcasting. But since the 2011 popular revolt, many journalists have enjoyed new-found freedoms. The number of radio and TV channels and print publications has increased, as has their freedom to report and debate political and social issues. State TV, which had toed the government line, has changed tack, giving airtime to the former opposition.&lt;ref name=BBC-Tunisia-Media/&gt;

Prior to the Tunisian revolution there were four private radio stations operating in Tunisia. In June 2011, following the [[Tunisian revolution]], a recommendation to license twelve new private radio stations was forwarded to the interim Prime Minister. In August 2011 none of the recommendations had been acted upon. However, several stations began broadcasting under time-limited provisional licenses. The stations operate without specific operating rules because a new regulatory framework is not yet in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latunisievote.org/en/politics/item/253-new-private-radios-authorized-but-still-voiceless &quot;New Private Radios: Authorized but still Voiceless&quot;], Latifa Al-Mekbali, 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nawaat.org/portail/2012/07/17/tunisia-the-hijacking-of-free-radio/ &quot;Tunisia: The hijacking of free radio&quot;], Sana Sbouai, [[Nawaat]], 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In part due to the lack of a regulatory framework the government's National Office of Broadcasting (ONT) requires broadcasters to pay a licensing fee of 120,000 dinars (approximately $75,000), and while that license is not necessary to broadcast, it confers a certain amount of legitimacy that broadcasters need to draw advertisers. The large fee is difficult for new start-up stations and the new stations feel that the fees provide an unfair advantage for the older more established private groups organized under the previous regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/11/14/emerging-from-the-underground-pirate-radio-seeks-legitimacy/ &quot;Emerging from the Underground, Pirate Radio Seeks Acceptance&quot;], Paul Rosenfeld, ''Tunisia Live'', 14 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunisian government considers [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) an important tool to boost the country's economy and to adapt the education system to the opportunities available from using Information Technology (IT) as a tool. [[E-commerce]], [[e-learning]], and [[Telemedicine|e-medicine]] are all areas of strong interest where the Government is seeking international partnership and investments. During the last 15 years, several important efforts were made to invest in ICT and the Internet. Physical infrastructures were modernised. In July 2004 the World Bank approved a  $13 million loan to the Tunisian government to support the government effort in accelerating its ICT reforms. Though, beyond the high priority the government is giving to ICT, development of telecommunications in Tunisia has been slower than expected compared to other developing countries in [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.weforum.org/pdf/GITR10/Part2/Chap%203_ICT%20in%20Tunisia.pdf &quot;Chapter 2.3: ICT on Tunisia: A Strategic Lever for Building a Knowledge-Based Economy&quot;], Tawfix Jelassi, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (France), ''The Global Information Technology Report 2009-2010'', World Economic Forum, 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 World Summit on the Information Society==
{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}

The first World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was held in Geneva in 2003. [[Tunisia]] hosted the second World Summit in November 2005. The Tunisian government took the initiative to host the summit in 1998. It was organised by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. A declaration of Principles and Plan of Action were approved in order to bridge the [[digital gap]] between developing and developed countries within the World Information Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/tunis/index.html &quot;Second Phase of the WSIS, 16-18 November 2005, Tunis&quot;], World Summit on the Information Society, International Telecommunications Union, retrieved 20 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yellow River''' or '''Huang He''' ({{audio|Huanghe pron.ogg|listen|hell=no}}) is the second-longest [[river]] in [[China]], after the [[Yangtze River]], and the [[List of rivers by length|sixth-longest]] river system in the world at the estimated length of {{convert|5464|km|mi||sp=us|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geol.lsu.edu/WDD/ASIAN/Huanghe/huange_he.htm Yellow River (Huang He) Delta, China, Asia]. Geol.lsu.edu (2000-02-28). Retrieved on 2013-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;   Originating in the [[Bayan Har Mountains]] in [[Qinghai]] province of [[Western China]], it flows through nine provinces, and it empties into the [[Bohai Sea]] near the city of [[Dongying]] in [[Shandong]] province. The Yellow River basin has an east–west extent of about {{convert|1900|km|-1|sp=us}} and a north–south extent of about {{convert|1100|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}. Its total [[drainage area]] is about {{convert|795,000|km2|sp=us}}.

Its basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization, and it was the most prosperous region in early [[Chinese history]]. There are frequent devastating [[natural disasters in China|floods]] and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the [[river bed]], sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.

== Name ==
Early Chinese literature including the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' or ''Tribute of Yu'' dating to the [[Warring States period]] (475–221&amp;nbsp;BC) refers to the Yellow River as simply {{linktext|lang=zh|河}} ([[Old Chinese]]: ''*C.gˤaj'',&lt;ref name=&quot;BaxSag&quot;&gt;Baxter, Wm. H. &amp; Sagart, Laurent. ''{{cite web|url= http://crlao.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1207 |title=Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.93&amp;nbsp;MB)}}'', p. 41. 2011. Accessed 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; modern Chinese (Pinyin) ''Hé''), a character that has come to mean &quot;river&quot; in modern usage. The first appearance of the name {{linktext|lang=zh-hant|黃河}} ([[Old Chinese]]: ''*N-kʷˤaŋ C.gˤaj''; [[Middle Chinese]]: ''Huang Ha''&lt;ref name=&quot;BaxSag&quot;/&gt;) is in the [[Book of Han]] written during the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty about the [[Western Han]] dynasty. The adjective &quot;yellow&quot; describes the perennial color of the muddy water in the lower course of the river, which arises from soil ([[loess]]) being carried downstream.

One of its older [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] names was the &quot;Black River&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Edward H. ''[https://archive.org/details/chinaherhistoryd00park China: Her History, Diplomacy, and Commerce, from the Earliest Times to the Present Day]'', p. 11. Dutton (New York), 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; because the river runs clear before it enters the [[Loess Plateau]], but the current name of the river among [[Inner Mongolia]]ns is ''Ȟatan Gol'' ({{linktext|Хатан гол}}, &quot;Queen River&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;geonames&quot;&gt;[http://www.geonames.de Geonames.de]. &quot;[http://www.geonames.de/water3.html#hua geonames.de: Huang He]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia itself, it is simply called the ''Šar Mörön'' ({{linktext|Шар мөрөн}}, &quot;Yellow River&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mongolian–English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cULYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA537|last=Bawden |first=Charles |publisher=Kegan Paul, reprinted 2010 by Routledge |date=1997 |pages=537 and 593 |isbn=9781136155888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Qinghai]], the river's [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] name is &quot;River of the Peacock&quot; ({{bo|t={{linktext|རྨ|་|ཆུ}} |w=rma.chu |s=Ma Chu}}; {{zh|s={{linktext|玛|曲}} |t={{linktext|瑪|曲}} |p=Mǎ Qū}})

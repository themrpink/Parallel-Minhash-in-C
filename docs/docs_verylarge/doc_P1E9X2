      <text bytes="6912" xml:space="preserve">A '''protective distribution system''' ('''PDS'''), also called ''protected distribution system'', is a US government term for wireline or [[fiber-optics]] [[telecommunication]] system that includes terminals and adequate [[acoustical]], [[electrical]], [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], and physical safeguards to permit its use for the unencrypted [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[classified information]].  At one time these systems were called &quot;'''approved circuits'''&quot;.

A complete protected distribution system includes the subscriber and [[terminal equipment]] and the interconnecting lines.

==Description==
The purpose of a PDS is to deter, detect and/or make difficult physical access to the communication lines carrying [[national security]] information.
A specification called the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 7003 was issued in December 1996 by the [[Committee on National Security Systems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spec&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title= Protective distribution system |work= National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction number 7003 |date= December 13, 1996 |publisher= Committee on National Security Systems |url= http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissi_7003.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060713051217/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissi_7003.pdf |archivedate= July 13, 2006 |accessdate= October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Approval authority, standards, and guidance for the design, installation, and maintenance for PDS are provided by NSTISSI 7003 to U.S. government departments and agencies and their contractors and vendors. This instruction describes the requirements for all PDS installations within the U.S. and for low and medium threat locations outside the U.S.
PDS is commonly used to protect [[SIPRNet]] and [[JWICS]] networks.
The document superseded one numbered NASCI 4009 on Protected Distribution Systems, dated December 30, 1981, and part of a document called NACSEM 5203, that covered guidelines for facility design, using the designations &quot;red&quot; and &quot;black&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;spec&quot; /&gt;

There are two types of PDS: hardened distribution systems and simple distribution systems.

==Hardened distribution ==
Hardened distribution PDSs provide significant physical protection and can be implemented in three forms:  hardened carrier PDSs, alarmed carrier PDSs and continuously viewed carrier PDSs.

===Hardened carrier===
In a hardened carrier PDS, the data cables are installed in a carrier constructed of electrical metallic tubing ([[Electrical conduit|EMT]]), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid sheet steel ducting. All of the connections in a Hardened Carrier System are permanently sealed completely around all surfaces with welds, epoxy or other such sealants. If the hardened carrier is buried under ground, to secure cables running between buildings for example, the carrier containing the cables is encased in concrete.

With a hardened [[carrier system]], detection is accomplished via human inspections that are required to be performed periodically. Therefore, hardened carriers are installed below ceilings or above flooring so they can be visually inspected to ensure that no intrusions have occurred. These periodic [[visual inspection]]s (PVIs) occur at a frequency dependent upon the level of threat to the environment, the security classification of the data, and the access control to the area.

=== Alarmed carrier ===
As an alternative to conducting human visual inspections, an alarmed carrier PDS may be constructed to automate the inspection process through electronic monitoring with an alarm system. In an Alarmed Carrier PDS, the carrier system is “alarmed” with specialized optical fibers deployed within the conduit for the purpose of sensing acoustic vibrations that usually occur when an intrusion is being attempted on the conduit in order to gain access to the cables.

Alarmed carrier PDS offers several advantages over hardened carrier PDS:

#Provides continuous monitoring 24/7/365
#Eliminates the requirement for periodic visual inspections
#Allows the carrier to be hidden above the ceiling or below the floor, since periodic visual inspections are not required
#Eliminates the need for the welding and epoxying of the connections
#Eliminates the requirement for concrete encasement outdoors 
#Eliminates the need to lock down [[manhole cover]]s
#Enables rapid redeployment for evolving network arrangements

Legacy alarmed carrier systems monitor the carrier containing the cables being protected. More advanced systems monitor the fibers within, or intrinsic to, the cables being protected to turn those cables into sensors, which detect intrusion attempts.

Depending on the [[government]] organization, utilizing an alarmed carrier PDS in conjunction with interlocking armored cable may, in some cases, allow for the elimination of the carrier systems altogether. In these instances, the cables being protected can be installed in existing conveyance (wire basket, ladder rack) or suspended cabling (on D-rings, J-Hooks, etc.).

=== Continuously viewed carrier ===
A Continuously Viewed Carrier PDS is one that is under continuous observation, 24 hours per day (including when operational). Such circuits may be grouped together, but should be separated from all non-continuously viewed circuits ensuring an open field of view. Standing orders should include the requirement to investigate any attempt to disturb the PDS. Appropriate security personnel should investigate the area of attempted penetration within 15 minutes of discovery. This type of hardened carrier is not used for Top Secret or special category information for non-U.S. UAA.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}&lt;!-- What is UAA? --&gt;
UAA is an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA).  Like definitions include Controlled Access Area (CAA) and Restricted Access Area (RAA). A Secure Room (SR) offers the highest degree of protection.

Therefore, from the least protected (least secure) to the most protected is as follows:

UAA
RAA
CAA
SR

== Simple distribution ==

Simple distribution PDSs are afforded a reduced level of physical security protection as compared to a hardened distribution PDS. They use a simple carrier system and the following means are acceptable under NSTISSI 7003: 
#The data cables should be installed in a carrier
#The carrier can be constructed of any material (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit)
#The joints and access points should be secured and be controlled by personnel cleared to the highest level of data handled by the PDS
#The carrier is to be inspected in accordance with the requirements of NSTISSI 7003

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''protocol-control information''' or PCI has the following meanings: 

#  The queries and replies among [[communication]]s equipment to determine the respective capabilities of each end of the communications [[data link|link]]. 
#  For layered systems, [[information]] exchanged between entities of a given layer, via the service provided by the next lower layer, to coordinate their joint [[Business operations|operation]].

[[Image:Pdu and sdu.svg|thumb|350px|[[Medium access control]] (MAC) layer protocol data unit (PDU) becomes [[physical layer]] [[service data unit]] (SDU).]]

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''protocol data unit''' ('''PDU''') is a single unit of information transmitted among peer entities of a [[computer network]]. A PDU is composed of protocol-specific control information and [[Payload (computing)|user data]]. In the layered architectures of [[communication protocol]] stacks, each layer implements protocols tailored to the specific type or mode of data exchange.

For example, the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) implements a connection-oriented transfer mode, and the PDU of this protocol is called a ''segment'', while the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) uses [[datagram]]s as protocol data units for [[connectionless communication]]. A layer lower in the [[Internet protocol suite]], at the [[Internet layer]], the PDU is called a [[network packet|packet]], irrespective of its payload type.

==Packet-switched data networks==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
In the context of [[packet switching]] data networks, a protocol data unit (PDU) is best understood in relation to a [[service data unit]] (SDU).

The features or services of the network are implemented in distinct &quot;layers&quot;.  For example, sending ones and zeros across a wire, fiber, etc. is done by the physical layer, organizing the ones and zeros into chunks of data and getting them safely to the right place on the wire is done by the data link layer, passing data chunks over multiple connected networks is done by the network layer and delivery of the data to the right software application at the destination is done by the transport layer.

Between the layers (and between the application and the top-most layer), the layers pass service data units across the interfaces.  The higher layer understands the structure of the data in the SDU, but the lower layer at the interface does not; the lower layer treats the SDU as [[Payload (computing)|payload]], undertaking to get it to the same interface at the destination.  In order to do this, the ''protocol'' (lower) layer will add to the SDU certain data it needs to perform its function; which is called [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulation]].  For example, it might add a port number to identify the application, a network address to help with routing, a code to identify the type of data in the packet and error-checking information.  All this additional information, plus the original service data unit from the higher layer, constitutes the ''protocol data unit'' at this layer.

The SDU and metadata added by the lower layer can be larger than the maximum size of that layer's PDU (known as the [[maximum transmission unit]]; MTU). When this is the case, the PDU must be split into multiple payloads of a size suitable for transmission or processing by the lower layer; a process known as [[IP fragmentation]].

The significance of this is that the PDU is the structured information that is passed to a matching protocol layer further along on the data's journey that allows the layer to deliver its intended function or service.  The matching layer, or &quot;peer&quot;, decodes the data to extract the original service data unit, decide if it is error-free and where to send it next, etc.  Unless we have already arrived at the lowest (physical) layer, the PDU is passed to the peer using services of the next lower layer in the protocol &quot;stack&quot;.  When the PDU passes over the interface from the layer that constructed it to the layer that merely delivers it (and therefore does not understand its internal structure), it becomes a service data unit to that layer.  The addition of addressing and control information (encapsulation) to an SDU to form a PDU and the passing of that PDU to the next lower layer as an SDU repeats until the lowest layer is reached and the data passes over some medium as a physical signal.

The above process can be likened to the mail system in which a letter (SDU) is placed in an envelope on which is written an address (addressing and control information) making it a PDU.  The sending post office might look only at the postcode and place the letter in a mailbag so that the address on the envelope can no longer be seen, making it now an SDU.  The mailbag is labeled with the destination postcode and so becomes a PDU until it is combined with other bags in a crate when it is now an SDU, and the crate is labeled with the region to which all the bags are to be sent, making the crate a PDU.  When the crate reaches the destination matching its label, it is opened and the bags (SDUs) removed only to become PDUs when someone reads the code of the destination post office.  The letters themselves are SDUs when the bags are opened but become PDUs when the address is read for final delivery.  When the addressee finally opens the envelope, the top-level SDU, the letter itself, emerges.

==Examples==
===OSI model===
Protocol data units of the [[OSI model]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DataEncapsulationProtocolDataUnitsPDUsandServiceDa.htm |title=Data Encapsulation, Protocol Data Units (PDUs) and Service Data Units (SDUs) |work=The TCP/IP Guide |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Layer 4: [[transport layer]] PDU is the [[Packet segment|segment]] or the datagram.
*The Layer 3: [[network layer]] PDU is the [[Network packet|packet]].
*The Layer 2: [[data link layer]] PDU is the [[Frame (networking)|frame]].
*The Layer 1: [[physical layer]] PDU is the [[bit]] or, more generally, [[Symbol (data)|symbol]].

Given a context pertaining to a specific OSI layer, ''PDU'' is sometimes used as a synonym for its representation at that layer.

When the PDU of one layer (''n''), sent as SDU to the layer one lower than it (''n-1''), plus any metadata ([[Header (computing)|headers]]/[[Trailer (computing)|trailers]]) layer ''n-1'' adds to the SDU would exceed the largest size layer ''n-1''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s PDU can be, IP fragmentation is invoked to break it up into multiple payloads that fit in the layer-''n-1'' PDU's.

===Internet protocol suite===
Protocol data units for the [[Internet protocol suite]] are:

*The [[transport layer]] PDU is the [[TCP segment]] for TCP, and the datagram for UDP.
*The [[Internet layer]] PDU is the [[Network packet|packet]].
*The [[link layer]] PDU is the [[Frame (networking)|frame]].

On TCP/IP over Ethernet, the data on the physical layer is carried in [[Ethernet frame]]s.

===ATM===
The data link layer PDU in [[Asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM) networks is called a ''cell''.

{{anchor|MPDU}}

===Media access control protocol data unit===
A '''media access control protocol data unit''' ('''MPDU''') is a message that is exchanged between [[media access control]] (MAC) entities in a communication system based on the layered [[OSI model]].

In systems where the MPDU may be larger than the [[MAC service data unit]] (MSDU), the MPDU may ''include'' multiple MSDUs as a result of [[packet aggregation]]. In systems where the MPDU is smaller than the MSDU, then one MSDU may ''generate'' multiple MPDUs as a result of [[packet segmentation]].

In [[telecommunication]], '''provisioning''' involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide new services to its users.  In [[NS/EP telecommunications|National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications]] services, ''&quot;provisioning&quot;'' equates to  ''&quot;initiation&quot;'' and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

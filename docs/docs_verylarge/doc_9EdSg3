'''Oldenburg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔldn̩bʊʁk|-|Oldenburg.ogg}}) is an [[independent city]] in the [[Oldenburg (district)|district of Oldenburg]] in the state of [[Lower Saxony]], Germany.  The city is officially named '''Oldenburg (Oldb)''' (''Oldenburg in Oldenburg'') to distinguish from [[Oldenburg in Holstein]].

During the French annexation (1811–1813) in the wake of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic war]] against Britain, it was also known as ''Le Vieux-Bourg'' in French. The city is at the rivers [[Hunte]] and [[Haaren (river)|Haaren]], in the northwestern region between the cities of [[Bremen]] in the east and [[Groningen]] (Netherlands) in the west. It has a population of 170,000 (November 2019).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oldenburg.de/startseite/politik/verwaltung-finanzen/statistik/einwohnerzahl-steigt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Oldenburg is part of the [[Bremen/Oldenburg Metropolitan Region]], with 2.37&amp;nbsp;million people.

The city is the place of origin of the [[House of Oldenburg]]. Before the end of the [[German Empire]] (1918), it was the administrative centre and residence of the [[List of rulers of Oldenburg|monarchs of Oldenburg]].

==History==

Archaeological finds point to a settlement dating back to the 8th century. The first documentary evidence, in 1108, referenced ''Aldenburg'' in connection with [[Elimar I, Count of Oldenburg|Elimar I]] (also known as Egilmar I) who is now commonly seen as the first count of Oldenburg. The town gained importance due to its location at a [[ford (river)|ford]] of the navigable Hunte river. Oldenburg became the capital of the [[County of Oldenburg]] (later a [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Duchy]] (1774- 1810), [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Grand Duchy]] (1815–1918), and [[Free State of Oldenburg|Free State]] (1918–1946)), a small state in the shadow of the much more powerful [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline= 1 |wstitle=Oldenburg (town) |display=Oldenburg |volume=20 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century Oldenburg was a wealthy town in a time of [[Thirty Years' War|war and turmoil]] and its population and power grew considerably. In 1667, the town was struck by a disastrous [[Black Death|plague]] epidemic and, shortly after, a fire destroyed Oldenburg. The Danish kings, who were also counts of Oldenburg at the time, had little interest in the condition of the town and it lost most of its former importance. In 1773, Danish rule ended. Only then were the destroyed buildings in the city rebuilt in a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] style.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ([[German language|German]]-speakers usually call the &quot;neoclassicist style&quot; of that period ''{{lang|de|klassizistisch}}'', while ''{{lang|de|neoklassizistisch}}'' specifically refers to the classicist style of the early 20th century.)

After the German government announced the abdication of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] (9 November 1918) following the exhaustion and defeat of the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]], monarchic rule ended in Oldenburg as well with the abdication of Grand Duke [[Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg|Frederick Augustus II of Oldenburg]] ''({{lang|de|Friedrich August II von Oldenburg}})'' on 11 November 1918. The Grand Duchy now became the Free State of Oldenburg ''({{lang-de| Freistaat Oldenburg}})'', with the city remaining the capital.

In the 1928 city elections, the [[Nazi Party]] received 9.8% of the vote, enough for a seat on the Oldenburg city council. In the September 1930 Oldenburg state elections, the Nazi Party's share of the vote rose to 27.3%, and on May 29, 1932, the Nazi Party received 48.4% in the state election, enough to put the Nazi party in charge of forming a state government and, significantly, making Oldenburg the first state in the country to put the Nazis in power based on electoral turnout. By that autumn, a campaign of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] began, forcing the sale of formerly Jewish-owned properties at steep discounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goldsmith | first1 = Martin | title = Alex's Wake: A Voyage of Betrayal and a Journey of Remembrance | isbn = 978-0306823220 | year = 2014 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/alexswakevoyageo0000gold/page/44 44–46] | publisher = Da Capo Press | url = https://archive.org/details/alexswakevoyageo0000gold/page/44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, after [[World War II]], the State of Oldenburg became part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British zone of occupation]]. The [[Control Commission for Germany - British Element|British military government]] of the Oldenburg region resided in the city. Several [[displaced persons camp|displaced-persons camp]]s were set up in the city that had suffered only 1.4% destruction during the [[Strategic Bombing During World War II|bombing campaigns of World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Schneider: ''Niedersachsen 1945'', p. 95. Hannover 1985&lt;/ref&gt; About 42,000 refugees migrated into Oldenburg, which raised the number of residents to over 100,000. In 1946 the Free State of Oldenburg was dissolved and the area became the 'Administrative District' of Oldenburg ''({{lang|de|Verwaltungsbezirk Oldenburg}})'' within the newly-formed [[States of Germany|federal German state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] ''({{lang|de|Niedersachsen}})''. The city was now capital of the district. In 1978 the district was dissolved and succeeded by the newly formed [[Weser-Ems]] administrative region ''({{lang|de| [[Regierungsbezirk]] Weser-Ems}})'', again with the city as administrative capital. The state of Lower Saxony dissolved all of the {{lang|de| Regierungsbezirke}} by the end of 2004 in the course of administrative reforms.

[[File:Young Nathan Marcus Adler.JPG|thumb|upright|Nathan Marcus Adler, chief Rabbi of the Oldenburg Jewish community in the 19th century]]
The [[History of the Jews in Oldenburg|history of the Jewish community of Oldenburg]] dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11684-oldenburg|title=OLDENBURG - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622031521/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11684-oldenburg|archivedate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards and during the 19th century, the Jews in Oldenburg were always around 1% of the total population, and by that time had acquired their own synagogue, cemetery and school. Most of them were merchants and businessmen. On 1938 [[Kristallnacht]], the town men were led to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], among them [[Leo Trepp]], the community [[Rabbi]] who survived and later became an honorary citizen of Oldenburg and honored by a street named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldenburg.de/?id=2628|title=1990: Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

After [[World War II]], a group of survivors returned to the city and maintained a small community until it was dissolved during the 1970s. Nevertheless, due to Jewish emigration from the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to Germany in the 1990s, a community of about 340 people is now maintaining its own synagogue, cemetery and other facilities. The old Jewish cemetery, which is no longer active after the opening of a new one, was desecrated twice in 2011 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sem40.ru/index.php?newsid=239989 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125323/http://www.sem40.ru/index.php?newsid=239989 |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''There are two [[Public university|public universities]] in Oldenburg:'''

* The [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] was founded in 1973 based on a previous college for teacher training, the ''Pädagogische Hochschule Oldenburg'', which had a history in Oldenburg dating back to 1793. The university was officially named after [[Carl von Ossietzky]] in 1991. As of 2014, it has almost 13,746 students, a scientific staff of 1,130, as well as 964 technical and administrative staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-oldenburg.de/planung-entwicklung/akademisches-controlling/hochschulstatistik/zahlen-und-fakten/|title=Statistics published on the CvO University’s web site, retrieved in 2014|website=uni-oldenburg.de|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702142318/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/planung-entwicklung/akademisches-controlling/hochschulstatistik/zahlen-und-fakten/|archivedate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new faculty of medicine and health sciences was established in 2012 as part of the newly founded ''European Medical School Oldenburg-Groningen'', a cooperation with the [[University of Groningen]] (Netherlands) and local hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/en/medicine/|title=VI.

* The [[Jade University of Applied Sciences]] (Jade-Hochschule) The former ''Fachhochschule Oldenburg'' (until 1999) was founded in 1971, a merger of the previous engineering academy with the nautical college in [[Elsfleth]]. Oldenburg already had a history of construction engineering training dating back to 1882. Starting in 2000, the Fachhochschule had been part of multiple re-organisations involving several [[Fachhochschule|UAS (Fachhochschule)]] in the northwestern region. A relaunch under the name ''Jade-Hochschule'' took place in 2009 (previously: ''Fachhochschule Oldenburg/Ostfriesland/Wilhelmshaven''). The Jade-Hochschule now comprises branches in three towns: Oldenburg, Elsfleth, and [[Wilhelmshaven]]. Based in Oldenburg are the departments of [[architecture]], [[construction engineering]] and [[construction management]], [[geodesy]], as well as the institute of [[hearing aid|hearing aid technology]] and [[audiology]]. There are about 2,000 students in the Oldenburg branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jade-hs.de/hochschule/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804163316/http://www.jade-hs.de/hochschule|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2010|title=Statistics published on the Jade-Hochschule website, retrieved in January 2012|author=|date=|website=jade-hs.de|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Elsfleth branch offers bachelor's degree courses in nautical science, international logistics, and harbour management.

* Armed Forces Pension Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oyak.com.tr/EN/corporate.html|title=Armed Forces Pension Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[OYAK]] (Ordu Yardımlaşma Kurumu/Armed Forces Pension Fund) provides its members with &quot;supplementary retirement benefits&quot; apart from the official retirement fund, T.C.Emekli Sandığı/SSK, to which they are primarily affiliated.

In addition to the retirement benefit, OYAK pays &quot;disability benefits&quot; to the members on duty when they become partially or fully disabled as well as &quot;death benefits&quot; to the heirs of the deceased member if the death occurs during the member's subscription to the foundation.

OYAK is incorporated as a private entity under its own law subject to Turkish civic and commercial codes. OYAK, while fulfilling its legal duties, as set in the law, also provides its members with social services such as loans, home loans and retirement income systems.

The initial source of OYAK's funds is a compulsory 10 percent levy on the base salary of Turkey's 200,000 serving officers who, together with 25,000 current pensioners, make up OYAK's members.

[[Image:ArsinoeII.jpg|thumb|Arsinoe II]]

[[Image:Oktadrachmon Ptolemaios II Arsinoe II.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A gold coin shows paired, profiled busts of a plump man and woman. The man is in front and wears a diadem and drapery. It is inscribed &quot;ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ&quot;.|Head of Ptolemy II Philadelphus with Arsinoe II behind. The Greek inscription ''ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ'' means &quot;[coin] of the siblings&quot;.]]

'''Arsinoë II''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Ἀρσινόη}}, 316 BC – unknown date between July 270 and 260 BC) was a [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic queen]] and co-regent of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of [[ancient Egypt]].

Arsinoe was queen of [[Thrace]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] by marriage to King [[Lysimachus]] and co-ruler of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] with her brother-husband, [[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. Arsinoe was given the unprecedented Egyptian title &quot;King of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]&quot;, marking her a full pharaoh.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=115}}

==Life==
[[File:Πήλινη κεφαλή της βασίλισσας Αρσινόης, αδερφής και συζύγου του βασιλιά Πτολεμαίου Β (4334588370).jpg|thumb|Pottery head of Arsinoe II]]
===Early life===
Arsinoë was the first daughter of Pharaoh [[Ptolemy I Soter]], founder of the Hellenistic state of Egypt, and his second wife [[Berenice I of Egypt]].{{sfn|Lorenzi|2010}}

She was maybe born in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], but was raised in the new city of [[Alexandria]], where her father moved his capital.{{sfn|Carney|p=16}} Nothing is known of her childhood or education, but judging from her later life as patron of scholars and noted for her learning, she is estimated to have been given a high education.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=17}}Her brothers were tutored by intellectuals hired by their fathers, and it is regarded likely that she attended these lessons as well: she corresponded with the intellectual [[Strato of Lampsacus]] later in life, and he may have previously been her tutor.{{sfn|Carney|2013}}

===Queen of Lysimachus===
At about age 15, Arsinoë married King Lysimachus (who was then around 60 years old),{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=31}}with whom she had three sons: [[Ptolemy Epigonos]],{{sfn|Billows|1995|p=110}}{{sfn|Bengtson|1977|p=569}} [[Lysimachus (son of Lysimachus)|Lysimachus]],{{sfn|Bengtson|1977|p=569}} and [[Philip (son of Lysimachus)|Philip]].{{sfn|Bengtson|1977|p=569}}

In order to position her sons for the throne, she had Lysimachus' first son, [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]], poisoned on account of treason.

Arsinoe reportedly paid for a rotunda in the [[Samothrace temple complex]], where she was likely an initiate. {{sfn|Carney|2013|p=38}}

===Queen of Ptolemy Keraunos===
After Lysimachus' death in battle in 281 BC, she fled to [[Cassandreia]] ({{lang|grc|Κασσάνδρεια}}) and married her paternal half-brother [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], one of the sons of Ptolemy I Soter from his previous wife, [[Eurydice of Egypt]]. The marriage was for political reasons as they both claimed the throne of Macedonia and Thrace (by the time of his death Lysimachus was ruler of both regions, and his power extended to southern Greece and [[Anatolia]]). Their relationship was never good.

As Ptolemy Keraunos was becoming more powerful, she decided it was time to stop him and conspired against him with her sons. This action caused Ptolemy Keraunus to kill two of her sons, Lysimachus and Philip, while the eldest, Ptolemy, was able to escape and to flee north, to the kingdom of the Dardanians.

She herself sought refuge in the Samothrace temple complex, which she had benefited during her tenure as queen.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=60-63}} She eventually left from Samothrace for Alexandria, Egypt, to seek protection from her brother, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]].{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=66}}

It is not known which year she left for Egypt. She may have left so early as 280, directly after the murder of the younger sons, or as late as 276, when the claim of her eldest son to the Macedonian throne had clearly failed after the succession of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]].{{sfn|Carney|2013}}

[[File:Cammeo gonzaga con doppio ritratto di tolomeo II e arsinoe II, III sec. ac. (alessandria), da hermitage.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Gonzaga Cameo]] in the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]. The gem measures 15,7 x 11,8 cm.]]

===Queen of Egypt===

In Egypt, she is believed to have instigated the accusation and exile of her brother Ptolemy II's first wife, [[Arsinoe I]]. Whether this was actually true is unknown: it is not known which year she arrived in Egypt, and her sister-in-law may already have been exiled at that point, or her divorce may have taken place without her involvement.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=67-70}}

Whatever the case, after the divorce of Ptolemy, Arsinoe II then married her younger brother. As a result, both were given the epithet &quot;Philadelphoi&quot; ({{lang-grc-koi|Φιλάδελφοι}} &quot;Sibling-lovers&quot;). The closer circumstances and reasons behind the marriage is not known.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=70-82}}

Her role as queen was unprecedented in the dynasty at the time and became a role model for later Ptolemaic queens: she acted alongside her brother in ritual and public display, became a religious and literal patron and was included in the Egyptian and Greek cults created by him for them.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=95-100}} Sharing in all of her brother's titles,{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=85}} she apparently was quite influential, having towns dedicated to her, her own cult (as was Egyptian custom), appearing on coinage and contributing to foreign policy,{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=90-95}} including Ptolemy II's victory in the [[Syrian Wars#First Syrian War .28274-271 BC.29|First Syrian War]] between Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire]].

According to [[Posidippus (epigrammatic poet)|Posidippus]], she won three [[chariot race]]s at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], probably in 272 BC.{{sfn|Posidippus|p=VIII 309}}{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=142}}

==Deification==
[[File:Arsinoe II.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of Arsinoe II struck under the rule of her husband-brother [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], including her main divine attributes: the ram's horn and the double cornucopia.]]
[[File:Gilt faience fragment of an oinochoe (jug) MET DP121919.jpg|thumb|Faience oinochoe with remains of gilding, depicting Arsinoe II]]
After her death, Ptolemy II established a cult of Arsinoe Philadelphus. She received burial and deification rites at [[Mendes]], where she had been a priestess, which are commemorated in the [[Mendes stele]]. This stele also includes the decree of Ptolemy II announcing her cult. All temples in Egypt were required to include a cult statue of Arsinoe II alongside the main god of the sanctuary. In the relief at the top of the stele, Arsinoe is depicted among the deities receiving sacrifice from Ptolemy - an image which recurs throughout the country. Separate temples were also constructed for Arsinoe, at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and elsewhere. The [[Fayyum]] region became the [[Arsinoite nome]], with Arsinoe as its patron goddess. From 263 BC, a portion of tax on orchard and vineyard produce in each nome of Egypt was dedicated to funding the nome's cult of Arsinoe.&lt;ref name=H1014&gt;{{harvnb|Holbl|2001|pp=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsinoe's cult was also propagated in Alexandria. An annual priesthood, known as the [[Kanephoros|Canephorus]] of Arsinoe Philadelphus, was established by 269 BC. The holder of the office was included as part of the dating formula in all official documents until the late second century BC. An annual procession was held in Arsinoe's honour, led by the Canephorus. Every household along the procession's route was required to erect a small altar of sand and sacrifice birds and lentils for Arsinoe.&lt;ref&gt;[[P. Oxy]] 27.2465.&lt;/ref&gt; A large temple was erected by the harbour in Alexandria. The admiral Callicrates of Samos erected another sanctuary at Cape Zephyrium, at the eastern end of the harbour, where Arsinoe was worshipped as Aphrodite Euploia (Aphrodite of the good-sailing). Similar sanctuaries were established at a number of port-cities under Ptolemaic control, including [[Citium]] in Cyprus, [[Delos]] in the [[Nesiotic League]], and [[Thera]]. As a result of these sanctuaries, Arsinoe became closely associated with protection from shipwrecks. Coinage and statuettes depicting the divine Arsinoe survive.&lt;ref name=H1014/&gt; Her divine attributes are a small ram's horn behind her ear - symbolising her connection to the ram of Mendes - and a pair of [[cornucopia]]e which she carries. She appears in this guise on a set of mass-produced [[faience]] [[Oenochoe|Oenochoae]], which seem to have been associated with funerary ritual in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=D.B. |title=Ptolemaic Oinochoai and Portraits in Faience: Aspects of the Ruler-Cult |date=1973 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsinoe seems to have been a genuinely popular goddess throughout the Ptolemaic period, with both Greeks and Egyptians, in Egypt and beyond. 'Arsinoe' is one of the few Greek names to be naturalised as an Egyptian personal name in the period. Altars and dedicatory plaques in her honour are found throughout Egypt and the Aegean, while hundreds of her faience oenochoae have been found in the cemeteries of Alexandria.

==Marriage and issue==
Arsinoe married Lysimachus of Thrace in 300 or 299 BC and had three children:

After Lysimachus' death in 281 BC, Arsinoe was briefly married to her half-brother Ptolemy Ceraunus from 280 to 279 BC and then to her full-blooded, younger brother Ptolemy II of Egypt from the late 270s BC until her death. Ptolemy II's children by his first wife [[Arsinoe I]], including his eventual successor [[Ptolemy III]] were posthumously declared to be children of Arsinoe II in the late 260s BC.

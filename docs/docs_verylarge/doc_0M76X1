Some non-coding DNA sequences must have some important biological function. This is indicated by [[comparative genomics]] studies that report highly [[Conserved non-coding sequence|conserved regions of non-coding DNA]], sometimes on time-scales of hundreds of millions of years. This implies that these non-coding regions are under strong [[evolution]]ary pressure and [[Natural selection|positive selection]].&lt;ref name=Ludwig&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig MZ | title = Functional evolution of noncoding DNA | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 634–9 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12433575 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00355-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the genomes of [[human]]s and [[mice]], which diverged from a [[common ancestor]] 65–75 million years ago, protein-coding DNA sequences account for only about 20% of conserved DNA, with the remaining 80% of conserved DNA represented in non-coding regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobb et al&quot;/&gt; [[Linkage mapping]] often identifies chromosomal regions associated with a disease with no evidence of functional coding variants of genes within the region, suggesting that disease-causing genetic variants lie in the non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobb et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cobb J, Büsst C, Petrou S, Harrap S, Ellis J | title = Searching for functional genetic variants in non-coding DNA | journal = Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–5 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18307723 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04880.x | s2cid = 2000913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of non-coding DNA mutations in cancer was explored in April 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khurana et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khurana E, Fu Y, Colonna V, Mu XJ, Kang HM, Lappalainen T, Sboner A, Lochovsky L, Chen J, Harmanci A, Das J, Abyzov A, Balasubramanian S, Beal K, Chakravarty D, Challis D, Chen Y, Clarke D, Clarke L, Cunningham F, Evani US, Flicek P, Fragoza R, Garrison E, Gibbs R, Gümüş ZH, Herrero J, Kitabayashi N, Kong Y, Lage K, Liluashvili V, Lipkin SM, MacArthur DG, Marth G, Muzny D, Pers TH, Ritchie GR, Rosenfeld JA, Sisu C, Wei X, Wilson M, Xue Y, Yu F, Dermitzakis ET, Yu H, Rubin MA, Tyler-Smith C, Gerstein M | display-authors = 6 | title = Integrative annotation of variants from 1092 humans: application to cancer genomics | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6154 | pages = 1235587 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24092746 | pmc = 3947637 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235587 | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0019-02F5-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-coding genetic polymorphisms play a role in infectious disease susceptibility, such as hepatitis C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu YF, Mauger DM, Goldstein DB, Urban TJ, Weeks KM, Bradrick SS | title = IFNL3 mRNA structure is remodeled by a functional non-coding polymorphism associated with hepatitis C virus clearance | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 16037 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26531896 | pmc = 4631997 | doi = 10.1038/srep16037 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516037L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, non-coding genetic polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to [[Ewing sarcoma]], an aggressive pediatric bone cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grünewald TG, Bernard V, Gilardi-Hebenstreit P, Raynal V, Surdez D, Aynaud MM, Mirabeau O, Cidre-Aranaz F, Tirode F, Zaidi S, Perot G, Jonker AH, Lucchesi C, Le Deley MC, Oberlin O, Marec-Bérard P, Véron AS, Reynaud S, Lapouble E, Boeva V, Rio Frio T, Alonso J, Bhatia S, Pierron G, Cancel-Tassin G, Cussenot O, Cox DG, Morton LM, Machiela MJ, Chanock SJ, Charnay P, Delattre O | title = Chimeric EWSR1-FLI1 regulates the Ewing sarcoma susceptibility gene EGR2 via a GGAA microsatellite | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 1073–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26214589 | pmc = 4591073 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specific sequences of non-coding DNA may be features essential to chromosome structure, [[centromere]] function and recognition of [[homologous chromosome]]s during [[meiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Subirana JA, Messeguer X | title = The most frequent short sequences in non-coding DNA | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 1172–81 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19966278 | pmc = 2831315 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a comparative study of over 300 [[prokaryotic]] and over 30 [[eukaryotic]] genomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahnert SE, Fink TM, Zinovyev A | title = How much non-coding DNA do eukaryotes require? | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 252 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–92 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18384817 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.005 | authorlink2 = Thomas Fink | arxiv = q-bio/0611047 | s2cid = 1717725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eukaryotes appear to require a minimum amount of non-coding DNA. The amount can be predicted using a growth model for regulatory genetic networks, implying that it is required for regulatory purposes. In humans the predicted minimum is about 5% of the total genome.

Over 10% of 32 mammalian genomes may function through the formation of specific [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|RNA secondary structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MA, Gesell T, Stadler PF, Mattick JS | title = Widespread purifying selection on RNA structure in mammals | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 17 | pages = 8220–36 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23847102 | pmc = 3783177 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used [[comparative genomics]] to identify compensatory DNA mutations that maintain RNA base-pairings, a distinctive feature of [[RNA]] molecules. Over 80% of the genomic regions presenting evolutionary evidence of RNA structure conservation do not present strong DNA sequence conservation.

Non-coding DNA may perhaps serve to decrease the probability of gene disruption during [[chromosomal crossover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dileep | first1=V. | year=2009 | title=The place and function of non-coding DNA in the evolution of variability | journal=Hypothesis | volume=7 | issue=1| page=e7 | doi=10.5779/hypothesis.v7i1.146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulating gene expression ==
{{Main|Regulation of gene expression}}

Some non-coding DNA sequences determine the expression levels of various genes, both those that are transcribed to proteins and those that themselves are involved in gene regulation.&lt;ref name=Callaway&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Callaway, Ewen | title=Junk DNA gets credit for making us who we are | journal=New Scientist |date=March 2010 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18680-junk-dna-gets-credit-for-making-us-who-we-are.html?full=true&amp;print=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll SB, Prud'homme B, Gompel N | title = Regulating evolution | journal = Scientific American | volume = 298 | issue = 5 | pages = 60–7 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18444326 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0508-60 | bibcode = 2008SciAm.298e..60C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26832224&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stojic L, Niemczyk M, Orjalo A, Ito Y, Ruijter AE, Uribe-Lewis S, Joseph N, Weston S, Menon S, Odom DT, Rinn J, Gergely F, Murrell A | title = Transcriptional silencing of long noncoding RNA GNG12-AS1 uncouples its transcriptional and product-related functions | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 10406 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26832224 | pmc = 4740813 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms10406 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...710406S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcription factors ===
{{Main|Transcription factor}}

Some non-coding DNA sequences determine where transcription factors attach.&lt;ref name=Callaway/&gt;  A transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific non-coding DNA sequences, thereby controlling the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9570129&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Latchman DS | title = Transcription factors: an overview | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1305–12 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9570129 | pmc = 2002184 | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(97)00085-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2128034&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karin M | title = Too many transcription factors: positive and negative interactions | journal = The New Biologist | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–31 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2128034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operators ===
{{Main|Operon#Operator}}

An operator is a segment of DNA to which a [[repressor]] binds. A repressor is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of [[RNA polymerase]] to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes. This blocking of expression is called repression.&lt;ref name=blewin&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewin, Benjamin |title=Genes IV |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1990 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/genesiv00lewi/page/243 243–58] |isbn=978-0-19-854267-4 |edition=4th |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/genesiv00lewi/page/243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhancers ===
{{Main|Enhancer (genetics)}}

An enhancer is a short region of DNA that can be bound with proteins ([[trans-acting factors]]), much like a set of transcription factors, to enhance transcription levels of genes in a gene cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwood EM, Kadonaga JT | title = Going the distance: a current view of enhancer action | journal = Science | volume = 281 | issue = 5373 | pages = 60–3 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9679020 | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5373.60 | bibcode = 1998Sci...281...60. | s2cid = 11666739 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/441b7a031396c3e3b30a26e4b452fe09e00cac4c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silencers===
{{Main|Silencer (genetics)}}

A silencer is a region of DNA that inactivates gene expression when bound by a regulatory protein. It functions in a very similar way as enhancers, only differing in the inactivation of genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maston&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maston GA, Evans SK, Green MR | title = Transcriptional regulatory elements in the human genome | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 29–59 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16719718 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115623 | s2cid = 12346247 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/238dfc85cd5646d13d488908786c56e01cc2e537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoters===
{{Main|Promoter (genetics)}}

A promoter is a region of DNA that facilitates transcription of a particular gene when a transcription factor binds to it. Promoters are typically located near the genes they regulate and upstream of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Biological Networks: Transcriptional Networks – Promoter Sequence Analysis|url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/courses/bnet-a06/lec11.pdf|publisher=Tel Aviv University|access-date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulators===
{{Main|Insulator (genetics) }}

A genetic insulator is a boundary element that plays two distinct roles in gene expression, either as an enhancer-blocking code, or rarely as a barrier against condensed chromatin.  An insulator in a DNA sequence is comparable to a linguistic [[word divider]] such as a comma in a sentence, because the insulator indicates where an enhanced or repressed sequence ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12154228&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgess-Beusse B, Farrell C, Gaszner M, Litt M, Mutskov V, Recillas-Targa F, Simpson M, West A, Felsenfeld G | title = The insulation of genes from external enhancers and silencing chromatin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue =  | pages = 16433–7 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12154228 | pmc = 139905 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162342499 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916433B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Evolution===

Shared sequences of apparently non-functional DNA are a major line of [[evidence of common descent]].&lt;ref name=TO-FAQ&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ &quot;Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics&quot;], [[talkorigins]], by Edward E. Max, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudogene sequences appear to accumulate mutations more rapidly than coding sequences due to a loss of selective pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrov &amp; Hartl&quot;/&gt; This allows for the creation of mutant alleles that incorporate new functions that may be favored by natural selection; thus, pseudogenes can serve as raw material for [[evolution]] and can be considered &quot;protogenes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balakirev ES, Ayala FJ | title = Pseudogenes: are they &quot;junk&quot; or functional DNA? | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 37 | issue =  | pages = 123–51 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14616058 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.040103.103949 | s2cid = 24683075 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10360b4b92468635132c0803eb5876bfda2d8298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2019 shows that new genes (termed [[De novo gene birth|''de novo'' gene birth]]) can be fashioned from non-coding regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20191016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levy |first=Adam |title=How evolution builds genes from scratch - Scientists long assumed that new genes appear when evolution tinkers with old ones. It turns out that natural selection is much more creative. |date=16 October 2019 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=574 |issue=7778 |pages=314–316 |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-03061-x |pmid=31619796 |s2cid=204707405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest at least one-tenth of genes could be made in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20191016&quot;/&gt;

===Long range correlations===

A statistical distinction between coding and non-coding DNA sequences has been found. It has been observed that nucleotides in non-coding DNA sequences display  long range power law correlations while coding sequences do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peng CK, Buldyrev SV, Goldberger AL, Havlin S, Sciortino F, Simons M, Stanley HE | title = Long-range correlations in nucleotide sequences | journal = Nature | volume = 356 | issue = 6365 | pages = 168–70 | date = March 1992 | pmid = 1301010 | doi = 10.1038/356168a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.356..168P | s2cid = 4334674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Li W, Kaneko K |title=Long-Range Correlation and Partial 1/f&lt;sup&gt;alpha&lt;/sup&gt; Spectrum in a Non-Coding DNA Sequence|journal=Europhys.

===Forensic anthropology===

Police sometimes gather DNA as evidence for purposes of [[forensic identification]].  As described in ''[[Maryland v. King]]'', a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision:&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf Slip opinion] for ''[[Maryland v. King]]'' from the U.S. Supreme Court. {{retrieved|access-date=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The current standard for forensic DNA testing relies on an analysis of the chromosomes located within the nucleus of all human cells. 'The DNA material in chromosomes is composed of &quot;coding&quot; and &quot;non-coding&quot; regions. The coding regions are known as genes and contain the information necessary for a cell to make proteins. . . . Non-protein coding regions . . . are not related directly to making proteins, [and] have been referred to as &quot;junk&quot; DNA.' The adjective &quot;junk&quot; may mislead the lay person, for in fact this is the DNA region used with near certainty to identify a person.&lt;ref name=USSC/&gt;}}

'''Edmond Moore Hamilton''' (October 21, 1904&amp;nbsp;– February 1, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JYDP-XWR|title= FamilySearch, Edmond Hamilton, February 1977|date= n.d.|publisher= United States Social Security Death Index|df=mdy-all|access-date= March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] writer of science fiction during the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.pulpgen.com/pulp/edmond_hamilton/|title= Edmond Hamilton|first= Larry|last= Estep|date= n.d.|publisher= Pulpgen.com|df=mdy-all|quote= The peak of Hamilton's popularity probably came in the 1920s and 1930s where he proved as popular with the readers of ''Weird Tales'' as such prominent authors as Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], he was raised there and in nearby [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. Something of a child prodigy, he graduated from high school and entered [[Westminster College (Pennsylvania)|Westminster College]] in [[New Wilmington, Pennsylvania]] at the age of 14, but washed out at 17.

== Writing career ==
Edmond Hamilton's career as a science fiction writer began with the publication of &quot;The Monster God of Mamurth&quot;, a short story, in the August 1926 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]'',&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; now a classic magazine of alternative fiction. Hamilton quickly became a central member of the remarkable group of ''Weird Tales'' writers assembled by editor [[Farnsworth Wright]], that included [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Robert E. Howard]]. ''Weird Tales'' would publish 79 works of fiction by Hamilton from 1926 to 1948, making him one of the magazine's most prolific contributors. Hamilton became a friend and associate of several ''Weird Tales'' veterans, including [[E. Hoffmann Price]] and [[Otis Adelbert Kline]]; most notably, he struck up a 20-year friendship with close contemporary [[Jack Williamson]], as Williamson records in his 1984 autobiography ''Wonder's Child.'' In the late 1930s ''Weird Tales'' printed several striking fantasy tales by Hamilton, most notably &quot;He That Hath Wings&quot; (July 1938), one of his most popular and frequently-reprinted pieces. Hamilton wrote one of the first hardcover compilations of what would eventually come to be known as the science fiction genre, ''The Horror on The Asteroid and Other Tales of Planetary Horror'' (1936).  The book comprises the following stories: &quot;The Horror on the Asteroid&quot;, &quot;The Accursed Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Saw Everything&quot; (&quot;The Man With the X-Ray Eyes&quot;), &quot;The Earth-Brain&quot;, &quot;The Monster-God of Mamurth&quot;, and &quot;[[The Man Who Evolved]]&quot;.

Through the late 1920s and early 1930s Hamilton wrote for all of the science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s then publishing, and contributed [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] stories to various other magazines as well. He was very popular as an author of [[space opera]], a [[Genre#Subgenre|subgenre]] he created along with [[E. E. Smith|E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith]]. His story &quot;The Island of Unreason&quot; (''[[Wonder Stories]]'', May 1933) won the first Jules Verne Prize as the best science fiction story of the year (this was the first science fiction prize awarded by the votes of fans, a precursor of the later [[Hugo Award]]s). In the later 1930s, in response to the economic strictures of the [[Great Depression]], he also wrote detective and crime stories. Always prolific in stereotypical pulp magazine fashion, Hamilton sometimes saw four or five of his stories appear in a single month in these years; the February 1937 issue of the pulp ''Popular Detective'' featured three Hamilton stories, one under his own name and two under pseudonyms. In the 1940s, Hamilton was the primary force behind the [[Captain Future]] [[Media franchise|franchise]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.robertweinberg.net/captainfuture.htm|title= Captain Future|first= Robert|last= Weinberg|date= n.d.|publisher= RobertWeinberg.net|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160314180925/http://www.robertweinberg.net/captainfuture.htm|archivedate= March 14, 2016|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|quote= Edmond Hamilton took [Mort] Weisinger's so-so idea about 'Mr. Future' and turned the concept into 'Captain Future'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a science fiction pulp designed for juvenile readers that won him many fans, but diminished his reputation in later years when science fiction moved away from [[space opera]]. Hamilton was always associated with an extravagant, romantic, high-adventure style of science fiction, perhaps best represented by his 1947 novel ''The Star Kings.'' As the science fiction field grew more sophisticated, his brand of extreme adventure seemed ever more quaint, corny, and dated.

In 1942 Hamilton began writing for [[DC Comics]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GCD&quot;&gt;{{Grand Comics Database search|type=credit|search= Edmond+Hamilton|title= Edmond Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in stories for their characters [[Superman]] and [[Batman]]. His first comics story was &quot;Bandits in Toyland&quot; in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #11 (June–July 1942).&lt;ref name=&quot;GCD&quot; /&gt; He wrote the short-lived science fiction series [[Chris KL-99]] in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irvine|first= Alex | authorlink=Alex Irvine |last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1950s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|Dorling Kindersley]]|date=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 64|quote = [''Strange Adventures''] issue #1 also saw the first appearance of...Chris KL-99, from legendary sci-fi author Edmond Hamilton and artist Howard Sherman.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was loosely based on Captain Future.

He introduced many of the early Legion concepts including the [[Time Trapper]] in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #317 (Feb. 1964)&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie, Michael &quot;1960s&quot; in Dolan, p. 110: &quot;Writer Edmond Hamilton and artist John Forte made the first-ever reference to the nefarious Time Trapper.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] in ''Adventure Comics'' #327 (Dec. 1964).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie &quot;1960s&quot; in Dolan, p. 113: &quot;Writer Edmond Hamilton and artist John Forte introduced them to Karth Arn, a super-strong acrobat calling himself 'Lone Wolf'...The hero soon adopted the moniker of Timber Wolf.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His story &quot;The Clash of Cape and Cowl&quot; in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #153 (Nov. 1965) is the source of an [[Internet meme]] in which Batman slaps Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cbr.com/batman-slaps-robin-the-origin-of-the-panel/|title= Batman Slaps Robin – The Origin of the Panel|first= Brian|last= Cronin|date= January 1, 2009|website= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910164903/http://www.cbr.com/batman-slaps-robin-the-origin-of-the-panel/|archivedate= September 10, 2016|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton retired from comics with the publication of &quot;The Cape and Cowl Crooks&quot; in ''World's Finest Comics'' #159 (August 1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;GCD&quot; /&gt;

In 1969, the [[Macfadden Communications Group|Macfadden/Bartell Corporation]] published a collection of short science fiction stories &quot;Alien Earth and Other Stories&quot; (520-00219-075), where Hamilton's 1949 &quot;Alien Earth&quot; was featured along with novelettes by Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and others.

==Marriage and collaboration==
On December 31, 1946, Hamilton married fellow science fiction author and screenwriter [[Leigh Brackett]] in [[San Gabriel, California]], and moved with her to [[Kinsman, Ohio]].  Afterward he would produce some of his best work including his novels ''The Star of Life'' (1947), ''The Valley of Creation'' (1948), ''City at World's End'' (1951)&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; and ''[[The Haunted Stars]]'' (1960). In this more mature phase of his career, Hamilton moved away from the romantic and fantastic elements of his earlier fiction to create some unsentimental and realistic stories, such as &quot;What's It Like Out There?&quot; (''Thrilling Wonder Stories'', December 1952), his single most frequently-reprinted and anthologized work.

Though Hamilton and Leigh Brackett worked side by side for a quarter-century, they rarely shared the task of authorship; their single formal collaboration, ''Stark and the Star Kings'', originally intended for [[Harlan Ellison]]'s ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'', would not appear in print until 2005. It has been speculated that when Brackett temporarily abandoned science fiction for screenwriting in the early 1960s, Hamilton did an uncredited revision and expansion of two early Brackett stories, &quot;Black Amazon of Mars&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot;&amp;nbsp;— revised texts were published as the novellas ''[[People of the Talisman]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Sinharat]]'' (1964).

Edmond Hamilton died in February 1977 in [[Lancaster, California]], of complications following kidney surgery. In the year before his death, [[Toei Animation]] had launched production of an [[anime]] adaptation of his [[Captain Future]] novels and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] adapted ''[[Star Wolf (TV series)|Star Wolf]]'' into a [[tokusatsu]] series; both series were aired on Japanese television in 1978. The ''Captain Future'' adaptation was later exported to Europe, winning Hamilton a new and different fan base than the one that had acclaimed him half a century before, notably in France, Italy and Germany.

Joint interviews of Brackett and Hamilton by Dave Truesdale were published in ''Tangent'' (Summer 1976),&lt;ref name=truesdale/&gt; and by [[Darrell Schweitzer]] in ''Amazing Stories'' (January 1978),&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&amp;nbsp;— the latter published several months after Hamilton's death, but conducted &quot;much earlier&quot;, Truesdale attributes to Schweitzer.&lt;ref name=truesdale /&gt;

The first recipe in [[French language|French]] for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in [[Nicholas Lemery]]'s ''Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cool&quot; /&gt; Recipes for ''sorbetti'' saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's ''Lo Scalco alla Moderna'' (The Modern Steward).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cool&quot; /&gt; Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot's ''Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits'', starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cool&quot; /&gt;

Ice cream recipes first appeared in [[England]] in the 18th century.

To ice cream.

Take Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten’d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and &lt;!-- 93 --&gt; lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou’d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten’d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.

[[Quaker]] colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in [[New York City|New York]] and other cities during the colonial era. [[Ben Franklin]], [[George Washington]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]] were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss émigré [[Carlo Gatti]] set up the first stand outside [[Charing Cross]] station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Stephens |url=http://bordeaux-undiscovered.blogspot.com/2007/03/wine-flavoured-ice-cream.html |title=Wine Flavoured Ice Cream |publisher=Bordeaux-Undiscovered |date=28 March 2007 |access-date=4 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727132607/http://bordeaux-undiscovered.blogspot.com/2007/03/wine-flavoured-ice-cream.html |archive-date=27 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from [[Regent's Canal]] under a contract with the [[Regent's Canal Company]]. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from [[Norway]].

[[Agnes Marshall]], regarded as the &quot;queen of ices&quot; in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books:  ''Ices Plain and Fancy: The Book of Ices'' (1885), ''Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery'' (1888), ''Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes'' (1891) and ''Fancy Ices'' (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using [[liquid nitrogen]] to make [[Ice cream#Using liquid nitrogen|ice cream]].

[[Ice cream soda]] was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The [[sundae|ice cream sundae]] originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent [[blue law]]s, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], and [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]. Both the [[ice cream cone]] and [[banana split]] became popular in the early 20th century.

The history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the [[soda shop]], the [[soda fountain]], and the [[ice cream parlor]]. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]], the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as [[bar]]s and [[bar|saloons]].

[[File:Children in the Ghetto and the Ice-Cream Man. Chicago Ill. (FRONT).jpeg|thumb|Children in [[Maxwell Street|Chicago]] surround an Ice cream vendor in 1909.]]
Ice cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap [[refrigeration]] became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants advertised &quot;a world of 28 flavors,” and [[Baskin-Robbins]] made its 31 flavors (&quot;one for every day of the month&quot;) the cornerstone of its [[marketing strategy]] (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).

One important development in the 20th century was the introduction of [[soft serve|soft ice cream]], which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a [[Tap (valve)|spigot]]. In the United States, chains such as [[Dairy Queen]], [[Carvel (franchise)|Carvel]], and [[Tastee-Freez]] helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.

Technological innovations such as these have introduced various [[food additive]]s into ice cream, most notably the [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizing agent]] [[gluten]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn030331.html |title=Gluten sensitivity more widespread than previously thought |publisher=Colorado State University Extension |author=Pat Kendall, Ph.D., R.D. |date=31 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which some people have an [[gluten-related disorders|intolerance]]. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nestle.ca/haagen_dazs/en/Company/FAQ/index#Q13 |title=Haagen-Dazs: FAQ – Is Haagen Dazs Gluten Free? |publisher=[[Nestlé]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202224331/http://www.nestle.ca/haagen_dazs/en/Company/FAQ/index#Q13 |archive-date=2 February 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as &quot;premium&quot; and &quot;super-premium&quot; varieties under brands such as [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]], [[Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company]] and [[Häagen-Dazs]].

== Composition ==
Ice cream is a colloidal [[emulsion]] made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are [[Chemical polarity|non polar]] and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as [[casein]] and [[whey]] protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can [[adsorb]] water and form [[micelles]] which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. [[Sucrose]] which is [[disaccharide]] is usually used as a sweetening agent. [[Lactose]] which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/Courses/ce457_527/ce457_pro/Colloidal%20and%20surface%20phenomenal%20aspects%20of%20Ice%20cream.doc|title=Colloidal and surface phenomenal aspects of ice cream}}&lt;/ref&gt; Too much lactose will result in a non ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |chapter=Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:EismaschineBoku.JPG|left|thumb|A Boku Europa [[ice cream maker]] in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]]]
Before the development of modern [[refrigeration]], ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]], insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. [[Frederic Tudor]] of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.

Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/three-ways-to-make-homemade-ice-cream|date=November 21, 2016|title=Three ways to make homemade ice cream|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=July 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a {{interlanguage link|sorbetière|fr}} (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing [[latent heat]] and bringing the mixture below the [[freezing point]] of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.

The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.

In Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.

The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.

In modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an [[ice cream maker]], an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add [[liquid nitrogen]] to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by [[Heston Blumenthal]] as ideal for home cooks, is to add [[dry ice]] to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Eggs |series=How to Cook Like Heston |first=Heston |last=Blumenthal |network=[[Channel 4]] |series-no=1 |number= 02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.

Borden's [[Eagle Brand]] sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with condensed milk, cream, and various simple flavourings.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Judy, ''[https://www.nola.com/food/2010/08/post_46.html Make New Orleans flavored ice cream without a fancy machine]'', Nola.com, August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.

An unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of {{convert|5|usgal|l|adj=on}} cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avf4u.html |title=The Vought F4U Corsair |last=Gobel |first=Greg |date=1 May 2015 |website=www.airvectors.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Zach |title=DIY Ice Cream in Wartime |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/as-next/cool-side-tropical-warfare-180969515/ |access-date=22 August 2018 |work=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]] |date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flying Fortresses Double As Ice-Cream Freezers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/03/13/archives/flying-fortresses-double-as-icecream-freezers.html |access-date=22 August 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 March 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialty job ===
[[File:East Village ice cream truck.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ice cream van]] vendor delivery]]
Today, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an [[ice cream van]]. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.

Some ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as &quot;[[ice cream van|ice cream trucks]]&quot;), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as &quot;[[Turkey in the Straw]]&quot;). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a [[music box]] noise rather than actual music.

Many countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.

In the U.S., the [[FDA]] rules state that to be described as &quot;ice cream&quot;, a product must have the following composition:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=§135.110 Ice cream and frozen custard|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e54b8eb5678cea336e79c0d72e07944d&amp;mc=true&amp;n=sp21.2.135.b&amp;r=SUBPART&amp;ty=HTML |publisher=FDA.gov |access-date=15 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* greater than 10% milk fat
* 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the [[protein]]s ([[casein]]s and whey proteins) and [[carbohydrate]]s (lactose) found in milk

It generally also has:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/ice-cream-mix-ingredients |title=Ice Cream Ingredients |access-date=15 September 2019 |work=Dairy Science and Technology Education Series |first=H.

* 12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based [[corn syrup]] sweeteners
* 0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers
* 55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.

These compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.
Even the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains {{convert|150|Cal|kJ}} per half-cup due to its high sugar content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn000725.html |title=Ice Cream – What's in a Scoop? |first=Pat |last=Kendall |access-date=9 August 2008 |publisher=[[Colorado State University]] |date=25 June 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080530044709/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn000725.html |archive-date = 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Canadian [[Food and Drugs Act]] and Regulations, ice cream in [[Canada]] is divided into  Ice cream mix and Ice cream.

== Physical properties ==
[[File:IceCreamSandwich.jpg|thumb|left|Ice cream sandwich]]
Ice cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physical Properties of Foods: Novel Measurement Techniques and Applications|url=https://archive.org/details/physicalproperti00aran_779|url-access=limited|last=Arana|first=Ignacio|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439835364|page=[https://archive.org/details/physicalproperti00aran_779/page/n398 385]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food safety concerns about ice cream ==
From the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases, weight gain, and other metabolic syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chassaing |first1=Benoit |last2=Koren |first2=Omry |last3=Goodrich |first3=Julia K. |last4=Poole |first4=Angela C. |last5=Srinivasan |first5=Shanthi |last6=Ley |first6=Ruth E. |last7=Gewirtz |first7=Andrew T. |title=Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome |journal=Nature |date=March 1, 2015 |volume=519 |issue=7541 |pages=92–96 |doi=10.1038/nature14232 |pmid=25731162 |pmc=4910713 |bibcode=2015Natur.519...92C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ostwald ripening ===
[[File:Magnum ice cream.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Chocolate-glazed [[Magnum (ice cream)|Magnum]] ice cream bar]]
[[Ostwald ripening]] is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:

r = r (0) + Rt exp(1/n)&lt;!--can someone format this correctly?--&gt;

Where r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).

To make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ice Cream|url=https://archive.org/details/icecream00goff|url-access=limited|last1=Hartel|first1=Richard W.|last2=Douglass Goff|first2=H.|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-6095-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/icecream00goff/page/n366 358], 359|date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==
{{Main|list of ice cream varieties by country}}
Around the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.
[[File:Italian ice cream.jpg|thumb|left|Italian ice cream, ''[[gelato]]'' in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].]]

The most traditional Argentine ''helado'' (ice cream) is very similar to Italian [[gelato]], in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.

Per capita, [[Australia]]ns and [[New Zealand]]ers are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the [[United States]] where people eat 23 litres each per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibisworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |title=Business Outlook: ice cream manufacturing (based on a report to be found through www.ibisworld.com.au) |publisher=Reed Business Information |access-date=3 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427031709/http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |archive-date=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

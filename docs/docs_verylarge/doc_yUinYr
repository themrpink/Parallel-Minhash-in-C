An '''optical switch''' is a device that selectively switches optical signals from one channel to another. The switching can be temporal or spatial.The former is known as an optical (time-domain) switch or an optical modulator, while the latter is called an optical space switch or an optical router. In general, optical modulators and routers can be made from each other.

==Terminology==
The word applies on several levels. In commercial terms (such as &quot;the telecom optical switch market size&quot;) it refers to any piece of [[circuit switching]] equipment between fibers. The majority of installed systems in this category actually use electronic switching between fiber [[transponders]]. Systems that perform this function by routing light beams are often referred to as &quot;photonic&quot; switches, independent of how the light itself is switched. Away from telecom, an optical switch is the unit that actually switches light between fibers, and a photonic switch is one that does this by exploiting nonlinear material properties, such as semiconductor-based materials, to steer light (i.e., to switch wavelengths, intensities, or directions) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jin |first=C.-Y. |last2=Wada |first2=O. |date=March 2014 |title=Photonic switching devices based on semiconductor nano-structures |journal=Journal of Physics D |volume=47 |pages=133001 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/47/13/133001|arxiv=1308.2389 |bibcode=2014JPhD...47m3001J }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence a certain portion of the optical switch market is made up of photonic switches. These will contain within them an optical switch, which will, in some cases, be a photonic switch.

==Operation==
An optical switch may operate by mechanical means, such as physically shifting an optical fiber to drive one or more alternative fibers, or by [[electro-optic effect]]s, [[magneto-optic effect]]s, or other methods. Slow optical switches, such as those using moving fibers, may be used for alternate [[routing]] of an optical switch [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] path, such as routing around a [[Fault (technology)|fault]]. Fast optical switches, such as those using electro-optic or magneto-optic effects, may be used to perform [[logic operation]]s; also included in this category are [[semiconductor]] [[optical amplifiers]], which are [[optoelectronic]] devices that can be used as optical switches and be integrated with discrete or integrated microelectronic circuits.

==Functionality==
The functionality of any switch can be described in terms of the connections it can establish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1073&amp; GR-1073-CORE], ''Generic Requirements for Single-mode Fiber Optic Switches,'' Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in [[Telcordia]] [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1073&amp; GR-1073], 
a connection is the association between two ports on a switch and is indicated as a
pair of port identifiers (''i'', ''j'' ), where ''i'' and ''j'' are two ports between which the
connection is established. A connection identifies the transmission path between
two ports. An optical signal can be applied to either one of the connected ports.
However, the nature of the signal emerging at the other port depends on the optical
switch and the state of the connection. A connection can be in the ''on'' state or the
''off'' state. A connection is said to be in the ''on'' state if an optical signal applied to
one port emerges at the other port with essentially zero loss in optical energy. A
connection is said to be in the ''off'' state if essentially zero optical energy emerges
at the other port.

Connections established in optical switches can be unidirectional or bidirectional. A unidirectional connection only allows optical signal transmission in one direction between the connected ports. A bidirectional connection allows optical signal transmission in both directions over the connection. Connections in passive and transparent optical switches are bidirectional, i.e., if a connection (''i'', ''j'' ) is set up, optical transmission is possible from ''i'' to ''j'' and from ''j'' to ''i''.

A device is optically “transparent” if the optical signal launched at the input remains optical throughout its transmission path in the device and appears as an optical signal at the output. Optically transparent devices operate over a range of wavelengths called the passband.

A passive optical switch does not have optical gain elements. An active optical switch has optical gain elements. An all-optical switch is a transparent optical switch in which the actuating signal is also optical. Thus, in an all-optical switch, an optical signal is used to switch the path another optical signal takes through the switch.

==Performance==
Various parameters are defined and specified to quantify the performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical switching matrix) is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port to any one of N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port.
 
Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an optical modulator.)

A switch’s ability to sustain its steady state and transient performance specifications under stressful environmental conditions and over time is also an important characteristic.

==Applications==
Optical switching technology is driven by the need to provide flexibility in optical network connectivity. Prime applications are optical protection, test systems, remotely reconfigurable add-drop multiplexers, and sensing. Possible future applications include remote optical provisioning and restoration.

Current switching applications include passive protection switching for service restoration following a disruption, such as a fiber cut. One common application for switches is in Remote Fiber Test Systems (RFTSs) that can monitor and locate a fault on a fiber transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1295&amp; GR-1295-CORE], ''Generic Requirements for Remote Fiber Testing Systems (RFTSs),'' Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging application of optical switches is optical cross-connection. Optical cross-connects utilize optical switching fabrics to establish an interconnection between multiple optical inputs and outputs.

==Patents==
A 2011 search on “optical switch” [http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html] yielded some 8,000 patents, roughly categorized as follows:

* [[MEMS]] approaches involving arrays of micromirrors that can deflect an optical signal to the appropriate receiver (e.g., {{patent|US |6396976}});
* [[Piezoelectric]] Beam Steering involving piezoelectric ceramics providing enhanced optical switching characteristics
* [[Inkjet]] methods involving the intersection of two [[waveguides]] so that light is deflected from one to the other when an inkjet-like bubble is created (e.g., {{patent|US |  6212308}});
* [[Liquid crystal]]s (e.g.,  {{patent|US |  4948229}}) that rotate [[polarized light]] either 0 degrees or 90 degrees depending on the applied [[electric field]];
* Thermal methods (e.g.,  {{patent|US | 5037169}}) that vary the [[refraction index]] in one leg of an [[interferometer]] to switch the signal;
* Nonlinear methods (e.g.,  {{patent|US |  5319492}}) that vary the [[diffraction]] pattern in a medium by taking advantage of the material nonlinear properties to deflect light to the desired receiver;
* Acousto-optic methods that change the refraction index as a result of strain induced by an acoustic field to deflect light (e.g.,  {{patent|US | 6922498}});
* [[Amplifier]]s and [[Optical attenuator|attenuator]]s in output fibers that adjust the signal to the digital “0” power range (when the fiber is not switched to) or to the normal power range when it is (e.g.,  {{patent|US |  7027211}}).
* [[Magneto-optic]] methods (e.g. {{patent|US |  6577430}}) using phenomena such as [[Faraday rotation]] to affect light polarization and ultimately determine light path.

{{redirect-distinguish|OTDR|On-Train Data Recorder}}
An '''optical time-domain reflectometer''' ('''OTDR''') is an [[optoelectronic]] instrument used to characterize an [[optical fiber]]. An OTDR is the optical equivalent of an electronic [[time domain reflectometer]]. It injects a series of optical pulses into the fiber under test and extracts, from the same end of the fiber, [[light]] that is scattered ([[Rayleigh scattering|Rayleigh backscatter]]) or reflected back from points along the fiber. The scattered or reflected light that is gathered back is used to characterize the optical fiber. This is equivalent to the way that an electronic time-domain meter measures reflections caused by changes in the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the cable under test. The strength of the return pulses is measured and integrated as a function of [[time]], and plotted as a function of length of the fiber.

==Reliability and quality of OTDR equipment==

The reliability and quality of an OTDR is based on its accuracy, measurement range, ability to resolve and measure closely spaced events, measurement speed, and ability to perform satisfactorily under various environmental extremes and after various types of physical abuse. The instrument is also judged on the basis of its cost, features provided, size, weight, and ease of use.

Some of the terms often used in specifying the quality of an OTDR are as follows:
:'''Accuracy''': Defined as the correctness of the measurement i.e., the difference between the measured value and the true value of the event being measured.

:'''Measurement range''': Defined as the maximum attenuation that can be placed between the instrument and the event being measured, for which the instrument will still be able to measure the event within acceptable accuracy limits.

:'''Instrument resolution''': Is a measure of how close two events can be spaced and still be recognized as two separate events. The duration of the measurement pulse and the data sampling interval create a resolution limitation for OTDRs. The shorter the pulse duration and the shorter the data sampling interval, the better the instrument resolution, but the shorter the measurement range. Resolution is also often limited when powerful reflections return to the OTDR and temporarily overload the detector. When this occurs, some time is required before the instrument can resolve a second fiber event. Some OTDR manufacturers use a “masking” procedure to improve resolution. The procedure shields or “masks” the detector from high-power fiber reflections, preventing detector overload and eliminating the need for detector recovery.

Industry requirements for the reliability and quality of OTDRs are specified in the Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment.&lt;ref name= &quot;Telecordia Sep 2010&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title = Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment| publisher = Telcordia (Ericsson Inc)| date = Sep 2010 | url = http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-196&amp;| accessdate = 15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of OTDR-like test equipment==

The common types of OTDR-like test equipment are:
# '''Full-feature OTDR''': 
#:Full-feature OTDRs are traditional, optical time domain reflectometers. They are feature-rich and usually larger, heavier, and less portable than either the hand-held OTDR or the fiber break locator. Despite being characterized as large, their size and weight is only a fraction of that of early generation OTDRs. Often a full-feature OTDR has a main frame that can be fitted with multi-function plug-in units to perform many fiber measurement tasks. Larger color displays are common. The full-feature OTDR often has a greater measurement range than the other types of OTDR-like equipment. Often it is used in laboratories and in the field for difficult fiber measurements. Most full-feature OTDRs are powered from AC and/or a battery.
# '''Hand-held OTDR and Fiber break locator''': 
#:Hand-held (formerly mini) OTDRs and fiber break locators are designed to troubleshoot fiber networks in a field environment, often using battery power. The two types of instruments cover the spectrum of approaches to fiber optic plant taken by communication providers. Hand-held, inexpensive OTDRs are intended to be easy-to-use, light-weight, sophisticated OTDRs that collect field data and perform rudimentary data analysis. They may be less feature rich than full-feature OTDRs. Often they can be used in conjunction with PC-based software to perform data collection and sophisticated data analysis. Hand-held OTDRs are commonly used to measure fiber links and locate fiber breaks, points of high loss, high reflectance, end-to-end loss, and Optical Return Loss (ORL).
#:Fiber break locators are intended to be low-cost instruments specifically designed to determine the location of a catastrophic fiber event, e.g., fiber break, point of high reflectance, or high loss. The fiber break locator is an opto-electronic tape measure designed to measure only distance to catastrophic fiber events.
#:In general, hand-held OTDRs and fiber break locators are lighter and smaller, simpler to operate, and more likely to employ battery power than full-feature OTDRs. The intent with hand-held OTDRs and fiber break locators is to be inexpensive enough for field technicians to be equipped with one as part of a standard tool kit.
# '''RTU in RFTSs''': 
#:The RTU is the testing module of the RFTS described in Generic Requirements for Remote Fiber Testing Systems (RFTSS).&lt;ref name= &quot;Telecordia Jan 2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title = Generic Requirements for Remote Fiber Testing Systems (RFTSs)| publisher = Telcordia (Ericsson Inc)| date = January 2000 | url = http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1295&amp;| accessdate = 15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An RFTS enables fiber to be automatically tested from a central location. A central computer is used to control the operation of OTDR-like test components located at key points in the fiber network. The test components scan the fiber to locate problems. If a problem is found, its location is noted and the appropriate personnel are notified to begin the repair process. The RFTS can also provide direct access to a database that contains historical information of the OTDR fiber traces and any other fiber records for the physical fiber plant.
#:Since OTDRs and OTDR-like equipment have many uses in the communications industry, operating environments vary widely, both indoors and outdoors. Most often, however, these test sets are operated in controlled environments, accessing the fibers at their termination points on fiber distribution frames. Indoor environments include controlled areas such as central offices (COs), equipment huts, or Controlled Environment Vaults (CEVs). Use in outside environments is rarer, but may include use in a manhole, aerial platform, open trench, or splicing vehicle.

==OTDR data format==
In the late 1990s, OTDR industry representatives and the OTDR user community developed a unique data format to store and analyze OTDR fiber data. This data was based on the specifications in GR-196, Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment. The goal was for the data format to be truly universal, in that it was intended to be implemented by all OTDR manufacturers. OTDR suppliers developed the software to implement the data format. As they proceeded, they identified inconsistencies in the format, along with areas of misunderstanding among users.

From 1997 to 2000, a group of OTDR supplier software specialists attempted to resolve problems and inconsistencies in what was then called the “Bellcore” OTDR Data Format. This group, called the OTDR Data Format Users Group (ODFUG), made progress. Since then, many OTDR developers continued to work with other developers to solve individual interaction problems and enable cross use between manufacturers.
 
In 2011, Telcordia decided to compile industry comments on this data format into one document entitled Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Data Format. This Special Report (SR) summarizes the state of the Bellcore OTDR Data Format, renaming it as the Telcordia OTDR Data Format.&lt;ref name= &quot;Telecordia July 2011&quot;&gt;{{Citation| first =Terry | last = Donovan| title = Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Data Format| publisher = Telcordia (Ericsson Inc)| date = Jul 2011 | url = http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-4731&amp;| accessdate = 15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The data format is intended for all OTDR-related equipment designed to save trace data and analysis information. Initial implementations require standalone software to be provided by the OTDR supplier to convert existing OTDR trace files to the SR-4731 data format and to convert files from this universal format to a format that is usable by their older OTDRs. This file conversion software can be developed by the hardware supplier, the end user, or a third party. This software also provides backward compatibility of the OTDR data format with existing equipment.

The SR-4731 format describes binary data. While text information is contained in several fields, most numbers are represented as either 16-bit (2-byte) or 32-bit (4-byte) signed or unsigned integers stored as binary images. Byte ordering in this file format is explicitly low-byte ordering, as is common on [[Intel]] processor-based machines. String fields are terminated with a zero byte “\0”. OTDR waveform data are represented as short, unsigned integer data uniformly spaced in time, in units of decibels (dB) times 1000, referenced to the maximum power level. The maximum power level is set to zero, and all waveform data points are assumed to be zero or negative (the sign bit is implied), so that the minimum power level in this format is -65.535 dB, and the minimum resolution between power level steps is 0.001 dB. In some cases, this will not provide sufficient power range to represent all waveform points. For this reason, the use of a scale factor has been introduced to expand the data point power range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telecordia July 2011&quot; /&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''outside plant''' has the following meanings:

*In civilian [[telecommunications]], outside plant refers to all of the physical cabling and supporting infrastructure (such as conduit, cabinets, tower or poles), and any associated hardware (such as [[repeater]]s) located between a [[demarcation point]] in a switching [[Facility (telecommunications)|facility]] and a demarcation point in another [[switching center]] or [[On-premises wiring|customer premises]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TGTT&quot;&gt;

  | title=Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms
  | accessdate=2010-02-02
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United States, the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] defines outside plant as the communications equipment located between a main distribution frame (MDF) and a [[User (telecommunications)|user]] [[end instrument]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TGTT&quot;/&gt;

The [[Cable TV|CATV]] industry divides its [[fixed asset]]s between [[Cable television headend|head end]] or [[inside plant]], and outside plant.  The electrical power industry also uses the term outside plant to refer to [[electric power distribution]] systems.

==Context==
[[Image:Distribution-frame-0a-messy.jpg|thumb|alt=A Main Distribution Frame showing 110 punch block and twisted pair wiring|Distribution Frame]]
[[File:Cleveland blizzard 1913, poles down.png|thumb|Damage to outside plant, 1913]]
Network connections between devices such as computers, printers, and phones require a physical infrastructure to carry and process signals. Typically, this infrastructure will consist of:
* Cables from wall outlets and jacks run to a [[Wiring closet|communications closets]], sometimes referred to as station cable.
* Cables connecting one [[Wiring closet|communications closet]] to another, sometimes referred to as riser cable.
* Racks containing telecommunications hardware, such as [[Network switch|switches]], [[router (computing)|router]]s, and [[repeater]]s.
* Cables connecting one building to another.
* Exterior communications cabinets containing hardware outside of buildings.
* Radio transceivers used inside or outside buildings, such as [[wireless access point]]s, and hardware associated with them, such as antennas and towers.

The portion of this infrastructure contained within a building is the [[inside plant]], and the portion of this infrastructure connecting buildings or facilities is the outside plant. Where these two plants meet in a given structure is the [[demarcation point]].

Outside plant cabling, whether copper or fiber, is generally installed as [[aerial cable]] between poles, in an [[Utility tunnel|underground conduit]] system, or by direct burial.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPC&quot;&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Hardware associated with the outside plant must be either protected from the elements (for example, [[distribution frame]]s are generally protected by a street side cabinet) or constructed with materials suitable for exposure to the elements. Installation of the outside plant elements often require construction of significant physical infrastructure, such as underground vaults.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In older large installations, cabling is sometimes protected by air pressure systems designed to prevent water infiltration. While this is not a modern approach, the cost of replacement of the older cabling with sealed cabling is often prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;UAPS&quot;&gt;

*In-house wiring that connects [[customer premises equipment]] to the [[demarcation point]], usually in residential installations contained in a weather protected box.
*One or more [[twisted pair]]s, called a drop wire. The drop wires typically connect to a splice case, located in line for aerial cables, or in a small weather protected case for underground wiring, where the local cabling is connected to a secondary feeder line. These cables contain fifty or more twisted pairs.
*Secondary feeder lines run to a streetside cabinet containing a [[distribution frame]] called a [[Serving Area Interface]] (SAI).
*The [[Serving Area Interface|SAI]] is connected to the [[main distribution frame]], located at a [[Telephone exchange]] or other switching facility, by one or more primary feeder lines which contain hundreds of copper twisted pairs. An [[Serving Area Interface|SAI]] may also contain a [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) supporting [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] service.

Active equipment (such as a [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] or [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] line circuit) can then be connected to the line in order to provide service, but this is not considered part of outside plant.

==Protecting equipment in the outside plant==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
The environment can play a large role in the quality and lifespan of equipment used in the outside plant. It is critical that environmental testing criteria as well as design and performance requirements be defined for this type of equipment.

There are generally four operating environments or classes covering all outside plant (OSP) applications, including wireless facilities.
:*Class 1: Equipment in a Controlled Environment
:*Class 2: Protected Equipment in Outside Environments
:*Class 3: Protected Equipment in Severe Outside Environments
:*Class 4: Products in an Unprotected Environment

Electronic equipment located in one or more of these environmental class locations is designed to withstand various environmental operating conditions resulting from climatic conditions that may include rain, snow, sleet, high winds, ice, salt spray, and sand storms. Since outside temperatures can possibly range from −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F) to 46&amp;nbsp;°C (115&amp;nbsp;°F), with varying degrees of solar loading, along with humidity levels ranging from below 10% up to 100%, significant environmental stresses within the enclosure or facility can be produced.

Telcordia [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3108&amp; GR-3108, Generic Requirements for Network Equipment in the Outside Plant (OSP)], contains the most recent industry data regarding each Class described above. It also discusses what is currently happening in  [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions|ATIS]]  and [[Underwriters Laboratories|Underwriters Laboratories (UL)]].

The document also includes 
:*Environmental criteria such as operating temperatures, humidity, particulate contamination, pollution exposure, and heat dissipation
:*Mechanical criteria such as structural requirements, packaging, susceptibility to vibration, earthquake, and handling
:*Electrical protection and safety including protection from lightning surges, AC power induction and faults, and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and DC power influences

===Handholes and other below-ground splice vaults===

Handholes and other below-ground splice vaults house telecommunications components used in an Outside Plant (OSP) environment.

Handholes are plastic or polymer concrete structures set below ground with their lids flush to the surrounding soil, turf, footpath, or road surface. They can be used to house and protect copper, coaxial, and optical fiber telephone cable splices and distribution elements. They safeguard and provide convenient access to cable termination and branch points, provide flexibility and access for installation operations (e.g., pulling or blowing cables), provide mechanical and environmental protection for splices, allow access for craftsperson work activities, and discourage (&amp; hinder?) access by unauthorized persons.

=== United Kingdom ===
In Britain in the 1930s, when the [[Windmill Theatre]], London, began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, &quot;The Cambridge guide to theatre&quot;, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}, page 803&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary [[tableaux vivants]]. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. [[Fan dance]]s were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho, with &quot;fully nude&quot; dancing and audience participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray Goldstein 2005&quot;/&gt; Following the introduction of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]], a local authority licence is required for venues in England and Wales (and later Scotland) where live nude entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413151441/http:/crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimereduction057a.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413151441/http:/crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimereduction057a.pdf|archive-date=13 April 2010|title=Sexual Entertainment Venues: Guidance for England and Wales|date=March 2010|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Echo NewLaws 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8212913.Tough_new_rules_on_strip_club_openings/ | title = Tough new rules on strip club openings | accessdate = 2010-06-11 | work = Echo | date = 2008-06-11 | last1 = Orbach | first1 = Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dog paddle''' or '''doggy paddle''' is a simple [[List of swimming styles|swimming style]].  It is characterized by the [[Human swimming|swimmer]] lying on their chest and moving their hands and legs alternately in a manner reminiscent of how [[dog]]s and other [[quadrupedal]] [[mammals]] swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boys' Own Book: A Complete Encyclopedia of Athletic, Scientific, Outdoor and Indoor Sports|year=1881|publisher=J Miller|author=William Clarke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiAMAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is effectively a &quot;trot&quot; in water, instead of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=At the Water's Edge: Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore But Then Went Back to Sea|author=Carl Zimmer|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=1999|isbn=0-684-85623-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZZpBy-lLTgC|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first swimming stroke used by ancient humans, believed to have been learned by observing animals swim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Breakthrough Swimming: Stroke Mechanics, Training Methods, Racing Techniques|page=[https://archive.org/details/breakthroughswim0000colw/page/12 12]|author=Cecil Colwin|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2002|isbn=0-7360-3777-2|url=https://archive.org/details/breakthroughswim0000colw/page/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prehistoric [[cave paintings]] in [[Egypt]] show figures doing what appears to be the dog paddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Olympic Swimming and Diving|author=Greg Kehm|page=[https://archive.org/details/olympicswimmingd0000kehm/page/4 4]|isbn=1-4042-0970-0|publisher=Rosen|year=2007|url=https://archive.org/details/olympicswimmingd0000kehm/page/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog paddle has also been taught as a military swimming stroke when a silent stroke is needed - since neither arms or legs break the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival at Sea|author=U.S. Departments of the Army and Air Force|year=1950|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=58|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/76323994/Survival-at-Sea-1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marines-tread-water-July 12-28-05.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] treading water in formation while carrying a rifle during a water survival course in July 2005]]
'''Treading water''' or '''water treading''' is what a [[Human swimming|swimmer]] can do while in a vertical position to keep their head above the surface of the water, while not providing sufficient directional [[thrust]] to overcome [[inertia]] and propel the swimmer in any specific direction. As it expends less energy than traditional strokes, it is often used by swimmers to rest in between periods of exertion without having to leave the water.

As such, the phrase &quot;treading water&quot; has become a [[euphemism]] for an effort expected to create motion, but which actually results in merely staying in one, possibly barely sustainable, place.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

==Methods==
Any sort of movement that allows the swimmer to do this can be classified as treading water, but it is more efficient to move the arms and legs in a specific fashion.

Non-swimmers often splash and kick in an effort to stay above the surface but their lack of technique along with shortness of breath and the panic factor make a very ineffective method of treading water.  They will usually tire quickly and not be able to stay above the surface very long.  

Experienced swimmers use a variety of techniques to stay above the surface.  These techniques often involve [[sculling]], [[flutter kick]], and other unofficial techniques of staying above the surface.

===Egg beater kick ===
{{Main|Eggbeater kick}}
The eggbeater kick is a highly refined and efficient method of treading water.  It involves the swimmer in a &quot;sitting position&quot; in the water.  The swimmer's back must be straight, knees bent so that the thighs are parallel to the surface of the water, and lower legs perpendicular to the surface.  

The left foot makes a clockwise motion while the right leg makes a counterclockwise motion towards the axis of the body, in a similar manner to operating the pedals on a [[bicycle]].  The legs should never meet because when one foot is on the inside of the motion, the other should be on the outside.  The arms are not involved directly in this kick.    

The most critical aspect to having an effective egg beater kick is flexibility.  You need very good range of motion of the hips to have a good egg beater kick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelreid.typepad.com/michaelreid/files/alexander_tech_of_eggbeater_kick.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggbeater kick can be used to move through the water if the body is angled.  Because of the opposite motion of the legs, eggbeater is a very smooth and steady way of treading water.  It also leaves the hands free to do work if necessary.     

This method of treading of water is the preferred method used by [[lifeguard]]s and other aquatic rescue professionals because of its efficiency and simplicity.  The fact that it does not occupy the hands is a major factor in this preference as these professionals often have to perform [[first aid]] as they are swimming to safety.  

Eggbeater is used in [[water polo]] because it lets the athletes use their arms to throw the ball. The eggbeater kick is the primary kick that enables the player to support themselves in the 
water while passing, shooting, defending, and resting – horizontally and vertically. It is also 
used for getting a quick, explosive start, when the player is beginning to swim. Greater elevation of the Polo player is created by a stronger eggbeater kick which results in a better rotation and stronger pass or shot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacswaterpolo.com/uploads/2/8/3/4/2834703/general_skills_and_drills_level_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of the eggbeater kick has been a cause of knee injuries in water polo players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Injuries in Water Polo | author1=Miljenko Franić | author2=Alan Ivković | author3=Ratko Rudić | authorlink3=Ratko Rudić |date=June 2007 | journal=Croatian Medical Journal | volume=48 | issue=3 | pages=281–288 | publisher=Medicinska Naklada | pmc=2080536 | pmid=17589969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggbeater is also used in [[synchronized swimming]] for stability and height above the water while leaving the hands free to perform strokes. Using the eggbeater, swimmers can also perform &quot;boosts&quot;, where they use their legs to momentarily propel themselves out of the water to their hips or higher.

The [[dog paddle]] is a simple style often used instinctively by children.  It involves waving both hands &amp; legs randomly while &quot;on all fours&quot;.

Another popular style involves sculling water horizontally while using flutter kicks vertically.

The ''History of Jin'' 《金史》 (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general [[Subutai]] (1176–1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of [[Kaifeng]], the defenders had a &quot;[[thunder crash bomb]]&quot; which &quot;consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container&amp;nbsp;... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than thirty miles, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than [[Chinese units of measurement#Area|half a ''mou'']]. When hit, even [[Chinese armour|iron armour]] was quite pierced through.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;needham&quot;/&gt; 

The Song Dynasty (960–1279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that [[arsenal]]s should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in [[Jingzhou]], about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to [[Xiangyang District, Xiangfan|Xiangyang]] and Yingzhou.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham&quot;/&gt; The Ming Dynasty text ''[[Huolongjing]]'' describes the use of poisonous gunpowder bombs, including the &quot;wind-and-dust&quot; bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Needham1986&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]], the Mongols used the explosive &quot;thunder-crash bombs&quot; against the Japanese. Archaeological evidence of the &quot;thunder-crash bombs&quot; has been discovered in an underwater  shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells confirmed that they contained gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delgado|first=James|title=Relics of the Kamikaze|journal=Archaeology|date=February 2003|volume=56|issue=1|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229155139/http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|archivedate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shock==
Explosive [[shock wave]]s can cause situations such as body displacement (i.e., people being thrown through the air), [[dismemberment]], [[internal bleeding]] and ruptured [[eardrum]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlstein 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mlstein|first=Randall L.|title=Forensic Science|url=https://archive.org/details/forensicscience00emba|url-access=limited|chapter=Bomb damage assessment|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon |editor2=Allan D. Pass |publisher=Salem Press|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/forensicscience00emba/page/n185 166]|isbn=978-1-58765-423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shock waves produced by explosive events have two distinct components, the positive and negative wave. The positive wave shoves outward from the point of detonation, followed by the trailing vacuum space &quot;sucking back&quot; towards the point of origin as the shock bubble collapses.
The greatest defense against shock injuries is distance from the source of shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Marks |first= Michael E. |title= The Emergency Responder's Guide to Terrorism |publisher= Red Hat Publishing Co., Inc. |year= 2002 |page= 30 |isbn= 1-932235-00-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a point of reference, the overpressure at the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] was estimated in the range of {{nowrap|28 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]].}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Wong |first= Henry |title= Blast-Resistant Building Design Technology Analysis of its Application to Modern Hotel Design |publisher= WGA Wong Gregerson Architects, Inc. |year= 2002  |page= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat==
A thermal wave is created by the sudden release of heat caused by an explosion. Military bomb tests have documented temperatures of up to 2,480&amp;nbsp;°C (4,500&amp;nbsp;°F). While capable of inflicting severe to catastrophic burns and causing secondary fires, thermal wave effects are considered very limited in range compared to shock and fragmentation. This rule has been challenged, however, by military development of [[thermobaric weapon]]s, which employ a combination of negative shock wave effects and extreme temperature to incinerate objects within the blast radius. This would be fatal to humans, as bomb tests have proven.

==Fragmentation==
{{main|Fragmentation (weaponry)}}
[[File:Ming Dynasty fragmentation bomb.jpg|thumb|180px|right|An illustration of a fragmentation bomb from the 14th century Ming Dynasty text ''Huolongjing''. The black dots represent iron pellets.]]
[[Fragmentation (weaponry)|Fragmentation]] is produced by the acceleration of shattered pieces of bomb casing and adjacent physical objects. The use of fragmentation in bombs dates to the 14th century, and appears in the [[Ming Dynasty]] text ''[[Huolongjing]]''. The fragmentation bombs were filled with iron pellets and pieces of broken porcelain. Once the bomb explodes, the resulting fragments are capable of piercing the skin and blinding enemy soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfrag&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Needham|title=Military Technology: The Gunpowder Epic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNcZJ35dIyUC&amp;pg=PR180|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|pages=180–181|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826084851/https://books.google.com/books?id=hNcZJ35dIyUC&amp;pg=PR180|archivedate=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While conventionally viewed as small metal shards moving at super-[[supersonic speed|supersonic]] and [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] speeds, fragmentation can occur in epic proportions and travel for extensive distances. When the SS ''Grandcamp'' exploded in the [[Texas City Disaster]] on April 16, 1947, one fragment of that blast was a two-ton anchor which was hurled nearly two miles inland to embed itself in the parking lot of the Pan American refinery.

==Effects on living things==
To people who are close to a blast incident, such as bomb disposal technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers, or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: [[overpressure]] (shock), [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], and [[heat]].  Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source.  This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts.&lt;ref&gt;Coupland, R.M. (1989). Amputation for antipersonnel mine injuries of the leg: preservation of the tibial stump using a medial gastrocnemius myoplasty. Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 71, pp. 405–408.&lt;/ref&gt; The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being set in motion by the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as incendiary agents projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a [[Bombsuit|bomb suit]] or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and foot protection, can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.

Experts commonly distinguish between civilian and military bombs. The latter are almost always mass-produced weapons, developed and constructed to a standard design out of standard components and intended to be deployed in a standard explosive device. [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] are divided into three basic categories by basic size and delivery. Type 76, IEDs are hand-carried parcel or suitcase bombs, type 80, are &quot;suicide vests&quot; worn by a bomber, and type 3 devices are vehicles laden with explosives to act as large-scale stationary or self-propelled bombs, also known as [[VBIED]] (vehicle-borne IEDs).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Improvised explosive materials are typically unstable {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and subject to spontaneous, unintentional detonation triggered by a wide range of environmental effects, ranging from [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] and [[friction]] to [[electrostatic]] shock. Even subtle [[motion (physics)|motion]], change in [[temperature]], or the nearby use of cellphones or radios can trigger an unstable or remote-controlled device. Any interaction with explosive materials or devices by unqualified personnel should be considered a grave and immediate risk of death or dire injury. The safest response to finding an object believed to be an explosive device is to get as far away from it as possible.

Atomic bombs are based on the theory of [[nuclear fission]], that when a large atom splits, it releases a massive amount of energy. [[Thermonuclear weapons]], (colloquially known as &quot;hydrogen bombs&quot;) use the energy from an initial [[Teller-Ulam design#Basic principle|fission]] explosion to create an even more powerful [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] explosion.

The term '''[[dirty bomb]]''' refers to a specialized device that relies on a comparatively low explosive yield to scatter harmful material over a wide area. Most commonly associated with [[radiological]] or chemical materials, dirty bombs seek to kill or injure and then to deny access to a contaminated area until a thorough clean-up can be accomplished. In the case of urban settings, this clean-up may take extensive time, rendering the contaminated zone virtually uninhabitable in the interim.

The power of large bombs is typically measured in [[TNT equivalent|kilotons (kt) or megatons of TNT (Mt)]]. The most powerful bombs ever used in combat were the two atomic bombs [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped by the United States]] to attack [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and the most powerful ever tested was the [[Tsar Bomba]]. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb is [[Russia]]n &quot;[[Father of All Bombs]]&quot; (officially Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1155952320070912?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Russia tests superstrength bomb, military says |last=Solovyov |first=Dmitry |date=2007-09-12 |work=Reuters |accessdate=2008-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419044709/http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1155952320070912?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |archivedate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[MOAB]] (officially Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or more commonly known as the &quot;Mother of All Bombs&quot;).

Below is a list of five different types of bombs based on the fundamental explosive mechanism they employ.

===Compressed gas===
Relatively small explosions can be produced by pressurizing a container until catastrophic failure such as with a [[dry ice bomb]]. Technically, devices that create explosions of this type can not be classified as &quot;bombs&quot; by the definition presented at the top of this article. However, the explosions created by these devices can cause property damage, injury, or death. Flammable liquids, gasses and gas mixtures dispersed in these explosions may also ignite if exposed to a spark or flame.

===Low explosive===
The simplest and oldest bombs store energy in the form of a [[low explosive]].  [[Black powder]] is an example of a low explosive.  Low explosives typically consist of a mixture of an oxidizing salt, such as [[potassium nitrate]] (saltpeter), with solid fuel, such as charcoal or aluminium powder.  These compositions deflagrate upon ignition, producing hot gas.  Under normal circumstances, this [[deflagration]] occurs too slowly to produce a significant pressure wave; low explosives, therefore, must generally be used in large quantities or confined in a container with a high burst pressure to be useful as a bomb.

===High explosive===
A high explosive bomb is one that employs a process called &quot;[[detonation]]&quot; to rapidly go from an initially high energy molecule to a very low energy molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ring Strain in Cycloalkanes|url=http://orgomadesimple.com/chapter-5-cycloalkanes/|website=Orgo Made Simple|accessdate=22 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622201710/http://orgomadesimple.com/chapter-5-cycloalkanes/|archivedate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation is distinct from deflagration in that the chemical reaction propagates faster than the speed of sound (often many times faster) in an intense shock wave. Therefore, the pressure wave produced by a high explosive is not significantly increased by confinement as detonation occurs so quickly that the resulting plasma does not expand much before all the explosive material has reacted. This has led to the development of [[plastic explosive]]. A casing is still employed in some high explosive bombs, but with the purpose of [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]]. Most high explosive bombs consist of an insensitive [[secondary explosive]] that must be detonated with a [[blasting cap]] containing a more sensitive [[primary explosive]].

===Thermobaric===
A [[thermobaric bomb]] is a type of [[explosive weapon|explosive]] that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the [[blast wave]] typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive. The '''fuel-air bomb''' is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapons.

===Nuclear fission===
[[Nuclear fission]] type atomic bombs utilize the energy present in very heavy atomic nuclei, such as U-235 or Pu-239. In order to release this energy rapidly, a certain amount of the fissile material must be very rapidly consolidated while being exposed to a neutron source. If consolidation occurs slowly, repulsive forces drive the material apart before a significant explosion can occur. Under the right circumstances, rapid consolidation can provoke a chain reaction that can proliferate and intensify by many orders of magnitude within microseconds. The energy released by a nuclear fission bomb may be tens of thousands of times greater than a chemical bomb of the same mass.

===Nuclear fusion===
A [[thermonuclear weapon]] is a type of nuclear bomb that releases energy through the combination of fission and [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] of the light atomic nuclei of deuterium and tritium. With this type of bomb, a thermonuclear detonation is triggered by the detonation of a fission type nuclear bomb contained within a material containing high concentrations of deuterium and tritium. Weapon yield is typically increased with a tamper that increases the duration and intensity of the reaction through inertial confinement and neutron reflection. Nuclear fusion bombs can have arbitrarily high yields making them hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than nuclear fission.

A [[pure fusion weapon]] is a nuclear weapon that doesn't require a primary fission stage to start a fusion reaction.

===Antimatter===

[[Antimatter weapon|Antimatter bombs]] can theoretically be constructed, but antimatter is very costly to produce and hard to store safely.

===Other===
* [[Aerial bomb]]
* [[Delay-action bomb]]
* [[Glide bomb]]
* [[General-purpose bomb]]
* [[Incendiary bomb]] - Incendiary bombs are designed to set targets ablaze.
* [[Cluster bomb]]
* [[Anti-runway penetration bomb]]
* [[Bunker buster]]
* [[Concrete bomb]] - A concrete bomb is an aerial bomb which contains dense, inert material (typically concrete, hence the name) instead of explosive.  The target is destroyed using the kinetic energy of the falling bomb.
* Inert bomb
{{Main|Inert munitions|military dummy}}
An [[Inert munition|inert bomb]] is one whose inner energetic material has been removed or otherwise rendered harmless. Inert munitions are used in military and naval training, and they are also collected and displayed by public museums, or by private parties.

Typically, NATO inert munitions are painted entirely in light blue and/or have the word &quot;INERT&quot; stenciled on them in prominent locations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The [[first air-dropped bomb]]s were used by the Austrians in the 1849 [[Republic of San Marco|siege of Venice]].  Two hundred unmanned balloons carried small bombs, although few bombs actually hit the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pS1QpH8FRgC&amp;q=Venice+bombing+1849&amp;pg=PA10 |title=Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918: An Illustrated History of their Impact |last=Murphy |first=Justin |year=2005 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=1-85109-488-1 |page=10 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first bombing from a fixed-wing aircraft took place in 1911 when the Italians dropped bombs by hand on the Turkish lines in what is now [[Libya]], during the [[Italo-Turkish War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-I3Zsdm14wC&amp;q=Lindqvist+Bombing+Libya&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Shock and Awe: War on Words |chapter=Guernica |last=Lindqvist |first=Sven |others=published by Van Eekelen, Bregje |year=2004 |publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]] |isbn=0-9712546-0-5 |page=76 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large scale dropping of bombs took place during [[World War I]] starting in 1915 with the German [[Zeppelin]] airship raids on [[London]], England, and the same war saw the invention of the first [[heavy bomber]]s.  One Zeppelin raid on 8 September 1915 dropped {{convert|4000|lb|abbr=on}} of high explosives and incendiary bombs, including one bomb that weighed {{convert|600|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilbur Cross (author)|Wilbur Cross]], &quot;Zeppelins of World War I&quot; page 35, published 1991 Paragon House ISBN I-56619-390-7&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] bombing became a major military feature, and a number of novel delivery methods were introduced. These included [[Barnes Wallis]]'s [[bouncing bomb]], designed to bounce across water, avoiding [[torpedo net]]s and other underwater defenses, until it reached a [[dam]], [[ship]], or other destination, where it would sink and explode. By the end of the war, planes such as the allied forces' [[Avro Lancaster]] were delivering with {{convert|50|yd|abbr=on}} accuracy from {{convert|20000|ft|abbr=on}}, ten ton [[earthquake bomb]]s (also invented by Barnes Wallis) named &quot;[[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]]&quot;, which, unusually for the time, were delivered from high altitude in order to gain high speed, and would, upon impact, penetrate and explode deep underground (&quot;[[camouflet]]&quot;), causing massive caverns or craters, and affecting targets too large or difficult to be affected by other types of bomb.

Modern military [[bomber]] aircraft are designed around a large-capacity internal [[bomb bay]], while [[fighter-bomber]]s usually carry bombs externally on pylons or bomb racks or on multiple ejection racks which enable mounting several bombs on a single pylon.  Some bombs are equipped with a [[parachute]], such as the World War II &quot;parafrag&quot; (an {{convert|11|kg|abbr=on}} fragmentation bomb), the [[Vietnam war]]-era [[BLU-82|daisy cutters]], and the bomblets of some modern [[cluster bomb]]s.  Parachutes slow the bomb's descent, giving the dropping aircraft time to get to a safe distance from the explosion.  This is especially important with airburst [[nuclear weapons]] (especially those dropped from slower aircraft or with very high yields), and in situations where the aircraft releases a bomb at low altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proceedings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jackson, S.B. |title=The Retardation of Weapons for Low Altitude Bombing |publisher=United States Naval Institute Proceedings |date=June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of modern bombs are also [[precision-guided munition]]s, and may be guided after they leave an aircraft by remote control, or by autonomous guidance.

Aircraft may also deliver bombs in the form of [[warhead]]s on guided [[missile]]s, such as long-range [[cruise missile]]s, which can also be launched from [[warship]]s.

A [[hand grenade]] is delivered by being thrown. Grenades can also be projected by other means, such as being launched from the muzzle of a [[rifle]] (as in the [[rifle grenade]]), using a grenade launcher (such as the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]]), or by attaching a [[rocket]] to the explosive grenade (as in a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG)).

A bomb may also be positioned in advance and concealed.

A bomb destroying a [[rail track]] just before a [[train]] arrives will usually cause the train to [[derailment|derail]].  In addition to the damage to vehicles and people, a bomb exploding in a [[transport]] network often damages, and is sometimes mainly intended to damage, the network itself.  This applies for [[railway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[runway]]s, and [[port]]s, and, to a lesser extent (depending on circumstances), to roads.

In the case of [[suicide bombing]], the bomb is often carried by the attacker on his or her body, or in a vehicle driven to the target.

The [[Blue Peacock]] nuclear mines, which were also termed &quot;bombs&quot;, were planned to be positioned during wartime and be constructed such that, if disturbed, they would explode within ten seconds.

The explosion of a bomb may be triggered by a [[detonator]] or a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. Detonators are triggered by [[clock]]s, [[remote control]]s like [[cell phone]]s or some kind of sensor, such as pressure (altitude), [[radar]], vibration or contact. Detonators vary in ways they work, they can be electrical, fire [[fuze]] or blast initiated detonators and others,

==Blast seat==
In [[forensic science]], the point of detonation of a bomb is referred to as its blast seat, seat of explosion, blast hole or [[epicenter]]. Depending on the type, quantity and placement of explosives, the blast seat may be either spread out or concentrated (i.e., an [[explosion crater]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh 2008&quot; /&gt;

Other types of [[explosion]]s, such as [[dust explosion|dust]] or [[BLEVE|vapor]] explosions, do not cause craters or even have definitive blast seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=C.

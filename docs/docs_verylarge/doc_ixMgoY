'''Needlework''' is decorative [[sewing]] and [[textile arts]] [[handicraft]]s.  Anything that uses a [[Sewing needle|needle]] for construction can be called needlework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/needlework|title=Needlework|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needlework may include related textile crafts such as [[crochet]], worked with a [[crochet hook|hook]], or [[tatting]], worked with a shuttle.

Similar abilities often transfer well between different varieties of needlework, such as [[fine motor skill]] and knowledge of [[textile]] [[fibers]].  Some of the same tools may be used in several different varieties of needlework.

According to the ''Ladies' Needlework Penny Magazine'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many women who persuade themselves that the occupations particularly allotted to their sex are extremely frivolous; but it is one of the common errors of a depraved taste to confound simplicity with frivolity. The use of the needle is simple, but not frivolous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Woman's embroidered boots 1885.jpg|thumb|Embroidered boots, 1885]]

Needlework was an important fact of women's identity during the [[Victorian age]], including [[embroidery]], [[Net (textile)|netting]], [[knitting]], [[crochet]], and [[Berlin wool work]]. A growing middle class had more leisure time than ever before; printed materials offered homemakers thousands of patterns. Women were still limited to roles in the household, and under the standards of the time a woman working on needle work while entertaining the parlor was considered beautiful. According to one publication from 1843: &quot;Never is beauty and feminine grace so attractive as, when engaged in the honorable discharge of household duties, and domestic cares.&quot;&lt;ref name=victorian&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ledbetter |first1=Kathryn |title=Victorian Needlework |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fancy work]] was distinguished from plain [[sewing]] and it was a mark of a prosperous and well-managed home to display handmade needlework. While plain sewing was often handed over to servants, even in middle class households, fancy work would often be done while entertaining guests, in the afternoons, evenings, or on Sundays. The types of goods that could be decorated with needlework techniques was limited only be the imagination: knitted boots, embroidered book covers, footstools, lampshades, sofa cushions, fans and on and on.&lt;ref name=victorian/&gt;

'''Cultural bias''' is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]]. Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.

Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, [[linguistics|linguistic]] and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.

==Cultural bias by discipline==
=== Psychology ===
Cultural bias has no a priori definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Whites]]), ethnic (e.g., [[Latinos]]/Latinas, [[English people|Anglos]]), or national groups (e.g., U.S. [[Americans]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between‐group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of [[African American]] and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their [[White American]] counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across these groups. Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Helms|first=Janet|editor1-last=Weiner|editor1-first=I. B.|editor2-last=Craighead|editor2-first=W. E.|date=January 30, 2010|encyclopedia=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|publisher=Wiley Online Library, American Cancer Society|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244|isbn = 9780470479216|chapter = Cultural Bias in Psychological Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural bias in [[psychological testing]] refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. However, the limitations they put forth, due to their particular culture-friendliness, has been realized much later. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. The problem lies not with the test-taker, but with the test itself. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychologenie.com/understanding-cultural-bias-with-examples|title=Understanding the Phenomena of Cultural Bias With Examples|last=PsycholoGenie|date=2015-05-30|website=psychologenie.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2019}}

===Economics===
Cultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1095 |title = Cultural Biases in Economic Exchange?|journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume = 124|issue = 3|pages = 1095–1131|year = 2009|last1 = Guiso|first1 = Luigi|last2 = Sapienza|first2 = Paola|last3 = Zingales|first3 = Luigi|hdl = 1814/7496|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/cultural_biases.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. This study suggests that low bilateral trust between two countries will result in less trade, less [[portfolio investment]], and less [[direct investment]]. This effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust intensive.

===Anthropology===
The concept of [[culture theory]] in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.

===Sociology===
It is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias as it is dependent on the group's standing in society, where the [[social construction]]s affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the [[University of California]] by Jane R. Mercer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercer|first1=Jane R. |title=Test &quot;validity&quot;, &quot;bias&quot;, and &quot;fairness&quot;: An analysis from the perspective of the sociology of knowledge|journal=Interchange|date=March 1978|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF01807733}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how test &quot;validity&quot;, &quot;bias&quot;, and &quot;fairness&quot; in different cultural belief systems affect one's future in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as &quot;the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group&quot;, which leads to a belief that &quot;the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups&quot;. In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. This idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test will represent the ability of a population as intended and will not reflect the abilities of a group that is not represented.

===History===
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship, when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian's own era are [[anachronism|anachronistically]] used to report and assess events of the past. This tendency is sometimes known as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David H. |last=Fischer |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |title=Historians' Fallacies: toward a logic of historical thought |url=https://archive.org/details/historiansfallac00fisc |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1970 |isbn=978-0061315459 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historiansfallac00fisc/page/137 137–9] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that &quot;a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know&quot; is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that &quot;anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-333-96447-7 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bipolar junction transistor''' ('''BJT''') is a type of [[transistor]] that uses both [[electron]]s and [[electron hole]]s as [[charge carrier]]s. In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a [[field-effect transistor]], use only one kind of charge carrier. A bipolar transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals to control a much larger current flowing between two other terminals, making the device capable of amplification or switching. 

BJTs use two junctions between two [[semiconductor]] types, n-type and p-type, which are regions in a single crystal of material. The junctions can be made in several different ways, such as changing the [[Doping (semiconductors)|doping]] of the semiconductor material as it is grown, by depositing metal pellets to form alloy junctions, or by such methods as diffusion of n -type and p-type doping substances into the crystal. The superior predictability and performance of junction transistors soon displaced the original [[point-contact transistor]]. Diffused transistors, along with other components, are elements of [[integrated circuit]]s for analog and digital functions.  Hundreds of bipolar junction transistors can be made in one circuit at very low cost. 

Bipolar transistor integrated circuits were the main active devices of a generation of mainframe and mini computers, but most computer systems now use integrated circuits relying on [[field effect transistor]]s. Bipolar transistors are still used for amplification of signals, switching, and in digital circuits. Specialized types are used for high voltage switches, for radio-frequency amplifiers, or for switching heavy currents.

==Current direction conventions==
By convention, the direction of current on diagrams is shown as the direction that a positive charge would move.  This is called ''conventional current''.  However, current in many metal conductors is due to the flow of electrons. Because electrons carry a negative charge, they move in the direction opposite to conventional current.{{efn|Some metals, such as [[aluminium]] have significant hole bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashcroftandmermin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|isbn=978-0030839931|pages=[https://archive.org/details/solidstatephysic00ashc/page/299 299–302]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/solidstatephysic00ashc/page/299}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor, currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons.  In this article, current arrows are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside the transistor.  The arrow on the symbol for bipolar transistors indicates the PN junction between base and emitter and points in the direction in which conventional current travels.

==Function==
{{Technical|section|date=July 2012}}

BJTs exist as PNP and NPN types, based on the [[Doping (semiconductors)|doping]] types of the three main terminal regions.  An NPN transistor comprises two [[P&amp;ndash;n junction|semiconductor junctions]] that share a thin p-doped region, and a PNP transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin n-doped region. N-type means doped with impurities that provide mobile electrons, while P-type means doped with impurities that provide holes that readily accept electrons. 

[[Image:NPN BJT Basic Operation (Active) jP.svg|thumb|942x942px|NPN BJT with forward-biased E–B junction and reverse-biased B–C junction|center]]

Charge flow in a BJT is due to [[diffusion]] of [[Charge carriers in semiconductors|charge carriers]] across a junction between two regions of different charge carrier concentration. The regions of a BJT are called ''emitter'', ''base'', and ''collector''.{{efn|See [[point-contact transistor]] for the historical origin of these names.}} A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, and the collector is doped more lightly than the base (collector doping is typically ten times lighter than base doping &lt;ref name= &quot;hu&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Chenming Calvin Hu | title = Modern Semiconductor Devices for Integrated Circuits | year = 2010 | url = http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hu/Book-Chapters-and-Lecture-Slides-download.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;). By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charge carriers (electrons or holes) injected from a heavily doped emitter into the base where they are [[minority carrier]]s that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.

In typical operation, the base–emitter [[p-n junction|junction]] is [[p-n junction#Forward bias|forward-biased]], which means that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is [[p-n junction#Reverse bias|reverse-biased]]. When forward bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium between the thermally generated [[charge carrier|carriers]] and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter [[depletion region]] is disturbed. This allows thermally excited electrons (in an NPN; holes in a PNP) to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter toward the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called ''[[minority carrier]]s'' because the base is doped p-type, which makes [[Electron hole|holes]] the ''[[majority carrier]]'' in the base. In a PNP device, analogous behaviour occurs, but with holes as the dominant current carriers.

To minimize the fraction of carriers that [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority-carrier lifetime. Having a lightly doped base ensures recombination rates are low. In particular, the thickness of the base must be much less than the [[Fick's law#Example solution in one dimension: diffusion length|diffusion length]] of the electrons. The collector–base junction is reverse-biased, and so negligible electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but carriers that are injected into the base and diffuse to reach the collector-base depletion region are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region. The thin ''shared'' base and asymmetric collector–emitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two ''separate'' and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.

===Voltage, current, and charge control===
The collector–emitter current can be viewed as being controlled by the base–emitter current (current control), or by the base–emitter voltage (voltage control). These views are related by the current–voltage relation of the base–emitter junction, which is the usual exponential current–voltage curve of a [[p–n junction]] (diode).&lt;ref name= &quot;hh&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Paul Horowitz]] and [[Winfield Hill]] | title = The Art of Electronics | edition = 2nd | year = 1989 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-37095-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;q=bjt+charge+current+voltage+control+inauthor:horowitz+inauthor:hill&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation for collector current is the concentration gradient of minority carriers in the base region.&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Semiconductor Device Physics and Simulation | author = Juin Jei Liou and Jiann S. Yuan | publisher = Springer | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-306-45724-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y343FTN1TU0C&amp;q=charge-controlled+bjt+physics&amp;pg=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Transistor Manual | author = General Electric | edition = 6th | year = 1962 | page = 12| bibcode = 1964trma.book.....C }} &quot;If the principle of space charge neutrality is used in the analysis of the transistor, it is evident that the collector current is controlled by means of the positive charge (hole concentration) in the base region. ... When a transistor is used at higher frequencies, the fundamental limitation is the time it takes the carriers to diffuse across the base region...&quot; (same in 4th and 5th editions).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[low-level injection]] (in which there are much fewer excess carriers than normal majority carriers) the [[ambipolar diffusion|ambipolar transport]] rates (in which the excess majority and minority carriers flow at the same rate) is in effect determined by the excess minority carriers.

Detailed [[transistor models]] of transistor action, such as the [[Gummel–Poon model]], account for the distribution of this charge explicitly to explain transistor behaviour more exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Semiconductor Device Modeling with Spice | author = Paolo Antognetti and Giuseppe Massobrio | publisher = McGraw&amp;ndash;Hill Professional | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-07-134955-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IBYU9xrGaIC&amp;q=gummel-poon+charge+model&amp;pg=PA96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge-control view easily handles [[phototransistor]]s, where minority carriers in the base region are created by the absorption of [[photon]]s, and handles the dynamics of turn-off, or recovery time, which depends on charge in the base region recombining. However, because base charge is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.

In [[analog circuit]] design, the current-control view is sometimes used because it is approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately &lt;math&gt;\beta_\text{F}&lt;/math&gt; times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the base-emitter voltage is approximately constant and that collector current is β times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, [[Ebers–Moll model|Ebers–Moll]]) model is required.&lt;ref name=hh/&gt; The voltage-control model requires an exponential function to be taken into account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the [[Ebers–Moll model]], design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For [[translinear circuit]]s, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose [[transconductance]] is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit analysis is performed using [[SPICE]] or a comparable analog-circuit simulator, so mathematical model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer, but a simplified view of the characteristics allows designs to be created following a logical process.

===Turn-on, turn-off, and storage delay===
{{Main|Baker clamp}}
Bipolar transistors, and particularly power transistors, have long base-storage times when they are driven into saturation; the base storage limits turn-off time in switching applications. A [[Baker clamp]] can prevent the transistor from heavily saturating, which reduces the amount of charge stored in the base and thus improves switching time.&lt;!-- at a cost of increased V&lt;sub&gt;CE,sat&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt;

===&lt;span id=&quot;AlphaBeta&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Transistor characteristics: alpha ({{mvar|α}}) and beta ({{mvar|β}}) {{Anchor|Alpha|Beta}}===
The proportion of carriers able to cross the base and reach the collector is a measure of the BJT efficiency. The heavy doping of the emitter region and light doping of the base region causes many more electrons to be injected from the emitter into the base than holes to be injected from the base into the emitter. A thin and lightly-doped base region means that most of the minority carriers that are injected into the base will diffuse to the collector and not recombine.

The ''[[common-emitter]] current gain'' is represented by {{mvar|β}}&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[Two-port network#h-parameters|{{mvar|h}}-parameter]] {{mvar|h}}&lt;sub&gt;FE&lt;/sub&gt;; it is approximately the ratio of the DC collector current to the DC base current in forward-active region. It is typically greater than 50 for small-signal transistors, but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications. Both injection efficiency and recombination in the base reduce the BJT gain.

Another useful characteristic is the ''[[common-base]] current gain'', {{mvar|α}}&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. The common-base current gain is approximately the gain of current from emitter to collector in the forward-active region. This ratio usually has a value close to unity; between 0.980 and 0.998. It is less than unity due to [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination of charge carriers]] as they cross the base region.

Alpha and beta are related by the following identities:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \alpha_\text{F} &amp;= \frac{I_\text{C}}{I_\text{E}}, &amp; \beta_\text{F} &amp;= \frac{I_\text{C}}{I_\text{B}}, \\
  \alpha_\text{F} &amp;= \frac{\beta_\text{F}}{1 + \beta_\text{F}} &amp; \iff \beta_\text{F} &amp;= \frac{\alpha_\text{F}}{1 - \alpha_\text{F}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Beta is a convenient figure of merit to describe the performance of a bipolar transistor, but is not a fundamental physical property of the device. Bipolar transistors can be considered voltage-controlled devices (fundamentally the collector current is controlled by the base-emitter voltage; the base current could be considered a defect and is controlled by the characteristics of the base-emitter junction and recombination in the base). In many designs beta is assumed high enough so that base current has a negligible effect on the circuit. In some circuits (generally switching circuits), sufficient base current is supplied so that even the lowest beta value a particular device may have will still allow the required collector current to flow.

A BJT consists of three differently [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] semiconductor regions: the ''emitter'' region, the ''base'' region and the ''collector'' region. These regions are, respectively, ''p'' type, ''n'' type and ''p'' type in a PNP transistor, and ''n'' type, ''p'' type and ''n'' type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: ''emitter'' (E), ''base'' (B) and ''collector'' (C).

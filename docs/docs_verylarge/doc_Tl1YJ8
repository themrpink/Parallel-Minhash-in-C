[[Image:Yosemite 20 bg 090404.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Half Dome]], a granite monolith in [[Yosemite National Park]] and part of the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]]]]
A '''batholith''' (from Greek ''bathos'', depth + ''lithos'', rock) is a large mass of [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] [[igneous rock]] (also called [[plutonic]] rock), larger than {{Convert|100|km2|sigfig=1}} in area,&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersenEtAl2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Physical Geography | publisher=Cengage Learning Inc. | first1=James F. | last1=Petersen | first2=Dorothy | last2=Sack | first3=Robert E. | last3=Gabler | year=2017 | location=Boston | pages=614 | isbn=978-1-305-65264-4| edition=11th }}&lt;/ref&gt;  that forms from cooled [[magma]] deep in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Batholiths are almost always made mostly of [[felsic]] or [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] rock types, such as [[granite]], [[quartz monzonite]], or [[diorite]] (see also ''[[granite dome]]'').

Note:  As a general rule, in contrast to the active volcanic vent in the figure, these names refer to the fully cooled and usually millions-of-years-old rock formations, which are the result of the underground magmatic activity shown.]]

==Formation==
Although they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or ''[[pluton]]s'', bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of [[partial melting]] near the base of the Earth's crust.

[[File:Vitosha platoto.jpg|thumb|The eroded laccolith above the batholith system of [[Vitosha]] - [[Plana (mountain)|Plana]] domed mountains, next to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Traditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] magma in large masses called ''plutonic [[diapir]]s''. Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]], pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form [[volcano]]es, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word ''pluton''; in reference to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of the underworld [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]]). An alternate view is that plutons commonly are formed not by ascent of large magma diapirs, but rather by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Clarence A., Jr.|title=Introduction to the geology of southern California and its native plants|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520249325|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present [[Subduction|subduction zones]] and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in [[continental crust]]. One such batholith is the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]], which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]. An even larger batholith, the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], is found predominantly in the [[Coast Mountains]] of western [[Canada]]; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern [[Alaska]].

==Surface expression and erosion==
A batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called ''[[Stock (geology)|stocks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;GLENCOE SCIENCE | Earth Science Twelfth Grade High School Textbook (Georgia); pg. 115 paragraph 1, pg. 521 question 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of [[erosion]] accelerated by [[Orogeny|continental uplift]] acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.

Batholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their [[crystal structure]] expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of [[mass wasting]] called [[exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]]. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by [[Weathering#Frost weathering|frost wedging]]). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is [[Half Dome]] in [[Yosemite Valley]].

A '''castle''' is a type of [[fortification|fortified]] structure built during the [[Middle Ages]] predominantly by the [[nobility]] or royalty and by [[Military order (monastic society)|military orders]]. Scholars debate the scope of the word ''castle'', but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a [[palace]], which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence&amp;nbsp;– though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as [[hill fort]]s and country houses. Over the approximately 900&amp;nbsp;years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]s, [[arrowslit]]s, and portcullises, were commonplace.

European-style castles originated in the 9th&amp;nbsp;and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, after the fall of the [[Carolingian Empire]] resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.

Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by [[stonemasonry|stone]]. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central [[keep]]. In the late 12th&amp;nbsp;and early 13th&amp;nbsp;centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on [[Enfilade and defilade|flanking fire]]. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence&amp;nbsp;– several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the [[Crusades]], such as [[Concentric castle|concentric fortification]], and inspiration from earlier defences, such as [[castra|Roman forts]]. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as [[moat]]s evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.

Although [[gunpowder]] was introduced to Europe in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&amp;nbsp;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a [[romanticism|romantic]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|revival of Gothic architecture]], but they had no military purpose.

==Definition==

===Etymology===
[[File:Tower of London viewed from the River Thames.jpg|thumb|alt=A keep seen from a river, rising behind a gate. The keep is large, square in plan, and has four corner towers, three square and one round, all topped by lead cupolas.|The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] &quot;White Tower&quot;, the [[keep]] of the [[Tower of London]], exemplifies all uses of a castle including city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.]]

The word ''castle'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''castellum'', which is a [[diminutive]] of the word ''[[castrum]]'', meaning &quot;fortified place&quot;. The [[Old English]] ''castel'', [[Old French]] ''castel'' or ''chastel'', French ''[[château]]'', Spanish ''castillo'', Portuguese ''castelo'', Italian ''castello'', and a number of words in other languages also derive from ''castellum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Creighton|Higham|2003|p=6|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8A1_Z1DTgYYC&amp;pg=PA6 chpt 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''castle'' was introduced into English shortly before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] to denote this type of building, which was then new to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining characteristics===
In its simplest terms, the definition of a castle accepted amongst academics is &quot;a private fortified residence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulson 16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Coulson|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[burh]]s and [[Defensive wall|walled cities]] such as [[Constantinople]] and [[Antioch]] in the Middle East; castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local [[feudalism|feudal]] lords, either for themselves or for their monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feudalism was the link between a lord and his [[vassal]] where, in return for military service and the expectation of loyalty, the lord would grant the vassal land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herlihy|1970|p=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th&amp;nbsp;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal ownership, thus tying castles to the medieval period; however, this does not necessarily reflect the terminology used in the medieval period. During the [[First Crusade]] (1096–1099), the [[Franks|Frankish]] armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately referred to as castles, but which would not be considered as such under the modern definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulson 16&quot;/&gt;

Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a [[Headquarters|base of operations]] in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friar|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36&amp;nbsp;castles such as [[Warwick Castle]], which he used to guard against rebellion in the [[English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liddiard|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1969|pp=452–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy 23-25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|1979|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=2, 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1983|pp=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by [[country house]]s as high status residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
''Castle'' is sometimes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of [[fortification]]s and, as a result, has been misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]] which, despite the name, is an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] which had a very different origin and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Creighton|Higham|2003|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although &quot;castle&quot; has not become a generic term for a [[manor house]] (like [[château]] in French and [[Schloss]] in German), many manor houses contain &quot;castle&quot; in their name while having few if any of the architectural characteristics, usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term &quot;castle&quot; was a masculine expression of their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1987|pp=1–2, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scholarship the castle, as defined above, is generally accepted as a coherent concept, originating in Europe and later spreading to parts of the Middle East, where they were introduced by European Crusaders. This coherent group shared a common origin, dealt with a particular mode of warfare, and exchanged influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1976|pp=2–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In different areas of the world, analogous structures shared features of fortification and other defining characteristics associated with the concept of a castle, though they originated in different periods and circumstances and experienced differing evolutions and influences. For example, [[Japanese castles|''shiro'']] in Japan, described as castles by historian [[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]], underwent &quot;a completely different developmental history, were built in a completely different way and were designed to withstand attacks of a completely different nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While European castles built from the late 12th and early 13th&amp;nbsp;century onwards were generally stone, ''shiro'' were predominantly timber buildings into the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, when Japanese and European cultures met, fortification in Europe had moved beyond castles and relied on innovations such as the Italian ''trace italienne'' and [[star fort]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull5&quot;/&gt; [[Forts in India]] present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, castles in Europe had generally fallen out of use militarily. Like ''shiro'', the Indian forts, ''durga'' or ''durg'' in [[Sanskrit]], shared features with castles in Europe such as acting as a domicile for a lord as well as being fortifications. They too developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their origins in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nossov|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules for attendees==
===Removing one's shoes===
In [[Yemen]], the Jewish custom was to remove one's shoes immediately prior to entering the synagogue, a custom that had been observed by Jews in other places in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih|Joseph Kafih]], ''Jewish Life in Sanà'', [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 1982, p. 64 (note 3) {{ISBN|965-17-0137-4}}. There, Rabbi Kafih recalls the following story in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Baba Metzi'a'' 2:8): &quot;Yehudah, the son of [[Judah ha-Nasi|Rebbe]], entered a synagogue and left his sandals [outside], and they were stolen. He then said, 'Had I not gone to the synagogue, my sandals would not have gone-off.'&quot; The custom of never entering a synagogue while wearing one's shoes is also mentioned in the [[Cairo Geniza]] manuscripts: &quot;While he is yet outside, let him take-off his shoes or sandals from his feet and then enter barefoot, since such is the way of servants to walk barefoot before their lords... We have a minor sanctuary, and we are required to behave with sanctity and fear [in it], as it says: ''And you shall fear my hallowed place''.&quot; (v. ''Halakhot Eretz Yisrael min ha-Geniza'' [''The Halacha of the Land of Israel from the Geniza''], ed. Mordechai Margaliot, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1973, pp. 131–132; Taylor-Schechter New Series 135, [[Cambridge University Library]] / Oxford MS. 2700).&lt;/ref&gt; The same practice of removing one's shoes before entering the synagogue was also largely observed among Jews in [[Morocco]] in the early 20th-century. On the island of [[Djerba]] in [[Tunisia]], Jews still remove their shoes when entering a synagogue. Today, the custom of removing one's shoes is no longer practiced in Israel.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Gender separation===
{{main|mechitza}}
In Orthodox synagogues, men and women do not sit together. The synagogue features a partition ({{lang|he-Latn|[[mechitza]]}}) dividing the men's and women's seating areas, or a separate women's section located on a balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/mehitzah-separate-seating-in-the-synagogue/|title=Mechitzah: Separate Seating in the Synagogue|website=My Jewish Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denominational differences==
===Reform Judaism===
[[File:Congregation_Emanu-El_of_the_City_New_York.jpg|thumb|[[Congregation Emanu-El of New York]]]]
The German–Jewish Reform movement, which arose in the early 19th century, made many changes to the traditional look of the synagogue, keeping with its desire to simultaneously stay Jewish yet be accepted by the surrounding culture.

The [[Hamburg Temple|first Reform synagogue]], which opened in [[Hamburg]] in 1811, introduced changes that made the synagogue look more like a church. These included: the installation of an [[Organ (music)|organ]] to accompany the prayers (even on [[Shabbat]], when musical instruments are proscribed by [[halakha]]), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Ken Spiro. [http://www.aish.com/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_54_-_Reform_Movement.asp &quot;Crash Course in Jewish History Part 54 - Reform Movement&quot;], Aish.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In following decades, the central reader's table, the [[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]], was moved to the front of the Reform sanctuary—previously unheard-of in Orthodox synagogues.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Gender separation was also removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Synagogue as community center==
Synagogues often take on a broader role in modern Jewish communities and may include additional facilities such as a catering hall, kosher kitchen, [[religious school]], [[library]], [[day care center]] and a smaller chapel for daily services.

==Synagogue offshoots==
Since many Orthodox and some non-Orthodox Jews prefer to collect a minyan (a quorum of ten) rather than pray alone, they commonly assemble at pre-arranged times in offices, living rooms, or other spaces when these are more convenient than formal synagogue buildings. A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called {{lang|yi-Latn|[[shtiebel]]}} ({{lang|yi|שטיבל}}, pl. {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebelekh}} or {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebels}}, Yiddish for &quot;little house&quot;), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.

Another type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the ''[[chavurah]]'' ({{lang|he|חבורה}}, pl. ''chavurot'', {{lang|he|חבורות}}), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the [[Pharisees]] lived near each other in ''chavurot'' and dined together to ensure that none of the food was unfit for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan F. Segal]], ''Rebecca's Children: Judaism and Christianity in the Roman World'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1986, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The oldest [[Samaritan]] synagogue, the [[Delos Synagogue]], dates from between 150 and 128&amp;nbsp;BCE, or earlier and is located on the island of [[Delos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/delos.html |title=Delos}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}
* The [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue of Dura Europos]], a Seleucid city in north eastern Syria, dates from the third century CE. It is unique.

The synagogue chamber, with its surviving paintings, is reconstructed in the National Museum in Damascus.
* The [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]] in [[Erfurt]], Germany, parts of which date to c.1100, is the oldest intact synagogue building in Europe. It is now used as a museum of local Jewish history.
* The [[Paradesi Synagogue]] is the oldest synagogue in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], located in Kochi, [[Kerala]], in India. It was built in 1568 by the Malabar Yehudan people or [[Cochin Jews|Cochin Jewish]] community in the Kingdom of Cochin. Paradesi is a word used in several Indian languages, and the literal meaning of the term is &quot;foreigners&quot;, applied to the synagogue because it was historically used by &quot;White Jews&quot;, a mixture of Jews from Cranganore, the Middle East, and European exiles. It is also referred to as the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or the Mattancherry Synagogue. The synagogue is located in the quarter of Old Cochin known as Jew Town and is the only one of the seven synagogues in the area still in use.
* [[Jew's Court]], Steep Hill, [[Lincoln, England]], is arguably the oldest synagogue in Europe in current use.

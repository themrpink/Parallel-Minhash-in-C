From the mid-9th century, following a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|Slavic revolt and attack]] on [[Patras]], a determined [[Hellenization]] process was carried out. According to the ''[[Chronicle of Monemvasia]]'', in 805 the Byzantine governor of [[Corinth]] went to war with the Slavs, exterminated them, and allowed the original inhabitants to claim their lands. They regained control of the city of Patras and the region was re-settled with Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), pp. 80, 82&lt;/ref&gt; Many Slavs were transported to [[Asia Minor]], and many Asian, Sicilian and Calabrian Greeks were resettled in the Peloponnese. By the turn of the 9th century, the entire Peloponnese was formed into the new ''thema'' of [[Peloponnesos (theme)|Peloponnesos]], with its capital at Corinth.&lt;ref name=&quot; Fine61&quot;/&gt;

The imposition of Byzantine rule over the Slavic enclaves may have largely been a process of Christianization and accommodating Slavic chieftains into the Imperial fold, as literary, [[epigraphic]] and [[sigillographic]] evidence testify to Slavic ''archontes'' participating in Imperial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 9th century, the Peloponnese was culturally and administratively Greek again,&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; except for a few small Slavic tribes in the mountains such as the [[Melingoi]] and [[Ezeritai]]. Although they were to remain relatively autonomous until [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times, such tribes were the exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Melingoi and Ezeritai, however, could speak Greek and appear to have been Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the Hellenization campaign also shows that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017-human genetics study showed that the Peloponnesians have little admixture with populations of the Slavic homeland and are much closer to Sicilians and southern Italians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stamatoyannopoulos, George]] et al., [http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ejhg201718a.html Genetics of the Peloponnesian populations and the theory of extinction of the medieval Peloponnesian Greeks], European Journal of Human Genetics, 25.5 (2017), pp. 637–645&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the troubled relations with the Slavs, the coastal regions of the Peloponnese suffered greatly from repeated Arab raids following the Arab capture of [[Crete]] in the 820s and the establishment of a [[Emirate of Crete|corsair emirate]] there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB1621&quot;&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; After the island was recovered by Byzantium in 961 however, the region entered a period of renewed prosperity, where agriculture, commerce, and urban industry flourished.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB1621&quot;/&gt;

====Frankish rule and Byzantine reconquest====

In 1205, following the destruction of the Byzantine Empire by the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Crusaders under [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] marched south through mainland Greece and conquered the Peloponnese against [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros|sporadic local Greek resistance]]. The [[Frangokratia|Franks]] then founded the [[Principality of Achaea]], nominally a [[vassal]] of the [[Latin Empire]], while the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] occupied several strategically important ports around the coast such as [[Pylos|Navarino]] and [[Koroni|Coron]], which they retained into the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 11, 1621, 2158&lt;/ref&gt; The Franks popularized the name ''[[Morea]]'' for the peninsula, which first appears as the name of a small bishopric in [[Elis]] during the 10th century. Its etymology is disputed, but it is most commonly held to be derived from the mulberry tree (''morea''), whose leaves are similar in shape to the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1409&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankish supremacy in the peninsula, however, received a critical blow after the [[Battle of Pelagonia]], when [[William II of Villehardouin]] was forced to cede the newly constructed fortress and palace at [[Mystras]] near ancient [[Sparta]] to a resurgent Byzantium. This Greek province (and later a semi-autonomous [[Despotate of the Morea|Despotate]]) staged a gradual reconquest, eventually conquering the Frankish principality by 1430.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 11, 1621&lt;/ref&gt; The same period was also marked by the migration and settlement of the [[Arvanites]] to [[Central Greece]] and the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;Obolensky (1971), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Turks]] began raiding the Peloponnese from c. 1358, but their raids intensified only after 1387 when the energetic [[Evrenos Bey]] took control. Exploiting the quarrels between Byzantines and Franks, he plundered across the peninsula and forced both the Byzantine despots and the remaining Frankish rulers to acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty and pay tribute. This situation lasted until the Ottoman defeat at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, after which Ottoman power was for a time checked.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-237&quot;&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman incursions into the Morea resumed under [[Turahan Bey]] after 1423. Despite the reconstruction of the [[Hexamilion wall]] at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Ottomans under [[Murad II]] breached it in 1446, forcing the Despots of the Morea to re-acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty, and again under Turahan in 1452 and 1456. Following the occupation of the [[Duchy of Athens]] in 1456, the Ottomans occupied a third of the Peloponnese in 1458, and Sultan [[Mehmed II]] extinguished the remnants of the Despotate in 1460. The last Byzantine stronghold, [[Salmeniko Castle]], under its commander [[Graitzas Palaiologos]], held out until July 1461.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-237&quot;/&gt; Only the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fortresses of [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], [[Koroni|Coron]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], [[Monemvasia]], [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] and [[Nauplion]] escaped Ottoman control.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-237&quot;/&gt;

===Ottoman conquest, Venetian interlude and Ottoman reconquest===
{{See also|Ottoman Greece|Morea Eyalet|Morean War|Kingdom of the Morea}}
The Venetian fortresses were conquered in a series of [[Ottoman-Venetian Wars]]: the [[Ottoman-Venetian War (1463-1479)|first war]], lasting from 1463 to 1479, saw much fighting in the Peloponnese, resulting in the loss of [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], while [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]] and [[Koroni|Coron]] fell in 1500 during the [[Ottoman-Venetian War (1499-1503)|second war]]. [[Koroni|Coron]] and [[Patras]] were captured in a crusading expedition in 1532, led by the Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]], but this provoked [[Ottoman-Venetian War (1537-1540)|another war]] in which the last Venetian possessions on the Greek mainland were lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-239&quot;&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Ottoman conquest, the peninsula was made into a province (''[[sanjak]]''), with 109 ''[[ziamet]]s'' and 342 ''[[timar]]s''. During the first period of Ottoman rule (1460-1687), the capital was first in Corinth (Turk. ''Gördes''), later in [[Leontari, Arcadia|Leontari]] (''Londari''), [[Mystras]] (''Misistire'') and finally in Nauplion (Tr. ''Anaboli''). Sometime in the mid-17th century, the Morea became the centre of a separate ''[[eyalet]]'', with [[Patras]] (''Ballibadra'') as its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-238&quot;&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Provinzen&quot;&gt;Birken (1976), pp. 57, 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Until the death of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1570, the Christian population (counted at some 42,000 families c. 1550&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-239&quot;/&gt;) managed to retain some privileges and Islamization was slow, mostly among the Albanians or the estate owners who were integrated into the Ottoman feudal system.

Although they quickly came to control most of the fertile lands, Muslims remained a distinct minority. Christian communities retained a large measure of self-government, but the entire Ottoman period was marked by a flight of the Christian population from the plains to the mountains. This occasioned the rise of the ''[[klepht]]''s, armed brigands and rebels, in the mountains, as well as the corresponding institution of the government-funded ''[[armatoloi]]'' to check the ''klephts''{{'}} activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-238&quot;/&gt;

With the outbreak of the &quot;[[Great Turkish War]]&quot; in 1683, the Venetians under [[Francesco Morosini]] [[Morean War|occupied the entire peninsula]] by 1687, and received recognition by the Ottomans in the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699).&lt;ref&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), pp. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetians established their province as the &quot;[[Kingdom of the Morea]]&quot; (It. ''Regno di Morea''), but their rule proved unpopular, and when the Ottomans [[Ottoman-Venetian War (1714-1718)|invaded the peninsula]] in 1715, most local Greeks welcomed them. The Ottoman reconquest was easy and swift, and was recognized by Venice in the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-240&quot;&gt;Bées &amp; Savvides (1993), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peloponnese now became the core of the [[Morea Eyalet]], headed by the ''Mora valesi'', who until 1780 was a [[pasha]] of the first rank (with three [[tugh|horsetails]]) and held the title of [[vizier]]. After 1780 and until the [[Greek War of Independence]], the province was headed by a ''[[muhassil]]''. The pasha of the Morea was aided by several subordinate officials, including a Christian translator (''[[dragoman]]''), who was the senior Christian official of the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-240&quot;/&gt; As during the first Ottoman period, the Morea was divided into 22 districts or [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-240&quot;/&gt; The capital was first at Nauplion, but after 1786 at [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitza]] (Tr. ''Trabliçe'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2-238&quot;/&gt;

The Moreot Christians rose against the Ottomans with Russian aid during the so-called &quot;[[Orlov Revolt]]&quot; of 1770, but it was swiftly and brutally suppressed. As a result, the total population decreased during this time, while the Muslim element in it increased. Nevertheless, through the privileges granted with the [[Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]], especially the right for the Christians to trade under the Russian flag, led to a considerable economic flowering of the local Greeks, which, coupled with the increased cultural contacts with Western Europe ([[Modern Greek Enlightenment]]) and the inspiring ideals of the [[French Revolution]], laid the groundwork for the [[Greek War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot; EI2-240&quot;/&gt;

The Peloponnesians played a major role in the [[Greek War of Independence]] – the war began in the Peloponnese, when rebels took control of [[Kalamata]] on March 23, 1821. The Greek insurgents made rapid progress and the entire peninsula was under Greek control within a few months, except for a few coastal forts and the main Turkish garrison at [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clogg2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Clogg|title=A Concise History of Greece|pages=35–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5pyUIY4THYC|date=20 June 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00479-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fighting was fierce and marked by atrocities on both sides; eventually the entire Muslim population was either massacred or fled to the forts.  The [[Siege of Tripolitsa|capture]] of Tripolitsa in September 1821 marked a turning point. Rivalries among the insurgents eventually erupted into civil war in 1824, which enabled the Ottoman Egyptian vassal [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to land in the peninsula in 1825.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clogg2002&quot;/&gt;

The Peloponnese peninsula was the scene of fierce fighting and extensive devastation following the arrival of Ibrahim's Egyptian troops. Partly as a result of the atrocities committed by Ibrahim, the UK, France, and the Russian Empire decided to intervene in favor of the Greeks.  The decisive naval [[Battle of Navarino]] was fought in 1827 off Pylos on the west coast of the Peloponnese, where a combined British, French and Russian fleet decisively defeated the Turko-Egyptian fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clogg2002&quot;/&gt;  Subsequently, a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary corps]] cleared the last Turko-Egyptian forces from the peninsula in 1828. The city of Nafplion, on the east coast of the peninsula, became the first capital of the [[First Hellenic Republic|independent Greek state]].

During the 19th and early 20th century, the region became relatively poor and economically isolated. A significant part of its population emigrated to the larger cities of Greece, especially [[Athens]], and other countries such as the United States and Australia. It was badly affected by the Second World War and [[Greek Civil War]], experiencing some of the worst atrocities committed in Greece during those conflicts. Living standards improved dramatically throughout Greece after the country accedes to the [[European Union]] in 1981.

In late August 2007, large parts of Peloponnese [[2007 Greek forest fires|suffered from wildfires]], which caused severe damage in villages and forests and the death of 77 people. The impact of the fires to the environment and economy of the region are still unknown. It is thought to be the largest environmental disaster in modern Greek history.

      <text bytes="108018" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Vector space with a notion of nearness}}In [[mathematics]], a '''topological vector space''' (also called a '''linear topological space''' and commonly abbreviated '''TVS''' or '''t.v.s.''') is one of the basic structures investigated in [[functional analysis]]. 
A topological vector space is a [[vector space]] (an [[Abstract algebra|algebraic]] structure) which is also a [[topological space]], the latter thereby admitting a notion of [[Continuous function|continuity]]. 
More specifically, its topological space has a [[Uniform space|uniform topological structure]], allowing a notion of [[uniform convergence]].

The elements of topological vector spaces are typically [[function (mathematics)|function]]s or [[Linear map|linear operators]] acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of [[Limit (mathematics)#Convergence and fixed point|convergence]] of sequences of functions.

[[Banach space]]s, [[Hilbert space]]s and [[Sobolev space]]s are well-known examples.

Unless stated otherwise, the underlying field of a topological vector space is assumed to be either the [[complex number]]s ℂ or the [[real number]]s ℝ.

== Motivation ==

;Normed spaces

Every [[normed vector space]] has a natural [[normed vector space#Topological structure|topological structure]]: the norm induces a [[metric space|metric]] and the metric induces a topology. 
This is a topological vector space because:
#The vector addition {{math|+ : ''X'' + ''X'' → ''X''}} is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the [[triangle inequality]] obeyed by the norm.
#The scalar multiplication {{math|· : 𝕂 × ''X'' → ''X''}}, where {{math|𝕂}} is the underlying scalar field of {{mvar|X}}, is jointly continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.

Thus all [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s are examples of topological vector spaces.

;Non-normed spaces

There are topological vector spaces whose topology is not induced by a norm, but are still of interest in analysis. 
Examples of such spaces are spaces of [[holomorphic function]]s on an open domain, spaces of [[infinitely differentiable function]]s, the [[Schwartz space]]s, and spaces of [[test function]]s and the spaces of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on them. 
These are all examples of [[Montel space]]s. 
An infinite-dimensional Montel space is never normable. 
The existence of a norm for a given topological vector space is characterized by [[Kolmogorov's normability criterion]].

A [[topological field]] is a topological vector space over each of its [[Field extension|subfields]]. 

== Definition ==

[[Image:Topological vector space illust.svg|right|thumb|A family of neighborhoods of the origin with the above two properties determines uniquely a topological vector space. The system of neighborhoods of any other point in the vector space is obtained by [[translation (mathematics)|translation]].]]

A '''topological vector space''' ('''TVS''') {{mvar|X}} is a [[vector space]] over a [[topological field]] {{math| 𝕂}} (most often the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers with their standard topologies) that is endowed with a [[topological space|topology]] such that vector addition {{math|+ : ''X'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} and scalar multiplication {{math|· : 𝕂 × ''X'' → ''X''}} are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous functions]] (where the domains of these functions are endowed with [[product topology|product topologies]]). Such a topology is called a '''vector topology''' or a '''TVS topology''' on {{mvar|X}}.

Every topological vector space is also a commutative [[topological group]] under addition. 

;Hausdorff assumption

A [[modem]] is similar to a transceiver in that it sends and receives a signal, but a modem uses modulation and demodulation. It modulates the signal being transmitted and demodulates the signal being received.

===Ethernet===
[[File:Ethernet-media-converter-transceiver-0a.jpg|thumb|[[100BASE-TX]] connected to a [[100BASE-FX]] transceiver]]
Transceivers are called [[Transmission medium|Medium]] Attachment Units ([[Medium Attachment Unit|MAU]]s) in [[IEEE 802.3]] documents and were widely used in [[10BASE2]] and [[10BASE5]] [[Ethernet]] networks. [[Fiber-optic]] [[gigabit Ethernet|gigabit]], [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]], [[40 Gigabit Ethernet]], and [[100 Gigabit Ethernet]] utilize [[GBIC]], [[SFP transceiver|SFP]], [[SFP+]], [[QSFP]], [[XFP]], [[XAUI]], [[CXP_(connector)|CXP]], and [[C Form-factor Pluggable|CFP]] transceiver systems.

==Regulation==
{{See also|Federal Communications Commission}}
Because transceivers are capable of broadcasting information over airwaves, they are required to adhere to various regulations.  In the United 
States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] oversees their use.  Transceivers must meet certain standards and capabilities depending on their intended use, and manufacturers must comply with these requirements.  However, transceivers can be modified by users to violate FCC regulations.  For instance, they might be used to broadcast on a frequency or channel that they should not have access to.  For this reason, the FCC monitors not only the production but also the use of these devices.

      <text bytes="1617" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], a '''transmission level point''' ('''TLP''') is a physical test point in an [[electronic circuit]], typically a transmission channel, where a test [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] may be inserted or measured.&lt;ref name=reeve&gt;Whitham R. Reeve (1992) ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook—Analog'',  IEEE Press, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, various parameters, such as the [[power (physics)|power]] of the signal, noise, or test tones inserted are specified or measured at the TLP.

The nominal transmission level at a TLP is a function of system design and is an expression of the design [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] or [[attenuation]] (loss).

[[Voice channel|Voice-channel]] transmission levels at test points are measured in [[dBm|decibel-milliwatts]] (dBm) at a [[frequency]] of ca. 1000 [[hertz]]. The dBm is an absolute level with respect to 1 mW. The TLP is thus characterized by the relation:&lt;ref name=reeve /&gt;

:TLP = dBm — dBm0

When the nominal signal power is 0 [[dBm]] at the TLP,  the test point is called a ''zero transmission level point'', or ''zero-dBm TLP''. In general, the term ''TLP'' is commonly used as if it were a unit, preceded by the nominal level for the test point. For example, the expression ''0 TLP'' refers to a ''0 dBm TLP''.  At a −16 TLP, the measured level of 0 dBm is +16 dBm0.

The level at a TLP where an [[end instrument]], such as a [[telephone]] set, is connected is usually specified as 0 dBm.

[[File:Transmission line animation3.gif|right|thumb|300px|Schematic of a wave moving rightward down a lossless two-wire transmission line. Black dots represent [[electron]]s, and the arrows show the [[electric field]].]]
[[Image:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|One of the most common types of transmission line, [[coaxial cable]]. ]]

In [[electrical engineering]], a '''transmission line''' is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct [[electromagnetic wave]]s in a contained manner. The term applies when the conductors are long enough that the [[wave]] nature of the transmission must be taken into account.  This applies especially to [[radio-frequency engineering]] because the short [[wavelength]]s means wave phenomena arise over very short distances (this can be as short as millimetres depending on frequency).  However, the [[Telegrapher's equations|theory of transmission lines]] was historically developed to explain phenomena on very long [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines, especially [[submarine telegraph cable]]s.

Transmission lines are used for purposes such as connecting [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]] and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] with their [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] (they are then called [[feed line]]s or feeders), distributing [[cable television]] signals, [[trunking|trunklines]] routing calls between telephone switching centres, computer network connections and high speed computer [[Bus (computing)|data buses]].  RF engineers commonly use short pieces of transmission line, usually in the form of printed [[planar transmission line]]s, arranged in certain patterns to build circuits such as [[distributed-element filter|filters]].  These circuits, known as [[distributed-element circuit]]s, are an alternative to traditional circuits using discrete [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s.

Ordinary electrical cables suffice to carry low frequency [[alternating current]] (AC)and [[audio signal]]s.  However, they cannot be used to carry currents in the [[radio frequency]] range above about 30&amp;nbsp;kHz, because the energy tends to radiate off the cable as [[radio wave]]s, causing power losses.  Radio frequency currents also tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as [[electrical connector|connectors]] and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source. These reflections act as bottlenecks, preventing the signal power from reaching the destination.  Transmission lines use specialized construction, and [[impedance matching]], to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses.  The distinguishing feature of most transmission lines is that they have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform ''[[Electrical impedance|impedance]]'', called the [[characteristic impedance]],to prevent reflections.  The higher the frequency of electromagnetic waves moving through a given cable or medium, the shorter the [[wavelength]] of the waves.  Transmission lines become necessary when the transmitted frequency's wavelength is sufficiently short that the length of the cable becomes a significant part of a wavelength.

At [[microwave]] frequencies and above, power losses in transmission lines become excessive, and [[waveguide]]s are used instead which function as &quot;pipes&quot; to confine and guide the electromagnetic waves. At even higher frequencies, in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]], [[infrared]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] ranges, waveguides in turn become lossy, and [[optics|optical]] methods, (such as lenses and mirrors), are used to guide electromagnetic waves.

==Overview==
Ordinary electrical cables suffice to carry low frequency [[alternating current]] (AC), such as [[mains power]], which reverses direction 100 to 120 times per second, and [[audio signal]]s.

==History==
Mathematical analysis of the behaviour of electrical transmission lines grew out of the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]], and [[Oliver Heaviside]]. In 1855 Lord Kelvin formulated a diffusion model of the current in a submarine cable. The model correctly predicted the poor performance of the 1858 trans-Atlantic [[Submarine communications cable|submarine telegraph cable]]. In 1885 Heaviside published the first papers that described his analysis of propagation in cables and the modern form of the [[telegrapher's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ernst |last1=Weber |first2=Frederik |last2=Nebeker |title=The Evolution of Electrical Engineering |publisher=IEEE Press |place=Piscataway, New Jersey |year=1994 |isbn=0-7803-1066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four terminal model==

[[Image:Transmission line symbols.svg|thumb|Variations on the [[electronic schematic|schematic]] [[electronic symbol]] for a transmission line.]]

For the purposes of analysis, an electrical transmission line can be modelled as a [[two-port network]] (also called a quadripole), as follows:

[[Image:Transmission line 4 port.svg]]

In the simplest case, the network is assumed to be linear (i.e. the [[complex number|complex]] voltage across either port is proportional to the complex current flowing into it when there are no reflections), and the two ports are assumed to be interchangeable.  If the transmission line is uniform along its length, then its behaviour is largely described by a single parameter called the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'', symbol Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is the ratio of the complex voltage of a given wave to the complex current of the same wave at any point on the line. Typical values of Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are 50 or 75 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s for a [[coaxial cable]], about 100 ohms for a twisted pair of wires, and about 300 ohms for a common type of untwisted pair used in radio transmission.

When sending power down a transmission line, it is usually desirable that as much power as possible will be absorbed by the load and as little as possible will be reflected back to the source.  This can be ensured by making the load impedance equal to Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in which case the transmission line is said to be ''[[impedance matching|matched]]''.

[[File:TransmissionLineDefinitions.svg|thumb|310px|A transmission line is drawn as two black wires. At a distance ''x'' into the line, there is current ''I(x)'' travelling through each wire, and there is a voltage difference ''V(x)'' between the wires. If the current and voltage come from a single wave (with no reflection), then ''V''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''I''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'' of the line.]]

Some of the power that is fed into a transmission line is lost because of its resistance.  This effect is called ''ohmic'' or ''resistive'' loss (see [[ohmic heating]]).  At high frequencies, another effect called ''dielectric loss'' becomes significant, adding to the losses caused by resistance.  Dielectric loss is caused when the insulating material inside the transmission line absorbs energy from the alternating electric field and converts it to [[heat]] (see [[dielectric heating]]). The transmission line is modelled with a resistance (R) and inductance (L) in series with a capacitance (C) and conductance (G) in parallel. The resistance and conductance contribute to the loss in a transmission line.

The total loss of power in a transmission line is often specified in [[decibels]] per [[metre]] (dB/m), and usually depends on the frequency of the signal.  The manufacturer often supplies a chart showing the loss in dB/m at a range of frequencies.  A loss of 3&amp;nbsp;dB corresponds approximately to a halving of the power.

High-frequency transmission lines can be defined as those designed to carry electromagnetic waves whose [[wavelength]]s are shorter than or comparable to the length of the line.  Under these conditions, the approximations useful for calculations at lower frequencies are no longer accurate.  This often occurs with [[radio]], [[microwave]] and [[light|optical]] signals, [[metal mesh optical filters]], and with the signals found in high-speed [[digital circuit]]s.

==Telegrapher's equations==
{{Main|Telegrapher's equations}}
{{See also|Reflections on copper lines}}

The '''telegrapher's equations''' (or just '''telegraph equations''') are a pair of linear differential equations which describe the [[voltage]] (&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) and [[Electric current|current]] (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;) on an electrical transmission line with distance and time. They were developed by [[Oliver Heaviside]] who created the ''transmission line model'', and are based on [[Maxwell's equations]].

[[Image:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|right|250px|Schematic representation of the elementary component of a transmission line.]]
The transmission line model is an example of the [[distributed-element model]]. It represents the transmission line as an infinite series of two-port elementary components, each representing an infinitesimally short segment of the transmission line:

* The distributed resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the conductors is represented by a series resistor (expressed in [[ohm]]s per unit length).
* The distributed inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (due to the [[magnetic field]] around the wires, [[self-inductance]], etc.) is represented by a series [[inductor]] (in [[Henry (unit)|henries]] per unit length).
* The capacitance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; between the two conductors is represented by a [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitor]] (in [[farad]]s per unit length).
* The [[Electric conductance|conductance]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of the dielectric material separating the two conductors is represented by a shunt resistor between the signal wire and the return wire (in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per unit length).

The model consists of an ''infinite series'' of the elements shown in the figure, and the values of the components are specified ''per unit length'' so the picture of the component can be misleading. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; may also be functions of frequency. An alternative notation is to use &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that the values are derivatives with respect to length.  These quantities can also be known as the [[primary line constants]] to distinguish from the secondary line constants derived from them, these being the [[propagation constant]], [[attenuation constant]] and [[phase constant]].

==Recognition==
The nation's highest award for combat valor, the [[Medal of Honor]], was conferred upon one ''Nisei'' during the war, [[Sadao Munemori]], after he sacrificed his life to save his fellow soldiers. Twenty-one members of the 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team received Distinguished Service Crosses during or immediately after their World War II service, but in the 1990s, after a study revealed that racial discrimination had caused them to be [[Medal of Honor#Past discrimination|overlooked]], their awards were upgraded to Medals of Honor. 

On October 5, 2010, Congress approved the granting of the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion, as well as the 6,000 Japanese Americans who served in the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]] during the war.&lt;ref name=steffen&gt;{{Cite news|last=Steffen |first=Jordan |title=White House honors Japanese American WWII veterans |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 6, 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-veterans-medal-20101006,0,7017069.story |postscript=. |accessdate= October 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007031655/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-veterans-medal-20101006%2C0%2C7017069.story |archivedate=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nisei Soldiers of World War II Congressional Gold Medal]] was collectively presented on November 2, 2011.&lt;ref name=usmint&gt;{{cite web | title=Congressional Gold Medal Presented to Nisei Soldiers of World War II|url=https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/20111102-congressional-gold-medal-presented-to-nisei-soldiers-of-world-war-ii|publisher =[[United States Mint]]|date=2011-11-02| accessdate=2020-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is a [[National Park Service]] site to commemorate the experience of American citizens of Japanese ancestry and their parents who patriotically supported the United States despite unjust treatment during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=2001 | title=National Japanese American Memorial, (sculpture). | work=Inventory staff | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!351342~!0#focus | accessdate= 14 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Go for Broke Monument]] in Little Tokyo, [[Los Angeles, California]], commemorates the Japanese Americans who served in the United States Army during World War II.

[[California]] has given four state highway segments honorary designations for [[Japanese American]] soldiers:
*[[California State Route 23|State Route 23]] between [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] and [[California State Route 118|State Route 118]] is named the ''[[Military Intelligence Service Memorial Highway|Military Intelligence Memorial Freeway]]''.
*[[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] between [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Madera, California|Madera]] is named the ''[[100th Infantry Battalion Memorial Highway]]'';
*[[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] between [[Salida, California|Salida]] and [[Manteca, California|Manteca]] is named the ''[[442nd Regimental Combat Team Memorial Highway]]'';
*The interchange between the [[Interstate 105 (California)|I-105]] and [[Interstate 405 (California)|I-405]] freeways in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] is labeled the ''Sadao S. Munemori Memorial Interchange''.

'''Babylonia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|b|ɪ|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|i|ə}}) was an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian-speaking]] [[state (polity)|state]] and [[cultural area]] based in central-southern [[Mesopotamia]] (present-day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]). A small [[Amorites|Amorite]]-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained the minor administrative town of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Leo Oppenheim, ''Ancient Mesopotamia''&lt;/ref&gt; It was merely a small provincial town during the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC) but greatly expanded during the reign of [[Hammurabi]] in the first half of the 18th century BC and became a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called &quot;the country of Akkad&quot; (''Māt Akkadī'' in Akkadian), a deliberate archaism in reference to the previous glory of the Akkadian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aliraqi.org/forums/showthread.php?t=69813 Aliraqi - Babylonian Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livius.org/articles/place/babylonian-empire/ Babylonian Empire - Livius]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was often involved in rivalry with the older state of [[Assyria]] to the north and [[Elam]] to the east in [[Ancient Iran]]. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi ([[floruit|fl.]] c. 1792–1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696–1654 BC, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Old Assyrian Empire]]. The Babylonian Empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi and reverted to a small kingdom.

Like Assyria, the Babylonian state retained the written Akkadian language (the language of its native populace) for official use, despite its [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking Amorite founders and [[Kassites|Kassite]] successors, who spoke a [[language isolate]], not being native Mesopotamians. It retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use (as did Assyria), but already by the time Babylon was founded, this was no longer a spoken language, having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian. The earlier Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in Babylonian and Assyrian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under its protracted periods of outside rule.

The earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a [[clay tablet]] from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334–2279 BC), dating back to the 23rd century BC. Babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and neither an independent state nor a large city; like the rest of Mesopotamia, it was subject to the Akkadian Empire which united all the Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under one rule. After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, the south Mesopotamian region was dominated by the [[Gutian people]] for a few decades before the rise of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], which restored order to the region and which, apart from northern Assyria, encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia, including the town of Babylon.

==History==

===Pre-Babylonian Sumero-Akkadian period===
Mesopotamia had already enjoyed a long history prior to the emergence of Babylon, with [[Sumer]]ian civilization emerging in the region c. 3500 BC, and the Akkadian-speaking people appearing by the 30th century BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis occurred between Sumerian and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian and vice versa is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt;

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the third and the second millennium BC (the precise timeframe being a matter of debate).&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 &quot;Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian&quot;. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91–120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

From c. 3500 BC until the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC, Mesopotamia had been dominated by largely [[Sumer]]ian cities and city states, such as [[Ur]], [[Lagash]], [[Uruk]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eridu]], [[Nuzi|Gasur]], [[Assur]], [[Hamazi]], [[Akshak]], [[Erbil|Arbela]] and [[Umma]], although Semitic Akkadian names began to appear on the king lists of some of these states (such as [[Eshnunna]] and Assyria) between the 29th and 25th centuries BC. Traditionally, the major religious center of all Mesopotamia was the city of [[Nippur]] where the god [[Enlil]] was supreme, and it would remain so until replaced by [[Babylon]] during the reign of Hammurabi in the mid-18th century BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 BC) saw the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of Mesopotamia unite under one rule, and the Akkadians fully attain ascendancy over the Sumerians and indeed come to dominate much of the ancient [[Near East]].

The empire eventually disintegrated due to economic decline, climate change and civil war, followed by attacks by the Gutians from the [[Zagros Mountains]]. Sumer rose up again with the Third Dynasty of Ur in the late 22nd century BC, and ejected the Gutians from southern Mesopotamia in 2161 BC as suggested by surviving tablets and astronomical simulations.&lt;ref name=Khalisi2020&gt;{{citation|arxiv=2007.07141|title=The Double Eclipse at the Downfall of Old Babylon|year=2020|last1=Khalisi|first1=Emil}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also seem to have gained ascendancy over much of the territory of the Akkadian kings of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia for a time.

Followed by the collapse of the Sumerian &quot;Ur-III&quot; dynasty at the hands of the [[Elam]]ites in 2002 BC, the [[Amorites]] (&quot;Westerners&quot;), a foreign [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic-speaking]] people, began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia from the northern [[Levant]], gradually gaining control over most of southern Mesopotamia, where they formed a series of small kingdoms, while the Assyrians reasserted their independence in the north. The states of the south were unable to stem the Amorite advance, and for a time may have relied on their fellow Akkadians in Assyria for protection.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

King [[Ilu-shuma]] (c. 2008–1975 BC) of the Old Assyrian Empire (2025–1750 BC) in a known inscription describes his exploits to the south as follows:
{{quote|The freedom&lt;ref group=n&gt;Freedom = Akk. ''addurāru''.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, [[Awal]], and Kish, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess [[Ishtar]], as far as the City of ([[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]).&lt;ref name=grayson&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Past scholars originally extrapolated from this text that it means he defeated the invading Amorites to the south and Elamites to the east, but there is no explicit record of that, and some scholars believe the Assyrian kings were merely giving preferential trade agreements to the south.

These policies were continued by his successors [[Erishum I]] and [[Ikunum]].

However, when [[Sargon I]] (1920–1881 BC) succeeded as king in Assyria in 1920 BC, he eventually withdrew Assyria from the region, preferring to concentrate on continuing the vigorous expansion of Assyrian colonies in [[Anatolia]] and the Levant, and eventually southern Mesopotamia fell to the Amorites, a Northwest Semitic-speaking people from the northern Levant. During the first centuries of what is called the &quot;Amorite period&quot;, the most powerful [[city-state|city states]] in the south were Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa, together with Assyria in the north.

===First Babylonian dynasty – Amorite dynasty, 1894–1595 BC===

One of these Amorite dynasties founded a small kingdom of [[Kazallu]] which included the then still minor town of [[Babylon]] circa 1894 BC, which would ultimately take over the others and form the short-lived first Babylonian empire, also called the [[First Babylonian dynasty]].

An Amorite chieftain named [[Sumu-abum]] appropriated a tract of land which included the then relatively small city of Babylon from the neighbouring Amorite ruled Mesopotamian city state of Kazallu, of which it had initially been a territory, turning his newly acquired lands into a state in its own right. His reign was concerned with establishing statehood amongst a sea of other minor city states and kingdoms in the region. However, Sumuabum appears never to have bothered to give himself the title of ''King of Babylon'', suggesting that Babylon itself was still only a minor town or city, and not worthy of kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Rogers, A History of Babylonia and Assyria, Volume I, Eaton and Mains, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was followed by [[Sumu-la-El]], [[Sabium]], [[Apil-Sin]], each of whom ruled in the same vague manner as Sumuabum, with no reference to kingship of Babylon itself being made in any written records of the time. [[Sin-Muballit]] was the first of these Amorite rulers to be regarded officially as a ''king of Babylon'', and then on only one single clay tablet. Under these kings, the nation in which Babylon lay remained a small nation which controlled very little territory, and was overshadowed by neighbouring kingdoms that were both older, larger, and more powerful, such as; Isin, Larsa, Assyria to the north and Elam to the east in ancient Iran. The Elamites occupied huge swathes of southern Mesopotamia, and the early Amorite rulers were largely held in vassalage to Elam.

====Empire of Hammurabi====
Babylon remained a minor town in a small state until the reign of its sixth Amorite ruler, [[Hammurabi]], during 1792–1750 BC (or c. 1728&amp;nbsp;– 1686 BC in the [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]). He conducted major building work in Babylon, expanding it from a small town into a great city worthy of kingship. A very efficient ruler, he established a bureaucracy, with taxation and centralized government. Hammurabi freed Babylon from Elamite dominance, and indeed drove the Elamites from southern Mesopotamia entirely. He then systematically conquered southern Mesopotamia, including the cities of Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna, Kish, [[Lagash]], Nippur, [[Borsippa]], Ur, Uruk, Umma, Adab, [[Sippar]], [[Rapiqum]], and Eridu. His conquests gave the region stability after turbulent times, and coalesced the patchwork of small states into a single nation; it is only from the time of Hammurabi that southern Mesopotamia acquired the name ''Babylonia''.

Hammurabi turned his disciplined armies eastwards and invaded the region which a thousand years later became [[Iran]], conquering Elam, Gutians, [[Lullubi]] and Kassites. To the west, he conquered the Amorite states of the Levant (modern [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]]) including the powerful kingdoms of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Yamhad]].

Hammurabi then entered into a protracted war with the Old Assyrian Empire for control of Mesopotamia and dominance of the Near East. Assyria had extended control over much of the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] parts of southeast Anatolia from the 21st century BC, and from the latter part of the 20th century BC had asserted itself over the northeast Levant and central Mesopotamia. After a protracted struggle over decades with the powerful Assyrian kings [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ishme-Dagan I]], Hammurabi forced their successor [[Mut-Ashkur]] to pay tribute to Babylon c. 1751 BC, giving Babylonia control over Assyria's centuries-old Hattian and Hurrian colonies in Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim Ancient Mesopotamia&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hammurabi's most important and lasting works was the compilation of the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian law code]], which improved the much earlier codes of [[Sumer]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and Assyria. This was made by order of Hammurabi after the expulsion of the Elamites and the settlement of his kingdom. In 1901, a copy of the [[Code of Hammurabi]] was discovered on a [[stele]] by [[Jacques de Morgan]] and [[Jean-Vincent Scheil]] at [[Susa]] in Elam, where it had later been taken as plunder. That copy is now in the [[Louvre]].

From before 3000 BC until the reign of Hammurabi, the major cultural and religious center of southern Mesopotamia had been the ancient city of Nippur, where the god Enlil was supreme. Hammurabi transferred this dominance to Babylon, making [[Marduk]] supreme in the pantheon of southern Mesopotamia (with the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], and to some degree [[Ishtar]], remaining the long-dominant deity in northern Mesopotamian Assyria). The city of Babylon became known as a &quot;holy city&quot; where any legitimate ruler of southern Mesopotamia had to be crowned. Hammurabi turned what had previously been a minor administrative town into a large, powerful and influential city, extended its rule over the entirety of southern Mesopotamia, and erected a number of impressive buildings.

The Amorite-ruled Babylonians, like their predecessor states, engaged in regular trade with the Amorite and Canaanite city-states to the west, with Babylonian officials or troops sometimes passing to the Levant and Canaan, and Amorite merchants operating freely throughout Mesopotamia. The Babylonian monarchy's western connections remained strong for quite some time. [[Ammi-Ditana]], great-grandson of Hammurabi, still titled himself &quot;king of the land of the Amorites&quot;. Ammi-Ditana's father and son also bore Amorite names: [[Abi-Eshuh]] and [[Ammi-Saduqa]].

====Decline====
[[File:Cylinder seal,ca. 18th–17th century B.C. Babylonian.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cylinder seal, ca. 18th–17th century BC. Babylonia]]
Southern Mesopotamia had no natural, defensible boundaries, making it vulnerable to attack. After the death of Hammurabi, his empire began to disintegrate rapidly. Under his successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1749–1712 BC) the far south of Mesopotamia was lost to a native Akkadian-speaking king [[Ilum-ma-ili]] who ejected the Amorite-ruled Babylonians. The south became the native [[Sealand Dynasty]], remaining free of Babylon for the next 272 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&quot;&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Babylonians and their Amorite rulers were driven from Assyria to the north by an Assyrian-Akkadian governor named [[Puzur-Sin]] c. 1740 BC, who regarded king Mut-Ashkur as both a foreign Amorite and a former lackey of Babylon. After six years of civil war in Assyria, a native king named [[Adasi]] seized power c. 1735 BC, and went on to appropriate former Babylonian and Amorite territory in central Mesopotamia, as did his successor [[Bel-bani]].

Amorite rule survived in a much reduced Babylon, Samshu-iluna's successor [[Abi-Eshuh]] made a vain attempt to recapture the Sealand Dynasty for Babylon, but met defeat at the hands of king [[Damqi-ilishu II]]. By the end of his reign Babylonia had shrunk to the small and relatively weak nation it had been upon its foundation, although the city itself was far larger than the small town it had been prior to the rise of Hammurabi.

He was followed by Ammi-Ditana and then Ammi-Saduqa, both of whom were in too weak a position to make any attempt to regain the many territories lost after the death of Hammurabi, contenting themselves with peaceful building projects in Babylon itself.

[[Samsu-Ditana]] was to be the last Amorite ruler of Babylon. Early in his reign he came under pressure from the Kassites, a people speaking an apparent [[language isolate]] originating in the mountains of what is today northwest Iran. Babylon was then attacked by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]], Anatolia-based [[Hittites]] in 1595 BC. Shamshu-Ditana was overthrown following the &quot;sack of Babylon&quot; by the Hittite king [[Mursili I]]. The Hittites did not remain for long, but the destruction wrought by them finally enabled their Kassite allies to gain control.

====The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology====
{{Missing information|section|the event itself, as opposed to just its role in chronological calculations|date=February 2019}}
The date of the sack of Babylon by the Hittites under king [[Mursili I]] is considered crucial to the various calculations of the early [[chronology of the ancient Near East]], as it is taken as a fixed point in the discussion. Suggestions for its precise date vary by as much as 230 years, corresponding to the uncertainty regarding the length of the &quot;Dark Age&quot; of the much later [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], resulting in the shift of the entire Bronze Age chronology of Mesopotamia with regard to the [[Egyptian chronology]]. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are:
* ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC
* short chronology: 1531 BC
* middle chronology: 1595 BC
* long chronology: 1651 BC (favored by astronomical events reconstruction)&lt;ref name=Khalisi2020/&gt;
* ultra-long chronology: 1736 BC&lt;ref&gt;Eder, Christian., Assyrische Distanzangaben und die absolute Chronologie Vorderasiens, AoF 31, 191–236, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kassite dynasty, 1595–1155 BC===
{{Main|Kassites}}
[[File:Kassite Babylonia EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The extent of the Babylonian Empire during the Kassite dynasty]]
The Kassite dynasty was founded by [[Gandash]] of Mari. The Kassites, like the Amorite rulers who had preceded them, were not originally native to Mesopotamia. Rather, they had first appeared in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of what is today northwestern Iran.

The ethnic affiliation of the Kassites is unclear. Still, their language was not [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], and is thought to have been either a language isolate or possibly related to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian language family]] of Anatolia,&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Thomas|title=Kassitisch und Hurro-Urartäisch. Ein Diskussionsbeitrag zu möglichen lexikalischen Isoglossen|journal=Altorientalische Forschungen|year=2003|issue=30|pages=372–381|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the evidence for its genetic affiliation is meager due to the scarcity of extant texts. That said, several Kassite leaders may have borne [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European names]], and they may have had an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] elite similar to the [[Mitanni]] elite that later ruled over the Hurrians of central and eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46842/Early-Vedic-period |title=India: Early Vedic period |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293553/Iranian-art-and-architecture/37848/Median-period |title=Iranian art and architecture |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kassites renamed Babylon [[Karduniaš]] and their rule lasted for 576 years, the longest dynasty in Babylonian history.

This new foreign dominion offers a striking analogy to the roughly contemporary rule of the [[Hyksos]] in [[ancient Egypt]]. Most divine attributes ascribed to the Amorite kings of Babylonia disappeared at this time; the title &quot;god&quot; was never given to a Kassite sovereign. Babylon continued to be the capital of the kingdom and one of the ''holy cities'' of western Asia, where the priests of the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] were all-powerful, and the only place where the right to inheritance of the short lived old Babylonian empire could be conferred.{{sfn|Sayce|1911|p=104}}

Babylonia experienced short periods of relative power, but in general proved to be relatively weak under the long rule of the Kassites, and spent long periods under Assyrian and Elamite domination and interference.

It is not clear precisely when Kassite rule of Babylon began, but the Indo-European Hittites from Anatolia did not remain in Babylonia for long after the sacking of the city, and it is likely the Kassites moved in soon afterwards. [[Agum II]] took the throne for the Kassites in 1595 BC, and ruled a state that extended from Iran to the middle Euphrates; The new king retained peaceful relations with [[Erishum III]], the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria, but successfully went to war with the [[Hittite Empire]], and twenty-four years after, the Hittites took the sacred [[statue of Marduk]], he recovered it and declared the god equal to the [[Kassite deities|Kassite deity]] [[Shuqamuna]].
[[File:Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia c. 1450 BC.png|thumb|240px|Map of Mesopotamia c. 1450 BC]]

[[Burnaburiash I]] succeeded him and drew up a peace treaty with the Assyrian king [[Puzur-Ashur III]], and had a largely uneventful reign, as did his successor [[Kashtiliash III]].

The [[Sealand Dynasty]] of southern Mesopotamia  remained independent of Babylonia and in native Akkadian-speaking hands. [[Ulamburiash]] managed to attack it and conquered parts of the land from ''Ea-gamil'', a king with a distinctly Sumerian name, around 1450 BC, whereupon Ea-Gamil fled to his allies in Elam. The Sealand Dynasty region still remained independent, and the Kassite king seems to have been unable to finally conquer it. Ulamburiash began making treaties with [[ancient Egypt]], which then was ruling southern [[Canaan]], and Assyria to the north. [[Karaindash]] built a bas-relief temple in Uruk and [[Kurigalzu I]] (1415–1390 BC) built a new capital [[Dur-Kurigalzu]] named after himself, transferring administrative rule from Babylon. Both of these kings continued to struggle unsuccessfully against the Sealand Dynasty.

[[Agum III]] also campaigned against the Sealand Dynasty, finally wholly conquering the far south of Mesopotamia for Babylon, destroying its capital [[Dur-Enlil]] in the process. From there Agum III extended farther south still, invading what was many centuries later to be called the [[Arabian Peninsula]] or [[Arabia]], and conquering the ''pre-Arab'' state of [[Dilmun]] (in modern [[Bahrain]]).

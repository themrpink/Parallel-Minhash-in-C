DAB can carry &quot;radiotext&quot; (in DAB terminology, ''Dynamic Label Segment'', or DLS) from the station giving real-time information such as song titles, music type and news or traffic updates, of up to 128 characters in length. This is similar to a feature of FM called [[Radio Data System|RDS]], which enables a radiotext of up to 64 characters.

The DAB transmission contains a local [[time of day]] and so a device may use this to automatically correct its internal clock when travelling between time zones and when changing to or from [[Daylight Saving]].

===More stations===
DAB is not more bandwidth efficient than analogue measured in programmes per MHz of a specific transmitter (the so-called [[link spectral efficiency]]), but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which makes it possible to reduce the [[reuse distance]], i.e. use the same radio frequency channel more densely. The [[system spectral efficiency]] (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of [[Single-frequency network|SFN]]s. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.

In certain areas – particularly rural areas – the introduction of DAB gives radio listeners a greater choice of radio stations. For instance, in [[Sørlandet|Southern Norway]], radio listeners experienced an increase in available stations from 6 to 21 when DAB was introduced in November 2006.

===Reception quality===
The DAB standard integrates features to reduce the negative consequences of [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] fading and [[signal noise]], which afflict existing [[Analog signal|analogue]] systems.

Also, as DAB transmits digital audio, there is no hiss with a weak signal, which can happen on FM. However, radios in the fringe of a DAB signal can experience a &quot;bubbling mud&quot; sound interrupting the audio or the audio cutting out altogether.

Due to sensitivity to [[doppler shift]] in combination with [[multipath propagation]], DAB reception range (but not audio quality) is reduced when travelling speeds of more than 120 to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h, depending on carrier frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech.ebu.ch&quot;&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_265-kozamernik.pdf Digital Audio Broadcasting (EBU Technical Review article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Less unlicensed (&quot;pirate&quot;) station interference===
The specialised nature, limited spectrum and higher cost of DAB broadcasting equipment provides barriers to [[pirate radio|unlicensed (&quot;pirate&quot;)]] stations broadcasting on DAB. In cities such as London with large numbers of unlicensed radio stations broadcasting on FM, this means that some stations can be reliably received via DAB in areas where they are regularly difficult or impossible to receive on FM because of interference from unlicensed radio stations.

===Variable bandwidth===
Mono talk radio, news and weather channels and other non-music programs need significantly less bandwidth than a typical music radio station, which allows DAB to carry these programmes at lower bit rates, leaving more bandwidth to be used for other programs.

However, this led to the situation where some stations are being broadcast in mono; see ''[[Digital Audio Broadcasting#Music radio stations broadcasting in mono|music radio stations broadcasting in mono]]'' for more details.

===Transmission costs===
DAB transmitters are inevitably more expensive than their FM counterparts. DAB uses higher frequencies than FM and therefore there may be a need to compensate with more transmitters to achieve the same coverage as a single FM transmitter. DAB is commonly transmitted by a different company from the broadcaster who then sells the capacity to a number of radio stations.  This shared cost can work out cheaper than operating an individual FM transmitter.

This efficiency originates from the ability a DAB network has in broadcasting more channels per transmitter/network. One network can broadcast 6–10 channels (with MP2 audio codec) or 10–18 channels (with HE AAC codec). Hence, it is thought that the replacement of FM-radios and FM-transmitters with new DAB-radios and DAB-transmitters will not cost any more compared with new FM facilities.  It is also argued that the power consumption will be lower for stations transmitted on a single DAB multiplex compared with individual analog transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garfors|first=Gunnar|title=DAB 20 Times Greener Than FM|url=http://www.garfors.com/2011/01/dab-vs-fm-on-power-consumption.html|accessdate=21 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013221809/http://www.garfors.com/2011/01/dab-vs-fm-on-power-consumption.html|archivedate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once applied, one operator has claimed that DAB transmission is as low as one-nineteenth of the cost of FM transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/0003/italys-south-tyrol-begins-fm-switch-off/340879 |title=Italy’s South Tyrol Begins FM Switch off |author=Davide Moro |magazine=Radio World |date=12 December 2017 |quote=For us, DAB+ is 19 times more efficient than FM |access-date=18 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216072017/http://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/0003/italys-south-tyrol-begins-fm-switch-off/340879 |archive-date=16 December 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages of DAB==

===Reception quality===
The reception quality during the early stage of deployment of DAB was poor even for people who live well within the coverage area. The reason for this is that DAB uses weak [[error correction coding]], so that when there are a lot of errors with the received data not enough of the errors can be corrected and a &quot;bubbling mud&quot; sound occurs. In some cases a complete loss of signal can happen. This situation has been improved upon in the newer DAB+ version that uses stronger [[error correction coding]] and as additional transmitters are built.

As with other digital systems, when the signal is weak or suffers severe interference, it will not work at all.  DAB reception may also be a problem for receivers when the wanted signal is adjacent to a stronger one.  This was a particular issue for early and low cost receivers.

===Audio quality===
A common complaint by listeners is that broadcasters ‘squeeze in’ more stations per ensemble than recommended &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; by:
*Minimizing the bit-rate, to the lowest level of sound-quality that listeners are willing to tolerate, such as 112 kbit/s for stereo and even 48 kbit/s for mono speech radio (LBC 1152 and the Voice of Russia are examples).
*Having few digital channels broadcasting in stereo.

===Signal delay===
The nature of a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) is such that the transmitters in a network must broadcast the same signal at the same time. To achieve synchronization, the broadcaster must counter any differences in propagation time incurred by the different methods and distances involved in carrying the signal from the multiplexer to the different transmitters. This is done by applying a delay to the incoming signal at the transmitter based on a timestamp generated at the multiplexer, created taking into account the maximum likely propagation time, with a generous added margin for safety. Delays in the audio encoder and the receiver due to digital processing (e.g. deinterleaving) add to the overall delay perceived by the listener.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech.ebu.ch&quot;/&gt; The signal is delayed, usually by around 1 to 4 seconds and can be considerably longer for DAB+. This has disadvantages:
*DAB radios are out of step with live events, so the experience of listening to live commentaries on events being watched is impaired;
*Listeners using a combination of analogue (AM or FM) and DAB radios (e.g. in different rooms of a house) will hear a mixture when both receivers are within earshot.

[[Time signal]]s, on the contrary, are not a problem in a well-defined network with a fixed delay. The DAB multiplexer adds the proper offset to the distributed time information. The time information is also independent from the (possibly varying) audio decoding delay in receivers since the time is not embedded inside the audio frames. This means that built in clocks in receivers can be precisely correct.

===Transmission costs===
DAB can provide savings for networks of several stations.  The original development of DAB was driven by national network operators with a number of channels to transmit from multiple sites.  However, for individual stations such as small community or local stations which traditionally operate their own FM transmitter on their own building the cost of DAB transmission will be much higher than analog.  Operating a DAB transmitter for a single station is not an efficient use of spectrum or power. With that said, this can be solved to some degree by combining multiple local stations in one DAB/DAB+ mux, similar to what is done on DVB-T/DVB-T2 with local TV stations.

===Coverage===
Although FM coverage still exceeds DAB coverage in most countries implementing any kind of DAB services, a number of countries moving to digital switchover have undergone significant DAB network rollouts; {{as of|2019|December|df=|lc=y}}, the following coverages were given by WorldDAB:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/countries|title=WorldDAB: Countries|last=|first=|date=2019-10-16|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility===
In 2006 tests began using the much improved [[HE-AAC]] codec for [[DAB+]]. Hardly any of the receivers made before 2008 support the newer codec, however, making them partially obsolete once DAB+ broadcasts begin and completely obsolete once all [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] encoded stations are gone. Most new receivers are both DAB and DAB+ compatible; however, the issue is exacerbated by some manufacturers disabling the DAB+ features on otherwise compatible radios to save on licensing fees when sold in countries without current DAB+ broadcasts.

===Power requirements===
[[File:Roberts Sports DAB 5 Portable DAB and FM Radio.jpg|thumb|right|Portable DAB/DAB+ and FM receiver, circa 2016. This unit requires two [[AA battery|&quot;AA&quot; size batteries]]. (Headphones not shown).]]
As DAB requires digital signal processing techniques to convert from the received digitally encoded signal to the analogue audio content, the complexity of the electronic circuitry required to do this is higher.  This translates into needing more power to effect this conversion than compared to an analogue FM to audio conversion, meaning that portable receiving equipment will have a much shorter battery life, and require higher power (and hence more bulk). This means that they use more energy than analogue [[Band II]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] receivers. However, thanks to increased integration (radio-on-chip), DAB receiver power usage has been reduced dramatically, making portable receivers far more usable.

==FM radio switch-off==

===Norway===
[[Norway]] was the first country to announce a complete switch-off of national FM radio stations. The switch-off started on 11 January 2017 and ended on 13 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2117569-norway-is-first-country-to-turn-off-fm-radio-and-go-digital-only/ Norway is first country to turn off FM radio and go digital-only]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/informasjon/slik-slukkes-fm-nettet-1.12319113|title=Slik slukkes FM-nettet|work=NRK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 switch-off did not affect some local and regional radio stations. They can continue to transmit on FM until 2027.

The timetable for the closure of FM signals in 2017 was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrk.no/nordland/medieprofessor_-_-et-kritisk-oyeblikk-for-radiomediet-1.13310906 Medieprofessor: – Et kritisk øyeblikk for radiomediet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11 January in [[Nordland]] (all radio)
* 8 February in [[Trøndelag]] and [[Møre og Romsdal]] ([[NRK Radio]])
* 21 April in Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal ([[P4 Radio Hele Norge|P4]], [[Radio Norge]] and [[community radio|local radio]])
* 26 April in [[Telemark]], [[Buskerud]], [[Hedmark]] and [[Oppland]] (NRK)
* 16 June in Telemark, Buskerud, Hedmark and Oppland (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 21 June in [[Sogn og Fjordane]], [[Hordaland]], [[Rogaland]] and [[Agder]] (NRK)
* 15 September in Sogn og Fjordane, Hordaland, Rogaland and Agder (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 20 September in [[Østfold]], [[Vestfold]], [[Oslo]] and [[Akershus]] (NRK)
* 8 December in Østfold, Vestfold, Oslo and Akershus (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 13 December in [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]] (all radio)

===Other countries===
*The [[Federal Government of Belgium]] has decided to turn off FM two years after 50 percent of the radio consumption becomes digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dabplus.de/2020/07/20/dab-in-europa-der-ueberblick-3/ |title=DAB+ in Europe: The Overview|publisher=https://www.dabplus.de/|date=20 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Denmark]] the current media agreement of the Danish Parliament stipulates that the FM broadcasts will be stopped as soon as the proportion of digital radio reception reaches 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dabplus.de/2020/07/20/dab-in-europa-der-ueberblick-3/ |title=DAB+ in Europe: The Overview|publisher=https://www.dabplus.de/|date=20 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2018 the situation has changed when it had not been planned to switch off FM transmitters, at least not until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2018-06-28-frygtede-for-to-millioner-biler-nu-faar-fm-baandet-lov-til-at-overleve Frygtede for to millioner biler - nu får FM-båndet lov til at overleve]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Switzerland]] has confirmed its plans to switch off analogue radio services starting in 18 months from now. Public broadcaster SRG SSR will go first in summer 2022, followed by private stations by January 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/11/switzerland-getting-ready-to-turn-off-fm-radio/ |title=Switzerland getting ready to turn off FM radio|publisher=RadioToday UK|date=5 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Italy]], RAS planned the switchover in the province of [[Trentino]] between December 2017 and November 2018, but a national switchover isn't planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ras.bz.it/de/digitalradio-weiter-ausgebaut-ukw-abschaltplan-der-ras-von-der-landesregierung-genehmigt/ |title=Digitalradio weiter ausgebaut – UKW Abschaltplan der RAS von der Landesregierung genehmigt |date=14 November 2017 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DAB radio switch-off==
Whilst many countries have expected a shift to digital audio broadcasting, a few have moved in the opposite direction following unsuccessful trials.

*[[Finland]] stopped its DAB services in 2005 claiming that future DAB broadcasts are possible - &quot;If international developments, however, lead to the adoption of DAB as a pan-European distribution standard, YLE will retain the means to resume DAB services.&quot; .&lt;ref&gt;https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/yle_closes_down_dab_radio_services/5196460&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish radios requested to the government that FM be made mandatory in cars sold in Finland.
*[[Hungary]] stopped its DAB services in September 2020. Hungary's National Media and Communications Authority (NMHH) has nonetheless stated that they will be reviewing the situation and may potentially reconsider DAB+ radio in the future.&lt;ref&gt;//https://www.worlddab.org/countries/hungary&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Portugal]] announced the termination of DAB in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mundodaradio.com/historia/dab_em_portugal.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hong Kong]] announced the termination of DAB in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201703/28/P2017032800689.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by DVB-T2 Lite.
*[[Taiwan]] ended trials in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncc.gov.tw/chinese/news_detail.aspx?site_content_sn=67&amp;is_history=0&amp;pages=0&amp;sn_f=36703&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[New Zealand]] ended trials in 2018.
*[[Canada]] conducted trials of DAB in [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band]] in major cities.  However the success of satellite digital radio and lack of [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band DAB]] receivers led to the analogue switch-off being abandoned. Canada subsequently adopted [[HD Radio]] as used in the neighboring United States instead of DAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/canada#current_situation |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110160250/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/canada#current_situation |archive-date=2018-11-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willy Brandt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɪliː ˈbʁant|lang}}; born '''Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm'''; 18 December 1913 – 8 October 1992) was a German politician and statesman who was leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from 1964 to 1987 and served as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of the Federal Republic of Germany ([[West Germany]]) from 1969 to 1974. He was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1971 for his efforts to strengthen cooperation in western Europe through the [[EEC]] and to achieve reconciliation between West Germany and the countries of [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1971/press.html |title=The 1971 Nobel Prize – Presentation Speech |website=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Social Democrat chancellor&lt;ref&gt;Since [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] in 1930&lt;/ref&gt; since 1930.

Fleeing to [[Norway]] and then [[Sweden]] during the [[Nazi]] regime and working as a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] journalist, he took the name Willy Brandt as a pseudonym to avoid detection by Nazi agents, and then formally adopted the name in 1948. Brandt was originally considered one of the leaders of the right wing of the SPD, and earned initial fame as [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] of [[West Berlin]]. He served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] and as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] in [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]'s cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969. As chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the [[United States]] and focused on strengthening [[European integration]] in western Europe, while launching the new policy of ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his ''Ostpolitik'', and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including the [[Vietnam War]], and [[right-wing authoritarian]] regimes. The [[Brandt Report]] became a recognised measure for describing the general [[North–South divide in the World|North-South divide]] in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce [[anti-communist]] policies at the domestic level, culminating in the ''[[Radikalenerlass]]'' (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.

Brandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after [[Günter Guillaume]], one of his closest aides, [[Guillaume Affair|was exposed]] as an agent of the [[Stasi]], the [[GDR|East German]] [[secret service]].

Willy Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm in the [[Free City of Lübeck]] ([[German Empire]]) on 18 December 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945–1996|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=89|url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Martha Frahm (16 March 1894 – 3 August 1969){{citation needed|date=January 2018}} a [[single parent]], who worked as a cashier for a department store. His father was a teacher from [[Hamburg]] named John Heinrich Möller (1887–1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tRyJy-An1MC&amp;q=John+Heinrich+Möller+1887&amp;pg=PA381 | title=Politik und Militär in Deutschland: Die Bundespräsidenten und Bundeskanzler und ihre Beziehung zu Soldatentum und Bundeswehr| isbn=9783937885360| last1=Kilian| first1=Dieter E.| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Brandt never met. As his mother worked six days a week, he was mainly brought up by his mother's stepfather, Ludwig Frahm (1875–1935), and his second wife, Dora.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

He joined the &quot;Socialist Youth&quot; in 1929 and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in 1930. He left the SPD to join the more left wing [[SAPD|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP), which was allied to the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Independent Labour Party]] in [[UK|Britain]]. After passing his [[Abitur]] in 1932 at ''Johanneum zu Lübeck'', he became an apprentice at the shipbroker and ship's agent F.&amp;nbsp;H. Bertling. In 1933, using his connections with the port and its ships, he left Germany for [[Norway]] to escape [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. It was at this time that he adopted the [[pseudonym]] '''Willy Brandt''' to avoid detection by Nazi agents. In 1934, he took part in the founding of the [[International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations]], and was elected to its secretariat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Brandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, disguised as a Norwegian student named '''Gunnar Gaasland'''. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from Lübeck in a [[marriage of convenience]] to protect her from deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], Brandt worked in [[Spain]] as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for [[Norwegian nationality law|Norwegian citizenship]]. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. On his release, he escaped to [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]]. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the [[Norwegian legation in Stockholm]], where he lived until the end of the war. Willy Brandt lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at [[Bommersvik]] College about problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the occupied countries at the start of the [[Second World War]]. In exile in Norway and Sweden, Brandt learned [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Brandt spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In late 1946, Brandt returned to [[Berlin]], working for the Norwegian government. In 1948, he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and became a German citizen again, formally adopting the pseudonym Willy Brandt as his legal name.

== Politician ==
Brandt was elected to the West German [[Bundestag]] (the federal parliament) in the [[1949 West German federal election]] as a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] delegate from West Berlin, serving there until 1957. Concurrently, he was elected as an SPD representative to the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordnetenhaus]] (the state-level parliament) of West Berlin in the [[1950 West Berlin state election]], and served there through 1971. In the [[1969 West German federal election]] he was again elected to the Bundestag, but as a delegate from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and remained in the Bundestag as a delegate from that state until his death in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noack&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noack |first1=Hans-Joachim |title=Willy Brandt: Ein Leben, ein Jahrhundert |date=2013 |publisher=Rowohlt |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3871346453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Brandt, while a member of the Bundestag and the editor-in-chief of the ''Berliner Stadtblatt'', received a secret payment of about 170,000 Deutsche Mark from the U.S. government ({{Inflation|DE|170000|1950|fmt=eq|cursign=€}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;faz16&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://m.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/historiker-enthuellt-washington-unterstuetzte-willy-brandt-mit-geheimen-zahlungen-14280080.html |title=Washington unterstützte Willy Brandt mit geheimen Zahlungen |language=de |trans-title=Washington supported Willy Brandt with secret payments |date=2016-06-10 |access-date=2020-06-21 |newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung }}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied any contribution to the topic.

From 3 October 1957 to 1966, Willy Brandt served as [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor of West Berlin]], during a period of increasing tension in East-West relations that led to the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. In Brandt's first year as mayor of Berlin, he also served as the president of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in Bonn. Brandt was an outspoken critic of Soviet repression of the 1956 [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] and of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1958 proposal that Berlin receive the status of a &quot;[[City-state|free city]]&quot;. He was supported by the influential publisher [[Axel Springer]]. As mayor of West Berlin, Brandt accomplished much in the way of urban development. New hotels, office-blocks and flats were constructed, while both [[Schloss Charlottenburg]] and the [[Reichstag building]] were restored. Sections of the &quot;Stadtring&quot; [[Bundesautobahn 100]] [[inner city]] motorway were opened, while a major housing programme was carried out, with roughly 20,000 new dwellings built each year during his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/GERbrandtW.htm |title=Willy Brandt : Biography |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009112249/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERbrandtW.htm |archivedate=9 October 2011 |access-date=27 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John F. Kennedy meeting with Willy Brandt, March 13, 1961.jpg|left|thumb|Brandt meeting [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961]]

At the start of 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] saw Brandt as a figure destined for high office in West Germany and was hoping he would replace [[Konrad Adenauer]] as chancellor following elections later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the [[White House]] a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country's leader. The diplomatic snub strained relations between Kennedy and Adenauer further during an especially tense time for Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kempe|2011|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, Brandt was disappointed and angry with Kennedy. Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting &quot;Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action.&quot; He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable &quot;to arouse doubts about the ability of the three [Allied] Powers to react and their determination&quot; and he called the situation &quot;a state of accomplished extortion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kempe|2011|pp=375–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandt became the chairman of the SPD in 1964, a post that he retained until 1987, longer than any other party chairman since the founding of the SPD by [[August Bebel]]. Brandt was the SPD candidate for the chancellorship in 1961, but he lost to [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s conservative [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] (CDU). In 1965, Brandt ran again, but lost to the popular [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Erhard's government was short-lived, however, and in 1966 a [[grand coalition]] between the SPD and CDU was formed, with Brandt serving as [[foreign minister]] and as the 5th [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]].

== Chancellor ==
At the 1969 elections, again with Brandt as the leading candidate, the SPD became stronger, and after three weeks of negotiations, the SPD [[Social-liberal coalition|formed a coalition]] government with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP). Brandt was elected [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]].

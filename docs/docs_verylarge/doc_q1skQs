Although there have been many advances in chemical weapon delivery since World War I, it is still difficult to achieve effective dispersion. The dissemination is highly dependent on atmospheric conditions because many chemical agents act in gaseous form. Thus, weather observations and forecasting are essential to optimize weapon delivery and reduce the risk of injuring friendly forces.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Dispersion====
[[File:Poison gas attack.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Dispersion of [[chlorine]] in [[World War I]]]]
Dispersion is placing the chemical agent upon or adjacent to a target immediately before dissemination, so that the material is most efficiently used.  Dispersion is the simplest technique of delivering an agent to its target. The most common techniques are munitions, bombs, projectiles, spray tanks and warheads.

[[World War I]] saw the earliest implementation of this technique. The actual first chemical ammunition was the [[Military history of France|French]] 26&amp;nbsp;mm cartouche suffocante [[rifle grenade]], fired from a [[flare gun|flare carbine]]. It contained 35g of the [[lachrymatory agent|tear-producer]] [[ethyl bromoacetate]], and was used in autumn 1914 – with little effect on the Germans.

The [[Military history of Germany|Germans]] contrarily tried to increase the effect of 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm [[shrapnel shell]]s by adding an irritant – [[dianisidine chlorosulfonate]]. Its use went unnoticed by the British when it was used against them at [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]] in October 1914. Hans Tappen, a chemist in the Heavy Artillery Department of the War Ministry, suggested to his brother, the Chief of the Operations Branch at German General Headquarters, the use of the tear-gases [[benzyl bromide]] or [[xylyl bromide]].

Shells were tested successfully at the Wahn artillery range near [[Cologne]] on January 9, 1915, and an order was placed for 15&amp;nbsp;cm [[howitzer]] shells, designated ‘T-shells’ after Tappen. A shortage of shells limited the first use against the Russians at [[Battle of Bolimów|Bolimów]] on January 31, 1915; the liquid failed to vaporize in the cold weather, and again the experiment went unnoticed by the Allies.

The first effective use were when the German forces at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] simply opened cylinders of [[chlorine]] and allowed the [[wind]] to carry the gas across enemy lines. While simple, this technique had numerous disadvantages. Moving large numbers of heavy gas cylinders to the front-line positions from where the gas would be released was a lengthy and difficult logistical task.
[[File:Poison Gas Attack Germany and Russia 1916.JPG|thumb|Aerial photograph of a German gas attack on [[Russia]]n forces circa 1916]]
Stockpiles of cylinders had to be stored at the front line, posing a great risk if hit by artillery shells. Gas delivery depended greatly on [[wind speed]] and direction. If the wind was fickle, as at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], the gas could blow back, causing [[friendly fire|friendly casualties]].

Gas clouds gave plenty of warning, allowing the enemy time to protect themselves, though many soldiers found the sight of a creeping gas cloud unnerving. This made the gas doubly effective, as, in addition to damaging the enemy physically, it also had a psychological effect on the intended victims.

Another disadvantage was that gas clouds had limited penetration, capable only of affecting the front-line trenches before dissipating. Although it produced limited results in World War I, this technique shows how simple chemical weapon dissemination ''can'' be.

Shortly after this &quot;open canister&quot; dissemination, French forces developed a technique for delivery of [[phosgene]] in a non-explosive [[artillery]] shell. This technique overcame many of the risks of dealing with gas in cylinders. First, gas shells were independent of the wind and increased the effective range of gas, making any target within reach of guns vulnerable. Second, gas shells could be delivered without warning, especially the clear, nearly odorless phosgene{{em dash}}there are numerous accounts of gas shells, landing with a &quot;plop&quot; rather than exploding, being initially dismissed as dud [[high explosive]] or [[shrapnel shell]]s, giving the gas time to work before the soldiers were alerted and took precautions.

The major drawback of artillery delivery was the difficulty of achieving a killing concentration. Each shell had a small gas payload and an area would have to be subjected to [[saturation bombardment]] to produce a cloud to match cylinder delivery. A British solution to the problem was the [[Livens Projector]]. This was effectively a large-bore mortar, dug into the ground that used the gas cylinders themselves as projectiles – firing a 14&amp;nbsp;kg cylinder up to 1500 m. This combined the gas volume of cylinders with the range of artillery.

Over the years, there were some refinements in this technique. In the 1950s and early 1960s, chemical artillery rockets and [[cluster bomb]]s contained a multitude of submunitions, so that a large number of small clouds of the chemical agent would form directly on the target.

====Thermal dissemination====
[[File:Mc-1 gas bomb.png|thumb|An American-made [[MC-1]] gas bomb]]
Thermal dissemination is the use of [[explosive]]s or [[pyrotechnic]]s to deliver chemical agents. This technique, developed in the 1920s, was a major improvement over earlier dispersal techniques, in that it allowed significant quantities of an agent to be disseminated over a considerable distance. Thermal dissemination remains the principal method of disseminating chemical agents today.

Most thermal dissemination devices consist of a [[bomb]] or [[shell (projectile)|projectile shell]] that contains a chemical agent and a central &quot;burster&quot; charge; when the burster detonates, the agent is expelled laterally.

Thermal dissemination devices, though common, are not particularly efficient. First, a percentage of the agent is lost by incineration in the initial blast and by being forced onto the ground. Second, the sizes of the particles vary greatly because explosive dissemination produces a mixture of liquid droplets of variable and difficult to control sizes.

The efficacy of thermal detonation is greatly limited by the flammability of some agents. For flammable [[Particulate|aerosols]], the cloud is sometimes totally or partially ignited by the disseminating explosion in a phenomenon called ''flashing''. Explosively disseminated [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] will ignite roughly one third of the time. Despite a great deal of study, flashing is still not fully understood, and a solution to the problem would be a major technological advance.

Despite the limitations of central bursters, most nations use this method in the early stages of chemical weapon development, in part because standard munitions can be adapted to carry the agents.

====Aerodynamic dissemination====
Aerodynamic dissemination is the non-explosive delivery of a chemical agent from an aircraft, allowing aerodynamic stress to disseminate the agent. This technique is the most recent major development in chemical agent dissemination, originating in the mid-1960s.

This technique eliminates many of the limitations of thermal dissemination by eliminating the flashing effect and theoretically allowing precise control of particle size. In actuality, the altitude of dissemination, wind direction and velocity, and the direction and velocity of the aircraft greatly influence particle size. There are other drawbacks as well; ideal deployment requires precise knowledge of [[aerodynamics]] and [[fluid dynamics]], and because the agent must usually be dispersed within the [[boundary layer]] (less than 200–300&amp;nbsp;ft above the ground), it puts pilots at risk.

Significant research is still being applied toward this technique. For example, by modifying the properties of the liquid, its breakup when subjected to aerodynamic stress can be controlled and an idealized particle distribution achieved, even at [[supersonic speed]]. Additionally, advances in fluid dynamics, [[computer model]]ing, and [[weather forecasting]] allow an ideal direction, speed, and altitude to be calculated, such that warfare agent of a predetermined particle size can predictably and reliably hit a target.

===Protection against chemical warfare===
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - &quot;Yanshuf&quot; Battalion Soldiers at ABC Warfare Exercise, Nov 2010.jpg|thumb|Israel Defense Forces &quot;Yanshuf&quot; battalion soldiers at chemical warfare defense exercise]]
Ideal protection begins with nonproliferation treaties such as the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], and detecting, very early, the ''signatures'' of someone building a chemical weapons capability. These include a wide range of intelligence disciplines, such as economic analysis of exports of [[dual-use]] chemicals and equipment, human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) such as diplomatic, refugee, and agent reports; photography from satellites, aircraft and drones ([[IMINT]]); examination of captured equipment ([[TECHINT]]); communications intercepts ([[COMINT]]); and detection of chemical manufacturing and chemical agents themselves ([[Materials MASINT#Chemical Warfare and Improvised Chemical Devices|MASINT]]).

Since industrial accidents can cause dangerous chemical releases (e.g., the [[Bhopal disaster]]), these activities are things that civilian, as well as military, organizations must be prepared to carry out. In civilian situations in [[Developed country|developed countries]], these are duties of [[HAZMAT]] organizations, which most commonly are part of fire departments.

Detection has been referred to above, as a technical [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence|MASINT]] discipline; specific military procedures, which are usually the model for civilian procedures, depend on the equipment, expertise, and personnel available. When chemical agents are detected, an [[alarm]] needs to sound, with specific warnings over emergency broadcasts and the like. There may be a warning to expect an attack.

If, for example, the captain of a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] ship believes there is a serious threat of chemical, biological, or radiological attack, the crew may be ordered to set Circle William, which means closing all openings to outside air, running breathing air through filters, and possibly starting a system that continually washes down the exterior surfaces. Civilian authorities dealing with an attack or a toxic chemical accident will invoke the [[Incident Command System]], or local equivalent, to coordinate defensive measures.&lt;ref name=FM3-11-34 /&gt;

Individual protection starts with a [[conflict gas mask|gas mask]] and, depending on the nature of the threat, through various levels of protective clothing up to a complete chemical-resistant suit with a self-contained air supply. The US military defines various levels of [[MOPP (protective gear)|MOPP]] (mission-oriented protective posture) from mask to full chemical resistant suits; [[Hazmat suit]]s are the civilian equivalent, but go farther to include a fully independent air supply, rather than the filters of a gas mask.

Collective protection allows continued functioning of groups of people in buildings or shelters, the latter which may be fixed, mobile, or improvised. With ordinary buildings, this may be as basic as plastic sheeting and tape, although if the protection needs to be continued for any appreciable length of time, there will need to be an air supply, typically an enhanced gas mask.&lt;ref name=CDC-MMWR-2002-09-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FM3-11-34 /&gt;

====Decontamination====
Decontamination varies with the particular chemical agent used. Some ''nonpersistent'' agents, including most pulmonary agents ([[chlorine]], [[phosgene]], and so on), [[blood gases]], and nonpersistent nerve gases (e.g., [[sarin|GB]]), will dissipate from open areas, although powerful exhaust fans may be needed to clear out buildings where they have accumulated.

In some cases, it might be necessary to neutralize them chemically, as with [[ammonia]] as a neutralizer for [[hydrogen cyanide]] or [[chlorine]]. Riot control agents such as [[CS gas|CS]] will dissipate in an open area, but things contaminated with CS powder need to be aired out, washed by people wearing protective gear, or safely discarded.

[[Mass decontamination]] is a less common requirement for people than equipment, since people may be immediately affected and treatment is the action required. It is a requirement when people have been contaminated with persistent agents. Treatment and decontamination may need to be simultaneous, with the medical personnel protecting themselves so they can function.&lt;ref name=Ciottone2007&gt;{{citation

There may need to be immediate intervention to prevent death, such as injection of [[atropine]] for nerve agents. Decontamination is especially important for people contaminated with persistent agents; many of the fatalities after the [[Air Raid on Bari|explosion of a WWII US ammunition ship carrying sulfur mustard]], in the harbor of Bari, Italy, after a German bombing on December 2, 1943, came when rescue workers, not knowing of the contamination, bundled cold, wet seamen in tight-fitting blankets.

For decontaminating equipment and buildings exposed to persistent agents, such as [[blister agent]]s, [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] or other agents made persistent by mixing with a thickener, special equipment and materials might be needed. Some type of neutralizing agent will be needed; e.g. in the form of a spraying device with neutralizing agents such as Chlorine, Fichlor, strong alkaline solutions or enzymes. In other cases, a specific chemical decontaminant will be required.&lt;ref name=FM3-11-34 /&gt;

==Sociopolitical climate==
The study of chemicals and their military uses was widespread in China and India. The use of toxic materials has historically been viewed with mixed emotions and moral qualms in the West. The practical and ethical problems surrounding poison warfare appeared in ancient Greek myths about Hercules' invention of poison arrows and Odysseus's use of toxic projectiles. There are many instances of the use of chemical weapons in battles documented in Greek and Roman historical texts; the earliest example was the deliberate poisoning of Kirrha's water supply with [[hellebore]] in the [[First Sacred War]], Greece, about 590 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Mayor, &quot;Greek Fire, Poison Arrows &amp; Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World&quot; Overlook-Duckworth, 2003, rev ed with new Introduction 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest reactions to the use of chemical agents was from [[Military history of the Roman Empire|Rome]]. Struggling to defend themselves from the [[Roman legion]]s, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes poisoned the wells of their enemies, with Roman jurists having been recorded as declaring &quot;armis bella non venenis geri&quot;, meaning &quot;war is fought with [[weapon]]s, not with [[poison]]s.&quot; Yet the Romans themselves resorted to poisoning wells of besieged cities in Anatolia in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayor 2003&quot;&gt;Mayor 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1915 the use of poisonous chemicals in battle was typically the result of local initiative, and not the result of an active government chemical weapons program. There are many reports of the isolated use of chemical agents in individual battles or [[siege]]s, but there was no true tradition of their use outside of [[incendiary device|incendiaries]] and smoke. Despite this tendency, there have been several attempts to initiate large-scale implementation of poison gas in several wars, but with the notable exception of World War I, the responsible authorities generally rejected the proposals for ethical reasons or fears of retaliation.

For example, in 1854 [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] (later 1st Baron Playfair, GCB, PC, FRS (1818–1898), a [[United Kingdom|British]] chemist, proposed using a cacodyl [[cyanide]]-filled [[artillery]] shell against enemy ships during the [[Crimean War]]. The British Ordnance Department rejected the proposal as &quot;as bad a mode of warfare as poisoning the wells of the enemy.&quot;

===Chemical weapon proliferation===
{{Main|Chemical weapon proliferation}}

Despite numerous efforts to reduce or eliminate them, some nations continue to research and/or stockpile chemical warfare agents. To the right is a summary of the nations that have either declared weapon stockpiles or are suspected of secretly stockpiling or possessing CW research programs. Notable examples include [[United States]] and [[Russia]].

In 1997, future [[Vice President of the United States|US Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] opposed the signing ratification of a treaty banning the use of chemical weapons, a recently unearthed letter shows. In a letter dated April 8, 1997, then Halliburton-CEO Cheney told Sen. [[Jesse Helms]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], that it would be a mistake for America to join the convention.  &quot;Those nations most likely to comply with the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] are not likely to ever constitute a military threat to the United States.  The governments we should be concerned about are likely to cheat on the CWC, even if they do participate,&quot; reads the letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://fas.org/cw/cwc_archive/cheneyletter_4-8-97.pdf |title=In Surprise Testimony Cheney Renews Opposition to CWC |publisher=United States Senate |date=April 8, 1997 |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |postscript=. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217171905/https://fas.org/cw/cwc_archive/cheneyletter_4-8-97.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Federation of American Scientists]].

The CWC was ratified by the Senate that same month. Since then, Albania, Libya, Russia, the United States, and India have declared over 71,000 metric tons of chemical weapon stockpiles, and destroyed about a third of them. Under the terms of the agreement, the United States and Russia agreed to eliminate the rest of their supplies of chemical weapons by 2012. Not having met its goal, the U.S. government estimates remaining stocks will be destroyed by 2017.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}{{update inline|date=August 2018}}

===India===
In June 1997, India declared that it had a stockpile of 1044 tons of sulphur mustard in its possession. India's declaration of its stockpile came after its entry into the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], that created the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]], and on January 14, 1993 India became one of the original signatories to the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. By 2005, from among six nations that had declared their possession of chemical weapons, India was the only country to meet its deadline for chemical weapons destruction and for inspection of its facilities by the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3987660.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106050759/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3987660.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2012|title=India declares its stock of chemical weapons|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/world/2007/12/30/26543/India-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-stockpile-by-2009 |title=India to destroy chemical weapons stockpile by 2009 |publisher=DominicanToday.com |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907155755/http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/world/2007/12/30/26543/India-to-destroy-chemical-weapons-stockpile-by-2009 |archivedate=September 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons and material stockpile and was granted an extension to complete a 100 percent destruction of its stocks by April 2009.

The Director-General of the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]], Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter, welcomed Iraq's decision to join the OPCW as a significant step to strengthening global and regional efforts to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons. The OPCW announced &quot;The government of Iraq has deposited its instrument of accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention with the Secretary General of the United Nations and within 30 days, on 12 February 2009, will become the 186th State Party to the Convention&quot;.

===Russia===
Russia signed into the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] on January 13, 1993 and ratified it on November 5, 1995. Declaring an arsenal of 39,967 tons of chemical weapons in 1997, by far the largest arsenal, consisting of blister agents: [[Lewisite]], [[Sulfur mustard]], Lewisite-mustard mix, and nerve agents: [[Sarin]], [[Soman]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]. Russia met its treaty obligations by destroying 1 percent of its chemical agents by the 2002 deadline set out by the Chemical Weapons Convention, but requested an extension on the deadlines of 2004 and 2007 due to technical, financial, and environmental challenges of chemical disposal. Since, Russia has received help from other countries such as Canada which donated C$100,000, plus a further C$100,000 already donated, to the Russian Chemical Weapons Destruction Program. This money will be used to complete work at Shchuch'ye and support the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at Kizner (Russia), where the destruction of nearly 5,700 tons of nerve agent, stored in approximately 2&amp;nbsp;million artillery shells and munitions, will be undertaken. Canadian funds are also being used for the operation of a Green Cross Public Outreach Office, to keep the civilian population informed on the progress made in chemical weapons destruction activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opcw.org/news/article/canada-contributes-to-russiarsquos-chemical-weapons-destruction-programme/ |title=Canada Contributes to Russia's Chemical Weapons Destruction Programme |publisher=Opcw.org |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426233831/http://www.opcw.org/news/article/canada-contributes-to-russiarsquos-chemical-weapons-destruction-programme/ |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons}}
On November 25, 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] unilaterally renounced the use of chemical weapons and renounced all methods of biological warfare. He issued a decree halting the production and transport of all chemical weapons which remains in effect. From May 1964 to the early 1970s the USA participated in [[Operation CHASE]], a [[United States Department of Defense]] program that aimed to dispose of chemical weapons by sinking ships laden with the weapons in the deep Atlantic. After the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972]], Operation Chase was scrapped and safer disposal methods for chemical weapons were researched, with the U.S. destroying several thousand tons of sulfur mustard by incineration at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, and nearly 4,200 tons of nerve agent by chemical neutralisation at Tooele Army Depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/co/rkymtnarsenal/ |title=Rocky Mountain Arsenal &amp;#124; Region 8 &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. ratified the Geneva Protocol which banned the use of chemical and biological weapons on January 22, 1975. In 1989 and 1990, the U.S. and the Soviet Union entered an agreement to both end their chemical weapons programs, including binary weapons. In April 1997, the United States ratified the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], this banned the possession of most types of chemical weapons. It also banned the development of chemical weapons, and required the destruction of existing stockpiles, precursor chemicals, production facilities, and their weapon delivery systems.

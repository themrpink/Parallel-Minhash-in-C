Apulia was an autonomous [[duchy]] until 1130 when its duke became king of Sicily.  After 1282, when the kingdom [[War of the Sicilian Vespers|lost]] the island of [[Sicily]] itself, Apulia remained part of the remnant [[Kingdom of Naples]] (confusingly known also as the Kingdom of Sicily), and remained so until the unification of Italy in 1861. This kingdom was independent under the House of Anjou from 1282 to 1442, then was part of [[Aragon]] until 1458, after which it was again independent under a cadet branch of the [[House of Trastámara]] until 1501. As a result of the French–Spanish war of 1501–1504, Naples again came under the rule of Aragon and the Spanish Empire from 1504 to 1714. When [[Barbary pirates]] of North Africa sacked [[Vieste]] in 1554, they took an estimated 7,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asaolu|first1=Richard Oluseyi|title=Slavery:Abolition|date=n.d.|publisher=Pedia|location=Mainz|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTXuW0zptegC&amp;q=vieste+1554+slaves&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coast of Apulia was [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|occupied]] at times by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and at other times by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dursteler|first1=Eric R., ed.|title=A Companion to Venetian History, 1400-1797|date=2013|publisher=Koninklejke|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9004252516|pages=142–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ascAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=apulia&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;David Gilmour, ''The Pursuit of Italy: A History of a Land, Its Regions and their Peoples'' (2012), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The region's contribution to Italy's [[gross value added]] was around 4.6% in 2000, while its population was 7% of the total. The per capita GDP is low compared to the national average and represents about 68.1% of the EU average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenreport.it/contenuti/leggi.php?id_cont=11969 |title=Eurostat |publisher=Greenreport |accessdate=2 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424084354/http://www.greenreport.it/contenuti/leggi.php?id_cont=11969 |archivedate=24 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of gross value added by the agricultural and services sectors was above the national average in 2000. The region has industries specialising in particular areas, including food processing and vehicles in [[Foggia]]; footwear and textiles in the [[Barletta]] area, and wood and furniture in the Murge area to the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;c.europa.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_eco.htm | title = Puglia - Economy | work = Portrait of the Regions | publisher=Eurostat |date=  March 2004 |accessdate= 8 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821143316/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_eco.htm |archivedate=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2013 the economy of Apulia expanded more than that of the rest of southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Monteduro, Pierangelo Buongiorno, Saverio Di Benedetto, ''Law and Agroecology: A Transdisciplinary Dialogue'' (2015), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Such growth, over several decades, is a severe challenge to the hydrogeological system.&lt;ref&gt;Amílcar Soares, Maria João Pereira, Roussos Dimitrakopoulos! '' geoENV VI – Geostatistics for Environmental Application'' (2008), p. 191: &quot;The approach highlighted the widespread degradation of water resources in the Apulian groundwater. ... Above all the rapid socio-economic growth over the last decades has caused severe stress to the Apulian hydrogeological system.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Apulia's thriving economy is articulated into numerous sectors boasting several leading companies: Aerospace ([[Sitael]], [[Blackshape]], [[Leonardo S.p.A.]]); 
Agriculture ([[Casillo Group]], [[G.C. Partecipazioni]]), Automotive ([[Getrag]], a subsidiary of [[Magna International]]); Food and Beverage (De Carlo, [[Divella]],  Quarta Caffé); Furniture ([[Natuzzi]]); ICT ([[:it:Exprivia|Exprivia]]); Mechanics ([[Isotta Fraschini Motori]], [[MERMEC]]); Publishing  ([[:it:Casa editrice Giuseppe Laterza &amp; figli|Laterza]], [[:it:Edizioni Dedalo|Edizioni Dedalo]]), Tourism ([[Nicolaus tour]]), Logistics ([[GTS Rail]]).

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 18.8% in 2017 and was higher than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=de&amp;pcode=tgs00010&amp;plugin=1|title=Regional Unemployment by NUTS2 Region|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105202703/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=de&amp;pcode=tgs00010&amp;plugin=1|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olive cultivars===
There are an estimated 50 to 60 million olive trees in Apulia, and the region accounts for 40% of Italy's olive oil production. There are four specific [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) covering the whole region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oliveoilsitaly.com/extra-virgin-oil/apulia/ PDO status] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706050340/https://www.oliveoilsitaly.com/extra-virgin-oil/apulia/ |date=6 July 2018 }}- Retrieved 6 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Olive varieties include: ''Baresane'', ''Biancolilla'', ''Brandofino'' (Castiglione), ''Buscionetto'' (Biancolilla), ''Carolea'', ''Cellina di Nardò'', ''Cerasuola'' (Ogliara), ''Cerignola'' (Bella di Cerignola), ''Cima di Bitonto'', ''Cima di Mola'', ''Coratina'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artecibo.com/the-coratina-olive Coratina olive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706074950/http://www.artecibo.com/the-coratina-olive |date=6 July 2018 }}- Retrieved 5 July 2019&lt;/ref&gt; also grown in Corning, CA., a 2018 Gold Medal New York International Olive Oil Competition (NYIOOC) winner,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lucerooliveoil.com/coratina-extra-virgin-olive-oil.html Coratina olives in Ca.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706051827/https://www.lucerooliveoil.com/coratina-extra-virgin-olive-oil.html |date=6 July 2018 }}- Retrieved 5 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frantoio'', ''Garganica'', ''La Minuta'', ''Leccino'', ''Moresca'', ''Nocellara Etnea'', ''Nocellara Messinese'', ''Ogliarola'', ''Ogliarola Barese'', ''Ogliara Messinese'', ''Ottobratica'', ''Peranzana'' that is produced as &quot;Certified Ultra-Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oliveoilemporium.com/OnlineStore/ProductList/ExtraVirginOliveOils/tabid/138/CategoryID/0/List/0/Level/a/ProductID/250/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2CProductName Peranzana olive oil]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}- Retrieved 5 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rotondella'', ''Santagatese'', ''Saracena'', ''Tonda Iblea'', and ''Verdello'' (subspecies of San Benedetto).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dopitalianfood.com/en/brands-dop-italian-food/olive-oil-pdo-pgi/item/437-land-of-bari-olive-oil-p-d-o.html Apulia region cultivars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706075050/http://www.dopitalianfood.com/en/brands-dop-italian-food/olive-oil-pdo-pgi/item/437-land-of-bari-olive-oil-p-d-o.html |date=6 July 2018 }}- Retrieved 20180-7-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thethinkingtraveller.com/thinkpuglia/guide-to-puglia/geography-of-puglia/a-carpet-of-olive-trees.aspx Puglia olive cultivars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706075026/https://www.thethinkingtraveller.com/thinkpuglia/guide-to-puglia/geography-of-puglia/a-carpet-of-olive-trees.aspx |date=6 July 2018 }}- Retrieved 5 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Xylella fastidiosa'' disease====
Since the years 2008-2010, the olive oil industry in Apulia is under threat from the pathogen ''[[Xylella fastidiosa]]'', a disease which inhibits the uptake of water and nutrients by the trees. The epicenter of the epidemic in the region is its south-eastern part.

==Transport==

The region has a good network of roads, but the railway network is less comprehensive, particularly in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;c.europa.eu&quot; /&gt; The region is crossed northwest to southeast by the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14 highway]] (Bologna–Taranto), which connects the region capital, [[Bari]], to [[Taranto]], the second most populous city in the region. The A14 also connects [[Foggia]] and points further north along the Adriatic coast to [[Pescara]], [[Ancona]], [[Rimini]] and eventually, [[Bologna]]. The only other highway in the region is the [[Autostrada A16 (Italy)|A16]] (Napoli–Canosa), which crosses the Italian peninsula east–west and links the region with [[Napoli]].

There are two international airports, [[Bari Karol Wojtyła Airport|Karol Wojtyla Airport]] in Bari ([[IATA]]: '''BRI''') and [[Brindisi Airport]] (IATA: '''BDS'''), which serves as the principal logistical hub for the United Nations Global Service Center headquartered in [[Brindisi]].
With the approval of a redevelopment project in 2018, the [[Grottaglie Airfield]] (IATA: '''TAR''') will host a [[spaceport]] for the [[Italian Space Agency]] and [[Virgin Galactic]].

Emigration from the region's depressed areas to northern Italy and the rest of Europe was very intense in the years between 1956 and 1971. Subsequently, the trend declined, as economic conditions improved, to the point where there was net immigration in the years between 1982 and 1985. Since 1986 the stagnation in employment has led to a new inversion of the trend, caused by a decrease in immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=c.europa.eu |accessdate=22 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132805/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf4_pop.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Apulia}}

Since 1 June 2015, former [[judge]] and mayor of [[Bari]] [[Michele Emiliano]] of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] has served as President of the Apulian region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.regione.puglia.it/index.php?page=presidente&amp;opz=scheda&amp;dp_id=3|title = Scheda Personale|date = |accessdate = 17 October 2015|website = Sito web Istituzionale della Regione Puglia|last = |first = |language = Italian|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905113948/http://www.regione.puglia.it/index.php?page=presidente&amp;opz=scheda&amp;dp_id=3|archive-date = 5 September 2015|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.completamente.org/scarica/MicheleEmiliano.pdf|title = BIOGRAFIA|date = |accessdate = 5 September 2015|website = CompletaMente.org|last = |first = |language = Italian|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041852/http://www.completamente.org/scarica/MicheleEmiliano.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
{{main|Apulian cuisine}}
Cuisine plays an important role throughout Apulia. The key locally produced ingredients used there include [[olive oil]], [[artichoke]]s, [[tomatoes]], [[eggplants|aubergine]], [[asparagus]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacla.se/sitinazioni/australia/pagine/aus/aspassoperlitalia.lasso Around Italy: A look at Apulia the cuisine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001102315/http://www.sacla.se/sitinazioni/australia/pagine/aus/aspassoperlitalia.lasso |date=1 October 2016 }} at sacla.se, accessed 22 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In summer it is very common to use also the [[Carosello (melon)|carosello]], a variety of muskmelon which is often consumed in an immature state. Several PDO and PGI products are made in Apulia; among can be found some types of cheese like the [[Canestrato]] Pugliese PDO and [[Burrata|Burrata di Andria PGI]], of olive oil like the Collina di Brindisi PDO, Dauno PDO, Terra d'Otranto PDO, Terre Tarentine PDO and Terra di Bari PDO, some fruits and vegetables like the Arancia del Gargano PGI, Carciofo Brindisino PGI, Cipolla bianca di Margherita PGI, [[Clementine#Varieties|Clementine del Golfo di Taranto PGI]], La Bella della Daunia PDO, Limone femminello del Gargano PGI, Patata novella di Galatina PGI and [[Uva di Puglia PGI]]. Moreover, also a type of bread, [[Pane di Altamura|Pane di Altamura PDO]] and a legume called Lenticchia di Altamura PGI are present in the [[List of Italian products with protected designation of origin|list]].

====''Sagre'' food festivals====
Apulia’s ''[[Sagra (festival)|sagre]]'' festivals show off regional specialities and local culture. While not unique to Apulia - ''sagre'' food festivals are one of Italy’s best kept food secrets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Italy’s best-kept food secret: the sagra festival|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/22/italys-best-kept-food-secret-the-sagra-festival|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 November 2020|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; - food is an integral part of the region’s identity and these are intensely social occasions where you can feast side by side with locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Puglia’s sagre food festivals|url=https://www.gaypugliapodcast.com/mainguides/foodfestivals/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 November 2020|website=THe Big Gay Podcast from Puglia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Language===
As with the other regions of Italy, the national language (since 1861) is Italian. However, because of its long and varied history, other historical languages have been used in this region for centuries. In isolated pockets of the southern part of [[Salento]], a dialect of Greek called [[Griko]] is still spoken by a few thousand people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Ethnologue report for language code:ell|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528151907/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell|archivedate=28 May 2010|accessdate=22 April 2010|website=|publisher=Ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rare dialects of the [[Franco-Provençal language]] called [[Faetar]] and the closely related Cellese are spoken by a dwindling number of individuals in the mountain villages of [[Faeto]] and [[Celle di San Vito]], in the [[Province of Foggia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagy 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagy|first1=Naomi|title=A Multilingual Corpus to Explore Variation in Language Contact Situations|journal=Rassegna Italiana di Linguistica Applicata|date=2011|volume=43|issue=1–2|page=3|url=http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/ngn/pdf/Nagy_2011_RILA_HLVC.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204171730/http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/ngn/pdf/Nagy_2011_RILA_HLVC.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] dialect of the [[Albanian language]] has been spoken by a small community since refugees settled there in the 15th{{nbsp}}century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aae |title=Ethnologue report for language code:aae |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002125012/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aae |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT culture===
Apulia is known for its tolerance and openness. For many years it has been a major holiday destination for the Italian gay population. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=20 June 2009|title=Off the gaydar|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/20/gay-travel-hotspots-laidback-puglia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 September 2020|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long, hot summers, a diverse coastline of sandy beaches punctuated with rocky shelves and coves, surrounded by warm, azure seas and a vibrant nightlife means Apulia now draws an international gay crowd over the summer months. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Big Gay Podcast from Puglia - Gay Puglia Guide|url=https://www.gaypugliapodcast.com/faq/the-big-gay-puglia-faq/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 September 2020|website=The Big Gay Podcast from Puglia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sophisticated gay scene has developed around the southern [[Salento]] town of [[Gallipoli, Apulia|Gallipoli]] and the nearby lidos at Baia Verde, with visitors also being drawn by the secluded naturist beaches around the region, most famously at [[:it:Riserva_naturale_statale_Torre_Guaceto|Torre Guaceto]] and at D’Ayala beach Campomarino. Both have dedicated gay sections.

The region has three annual [[Pride parade]]s, including [[Salento Pride]].

It is the second most important economic centre of mainland [[Southern Italy]] after [[Naples]] (and the third after [[Palermo]], if [[Insular Italy]] is included), a [[port]] and [[university]] city, as well as the city of [[Saint Nicholas]]. The city itself has a population of 320,257 inhabitants, over {{convert|116|km2|mi2}}, while the  urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. The [[metropolitan area]] has 1.3&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants.

Bari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the [[Basilica di San Nicola|Basilica of Saint Nicholas]], the [[Cathedral of San Sabino]] (1035–1171) and the Hohenstaufen Castle built for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by [[Joachim Murat]]), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a [[promenade]] on the sea and the major shopping district (the ''via Sparano'' and ''via Argiro'').

Modern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s. The city has a redeveloped airport, [[Karol Wojtyła Airport]], with connections to several European cities.

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of Bari}}

=== Ancient ===
The city was probably founded by the [[Peucetii]]. The city had strong Greek influences&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Bari-Italy&lt;/ref&gt; and once it passed under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] rule in the 3rd century BC, it developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the [[Via Traiana]] and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to [[Taranto|Tarentum]] led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; The first historical bishop of [[Bishopric of Bari|Bari]] was [[Gervasius and Protasius|Gervasius]] who was noted at the [[Council of Sardica]] in 347. The bishops were dependent on the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] until the 10th century.

=== Middle Ages ===
After the devastations of the [[Gothic Wars]], under [[Lombards|Longobard]] rule a set of written regulations was established, the ''Consuetudines Barenses'', which influenced similar written constitutions in other southern cities. Until the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|arrival of the Normans]], Bari continued to be governed by the Longobards and Byzantines, with only occasional interruption.

Throughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major [[slavery|slave]] depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] from [[Dalmatia]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from what is now [[Prussia]] and [[Poland]], and the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba [[Mamluk]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Cartoon History of the Universe III – From the Rise of Arabia to the Renaissance (Volumes 14–19)| publisher = Doubleday| year = 2002| isbn = 0-393-32403-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 20 years, Bari was the centre of the [[Emirate of Bari]]; the city was captured by its first emirs [[Kalfun]] in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by [[Radelchis I of Benevento]].&lt;ref name=Wickham62&gt;{{cite book |author=Chris Wickham |title=Early Medieval Italy: Central Power and Local Society 400–1000 |location=Totowa |publisher=Barnes and Noble |year=1981 |pages=62, 154 |isbn=978-0-389-20217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was conquered and the emirate extinguished in 871 following [[Louis II's campaign against Bari (866–871)|five-year campaign]] by [[Emperor Louis II]], assisted by a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095 |author=Hilmar C.

The failed revolt (1009–1011) of the Lombard nobles [[Melus of Bari]] and his [[brother-in-law]] Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the [[Battle of Cannae (1018)]], offered their [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the [[Byzantius (archbishop of Bari)|Archbishop Byzantius]], Bari became attached to the [[Holy See|see of Rome]] and was granted &quot;[[province|provincial]]&quot; status.

In 1071, Bari was captured by [[Robert Guiscard]], following a [[Siege of Bari|three-year siege]]. [[Maio of Bari]] (died 1160), a Lombard merchant's son, was the third of the great admirals of Norman [[Sicily]]. The [[Basilica di San Nicola]] was founded in 1087 to receive the relics of this saint, which were surreptitiously brought from [[Myra]] in [[Lycia]], in Byzantine territory. The saint began his development from Saint Nicholas of Myra into Saint Nicholas of Bari and began to attract pilgrims, whose encouragement and care became central to the [[economy]] of Bari. In 1095 [[Peter the Hermit]] [[Preaching|preach]]ed the [[first crusade]] there.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; In October 1098, [[Urban II]], who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the [[Council of Bari]], one of a series of [[synod]]s convoked with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the [[filioque]] clause in the Creed, which [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] ably defended, seated at the [[pope]]'s side. The Greeks were not brought over to the Latin way of thinking, and the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] was inevitable.

A [[civil war]] broke out in Bari in 1117 with the murder of the archbishop, Riso. Control of Bari was seized by [[Grimoald, Prince of Bari|Grimoald Alferanites]], a native Lombard, and he was elected lord in opposition to the Normans. By 1123, he had increased ties with [[Byzantium]] and [[Venice]] and taken the title ''gratia Dei et beati Nikolai barensis princeps''. Grimoald increased the cult of St Nicholas in his city. He later did homage to [[Roger II of Sicily]], but rebelled and was defeated in 1132.

Bari was occupied by [[Manuel I Komnenos]] between 1155 and 1158. In 1246, Bari was sacked and razed to the ground; [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], repaired the fortress of Baris but it was subsequently destroyed several times. Bari recovered each time.

=== Early modern period ===
[[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella d’Aragona]], princess of [[Naples]] and widow of the Duke [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]] of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], enlarged the castle, which she made her residence, 1499–1524. After the death of Queen [[Bona Sforza]], of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], Bari came to be included in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and its history contracted to a local one, as [[malaria]] became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law [[Joachim Murat]]. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist [[grid plan]], which bears his name today as the ''Murattiano''. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] can be seen in the imposing architecture along the seafront.

=== World War II ===

On 11 September 1943, in connection with the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], Bari was taken without resistance by the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.

The [[Balkan Air Force]] supporting the [[Yugoslav partisans]] was based at Bari.

==== The 1943 chemical warfare disaster ====
{{further|Air raid on Bari}}
Through a tragic coincidence intended by neither of the opposing sides in [[World War II]], Bari gained the unwelcome distinction of being the only European city to experience [[chemical warfare]] in the course of that war.

On the night of 2 December 1943, 105 German [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers attacked the port of Bari, which was a key supply centre for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces fighting their way up the [[Italian Peninsula]]. Over 20 Allied ships were sunk in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. [[Liberty ship]] ''[[SS John Harvey|John Harvey]]'', which was carrying [[mustard gas]]; mustard gas was also reported to have been stacked on the quayside awaiting transport (the chemical agent was intended for retaliation if German forces had initiated chemical warfare). The presence of the gas was highly classified and the U.S. had not informed the British military authorities in the city of its existence. This increased the number of fatalities, since British physicians—who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas—prescribed treatment proper for those suffering from exposure and immersion, which proved fatal in many cases. Because rescuers were unaware they were dealing with gas casualties, many additional casualties were caused among the rescuers, through contact with the contaminated skin and clothing of those more directly exposed to the gas.

Following the attack, the harbor was closed for operations for three weeks and it did not return to full capacity until February 1944.

A member of U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid.  Alexander had trained at the Army's [[Edgewood Arsenal]] in New Jersey,{{citation needed|reason=Please check this reference; the link(?) identifies the Edgewood Arsenal as part of the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland|date=March 2016}} and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the ''John Harvey'', and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of [[chemotherapy]] based on mustard, [[Mustine]].&lt;ref name=Infield1976&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster at Bari |author=Glenn Infield |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-450-02659-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the orders of Allied leaders [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill]], and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book ''Disaster at Bari''.&lt;ref name=Infield1976/&gt; Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: &quot;[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq104-4.htm |title=US Naval Historical Center report |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112101131/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq104-4.htm |archive-date=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others put the count as high as &quot;more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889901210 Amazon book summary] of {{cite book |title=Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup |year=2001 |author=Gerald Reminick |publisher=Glencannon Press |isbn=978-1-889-90121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack, which became nicknamed &quot;The Little Pearl Harbor&quot; after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese air attack]] on the [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii|American naval base in Hawaii]], was highly destructive in itself, apart from the effects of the gas. Attribution of the causes of death to the gas, as distinct from the direct effects of the German attack, has proved far from easy.

The affair is the subject of two books: ''Disaster at Bari'', by Glenn B. Infield, and ''Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup'', by Gerald Reminick.

In 1988 through the efforts of [[Nick T. Spark]], U.S. Senators [[Dennis DeConcini]] and [[Bill Bradley]], Dr. Stewart Alexander received recognition from the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] for his actions during the Bari disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Mohave Daily Miner]] |location=Kingman, Arizona |date=May 20, 1988 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=943&amp;dat=19880520&amp;id=-61PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eVMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3824,2173744 |title=Tucson Senior Helps Retired Doctor Receive Military Honor |page=B8 |via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skateboards]] have the advantage of being so small and light that users can easily carry them when not skating.

The most efficient human-powered land vehicle is the [[bicycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cycling/humanpower1.html Science of Cycling: Human Power: page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the much more common [[upright bicycle]], the  [[recumbent bicycle]] may be faster on level ground or down hills due to better [[aerodynamics]] while having similar [[power transfer]] efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Velomobile]]s are increasingly popular in colder and/or wetter countries{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} due to the protection they offer against the environment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Freight bicycle]]s are used to transport [[cargo]]. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s can be used as [[taxicab]]s.

In 2016, AeroVelo cyclist Todd Reichert achieved the human-powered speed record of {{convert|142.04|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} with a [[velomobile]] at [[Battle Mountain, Nevada|Battle Mountain]], Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2016/results.htm|title = 2016 WHPSC 200 Meter Racing Results|accessdate = 2016-09-16|publisher = Wisil.recumbents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch cyclist [[Fred Rompelberg]] set a {{convert|268.8|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speed record at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]] on October 3, 1995 while cycling in the wake of a motor dragster pace-car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fredrompelberg.com/en/html/algemeen/fredrompelberg/record.asp |title=The formidable record of Fred Rompelberg and its development |publisher=Fredrompelberg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006053025/http://www.fredrompelberg.com/en/html/algemeen/fredrompelberg/record.asp |archive-date=2010-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wake of the pace-car reduced the aerodynamic drag against which Rompelberg pedalled to almost zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canosoarus.com/08LSRbicycle/LSR%20Bike01.htm |title=152 MPH Pedal Bicycle - Intro |publisher=Canosoarus.com |date=1985-07-20 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Kolodziejzyk set two world records recognized by both the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] and Guinness (TM) World Records on July 17, 2006 on a race track in [[Eureka, California]]. The first record is for the most distance traveled in 24 hours by human power {{convert|1041|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and the second for the world's fastest {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} time trial (23 hours, 2 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/ Greg Kolodziejzyk website]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both records were broken on August 6, 2010 by Christian von Ascheberg who drove {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in 19 hours, 27 minutes and managed to go {{convert|1219|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in 24 hours with his Milan SL [[Velomobile]]. In the same race he also raised the 12-hour record to {{convert|664.97|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, which is an average of {{convert|55.41|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

The ''[[Enea Bossi, Sr.#Pedaliante|Pedaliante]]'' flew short distances fully under human power in 1936, but the distances were not significant enough to win the prize of the Italian competition for which it was built. The flights were deemed to be a result of the pilot's significant strength and endurance, and not attainable by a typical human. Additional attempts were made in 1937 and 1938 using a catapult system, launching the plane to a height of {{convert|9|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. With the catapult launch, the plane successfully traveled the {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance outlined by the competition, but was declined the prize due to the takeoff method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/32-v10n1-1992.pdf Pedaliante]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JA/1970/PVJAPRE44154.pdf |title=Man-Powered Flight - Achievements to Date With a New Suggestion |access-date=2008-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201233/http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JA/1970/PVJAPRE44154.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883606,00.html?iid=chix-sphere | work=Time | title=Transport: Icarus to Bossi | date=8 February 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first officially authenticated regularly feasible take-off and landing of a human-powered aircraft (one capable of powered takeoffs, unlike a [[glider aircraft|glider]]) was made on 9 November 1961 by [[Derek Piggott]] in [[Southampton University]]'s Man Powered Aircraft ([[SUMPAC]]).

Perhaps the best-known human-powered plane is the [[Gossamer Albatross]], which flew across the [[English Channel]] in 1979.

The current distance and duration record recognised by the FAI, a straight distance of {{convert|115.11|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 3 hours and 54 minutes, was achieved on 23 April 1988 from [[Heraklion]] on [[Crete]] to [[Santorini]] in a [[MIT Daedalus]] 88 piloted by Kanellos Kanellopoulos.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The current speed record is held by the Monarch B, built by a team at MIT in 1983, which won a Kremer Prize of Â£20,000 for sustaining a speed of over {{convert|30|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} over a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} triangular course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bhpfc.org.uk/the-kremer-prize/|title=The Kremer Prize {{!}} BHPFC|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Helicopters=====
{{main|Human-powered helicopter}} 
The first officially observed human-powered helicopter to have left the ground was the [[Da Vinci III]] in 1989. It was designed and built by students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in California, USA. It flew for 7.1 seconds and reached a height of {{convert|8|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The second was the Yuri I in 1994, designed and built by students at Nihon University in Japan. It flew for 19.46 seconds and reached an altitude of {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. On 13 June 2013, the [[AeroVelo Atlas]] was the first to complete a flight that lasted 64 seconds and reached an altitude of 3.3 meters, thus winning the [[Sikorsky Prize]].

====Watercraft====

Human-powered watercraft include prehistoric, historic and well-known traditional and sporting craft such as canoes, rowing boats and [[galley]]s. The term ''human-powered boat'' is often used for more modern craft using propellers and water wheels for propulsion. These can be more efficient than paddles or oars and especially allow the use of the leg muscles which are generally stronger than arm muscles, even for non-athletes. Competitive rowing boats use sliding seats to engage the legs for propulsion with an oar for this reason, but require considerable skill to use efficiently. In addition, there is little skill required for forward propulsion while looking forwards and craft such as [[pedalo]]s are popular at resorts.

=====Hydrofoils=====
Hydrofoils have less water resistance at the highest speeds attainable by humans and are thus usually faster than displacement boats on short courses. The world speed record on water was set 27 October 1991 by MIT professor Mark Drela who pedalled a [[human-powered hydrofoil]], &quot;[[Decavitator]]&quot;, to 18.5 knots (21.3&amp;nbsp;mph)(9.53 meters/second) over a 100-meter course in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, US.

=====Submarines=====
In 1989, the first human-powered International Submarine Race (ISR) was held in Florida with 17 craft. Since then nine more races have been held. The races themselves have been moved from the waters of Florida to the  [[David Taylor Model Basin]] at the [[Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center]] in Bethesda, Maryland, and are held biennially. At the 9th ISR in 2007 (in which 23 submarines participated) several new records were set: A single-person craft, [[Omer5]] achieved a record speed of 8.035 knots breaking the Omer team's previous record of 7.19 knots set by Omer 4 in 2004. Also Omer 6 snatched up a record for non-propeller driven craft with a speed of 4.642 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isrsubrace.org/ |title=International Submarine Races |publisher=Isrsubrace.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iolanthe; or, The Peer and the Peri''''' ({{IPAc-en|aÉª|.|oÊ|Ë|l|Ã¦|n|Î¸|iË}}) is a [[comic opera]] with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]]. It is one of the [[Savoy opera]]s and is the seventh of fourteen operatic collaborations by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In the opera, the [[fairy]] Iolanthe has been banished from fairyland because she married a mortal; this is forbidden by fairy law. Her son, Strephon, is an [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]n shepherd who wants to marry Phyllis, a [[Ward (law)|Ward]] of [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]]. All the members of the [[House of Lords|House of Peers]] also want to marry Phyllis. When Phyllis sees Strephon hugging a young woman (not knowing that it is his mother â immortal fairies all appear young), she assumes the worst and sets off a climactic confrontation between the peers and the fairies. The opera [[satire|satirises]] many aspects of British government, law and society. The confrontation between the fairies and the peers is a version of one of Gilbert's favourite themes: a tranquil civilisation of women is disrupted by a male-dominated world through the discovery of mortal love.

''Iolanthe'' opened in London on 25 November 1882, at the [[Savoy Theatre]] to a warm reception, and ran for 398 performances, the fourth consecutive hit by Gilbert and Sullivan. It was the first work to premiere at the Savoy (although ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' had transferred to the theatre in 1881) and was the first new theatre production in the world to be illuminated entirely with electric lights, permitting some special effects that had not been possible in the era of [[Gas lighting#Theatrical use|gas lighting]]. The opera opened simultaneously in New York, and touring companies were sent around the UK and US to play the piece. The first Australasian touring production followed in 1885, and the opera was revived in London beginning in 1901. The [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] toured the opera nearly continuously in repertory from 1891 until 1982, and made several recordings of the opera over that period. Numerous other professional and amateur productions have been given of this enduring work, and various other recordings have been issued.

==Background==
[[File:Iolanthe Programme.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Programme from 1883 during the original run]]
[[W. S. Gilbert]] presented his basic idea for a new opera to [[Arthur Sullivan]] in October 1881. Gilbert's earliest ideas for the story of ''Iolanthe'' originated in his ''[[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]]'', &quot;The Fairy Curate&quot;: &quot;Once a fairy / Light and airy / Married with a mortal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The fairy marries a &quot;prosaic&quot; attorney and bears him a son. After her son grows up, she visits him on Earth, but she is mistaken for his lover, since fairies perpetually appear young and beautiful.&lt;ref name=Crowther158&gt;Crowther, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan found the premise funny, and Gilbert set to work on fleshing out the story. By December, he had written some lyrics for Sullivan to look at, but he struggled with the plot for several months, whereas he had dashed off earlier operas in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 204â205; Bradley, p. 358; and Crowther, pp. 167 and 170&lt;/ref&gt; During these months, Sullivan took an extended trip to Egypt, Italy and elsewhere. Upon his return to London in April 1882, he moved into a new home; in May, his beloved mother died rather suddenly.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 172â173&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of July 1882, Gilbert had supplied Sullivan with lyrics to several of the songs, and Sullivan began work setting them to music. Over the next two months, Sullivan met Gilbert to discuss the libretto as more lyrics were completed. Music rehearsals began in September, and staging began in October, scheduled around performances of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s previous opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', which had transferred to the [[Savoy Theatre]] a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, pp. 167â169&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was still composing more numbers for the opera until 20 October, with a few modifications continuing into early November. Uncharacteristically, Sullivan composed the overture himself, instead of assigning it to an assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 211â215&lt;/ref&gt; Two casts rehearsed simultaneously, as the opera was to open on the same night in London and New York City, a historic first for any play.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had targeted the aristocracy and political officials for satiric treatment in earlier works. In this opera, the [[House of Lords]] is lampooned as a bastion of the ineffective, privileged and dim-witted, whose only qualification to govern is noble birth. The political party system, the law and other institutions also come in for a dose of satire. Throughout ''Iolanthe'', however, both author and composer managed to couch the criticism among such bouncy, amiable absurdities and &quot;splendid pageantry&quot; that it is all received as good humour, with Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] complimenting the opera's good taste.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, p. 171; and Bradley, pp. 357â358&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Gilbert later refused to allow quotes from the piece to be used as part of the campaign to diminish the powers of the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Although titled ''Iolanthe'' all along in Gilbert's plot book,&lt;ref&gt;Tillett ''et al.'' 1982, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; for a time the piece was advertised as ''Perola'' and rehearsed under that name.   According to an often-repeated myth, Gilbert and Sullivan did not change the name to ''Iolanthe'' until just before the premiÃ¨re.&lt;ref&gt;Baily 1952, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, however, the title was advertised as ''Iolanthe'' as early as 13 November 1882 &amp;ndash; eleven days before the opening &amp;ndash; so the cast had at least that much time to learn the name. It is also clear that Sullivan's musical setting was written to match the cadence of the word &quot;Iolanthe,&quot; and could only accommodate the word &quot;Perola&quot; by preceding it (awkwardly) with &quot;O&quot;, &quot;Come&quot; or &quot;Ah&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, ''et al.'' 1982, pp. 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Irving]] had produced a [[W. G. Wills]] adaptation of ''[[King RenÃ©âs Daughter]]'' in London in 1880, under the name ''Iolanthe'', and in October 1882 Gilbert asked his producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], to request Irving's permission to use the name. It is not known whether Irving replied.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 212â13; and Bradley, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iolanthe'' premiered only three days after ''Patience'' closed at the Savoy. The Savoy Theatre, opened only a year earlier, was a state-of-the-art facility, the first theatre in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. ''Patience'' had transferred to the Savoy from the [[Opera Comique]], upon the theatre's opening, but ''Iolanthe'' was the first show to premiere at the theatre. New lighting technologies made such special effects as sparkling fairy wands possible for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavoyTheatre.htm &quot;The Savoy Theatre, Strand, WC2&quot;], ArthurLloyd.co.uk, accessed 25 October 2018; and Davis, Carol E.

On the first night [[Alice Barnett]], as the Queen of the Fairies, sang the verses directly to Captain Shaw, who was sitting in the centre of the [[Stalls (theatre)|stalls]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 216â217&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera's premiere was received by an enthusiastic audience and earned critical praise,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; although there was general agreement that the second act needed some trimming.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iolanthe'' became the fourth consecutive major success for Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, following ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878), ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879) and ''Patience'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 145â225&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly viewing his work with Gilbert as frivolous, beneath his skills and repetitious, Sullivan had intended to resign from the partnership with Gilbert and Carte after ''Iolanthe'', but on the day of its premiere, he received a letter from his broker, Edward Hall, notifying him that Hall had lost all his money, including Â£7,000 of Sullivan's investments, the bulk of his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 199 and 217&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's lifestyle was not inexpensive, and he was helping to support his late brother's large family,&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 8â9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his mistress, [[Fanny Ronalds]], and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.php &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723140938/http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.php |date=23 July 2008 }}, Madison Savoyards.org (2005), accessed 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He soon concluded that the only certain way to restore his financial security was to continue writing [[Savoy opera]]s. On 8 February 1883, he signed a new five-year creative partnership agreement with Gilbert and Carte; Gilbert was already at work on their next piece, ''[[Princess Ida]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 218â219&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 May 1883, Sullivan was [[Knight bachelor|knight]]ed by [[Queen Victoria]] for his &quot;services ... rendered to the promotion of the art of music&quot; in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
'''Act I'''

The beloved fairy Iolanthe, who arranged the fairies' songs and dances, committed the capital crime (under fairy law) of marrying a mortal man. The Queen of the fairies commuted Iolanthe's sentence of death to banishment for life on the condition that she left her husband and never communicated with him again.  After the passage of 25 years, the fairies, still missing Iolanthe deeply, plead with their Queen to pardon Iolanthe and to restore her place in fairyland (&quot;Tripping hither, tripping thither&quot;).

Summoned by the Fairy Queen (&quot;Iolanthe! From thy dark exile thou art summoned&quot;), Iolanthe rises from the frog-infested stream that has been her home in exile. The Queen, unable to bear punishing her any longer, pardons Iolanthe, who is warmly greeted by the other fairies. Iolanthe tells her sisters that she has a son, Strephon, noting that he's a fairy down to the waist, but his legs are mortal. The fairies laugh that Iolanthe appears too young to have a grown son, as one of the advantages of a fairy's immortality is that they never grow old. Strephon, a handsome [[Arcadia]]n shepherd, arrives and meets his aunts (&quot;Good-morrow, good mother&quot;). He tells Iolanthe of his love for the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s [[Ward (law)|ward of court]], the beautiful Phyllis, who does not know of Strephon's mixed origin. Strephon is despondent, however, as the Lord Chancellor has forbidden them to marry, partly because he feels that a shepherd is unsuitable for Phyllis, but partly because the Lord Chancellor wishes to marry Phyllis himself. In fact, so do half the members of Britain's [[House of Lords]]. The Fairy Queen promises her assistance (&quot;Fare thee well, attractive stranger&quot;). Soon Phyllis arrives, and she and Strephon share a moment of tenderness as they plan their future and possible elopement (&quot;Good-morrow, good lover&quot;; &quot;None shall part us from each other&quot;).

A cadre of the [[peerage|peer]]s of the realm arrive in noisy splendour (&quot;Loudly let the trumpet bray&quot;) with the Lord Chancellor (&quot;The law is the true embodiment&quot;). They are all smitten with Phyllis, and they have appealed to the Lord Chancellor to decide who will have her hand. The Lord Chancellor hesitates to act upon his own regard for Phyllis due to his position as her guardian. The Lords send for Phyllis to choose one of their number, but she will not marry any of them, as virtue is found only in a &quot;lowly&quot; cottage (&quot;My well-loved Lord&quot; and &quot;Nay, tempt me not&quot;). The peers beg her not to scorn them simply because of their &quot;[[Nobility|blue blood]]&quot; (&quot;Spurn not the nobly born&quot; and &quot;My lords, it may not be&quot;). Strephon approaches the Lord Chancellor, pleading that Nature bids him marry Phyllis. But the Lord Chancellor wryly notes that Strephon has not presented sufficient [[rules of evidence|evidence]] that Nature has interested herself in the matter. He refuses his consent to the marriage between Strephon and Phyllis (&quot;When I went to the Bar&quot;).

Disappointed, Strephon calls on Iolanthe for help.  She appears and promises to support her son. Spying on the two, the peers &amp;ndash; led by the brainless and stuffy Earls Tolloller and Mountararat &amp;ndash; together with Phyllis, see Iolanthe and Strephon in a warm embrace. All three jump to the obvious conclusion, since the centuries-old Iolanthe appears to be a girl of seventeen (&quot;When darkly looms the day&quot;). The peers scoff at the seemingly absurd claim that Iolanthe is Strephon's mother as Strephon pleads: &quot;She is, has been, my mother from my birth!&quot;  Phyllis angrily rejects Strephon for his supposed infidelity and declares that she will marry either Lord Tolloller or Lord Mountararat (&quot;...and I don't care which!&quot;). Strephon then calls for help from the fairies, who appear but are mistaken by the peers for a girls' school on an outing. Offended, the Fairy Queen pronounces a magical &quot;sentence&quot; upon the peers: Strephon shall not only become a [[Member of Parliament]], but will also have the power to pass any bill he proposes (&quot;With Strephon for your foe, no doubt&quot;).

'''Act II'''

Private Willis, on night guard duty, paces outside the [[Palace of Westminster]] and muses on political life (&quot;When all night long a chap remains&quot;). The fairies arrive and tease the peers about the success of [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Strephon, who is advancing a bill to open the peerage to competitive examination (&quot;Strephon's a member of Parliament&quot;). The peers ask the fairies to stop Strephon's mischief, stating that the House of Peers is not susceptible of any improvement (&quot;When Britain really ruled the waves&quot;). Although the fairies say that they cannot stop Strephon, they have become strongly attracted to the peers (&quot;In vain to us you plead&quot;). The fairy Queen is dismayed by this. Pointing to Private Willis of the First [[Grenadier Guards]], who is still on duty, the Queen claims that she is able to subdue her response to the effects of his manly beauty (&quot;Oh, foolish fay&quot;).

[[File:Iolanthe Group.jpg|left|frame|&quot;In friendship's name!&quot;]]
Phyllis cannot decide whether she ought to marry Tolloller or Mountararat, and so she leaves the choice up to them. Tolloller tells Mountararat that his family's tradition would require the two Earls to duel to the death if the latter were to claim Phyllis. The two decide that their friendship is more important than love and renounce their claims to her (&quot;Though p'r'aps I may incur thy blame&quot;). The Lord Chancellor arrives dressed for bed and describes a nightmare caused by his unrequited love for Phyllis (&quot;Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The Lord Chancellor says that &quot;Love, nightmare-like, lies heavy on my chest.&quot;  A well-known painting exhibited in London, &quot;[[The Nightmare]]&quot;, had influenced several writers including [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (see Ward, Maryanne C. (Winter, 2000). &quot;A Painting of the Unspeakable: Henry Fuseli's ''The Nightmare'' and the Creation of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''&quot;. ''The Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association'' 33 (1): 20â31) and had been described in a short poem by [[Erasmus Darwin]], &quot;Night-Mare&quot;, which included the lines, &quot;The Fiend.../ Seeks some love-wilder'd maid with sleep oppress'd,/ Alights, and grinning sits upon her breast&quot;. See Moffitt, John F. &quot;A Pictorial Counterpart to 'Gothick' Literature: Fuseli's ''The Nightmare''&quot;, ''Mosaic'', vol. 35, issue 1 (2002), University of Manitoba&lt;/ref&gt; The two peers try to cheer him up and urge him to make another effort to persuade himself to award Phyllis to ... himself (&quot;If you go in you're sure to win&quot;).

Strephon now leads both parties in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], but he is miserable at losing Phyllis.  He sees Phyllis and reveals to her that his mother is a fairy, which accounts for her apparent youth (&quot;If we're weak enough to tarry&quot;). Phyllis and Strephon ask Iolanthe to plead with the Lord Chancellor to allow their marriage, for &quot;none can resist your fairy eloquence.&quot; This is impossible, she replies, for the Lord Chancellor is her husband. He believes Iolanthe to have died childless, and she is bound not to &quot;undeceive&quot; him, under penalty of death. However, to save Strephon from losing his love, Iolanthe resolves to present his case to the Lord Chancellor while veiled (&quot;My lord, a suppliant at your feet&quot;).

Although the Lord Chancellor is moved by her appeal, which evokes the memory of his wife, he declares that he himself will marry Phyllis. Desperate, Iolanthe unveils, ignoring the warnings of the unseen Fairies, revealing that she is his long-lost wife, and Strephon is his son. The Lord Chancellor is amazed to see her alive, but Iolanthe has again broken fairy law, and the Fairy Queen is now left with no choice but to punish Iolanthe with death (&quot;It may not be ... Once again thy vow is broken&quot;). As she prepares to execute Iolanthe, the Queen learns that the rest of the fairies have chosen husbands from among the peers, thus also incurring death sentences &amp;ndash; but the Queen blanches at the prospect of slaughtering all of them. The Lord Chancellor suggests a solution: change the law by inserting a single word: &quot;every fairy shall die who ''doesn't'' marry a mortal.&quot; The Fairy Queen cheerfully agrees and, to save her life, the dutiful soldier, Private Willis, agrees to marry her. Seeing no reason to stay in the mortal realm if peers are to be recruited &quot;from persons of intelligence&quot;, the peers join the fairy ranks and &quot;away [they] go to fairyland&quot; (&quot;Soon as we may, off and away&quot;).

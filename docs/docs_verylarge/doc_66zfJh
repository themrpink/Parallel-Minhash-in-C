===Europeans (from 1500)===
[[File:CantinoPlanisphere-Mascareignes.png|thumb|325px|Map of Madagascar and the [[Mascarene Islands]] (1502)]]

Europe knew of Madagascar through Arab sources; thus ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' claimed that &quot;the inhabitants are Saracens, or followers of the law of Mohammed&quot;, without mentioning other inhabitants. Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on August 10, 1500, when the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sea captain [[Diogo Dias]] sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy|wstitle=Madagascar&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Madagascar}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|ley196608}} The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island ''São Lourenço'' ([[Saint Lawrence]]). In 1666, [[François Caron]], the director general of the newly formed [[French East India Company]], sailed to Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vincent |first=Rose |title=The French in India: From Diamond Traders to Sanskrit Scholars |origyear= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1990 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-86132-259-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now [[Réunion]]) and [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On [[Île Sainte-Marie]], a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous [[pirate utopia]] of [[Libertatia]] in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favorite haunt for pirates.  Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them [[Robert Drury (sailor)|Robert Drury]], whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;''From MADAGASCAR to the MALAGASY REPUBLIC'', by Raymond K. Kent pg 65–71&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors sometimes called Madagascar &quot;Island of the Moon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Madagascar: An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island and Its Former Dependencies'' by [[Samuel Pasfield Oliver]], p. 6. (excerpted in Google Book Search)&lt;/ref&gt;

====European settlements====
By the 15th century, Europeans had wrested control of the [[spice trade]] from the Muslims. They did this by bypassing the Middle East and sending their cargo-ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to India. The Portuguese mariner [[Diogo Dias]] became the first European to set foot on Madagascar when his ship, bound for India, blew off course in 1500. In the ensuing two-hundred years, the English and French tried (and failed) to establish settlements on the island.

Fever, dysentery, hostile Malagasy, and the trying arid climate of southern Madagascar soon terminated the English settlement near [[Toliara]] in 1646. Another English settlement in the north in Île Sainte-Marie came to an end in 1649. The French colony at [[Tôlanaro]] (Fort Dauphin) fared a little better: it lasted thirty years. On Christmas night 1672, local Antanosy tribesmen, perhaps angry because fourteen French soldiers in the fort had recently divorced their Malagasy wives to marry fourteen French orphan-women sent out to the colony, massacred the fourteen grooms and thirteen of the fourteen brides. The Antanosy then besieged the stockade at Tôlanaro for eighteen months. A ship of the French East India Company rescued the surviving thirty men and one widow in 1674.

In 1665, [[François Caron]], the Director General of the newly formed [[French East India Company]], sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and Île-de-France (today's [[Réunion]] and [[Mauritius]] respectively). In the late 17th century, the French established trading-posts along the east coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY OF MADAGASCAR&quot;/&gt;

====Pirates and slave-traders====

Between 1680 and 1725, Madagascar became a [[pirate]] stronghold. Many unfortunate sailors became shipwrecked and stranded on the island. Those who survived settled down with the natives, or more often, found French or English colonies on the island or even pirate havens and thus became pirates themselves. One such case, that of Robert Drury,&lt;ref&gt;''From Madagascar to the Malagasy Republic'' by Raymond K. Kent, Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976 ({{ISBN|0-8371-8421-5}}), pages 55–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
resulted in a journal giving one of the few written depictions of southern Madagascar in the 18th century.

Pirate luminaries such as [[William Kidd]], [[Henry Every]], [[John Bowen (pirate)|John Bowen]], and [[Thomas Tew]] made Antongil Bay and Île Sainte-Marie (a small island 12 miles off the northeast coast of Madagascar) their bases of operations. The pirates plundered merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, the [[Red Sea]], and the [[Persian Gulf]]. They deprived Europe-bound ships of their silks, cloth, spices, and jewels. Vessels captured going in the opposite direction (to India) lost their coin, gold, and silver. The pirates robbed the Indian cargo ships that traded between ports in the Indian Ocean as well as ships commissioned by the [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of France, England, and the Netherlands. The pilgrim fleet sailing between Surat in India and Mocha on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula were a favorite target, because the wealthy Muslim pilgrims often carried jewels and other finery with them to Mecca. Merchants in India, various ports of Africa, and Réunion showed willingness to [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] the pirates' stolen goods. The low-paid seamen who manned merchant ships in the Indian Ocean hardly put up a fight, seeing as they had little reason or motivation to risk their lives. The pirates often recruited crewmen from the ships they plundered.

With regard to piracy in Malagasy waters, note the (semi-)legendary accounts of the alleged pirate-state of Libertatia.

Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, certain Malagasy tribes occasionally waged wars to capture and enslave prisoners. They either sold the slaves to Arab traders or kept them on-hand as laborers. Following the arrival of European slavers, human slaves became more valuable, and the coastal tribes of Madagascar took to warring with each other to obtain prisoners for the lucrative slave-trade. Instead of spears and cutlasses, the tribesmen fought with muskets, musket-balls, and gunpowder that they obtained from the Europeans, conducting fierce and brutal wars. On account of their relationship to the pirates, the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] in eastern Madagascar had more firearms than anyone else. They overpowered their neighbors, the [[Antankarana]] and [[Tsimihety people|Tsimihety]], and even raided the [[Comoro Islands]]. As the tribe on the west coast with the most connections to the slave trade, the [[Sakalava people]] also had access to guns and powder.

Today, the people of Madagascar can be considered as the product of mixing between the first occupants, the ''vahoaka ntaolo'' Austronesians (''Vazimba''and ''Vezo'') and those arrived later (''Hova'' neo-Austronesians, Persians, Arabs, Africans and Europeans).

[[Genotype|Genotypically]], the original Austronesian heritage is more or less evenly distributed throughout the island. Researchers have noticed the &quot;Polynesian motif&quot; everywhere:&lt;ref&gt;Hurles ''et alii'' (2005), Ricaut ''et alii'' (2009), Hagelberg ''et alii'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; an old marker of Austronesian populations from before the great immigration to the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia. This fact would require a starting common home among the Proto-Malagasy ''vahoaka ntaolo'' (gone west to Madagascar) and the ancestors of the current Polynesians (left for the Pacific Islands in the East) between 500 BCE – 1 CE.

[[File:Radama I, portrait by Ramanankirahina.gif|thumb|right|Radama I, the first monarch of the kingdom unified central Madagascar.]]

===Rise of the great kingdoms===
Those new immigrants of the Middle Ages were a minority in numbers, yet their cultural contributions, political and technological to the neo-Vazimba and neo-Vezo world substantially altered their society and is the cause of the major upheavals of the sixteenth that led to the Malagasy feudal era.

On the coasts, the integration of the East Asians, Middle Easterns, Bantus and Portuguese led to the establishment of the kingdoms of the [[Antakarana]], [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]], [[Menabe]] and [[Vezo]] on the west coast, the [[Mahafaly]] and [[Antandroy]] in the south, and the [[Antesaka]], [[Antambahoaka]], [[Antemoro]], [[Tanala|Antanala]] and [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] on the east coast.

In the interior, the struggle for hegemony between the different Neo-Vazimba clans of central highlands, called the ''Hova'' by the coastal Neo-Vezo clans, led to the creation of the [[Merina]], [[Betsileo]], [[Bezanozano]], [[Sihanaka]], [[Tsimihety]] and [[Bara people|Bara]] kingdoms.

The birth of these kingdoms/tribes essentially altered the political structure of the ancient world of the Vahoaka Ntaolo, but for the most part the common language, customs, traditions, religion and economy was preserved.

Among the Central Kingdoms, the most important were the [[Betsileo]] kingdoms (Fandriana, Fisakana, Manandriana, Isandra) to the south, and the [[Merina]] kingdoms to the north. These were definitively unified in the early 19th century by [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. His son and successor [[Radama I]] (reigning 1810–1828) opened his country to foreign influence. With the support of the British, he extended its authority over much of the island. From 1817, the central Merina kingdoms, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, unified by Radama I were known to the outside world as the [[Kingdom of Madagascar]].

===Sakalava===
The island's West clan chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbors, first with Arab, [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] traders who connected Madagascar with East Africa, the Middle East and India, and later with European slave traders.&lt;ref&gt;Cities of the Middle East and North Africa By Michael Dumper, Bruce E. Stanley, Janet L. Abu-Lug&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth created in Madagascar through trade created a state system ruled by powerful regional monarchs known as the Maroserana. These monarchs adopted the cultural traditions of subjects in their territories and expanded their kingdoms. They took on divine status, and new nobility and artisan classes were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/madg_1/hd_madg_1.htm |title=Kingdoms of Madagascar: Maroserana and Merina |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar functioned as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. By the Middle Ages, large [[chiefdom]]s began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] alliance of the eastern coast and the [[Sakalava]] chiefdoms of the [[Menabe]] (centered in what is now the town of [[Morondava]]) and of [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]] (centered in what is now the provincial capital of [[Mahajanga]]). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of [[Antsiranana]], [[Mahajanga]] and [[Toliara]].

The island's chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbours, notably East Africa, the Middle East and [[India]]. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the [[Sakalava]] chiefdoms of the [[Menabe]], centred in what is now the town of [[Morondava]], and of [[Boina Kingdom|Boina]], centered in what is now the provincial capital of [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of [[Antsiranana]], Mahajanga and Toliara.

According to local tradition, the founders of the Sakalava kingdom were Maroseraña (or Maroseranana, &quot;those who owned many ports&quot;) princes, from the Fiherenana (now [[Toliara]]). They quickly subdued the neighbouring princes, starting with the southern ones, in the Mahafaly area. The true founder of Sakalava dominance was [[Andriamisara]]; his son [[Andriandahifotsy]] (c1610-1658) then extended his authority northwards, past the [[Mangoky River]]. His two sons, Andriamanetiarivo and Andriamandisoarivo, extended gains further up to the Tsongay region (now Mahajanga). At about that time, the empire's unity starts to split, resulting in a southern kingdom (Menabe) and a northern kingdom (Boina). Further splits resulted, despite continued extension of the Boina princes' reach into the extreme north, in Antankarana country.

The Sakalava rulers of this period are known through the memoirs of Europeans such as [[Robert Drury (Sailor)|Robert Drury]], [[James Cook]], Barnvelt (1719), Valentyn (1726).

===Merina monarchy===
[[File:Madagascar—Gathering of The People for The Making of Laws (LMS, 1869, pp. 52).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Madagascar—Gathering of The People for The Making of Laws (LMS, 1869, p.52)&lt;ref name=&quot;Fruits-LMS&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=London Missionary Society|title=Fruits of Toil in the London Missionary Society|date=1869|publisher=John Snow &amp; Co.|location=London|page=525|url=https://archive.org/details/fruitsoftoilinth17115gut|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1785–1810) and his son, [[Radama I]] (1810–1828) succeeded in uniting nearly all of Madagascar under [[Merina]] rule.  These kings and their successors descended from a line of [[List of Malagasy monarchs|ancient Merina royalty]] who ruled the lands of [[Imerina]] in the central Highlands of Madagascar since at least the 16th century. Even prior to their eventual domination and unification of the entire island, the political and cultural activities of Merina royalty were to leave an indelible mark on contemporary Malagasy identity.

With the establishment of dominion over the greater part of the Highlands, Andrianampoinimerina became the first [[List of Malagasy monarchs|Merina monarch]] to be considered a king of Madagascar.  The island continued to be ruled by a succession of Merina monarchs until the last of them, [[Ranavalona III]], was deposed and exiled to Algeria by French forces who conquered and colonized the island in 1895.

====King Andrianampoinimerina====
{{main|Andrianampoinimerina}}
Andrianampoinimerina, grandson of King [[Andriambelomasina]] and successor to his uncle King [[Andrianjafy]], successfully reunited the fragmented Merina kingdom through a combination of diplomacy, strategic political marriages and successful military campaigns against rival princes.  Andrianampoinimerina distinguished himself from other kings by codifying laws and supervising the building of dikes and trenches to increase the amount of arable land around his capital at Antananarivo in a successful bid to end the famines that had wracked Imerina for decades. The king ambitiously proclaimed: ''Ny ranomasina no valapariako'' (“the sea is the boundary of my rice-field”), and by the time of his death in 1810 he had conquered the Bara and Betsileo highland tribes, laying the groundwork for expansion of his kingdom to the shores of the island.

====King Radama I (1810–1828)====
{{main|Radama I}}
Andrianampoinimerina's son [[Radama I]] (Radama the Great) assumed the throne during a turning-point in European history that had repercussions for Madagascar. With the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon]] in 1814/1815, the balance of power in Europe and overseas shifted in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s favor. The British, eager to exert control over the trade routes of the Indian Ocean, had captured the islands of [[Réunion]] and [[Mauritius]] from the French in 1810. Although they returned Réunion to France, they kept Mauritius as a naval base which would maintain trade links throughout the [[British Empire]]. Mauritius's governor, in a bid to woo Madagascar from French control, recognized Radama I as King of Madagascar, a diplomatic maneuver meant to underscore the idea of the sovereignty of the island and thus to preclude claims by any European powers.

Radama I signed treaties with the United Kingdom outlawing the slave trade and admitting Protestant missionaries into Madagascar. As a result of these treaties Protestant missionaries from Britain would spread British influence in Madagascar; while outlawing the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]] would weaken Réunion's economy by depriving the island of slave laborers for France's [[sugar]] [[plantation]]s. In return for outlawing the slave trade, Madagascar received what the treaty called &quot;The Equivalent&quot;: an annual sum of a thousand dollars in gold, another thousand in silver, stated amounts of gunpowder, flints, and muskets, plus 400 surplus [[British Army]] [[uniform]]s. The governor of Mauritius also sent military advisers who accompanied and sometimes led Merina soldiers in their battles against the Sakalava and Betsimisaraka. In 1824, having defeated the Betsimisaraka, Radama I declared, &quot;Today, the whole island is mine! Madagascar has but one master.&quot; The king died in 1828 while leading his army on a punitive expedition against the Betsimisaraka.

====Queen Ranavalona I (1828–1861)====
{{main|Ranavalona I}}
[[File:Christian martyrs burned at the stake in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|180px|Christians burned at the stake by Ranavalona I]]
The 33-year reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]], the widow of Radama I, was characterized by an increase in the size of the Kingdom of Madagascar as it conquered neighboring states as well as an effort to maintain the cultural and political sovereignty of Madagascar in the face of increasing foreign influence. The queen repudiated the treaties that Radama I had signed with Britain and, in 1835 after issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, she expelled British missionaries from the island and began persecuting Christian converts who would not renounce their religion. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as ''ny tany maizina'', or &quot;the time when the land was dark&quot;. During her reign regular warfare, disease, slavery, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice
(Tangena ordeal) resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign, with Madagascar's population reducing from 5 million in 1833 to 2.5 million in 1839.

Unbeknownst to the queen, her son and heir, the crown-prince (the future [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]]), attended Roman Catholic masses in secret.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The young man grew up under the influence of French nationals in Antananarivo. In 1854, he wrote a letter to [[Napoleon III of France|Napoléon III]] inviting France to invade and uplift Madagascar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} On June 28, 1855 he signed the [[Lambert Charter]]. This document gave Joseph-François Lambert, an enterprising French businessman who had arrived in Madagascar only three weeks before, the exclusive right to develop all minerals, forests, and unoccupied land in Madagascar in exchange for a 10-percent royalty payable to the Merina monarchy. In years to come, the French would show the Lambert Charter and the prince's letter to Napoléon III to explain the Franco-Hova Wars and the annexation of Madagascar as a colony. In 1857, the queen uncovered a plot by her son (the future Radama II) and French nationals in the capital to remove her from power. She immediately expelled all foreigners from Madagascar, sparing her son. Ranavalona died in 1861.

==== King Radama II (1861–1863) ====
{{main|Radama II}}
In his brief two years on the throne, King [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] re-opened trade with Mauritius and Réunion, invited Christian missionaries&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy|wstitle=Madagascar&quot; /&gt; and foreigners to return to Madagascar, and re-instated most of Radama I's reforms. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], the prime minister, engineered a coup d'état in which Radama II was strangled to death.

====Queen Rasoherina (1863–1868)====
{{main|Rasoherina of Madagascar}}
[[File:Malagasi Embassy to Europe 1863 Rainifiringa Ralahimaholy with Rev John Duffus and Rasatranabo na Rainandrianandraina.jpg|thumb|Malagasy Embassy to Europe in 1863. Left to right: Rainifiringa Ralaimaholy, Rev. John Duffus and Rasatranabo aka Rainandrianandraina.]]
A council of princes headed by [[Rainilaiarivony]] approached Rabodo, the widow of [[Radama II]], the day after the death of her husband.  They gave her the conditions under which she could succeed to the throne.  These conditions included the suppression of [[trial by ordeal]] as well as the monarchy's defense of [[freedom of religion]].  Rabodo, crowned queen on May 13, 1863 under the throne name of [[Rasoherina of Madagascar|Rasoherina]], reigned until her death on April 1, 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Randriamamonjy, ''Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra'' (The history of Madagascar by Region), pages 529–534.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malagasy people remember Queen Rasoherina for sending ambassadors to London and Paris and for prohibiting [[Sunday market]]s. On June 30, 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. With the United States of America she signed a trade agreement that also limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle.  Finally, with France the queen signed a peace between her descendants and the descendants of the ''Emperor of France''.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Randriamamonjy, ''Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra'' (''The history of Madagascar by Region''), pages 529–534.&lt;/ref&gt; Rasoherina married her Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], but public outcry against his involvement in the murder of [[Radama II]] soon forced his resignation and exile to [[Betsileo]] country south of [[Imerina]].  She then married his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], head of the army at the time of Radama II's murder who was promoted to the post of Prime Minister upon the resignation and exile of his older brother.  Rainilaiarivony would rule Madagascar from behind the scenes for the remaining 32 years of the Merina monarchy, marrying each of the final three queens of Madagascar in succession.

====Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883)====
{{main|Ranavalona II}}
In 1869, Queen [[Ranavalona II of Madagascar|Ranavalona II]], previously educated by the [[London Missionary Society]], underwent baptism into the [[Church of England]] and subsequently made the [[Anglican]] faith the official [[state religion]] of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;Madagascar now has three dioceses in the autonomous [[Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]]. [http://www.anglicancommunion.org/mission/companion/diocese/2004toamasina.cfm]. Retrieved September 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The queen had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (traditional royal idols) burned in a public display. Catholic and Protestant [[missionaries]] arrived in numbers to build churches and schools. The reign of Queen Ranavalona II proved the high water mark of British influence in Madagascar.  British goods and weapons arrived on the island by way of [[Cape Colony|South Africa]].

====Queen Ranavalona III (1883–1897)====
{{main|Ranavalona III}}
Her public coronation as queen took place on November 22, 1883 and she took the name [[Ranavalona III]].  As her first order of business she confirmed the nomination of [[Rainilaiarivony]] and his entourage in their positions.  She also promised to do away with the French threat.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Randriamamonjy, ''Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra'' (History of Madagascar by Region), pg 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

====End of the monarchy====
{{main|Franco-Hova Wars|First Madagascar expedition|Second Madagascar expedition}}
[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur à Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 May and May 24, 1895.]]
Angry at the cancellation of the [[Lambert Charter]] and seeking to restore property seized from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first [[Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' as a name referring to the Merina aristocrats). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. In Europe, meanwhile, European diplomats had worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to establish control over the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over the island of [[Heligoland]] to [[German Empire|Germany]] and renounced all claims of influence in Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled the end of the Madagascan political independence. [[Rainilaiarivony]] had succeeded in playing the various European powers against one another, but now France could act without fear of British support towards the Madagascans.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In 1895, a French [[flying column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise (they had expected an attack from the much closer east coast). Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] Madagascar. The 103-year-old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family sent into exile in [[Algeria]].

===International recognition and modernization of the Kingdom (1817–1895)===
The kingdom of Madagascar continued its transformation throughout the 19th century from a locally grown monarchy into a modern [[State (polity)|state]].

Before Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as [[sorabe]]. In 1820 under the direction of [[David Jones (missionary)|David Jones]], a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/madagascar/jones_david.html |title=Dictionary of African Christian Biography | accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language.

The United States and the Kingdom of Madagascar concluded a commercial convention in 1867 after which Queen Rasoherina and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivoy exchanged gifts with president [[Andrew Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/malagasy/queen.html |title=Objects as Envoys |accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was then signed in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |title=U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Madagascar |accessdate=May 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Ranavalona I, early attempts at industrialization took place from 1835 under the direction of the French [[Jean Laborde]] (a survivor of a shipwreck off the east coast), producing soap, [[porcelain]], metal tools and firearms (rifles, cannons, etc.)..

In 1864 [[Antananarivo]] opened the first hospital and a modern medical school. Two years later appeared the first newspaper. A scientific journal in English (''Antananarivo Annual'') was released from 1875. In 1894, on the eve of the establishment of colonial rule, the schools of the kingdom, mainly led by the [[Protestant]] missions, were attended by over 200,000 students.

In the [[Treaty of Berlin (1885)|Berlin Treaty]], the British accepted the claims of France to exert its influence on Madagascar, and a treaty of alliance between France and [[Madagascar]] was signed on December 17, 1885 by Queen [[Ranavalona III]].

Disagreements on the implementation of this treaty served as a pretext for the French invasion of 1895, which first met little resistance. The authority of the Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]], in power since 1864, had become very unpopular with the public.

The British accepted the imposition of a French [[Malagasy Protectorate|protectorate]] over Madagascar in 1890 in return for recognition of British soverienigty over [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar]] (subsequently part of [[Tanzania]]) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area.&lt;ref&gt;See Allen and Covell, ''Historical Dictionary of Madagascar'', pgs. xxx–xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the French was initially to maintain the protectorate in order to control the economy and foreign relations of the island. But later, the outbreak of the [[Menalamba rebellion]] and the arrival of General [[Joseph Gallieni|Gallieni]] (responsible for &quot;pacifying&quot; the country) in 1896 led to the [[French Madagascar|colonization of the island]] and the exile of the queen to [[Algeria]].

In 1904–1905 Madagascar was the scene of a [[1904–1905 uprising in Madagascar|large-scale uprising by various tribes and tribal leaders]], among whom Kotavy, a former French corporal who defected to the rebels, filled a preponderant role.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mutibwa|first=Phares M.|date=1980|journal=Transafrican Journal of History|volume=9|issue=1/2|pages=134–152|issn=0251-0391|jstor=24328554|title=Resistance to Colonialism: The Revolt of 1904—5 in South-East Madagascar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malagasy troops fought in France, [[Morocco]], and [[Syria]] during [[World War II]]. Prior to the implementation of the [[Final Solution]], [[Nazi Germany]] had considered the [[Madagascar Plan]], which would have relocated [[European Jews]] to Madagascar. After France fell to the Germans in 1940, the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government administered Madagascar until 1942, when British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops occupied the strategic island in the [[Battle of Madagascar]]. The United Kingdom handed over control of the island to [[Free French Forces]] in 1943.

In 1948, with French prestige at a low ebb, the French government, headed by Prime Minister [[Paul Ramadier]] of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party, suppressed the [[Madagascar revolt]], a nationalist uprising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/mgtoc.html A Country Study: Madagascar] Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Wars, by George Childs Kohn (Facts on File, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;B&amp;J&quot;: Jacob Bercovitch and Richard Jackson, International Conflict : A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945–1995 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, T., A World Atlas of Military History 1945–1984 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WHPSI&quot;: The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;

The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the [[Loi Cadre]] ([[Overseas Reform Act]]), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The [[Malagasy Republic]], proclaimed on October 14, 1958, became an autonomous state within the [[French Community]]. On March 26, 1960 France agreed to Madagascar becoming fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50D14F935591A7A93C1A9178FD85F448685F9 | work=The New York Times | title=MALAGASY PACT SIGNED; Gives Republic Independence Within French Community | date=April 3, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 1960 Madagascar became an independent country and [[Philibert Tsiranana]] became its first president.

== Independence ==
===First Republic (1960–1972)===
Tsiranana's rule represented continuation, with French settlers (or ''colons'') still in positions of power.  Unlike many of France's former colonies, the Malagasy Republic strongly resisted movements towards [[communism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Madagascar History&quot;&gt;[[Lonely Planet]]: [http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/africa/madagascar/essential?a=culture Madagascar History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018084325/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/africa/madagascar/essential?a=culture |date=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

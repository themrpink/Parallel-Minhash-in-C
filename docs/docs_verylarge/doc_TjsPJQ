===Second Catilinarian conspiracy===
{{Main article|Second Catilinarian conspiracy}}
The [[second Catilinarian conspiracy]] was a plot, devised by Catiline with the help of a group of aristocrats and disaffected veterans, to overthrow the [[Roman Republic]] in 63 BC. [[Cicero]] exposed the plot in a senate meeting in November 8, which forced Catiline to flee from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SPQR : a history of ancient Rome|last=Beard, Mary, 1955-|isbn=978-0-87140-423-7|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=902661394|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

The failure of the conspiracy in Rome was a massive blow to Catiline‘s cause. Upon hearing of the death of [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]] and the other conspirators at Rome, many men deserted his army, reducing the size from about 10,000 to a mere 3,000. Catiline and his ill-equipped army began to march towards Gaul, however, they were blocked by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer (consul)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer]] (the governor of [[Cisalpine Gaul]]) with three legions. They marched back towards Rome and then north again repeating this several times in a vain attempt to avoid battle. Gaius Antonius marched up from Rome with two legions. Catiline chose to engage the smaller army of Gaius Antonius near [[Pistoia]], hoping that he could defeat Antonius in the ensuing [[Battle of Pistoria|battle]] and dishearten the other Republican armies. Catiline also hoped that he might have an easier battle against Antonius who, he assumed, would fight less determinedly, as he had once been allied with Catiline.&lt;ref name=&quot;sall_56-61&quot;&gt;Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Sal.+Cat.+56&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0123 LVI-LXI]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Catiline may have still believed that Antonius Hybrida was conspiring with him—which may have been true, as Antonius Hybrida claimed to be ill on the day of the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;sall_59&quot;&gt;Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0123:section=59 LIX]&lt;/ref&gt;

Catiline and all his troops fought bravely, Catiline himself on the front lines. Once Catiline saw that there was no hope of victory, he threw himself into the thick of the fray. When the corpses were counted, all Catiline's soldiers were found with frontal wounds, and his corpse was found far in front of his own lines. In ''Catiline's War'', the 1st-century BC Roman historian Sallust gives the following account:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
When the battle was ended it became evident what boldness and resolution had pervaded Catiline's army. For almost every man covered with his body, when life was gone, the position which he had taken when alive at the beginning of the conflict. A few, indeed, in the centre, whom the praetorian cohort had scattered, lay a little apart from the rest, but the wounds even of these were in front. But Catiline was found far in advance of his men amid a heap of slain foemen, still breathing slightly, and showing in his face the indomitable spirit which had animated him when alive.&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Catiline's War'', Book LXI, pt. 4 (translated by J. C. Rolfe).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Catiline was found, far in advance of his men, among the dead bodies of the enemy; a most glorious death, had he thus fallen for his country.&lt;br&gt;– [[Florus]], ''Epitome de Tito Livio'' ([[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#12|IV, 1]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Catiline's death, many of the poor still regarded him with respect and did not view him as the traitor and villain that Cicero claimed he was.&lt;ref name=&quot;cic_flacco_38&quot;&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Flacco'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0013%3Atext%3DFlac.%3Achapter%3D38 XXXVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic element of Rome, however, certainly viewed him in a much darker light. Sallust wrote an account of the conspiracy that epitomized Catiline as representative of all of the evils festering in the declining Roman Republic. In his account, Sallust attributes countless crimes and atrocities to Catiline except for some of the more outrageous claims against him, particularly a ritual that involved drinking blood of a sacrificed child.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal_22&quot;&gt;Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0123:section=22 XX]&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians such as [[Florus]] and [[Dio Cassius]], far removed from the original events, recorded the claims of Sallust and the aforementioned rumors as facts.&lt;ref name=&quot;florus_2.12&quot;&gt;Florus, ''Epitome de Tito Livio'' [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#12|II.xii]]; Dio Cassius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#30.3 XXXVII.30.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the modern era Catiline was equated, as Sallust described, to everything depraved and contrary to both the laws of the gods and men.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Nevertheless, many Romans viewed his character with a degree of respect.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Well after Catiline's death and the end of the threat of the conspiracy, Cicero stated that Catiline was an enigmatic man who possessed both the greatest of virtues and the most terrible of vices.

&lt;blockquote&gt;He had many things about him which served to allure men to the gratification of their passions; he had also many things which acted as incentives to industry and toil. The vices of lust raged in him; but at the same time he was conspicuous for great energy and military skill. Nor do I believe that there ever existed so strange a prodigy upon the earth, made up in such a manner of the most various, and different and inconsistent studies and desires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Pro Caelio'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0020:text=Cael.:chapter=5 V])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

a later source says of him &quot;[he had] the faculty of enjoying all pleasures and of bearing all privations, courage, military talent, knowledge of men, the energy of a felon, and that horrible mastery of vice, which knows how to bring the weak to fall and how to bring the fallen to crime.&quot;

While history has often viewed Catiline through the lenses of his enemies, some modern historians have reassessed Catiline, such as [[Michael Parenti]], in ''The Assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parenti, ''The Assassination of Julius Caesar; A People's History of Ancient Rome'', The New Press, New York, 2004, {{ISBN|1-56584-797-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some consider Catiline to be a reformer such as the [[Gracchi]] who met similar resistance from the government, but many consider him more as a man who used the plight of the poor to suit his personal interests and a politician of the time no more corrupt than any other.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} 

In parts of Italy up until the Middle Ages the legend of 'Catellina' continued to exist and was favourable to him.&lt;ref&gt;L.P Wilkinson, ''Letters of Cicero'', Hutchinson University Library, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholarly texts, such as [[H. E. Gould]] and [[J. L. Whiteley]]'s Macmillan edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[In Catilinam]]'', dismiss Catiline as a slightly deranged revolutionary, primarily concerned with the cancellation of his own debts accrued in running for so many consulships, and in achieving the status he believed his by birthright due to his family name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould+Whiteley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Cicero : first and second speeches against Catiline | publisher=Macmillan | author=Cicero, Marcus Tullius | authorlink=Cicero |editor1-last=Gould |editor1-first=H.E. |editor1-link=H.

==Fiction==
* [[Virgil]], in Book VIII of his [[Aeneid]] mentions Catiline as being punished in [[Tartarus]] by the [[Furies]] for committing heinous sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aeneid |url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidVIII.php#anchor_Toc3637710 |location=Book VIII, Lines 666-668}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CatilineTragedy.jpg|frame|right|Title page of [[Ben Jonson]]'s tragedy (1611) from the Folio of 1692]]
*At least two major dramatists have written tragedies about Catilina: [[Ben Jonson]], the English Jacobean playwright, wrote ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy]]'' in 1611; ''[[Catiline (play)|Catiline]]'' was the first play by the Norwegian 'father of modern drama'{{fact|date=August 2019}} [[Henrik Ibsen]], written in 1850.
*[[Antonio Salieri]] wrote an opera tragicomica in two acts on the subject of the Catiline Conspiracy entitled ''[[Catilina (opera)|Catilina]]'' to a libretto by [[Giambattista Casti]] in 1792. The work was left unperformed until 1994 due to its political implications during the [[French Revolution]]. Here serious drama and politics were blended with high and low comedy; the plot centered on a love affair between Catiline and a daughter of Cicero as well as the historic political situation.
*[[Steven Saylor]] has written the novel ''[[Catilina's Riddle]]'', where the plot revolves around the intrigue between Catilina and Cicero in 63 BC. Catilina also plays a major character in Steven Saylor’s short story ''The House of the Vestals''.
*Catilina's conspiracy and Cicero's actions as [[Roman Consul|Consul]] figure prominently in the novel ''[[Caesar's Women]]'' by [[Colleen McCullough]] as a part of her ''[[Masters of Rome]]'' series.
*[[SPQR series|SPQR II: ''The Catiline Conspiracy'']], by [[John Maddox Roberts]], discusses Catiline's conspiracy.
*[[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' book ''[[Imperium (Harris novel)|Imperium]]'', based on [[Cicero]]'s letters, covers the developing career of Cicero with many references to his increasing interactions with Catiline. The sequel, ''[[Lustrum (novel)|Lustrum]]'' (issued in the United States as ''Conspirata''), deals with the five years surrounding the Catiline Conspiracy.
*''The Roman Traitor or the Days of Cicero, Cato and Catiline: A True Tale of the Republic'' by [[Henry William Herbert]] originally published in 1853 in two volumes.
*''A Pillar of Iron'' by [[Taylor Caldwell]], published in 1965, tells of the life of Cicero, especially in relation to Catilina and his conspiracy against Rome.
*''A Slave Of Catiline'' is a book by [[Paul Lewis Anderson|Paul Anderson]] that tells of a slave who helps and then hinders Catilina's conspiracy to overthrow Rome.
*A novel on the conspiracy, ''The Fall of the Republic'', written by Scott Savitz, was published in September 2020.

'''Shovelware''' is a term for [[Bundled software|software bundles]] noted more for the quantity of what is included rather than for the quality or usefulness.&lt;ref name=PCMag&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/51294/shovelware |title=Definition of: Shovelware |website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The metaphor implies that the creators showed little care for the quality of the original software, as if the new compilation or version had been created by indiscriminately adding titles &quot;by the shovel&quot; in the same way someone would shovel bulk material into a pile. The term &quot;shovelware&quot; is coined by semantic analogy to phrases like [[shareware]] and [[freeware]], which describe methods of software distribution.  It first appeared in the early 1990s when large amounts of [[shareware]] [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]] programs were copied onto CD-ROMs and advertised in magazines or sold at computer flea markets.&lt;ref name=PCMag/&gt;

==Shovelware CD-ROMs==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' wrote in 1990 that for &quot;those who do not wish to wait for&quot; software that used the new CD-ROM format, [[The Software Toolworks]] and [[Access Software]] planned to release &quot;game packs of several classic titles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw19900708&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=73 | title=The Maturation of Computer Entertainment: Warming The Global Village | work=Computer Gaming World | date=8 July 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 the magazine referred to software repackaged on CD-ROM as &quot;shovelware&quot;, describing one collection from Access as having a &quot;rather dusty menu&quot; and another from The Software Toolworks (&quot;the reigning king of software repackaging efforts&quot;) as including games that were &quot;mostly mediocre even in their prime&quot;; the one exception, ''[[Chessmaster 2000]]'', used &quot;stunning [[CGA graphics]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199304&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=Forging Ahead or Fit to be Smashed? | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1993 | accessdate=6 July 2014 |page=24 |number=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the magazine described shovelware as &quot;old and/or weak programs shoveled onto a CD to turn a quick buck&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller199401&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=January 1994 |title=The Shiny New Face Of Shareware |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=114 |department=Best of the Rest |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=128,130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although poor-quality collections existed at least as far back as the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] era, the term &quot;shovelware&quot; became commonly used in the early 1990s to describe CD-ROMs with collections of shareware or public domain software. The capacity of CD-ROM was 450–700 times that of the [[floppy disk]], and 6–16 times larger than the hard disks commonly fitted to personal computers in 1990. This outsized capacity meant that very few users would install the disc's entire contents, encouraging producers to fill them by including as much existing content as possible, often without regard to the quality of the material. Advertising the number of titles on the disc often took precedence over the quality of the content. Software reviewers, displeased with huge collections of inconsistent quality, dubbed this practice &quot;shovelware&quot;. Some CD-ROM computer games had moderately sized games that did not fill the disc, which enabled the manufacturer to bundle demo versions of their other products on the same disc.

The prevalence of shovelware has decreased due to the practice of downloading individual programs from a [[crowdsourced]] or curated [[app store]] becoming the predominant mode of [[software distribution]]. It continues in some cases with [[bundled software|bundled]] or [[pre-installed software]], where many extra programs of dubious quality and usefulness are included with a piece of hardware.

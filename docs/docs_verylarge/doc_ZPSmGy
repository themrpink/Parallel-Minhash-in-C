[[File:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|Railway wheel [[Train wheel#Flange|flange]] (left)&lt;br /&gt;Tram wheel flange (right)]]
[[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|[[Train wheel#Flange|Flanged]] [[Train wheel|railway wheel]]]]
A '''flange''' is an   external or internal [[Ridge (disambiguation)|ridge]], or [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] (lip), for [[Shear strength|strength]], as the flange of an [[iron]] [[Beam (structure)|beam]] such as an [[I-beam]] or a [[T-beam]]; or for attachment to another object, as the flange on the end of a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the [[lens mount]] of a [[camera]]; or for a flange of a [[Railroad car|rail car]] or [[tram]] [[train wheel|wheel]]. Thus  flanged wheels are wheels with a flange on one side to keep the wheels from running off the [[Rail profile|rails]]. The term &quot;flange&quot; is also used for a kind of tool used to form flanges.  [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|Pipes]] with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.

== Plumbing or piping ==
{{Main|plumbing|piping}}
[[File:SurreyFlange.JPG|thumb|right|Surrey flange]]

A flange can also be a plate or ring to form a rim at the end of a pipe when fastened to the pipe (for example, a [[closet flange]]). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing the end of a pipe. A flange joint is a connection of pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.

Although the word flange generally refers to the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting, many flanged plumbing fittings are themselves known as 'flanges':

Common flanges used in plumbing are the Surrey flange or Danzey flange, York flange, Sussex flange and Essex flange.
Surrey and York flanges fit to the top of the hot water tank allowing all the water to be taken without disturbance to the tank. They are often used to ensure an even flow of water to showers. An Essex flange requires a hole to be drilled in the side of the tank.

There is also a Warix flange which is the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the top of the flange and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female adapters so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.

A [[closet flange]] provides the mount for a [[toilet]].

== Pipe flanges ==
Flanges are piping components bolted together using gasket in between two flanges as a sealing material. Flanges are used to connect pipes with each other, connect pipes to flanged valves, connect pipes to flanged fittings, connect pipes to flanged piping specialty items such as strainers and to isolate piping sections using a blind flange.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.piping-world.com/piping-flanges-types-of-flanges-in-piping-systems&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different flange standards to be found worldwide. To allow easy functionality and interchangeability, these are designed to have standardised dimensions. Common world standards include ASA/ASME (USA), PN/DIN (European), BS10 (British/Australian), and JIS/KS (Japanese/Korean). In the USA, ANSI stopped publishing B16.5 in 1996, and the standard is ASME B16.5. ASME B16.5 covers flanges up to 24 inches size and up to pressure rating of Class 2500. Flanges larger than 24 inches are covered in ASME B16.47.

In most cases these are interchangeable as most local standards have been aligned to ISO standards, however, some local standards still differ (e.g. an ASME flange will not mate against an ISO flange). Further, many of the flanges in each standard are divided into &quot;pressure classes&quot;, allowing flanges to be capable of taking different pressure ratings. Again these are not generally interchangeable (e.g. an ASME 150 will not mate with an ASME 300).&lt;ref name=B165&gt;ASME B16.5&lt;/ref&gt;

These pressure classes also have differing [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] ratings for different materials. Unique pressure classes for piping can also  be developed for a process plant or power generating station; these may be specific to the corporation, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, or the process plant owner.  The ASME pressure classes for Flat-Face flanges are Class 125 and Class 250.  The classes for Ring-Joint, Tongue &amp; Groove, and Raised-Face flanges are Class 150, Class 300, (Class 400 - unusual), Class 600, Class 900, Class 1500, and Class 2500.&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

The flange faces are also made to standardized dimensions and are typically &quot;flat face&quot;, &quot;raised face&quot;, &quot;[[Groove (machining)|tongue and groove]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Gland (engineering)|ring joint]]&quot; styles, although other obscure styles are possible.

Flange designs are available as &quot;[[Weld neck flange|weld neck]]&quot;, &quot;slip-on&quot;, &quot;lap joint&quot;, &quot;socket weld&quot;, &quot;[[Threaded pipe|threaded]]&quot;, and also &quot;blind&quot;.&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

=== ASME standards (U.S.) ===
[[File:Flanschverbindung Gasleitung.jpg|thumb|300px|right|ASME type flange on a gas pipeline]]

Pipe flanges that are made to standards called out by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] B16.5 or ASME B16.47, and MSS SP-44. They are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. ASME B16.5 refers to [[nominal pipe size]]s (NPS) from ½&quot; to 24&quot;. B16.47 covers NPSs from 26&quot; to 60&quot;. Each specification further delineates flanges into [[pressure]] classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and  B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900.  However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]].  Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature. For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 Flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM A105 Carbon Steel and temperatures below 100F).

The [[gasket]] type and [[Screw|bolt]] type are generally specified by the standard(s); however, sometimes the standards refer to the ASME [[Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]] (B&amp;PVC) for details (see ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 – Appendix 2). These flanges are recognized by ASME Pipe Codes such as ASME B31.1 Power Piping, and ASME B31.3 Process Piping.

Materials for flanges are usually under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, there are many &quot;industry standard&quot; flanges that in some circumstance may be used on ASME work.

The product range includes SORF, SOFF, BLRF, BLFF, WNRF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), WNFF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), SWRF (XS &amp; STD), SWFF (XS &amp; STD), Threaded RF, Threaded FF &amp; LJ, with sizes from 1/2&quot; to 16&quot;. The bolting material used for flange connection is [[Threaded rod|stud bolts]] mated with two nut (washer when required). In Petrochemical industries, ASTM A193 B7 STUD &amp; ASTM A193 B16 Stud Bolts are used as these have high tensile strength.

=== European Dimensions (EN / DIN) ===
Most countries in Europe mainly install flanges according to standard DIN EN 1092-1 (forged Stainless or Steel Flanges). Similar to the ASME flange standard, the EN 1092-1 standard has the basic flange forms, such as weld neck flange, blind flange, lapped flange, threaded Flange (Thread ISO7-1 instead of NPT), weld on collar, pressed collars, and adapter flange such as flange coupling GD press fittings. The different forms of flanges within the EN 1092-1 (European Norm Euronorm) is indicated within the flange name through the type.

=== Other countries ===
Flanges in the rest of the world are manufactured according to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards for materials, pressure ratings, etc. to which local standards including [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]], [[British Standards|BS]], and others, have been aligned.

== Compact flanges ==
As the Compact flange size increase it becomes relatively increasingly heavy and complex resulting in high procurement, installation and maintenance costs.
Large flange diameters in particular are difficult to work with, and inevitably require more space and have a more challenging handling and installation procedure, particularly on remote installations such as oil rigs.

The design of the flange face includes two independent seals. The first seal is created by application of seal seating stress at the flange heel, but it is not straight forward to ensure the function of this seal.

Theoretically, the heel contact will be maintained for pressure values up to 1,8 times the flange rating at room temperature.

Theoretically, the flange also remains in contact along its outer circumference at the flange faces for all allowable load levels that it is designed for.

The main seal is the IX seal ring. The seal ring force is provided by the elastic stored energy in the stressed seal ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the seal ring inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.

The design aims at preventing exposure to oxygen and other corrosive agents. Thus, this prevents corrosion of the flange faces, the stressed length of the bolts and the seal ring. This however depends on the outer dust rim to remain in satisfactory contact and that the inside fluid is not corrosive in case of leaking into the bolt circle void.

=== Applications of compact flanges ===
The initial cost of the theoretical higher performance compact flange is inevitably higher than a regular flange due to the closer tolerances and significantly more sophisticated design and installation requirements.
By way of example, compact flanges are often used across the following applications: subsea oil and gas or riser, cold work and [[cryogenics]], gas injection, high temperature, and nuclear applications.

== Train wheels ==
{{Main|train wheel}}

Trains stay on their tracks primarily due to the conical geometry of their wheels. They also have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails, when the limits of the geometry based alignment are reached, e.g. due to some emergency or defect.

== Vacuum flanges ==
{{Main|vacuum flange}}
A vacuum flange is a flange at the end of a tube used to connect vacuum chambers, tubing and vacuum pumps to each other.

[[File:pdr-cbr-flange.jpg|thumb|right|Form factor of PDR and CBR flanges.]]

== Microwave ==
{{Main|Waveguide flange}}
In [[microwave]] [[telecommunication]]s, a flange is a type of cable joint which allows different types of [[waveguide]] to connect.

Several different [[waveguide flange|microwave RF flange]] types exist, such as CAR, CBR, OPC, PAR, PBJ, PBR, PDR, UAR, UBR, UDR, icp and UPX.

== Ski boots ==
[[File:Salomon Divine RS CF.JPG|thumb|right|The extensions at the toe and heel of this ski boot produce flanges used to clip into the ski bindings.]]

[[Ski boot]]s use flanges at the toe or heel to connect to the binding of the ski.  The size and shape for flanges on [[alpine skiing]] boots is standardized in ISO 5355. Traditional [[Telemark skiing|telemark]] and [[cross country skiing|cross country]] boots use the 75&amp;nbsp;mm Nordic Norm, but the toe flange is informally known as the &quot;duckbill&quot;. New cross country bindings eliminate the flange entirely and use a steel bar embedded within the sole instead.

'''Rudolf I''', also known as '''Rudolf of Habsburg''' ({{lang-de|Rudolf von Habsburg}}, {{lang-cz|Rudolf Habsburský}}; 1 May 1218 &amp;ndash; 15 July 1291), was [[House of Habsburg|Count of Habsburg]] from about 1240 and [[King of the Romans]] from 1273 until his death.

Rudolf's [[imperial election of 1273|election]] marked the end of the ''[[Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)|Great Interregnum]]'' in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the death of the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1250. Originally a [[Duke of Swabia|Swabian]] count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] in opposition to his mighty rival, the [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]], whom he defeated in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]]. The territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the present-day country of [[Austria]].

Rudolf was the first king of the Romans of the Habsburg dynasty, and he played a vital role in raising the [[comital]] house to the rank of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial princes]]. He was also the first of a number of late medieval [[count-kings]], so called by the historian Bernd Schneidmüller, from the rival noble houses of Habsburg, [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]], all striving after the Roman-German royal dignity, which ultimately was taken over by the Habsburgs in 1438.

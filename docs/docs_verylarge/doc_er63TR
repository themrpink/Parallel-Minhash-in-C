A '''cathedral''' is a [[church (building)|church]] that contains the ''[[cathedra]]'' ({{Langnf||Latin|seat}}) of a [[bishop]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, {{ISBN|0-19-860575-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus serving as the central church of a [[diocese]], [[Annual Conference|conference]], or [[episcopate]].&lt;ref name=NSE/&gt; Churches with the function of &quot;cathedral&quot; are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches.&lt;ref name=NSE&gt;New Standard Encyclopedia, 1992 by Standard Educational Corporation, Chicago, Illinois; page B-262c&lt;/ref&gt; Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appeared in [[Italy]], [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western [[Catholic Church]] until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures, and legal identities distinct from [[parish church]]es, [[monastery|monastic]] churches, and episcopal residences.

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Christian church in several parts of Western Europe, such as [[Church of Scotland|Scotland]], the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Netherlands]], certain [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss Cantons]] and parts of [[Germany]], adopted a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] polity that did away with bishops altogether. Where ancient cathedral buildings in these lands are still in use for congregational worship, they generally retain the title and dignity of &quot;cathedral&quot;, maintaining and developing distinct cathedral functions, but void of hierarchical supremacy. From the 16th century onwards, but especially since the 19th century, churches originating in Western Europe have undertaken vigorous programmes of [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], leading to the founding of large numbers of new dioceses with associated cathedral establishments of varying forms in Asia, Africa, Australasia, Oceania and the Americas. In addition, both the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] churches have formed new dioceses within formerly Protestant lands for converts and migrant co-religionists. Consequently, it is not uncommon to find Christians in a single city being served by three or more cathedrals of differing denominations.

==Etymology and definition==
[[File:Roma-san giovanni03.jpg|thumb|The [[cathedra]] of the [[Pope]] as Bishop of Rome, [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]]]]
The word &quot;cathedral&quot; is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''cathédrale'', from the [[Latin]] ''cathedra'' (&quot;seat&quot;), from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] καθέδρα ''kathédra'', &quot;seat, bench&quot;, from κατά ''kata'' &quot;down&quot; and ἕδρα ''hedra'' &quot;seat, base, chair.&quot;

The word refers to the presence and prominence of the bishop's or archbishop's chair or throne, raised above both clergy and laity, and originally located facing the congregation from behind the [[High Altar]]. In the ancient world, the chair, on a raised dais, was the distinctive mark of a teacher or [[rhetor]] and thus symbolises the bishop's role as teacher. A raised throne within a [[basilica]]n hall was also definitive for a [[Late Antique]] presiding [[magistrate]]; and so the ''cathedra'' also symbolises the bishop's role in governing his diocese.

The word &quot;cathedral&quot;, as the seat of a bishop, is found in most languages; however in Europe a cathedral church can be referred to as a ''[[Duomo]]'' (for example in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''[[Dom (church)|Dom]]'' (e.g. [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], etc.), from the [[Latin]] term ''domus ecclesiae'' or ''domus episcopalis''. While the terms are not synonymous (a ''duomo'' is a [[collegiate church]], cognate with the English &quot;[[Minster (church)|Minster]]&quot;) many cathedral churches are also collegiate churches, so that ''Duomo'', or ''Dom'', has become the common name for a cathedral in those countries.
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the English word &quot;cathedral&quot; commonly translates as ''[[katholikon]]'' (''sobor'' in Slavic languages), meaning &quot;assembly&quot;, but this title is also applied to [[monasticism|monastic]] and other major churches without episcopal responsibilities. When the church at which an [[archbishop]] or &quot;[[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]&quot; presides is specifically intended, the term ''kathedrikós naós'' (literally: &quot;cathedral temple&quot;) is used.

The episcopal throne embodies the principle that only a bishop makes a cathedral, and this still applies even in those churches that no longer have bishops, but retain cathedral dignity and functions in ancient churches over which bishops formerly presided. But the throne can also embody the principle that a cathedral makes a bishop; both specifically, in that the bishop is elected within the cathedral and is inaugurated by being enthroned within the cathedral by acclamation of clergy and laity; and also generally, in that the bishops' essential qualifications of regular prayer, higher learning and musical worship were for many centuries, primarily accessible through cathedral functions. In this there is a distinction between those church traditions, predominantly those of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] but formerly also including  [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] churches in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], whose bishops came to be made in [[monasteries]]; and those church traditions whose bishops have tended predominantly to arise through the ranks of cathedral clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk, Andrea; &quot;Renouncing the World yet leading the Church&quot;; Harvard University Press; 2004; p8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic or Roman Catholic tradition, the term &quot;cathedral&quot; correctly applies only to a church that houses the seat of the bishop of a diocese. The abbey church of a territorial abbacy serves the same function (that is, houses the seat of the abbot), but does not acquire the title. In any other jurisdiction canonically equivalent to a diocese but not canonically erected as such (prelature, vicariate, ordinariate, prefecture, apostolic administration), the church that serves this function is correctly called the &quot;principal church&quot; of the respective entity—though some have coopted the term &quot;cathedral&quot; anyway.  The Catholic Church also uses the following terms.

* A [[pro-cathedral]] is a parish or other church used temporarily as a cathedral, usually while the cathedral of a diocese is under construction, renovation, or repair.  This designation applies only as long as the temporary use continues.
* A '''co-cathedral''' is a second cathedral in a diocese that has two sees.  This situation can arise in various ways such as a merger of two former dioceses, preparation to split a diocese, or perceived need to perform cathedral functions in a second location due to the expanse of the diocesan territory.
* A '''proto-cathedral''' (literally, &quot;first cathedral&quot;) is the former cathedral of a transferred see.

The cathedral church of a [[metropolitan bishop]] is called a ''metropolitan cathedral''.

The term &quot;cathedral&quot; actually carries no implication as to the size or ornateness of the building, although many cathedrals are impressive edifices simply because diocesan celebrations typically require the capacity of one of the larger churches in the diocese.  Thus, the term &quot;cathedral&quot; is often applied colloquially to large and impressive churches that do not function as cathedrals, (e.g. the [[Arctic Cathedral]] in [[Tromsø (city)|Tromsø]], Norway and the [[Sagrada Família]], a [[minor basilica]] in Barcelona.).

==History and organization==

===Origins and characteristics of the first cathedrals===
The history of cathedrals  starts in the year 313, when the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] personally adopted Christianity and initiated the [[Peace of the Church]]. Indeed, in strict terminology, there could not have been &quot;cathedrals&quot; before that date, as before the 4th century there were no Christian &quot;cathedrae&quot;; bishops were never seated when leading congregational worship, but instead presided standing on a raised platform or ''pulpitum''. In the third century, the phrase &quot;ascending the platform&quot;, ''ad pulpitum venire'', becomes the standard term for Christian [[ordination]]. During the siege of [[Dura Europos]] in 256, a complete Christian house church, or ''domus ecclesiae'' was entombed in a defensive bank, surviving when excavated, in places to wall-top height. The Dura church had been converted out of a large urban courtyard house of standard form, in which two rooms had been knocked together to make an assembly hall, capable of holding 60-75 standing; while a tank had been inserted in a room on the opposite side of the courtyard as a baptistery, with rich wall paintings above it.  The large room was indeed found to have a raised pulptum at one end, big enough for one person in turn to read, preach and preside from; but too low to have been surmounted by a throne, and too small to have contained an altar. Otherwise the large room had no decoration or distinctive features at all.

In 269, soon after Dura fell to the Persian army, a body of clerics assembled a charge sheet against the bishop of Antioch, [[Paul of Samosata]], in the form of an open letter. Amongst the accusations was that Paul, who had received the civil rank of ''[[ducenarius]]'' due to contacts in the imperial court, had improperly erected an enclosure, or ''secretum'', for himself in the church of Antioch; that within this enclosure he had erected a throne from which he presided in worship; and that he had trained a female choir to sing hymns of his own devising.  These practices were all condemned as innovations, improperly importing the symbols of his secular Roman magistracy into church ritual; while presumptuously and blasphemously asserting that the person of the bishop in eucharistic worship is seated in the place of Christ himself. Still in a hundred years, all bishops in the Mediterranean world had cathedrals, all sat on thrones within an enclosed sanctuary space, and all had established trained choirs to enhance eucharistic worship.

The driving principle underlying this change was the acceptance by bishops, more or less willingly, of an imperial invitation to adopt and maintain the duties, dignity and insignia proper to a public [[magistrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eusebius |title=Life of Constantine|page=4:27,2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristically a Roman magistrate presided from a raised throne in a large, richly decorated and aisled rectangular hall called a ''[[basilica]]''; and now bishops would do the same.  The earliest of these new basilican cathedrals of which substantial remains are still visible (and maybe amongst the very earliest to be built) is below the [[Cathedral of Aquileia]] on the northern tip of the [[Adriatic]] sea.  Dated from a mosaic inscription between 313 and 319, the complex consisted of two parallel east-west aisled halls of similar size; with a third smaller north-south cross-hall connecting them, which has been interpreted as the presence hall of the ''episcopium'' or bishop's residence.  The three halls create an open courtyard, in which was originally located a separate baptistery.  Surviving from both large basilican halls are rich mosaic pavements showing (amongst other scenes) [[Jonah and the Whale]], and a series of, mainly female, donor portraits. It appears that similar cathedrals of double-basilica and baptistry were soon afterwards erected in [[Milan]], [[Trier]] and [[Pavia]]; but that subsequently single-basilican churches became the more common cathedral model.

Constantine's declaration of imperial favour towards Christianity transformed all aspects of Christian life in the Roman Empire.  From being a minority religion, largely confined to urban areas and restricted social groupings, and subject to official hostility and occasional persecution; Christianity acquired greatly expanded numbers of potential adherents of all classes, initially still within city areas, but eventually extending out to the ''[[pagus]]'', the city's rural hinterland. The consequence was a radical expansion in the buildings, funding and personnel of associated Church establishments throughout the 4th century.  The first cathedrals represent this expansion in material form.

====Buildings====

The location and layout of the first cathedrals varied substantially from city to city, although most, as at Aquileia, tended to be sited within the city walls but away from the urban centre; but certain elements are almost always found.

====Basilicas====

[[Basilica]]n halls had previously been characteristic of major civic complexes and military headquarters buildings; but now became the standard structure for accommodating large Christian congregations. From now on, the term basilica denotes any substantial church building.  These new basilicas were wholly different in scale from earlier Christian assembly halls, as they were also different in form from any Roman non-Christian temple or religious structure.  The halls were longitudinal, aisled, and flooded with light from large [[clerestory]] windows. Floors and walls were richly decorated with mosaic and inlay&amp;nbsp;– usually in abstract or floral patterns.  The two original double basilicas at Aquileia had both been about 37m by 17m in size, but within 30 years one hall was quadrupled to 73m by 31m.  This expanded basilica now demonstrated three additional features that became characteristic of early cathedrals: an enclosure at the eastern end of the church surrounding the altar; a ''{{lang|el|[[synthronos]]}}'' east of the altar facing west, and consisting of a raised dais with a centrally place bishop's throne and benches either side for the clergy of his ''familia''; and a partitioned-off ''[[narthex]]'' at the western end into which  ''[[catechumens]]'' would withdraw during the central act of the [[Eucharist]]ic liturgy.

====Baptisteries====

The baptistery in the Dura church was about 1m square and 1m deep; baptismal candidates could stand in it, but could not be immersed.  In the new cathedrals, as had been the case before, only bishops baptised; and ceremonies were held not more than twice a year to allow for suitable periods of instruction.  So baptisteries needed to be greatly increased in size, with associated accommodation to ensure privacy in undressing, anointing and redressing; and the baptismal tank, commonly octagonal, was now fully deep enough for total immersion, and wide enough to accommodate both the candidate and an assisting male or female deacon. Baptisteries commonly adopted centralised plan forms derived from funerary chapels; and are invariably separate from the congregational basilica.

====Episcopium====

No one lived in the house church at Dura; such residential facilities as the latrine and kitchen were removed in the conversion. But cathedral complexes always included an episcopal residence. Prominent amongst the charges that had been directed against [[Paul of Samosata]] had been his alleged over-familiarity with pious women.  As was common, Paul had been married when elected bishop; and again, as was universally expected for a bishop, he had then ceased sexual contact with his wife and no longer cohabited with her.  But his accusers charged that, by continuing to associate with other women (even without any indication of actual impropriety) he was creating an unacceptable potential for scandal. To avoid similar such occasions arising, it was necessary for the new cathedrals to create male-only living quarters for the bishop and his entire establishment; and since, in churches in the West, all [[presbyters]] and [[deacons]] were also expected to live apart from their wives after ordination, these living quarters, the ''episcopium'', were necessarily substantial in extent. In addition to eating and sleeping quarters for ordained boys and men, the episcopium also commonly provided private dining halls for the hospitality expected of the bishop's enhanced social status, a private [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] or chapel for the bishop, and often a bath house.

===Finances===

Just as the episcopal residence was integral within the complex of cathedral buildings, so too there was no distinction between episcopal, diocesan and cathedral property and endowments.  In principle, all diocesan income was paid into a common fund, and divided into four fixed shares for each main area of expenditure; the Bishop himself; the cathedral clergy; the fabric and lighting of cathedral and city churches; and charitable donations.  Many diocese already held substantial endowments, but income increased enormously with the Peace of the Church; partly due to imperial subsidies in kind, but mainly from private bequests and regular private benefactions (often called 'first fruits');  although at this date, [[tithe]] was never paid to the church.  In addition, many individual landowners supported private chapels and oratories on their own property; and endowed independent charitable institutions, and eventually monasteries and nunneries too.

====Bishop's share====

[[Augustine of Hippo]] estimated his personal income as being 20 times that of his father, a minor civil servant; and Augustine was by no means the wealthiest bishop in North Africa.  But in accepting from Constantine the status of civil magistrates, bishops were now also committed to substantial expenditure to maintain their new style and status; and also to fulfil the associated duties, for instance in employing qualified legal assessors to support them when sitting as civil judges.

====Clergy share====

All ordained clerics attached to the cathedral were paid through stipends from the general fund. This applied both to the clergy working directly within the cathedral itself, and also to the clergy, called ''canonici''  attached to churches founded by the bishop within the city.  From the end of the 4th century, as the mission of the church extended more into rural areas, 'baptistery churches' were founded in more distant villages, so that rural populations could receive the bishop's baptism locally; and the clergy in these churches also counted as ''canonici'' and drew a regular stipend.

====Fabric share====

Plentiful donor inscriptions show that most new church building programmes; mosaics, roofs, furnishings, were financed by private donations.  The costs of maintenance and lighting, however, fell on the general fund.  This also applied to the churches, known as ''tituli'', served directly by the bishop's clergy, generally also including any surviving house churches from the period before the Peace of the Church and the rural baptistery churches; but not to the chapels, called ''parochiae'', established by rural landowners for the convenience of their tenants. The bishop, in respect of his civil status, was expected to contribute to public works of general benefit; aqueducts, bridges, watercourses.

====Charitable share====

In all cities, bishops dedicated substantial sums to the support of widows, orphans and the poor.  Such donations had been a strong feature of the church in earlier centuries, but tended then to be specifically directed to the Christian needy.  Now the charitable compass became general. Bishops were especially expected to take responsibility for raising ransom funds, where local persons had fallen captive. In addition, it was expected that each diocese would support a ''[[xenodochium]]'', a hostel for the homeless and strangers.

Just as the status of the bishop was transformed at the Peace of the Church; so too was that of the male clergy. With the bishop now resident in the ''episcopium'' the other male clergy came to be recognised as his formal ''familia'', in mark of which male clergy now received the [[tonsure]] by shaving of their heads; this being originally a Roman badge of adoption.  The early church had recognised the orders of bishop, presbyter (priest) and deacon, but a range of [[minor orders]] had since grown up in addition; and all were tonsured.  These orders now tended to be understood as clerical 'ranks', equivalent to those in the military, such that the male clergy are now often referred to as a &quot;clerical militia&quot;.  And as in the Roman military or civil service, promotion was expected to follow the principle of ''[[cursus honorum]]'', rising through the ranks, with the expectation that ideally, a minimum period would be served in each.  The female orders of virgin, widow and (female) deacon remained explicitly outside the bishop's familia; and so they did not receive the tonsure and nor did they progress through the ''cursus honorum''.  But all orders of cathedral clergy, male and female, increased dramatically in numbers.  Around 540 [[Justinian]] ordered that the clerical payroll of [[Hagia Sophia]] should be strictly limited to 60 presbyters, 100 male deacons, 90 subdeacons, 110 lectors, 25 singers, 100 doorkeepers and 40 female deacons; 525 in all.

====Bishops====

Bishops were at the head of the local church; but not explicitly within the ''cursus honorum'', as appointment was by election from the local clergy and people.  Not surprisingly, the clergy tended to favour appointment of bishops from within the ranks of cathedral presbyters; but local lay choice often tended rather to outsiders, either a spectacular holy man, hermit or ascetic; or otherwise a senior civil servant or diplomat, who might have favourable contacts to exploit at court.  But most bishops came from the ''[[curiales|curial]]'' class, that is those holding the hereditary rank of [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]] with the obligation to serve on the city council, as only persons of this class and above would be likely to have a full rhetorical education in Greek and Latin grammar; without which it was not possible for a boy raised with a knowledge only of Late Antique vernacular speech to express himself in approved classical linguistic forms.

====Presbyters and archpriests====

It was expected that the normal president at both the Eucharist and Baptism would be the bishop; who would celebrate in the cathedral and in titular churches in turn. But, in practice, the bishop needed deputies for eucharistic worship and also for the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] of daily prayer, and this duty fell to the presbyters. The bishop selected a senior presbyter as [[archpriest]] who acted as his official deputy in all ritual matters and as head of the familia. The archpriest was also responsible for the cathedral school. After the 5th century, there were no longer state-supported secular teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]] in the West (other than in parts of Italy) and so the church would have to educate its own.

====Deacons, subdeacons and archdeacons====

Just as the presbyters deputised for the bishop in ritual matters, so the deacons deputised in administrative and financial matters, especially in the raising and delivering of charity.  At the head of the diaconate was the archdeacon; the bishop's main deputy in managerial affairs.  Originally inferior in rank to the archpriest, the archdeacon by the sixth century had established clear pre-eminence. Subdeacons assisted the deacons, but unlike them were allowed to marry after ordination; consequently many clerics stopped the cursus honorum at this point, and it was not unusual for a subdeacon to be elected bishop; and even Pope.

The [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany by the Nazi authorities.

[[Reichskommissariat]]s were established in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, designated as a colonies the &quot;Germanic&quot; populations of which were to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich. By contrast the Reichskommissariats established in the east ([[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] in the Baltics, [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] in the Ukraine) were established as colonies for settlement by Germans. 

In Norway, under [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]], the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].

About 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].

====War justifications====

''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: &quot;We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Whittam. ''Fascist Italy''. Manchester, England; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press. P. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy condemned the Western powers for enacting sanctions on Italy in 1935 for its actions in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] that Italy claimed was a response to an act of Ethiopian aggression against tribesmen in [[Italian Eritrea]] in the Walwal incident of 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher, Jonathan Wilkenfeld. Study of Crisis. University of Michigan Press, 1997. P. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy, like Germany, also justified its actions by claiming that Italy needed to territorially expand to provide ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (&quot;vital space&quot;) for the Italian nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodogno46&quot;&gt;*{{Cite book|first=Davide|last=Rodogno|title=Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War |location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|pages=46–48|isbn=978-0-521-84515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1938 in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Italy demanded concessions from France to yield to Italy in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. James Burgwyn 1940. p182-183&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918–1940. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 1997. p182-183.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Italy and France deteriorated with France's refusal to accept Italy's demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. James Burgwyn 1940. p182-183&quot;/&gt; France responded to Italy's demands with threatening naval maneuvers as a warning to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. James Burgwyn 1940. p182-183&quot;/&gt; As tensions between Italy and France grew, Hitler made a major speech on 30 January 1939 in which he promised German military support in the case of an unprovoked war against Italy.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918–1940. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 1997. p185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. Italy justified its [[Greco-Italian War|intervention against Greece in October 1940]] on the allegation that Greece was being used by Britain against Italy, Mussolini informed this to Hitler, saying: &quot;Greece is one of the main points of English maritime strategy in the Mediterranean&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lukacs 1941. P. 116&quot;&gt;John Lukacs. The Last European War: September 1939 – December 1941. P. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy justified its [[invasion of Yugoslavia|intervention against Yugoslavia in April 1941]] by appealing to both Italian irredentist claims and the fact of [[Albanians|Albanian]], [[Croats|Croatian]], and [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonian]] separatists not wishing to be part of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jozo Tomasevich P. 30-31&quot;&gt;Jozo Tomasevich. War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945: Occupation and Collaboration. P.&amp;nbsp;30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian separatism soared after the assassination of Croatian political leaders in the Yugoslav parliament in 1928 including the death of [[Stjepan Radić]], and Italy endorsed Croatian separatist [[Ante Pavelić]] and his fascist [[Ustaše]] movement that was based and trained in Italy with the Fascist regime's support prior to intervention against Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jozo Tomasevich P. 30-31&quot;/&gt;

====History====

The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a &quot;[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]&quot; in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935–1936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the &quot;Italian Empire&quot;.{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.

Italy was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935–1936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40–41}} 
Mussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel W. Mitcham]]: ''Rommel's Desert War: The Life and Death of the Afrika Korps''. Stackpole Books, 2007. P16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By early 1940, Italy was still a non-belligerent, and Mussolini communicated to Hitler that Italy was not prepared to intervene soon. By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. W. Kavanaugh. ''Hitler's Malta Option: A Comparison of the Invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur) and the Proposed Invasion of Malta'' (Nimble Books LLC, 2010). p20.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1941, Italy's attempts to run an autonomous campaign from Germany's, collapsed as a result of military setbacks in Greece, [[North Africa]], and [[Eastern Africa]]; and the country became dependent and effectively subordinate to Germany. After the German-led invasion and occupation of [[Yugoslavia during World War II|Yugoslavia]] and Greece, that had both been targets of Italy's war aims, Italy was forced to accept German dominance in the two occupied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp284&quot;&gt;Mussolini Unleashed, 1939–1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War. Pp.&amp;nbsp;284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by 1941, German forces in North Africa under [[Erwin Rommel]] effectively took charge of the military effort ousting Allied forces from the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]], and German forces were stationed in [[Sicily]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Knight. Mussolini and Fascism. Pp. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany's insolence towards Italy as an ally was demonstrated that year when Italy was pressured to send 350,000 &quot;guest workers&quot; to Germany who were used as forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight&quot;&gt;Patricia Knight. ''Mussolini and Fascism''. Routledge, 2003. P. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hitler was disappointed with the Italian military's performance, he maintained overall favorable relations with Italy because of his personal friendship with Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2006.

On 25 July 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini, placed him under arrest, and began secret negotiations with the Western Allies. An [[armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice]] was signed on 8 September 1943, and four days later Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Gran Sasso raid|Operation Oak]] and placed in charge of a puppet state called the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana''/RSI, or ''Repubblica di Salò'') in [[northern Italy]]. In order to liberate the country from the Germans and Fascists, Italy became a [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerent]] of the Allies; as result, the country descended in [[Italian civil war|Civil War]], with the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] and the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]], supported by the Allies, contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Some areas in Northern Italy were liberated from the Germans as late as May, 1945. Mussolini was killed by Communist partisans on 28 April 1945 while trying to escape to [[Switzerland]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1131}}

====Colonies and dependencies====
[[File:Italian Colonial Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Every territory ever controlled by the [[Italian Empire]] at some point in time during World War II]]
{{main|Italian Empire|Italian imperialism under Fascism}}
===== In Europe =====
The [[Italian Islands of the Aegean|Dodecanese Islands]] were an Italian dependency from 1912 to 1943.

Montenegro was an Italian dependency from 1941 to 1943 known as the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Governorate of Montenegro]] that was under the control of an Italian military governor. Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an &quot;independent&quot; state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]]. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist [[Sekula Drljević]] and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the &quot;Kingdom of Montenegro&quot; under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|general uprising against the Italians]]. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Italian troops and 20,000 of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian]] and [[Sandžak Muslim militia|Muslim]] irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control. With the Italian capitulation of 1943, Montenegro came directly under the control of Germany.

Politically and economically dominated by Italy from its creation in 1913, Albania was occupied by Italian military forces in 1939 as the Albanian king Zog l fled the country with his family. The Albanian parliament voted to offer the Albanian throne to the King of Italy, resulting in a personal union between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/30.htm Albania: A Country Study: Italian Occupation, Library of Congress].

===== In Africa =====
[[Italian East Africa]] was an Italian colony existing from 1936 to 1943. Prior to the invasion and annexation of Ethiopia into this united colony in 1936, Italy had two colonies, Eritrea and Somalia since the 1880s.

[[Italian Libya|Libya]] was an Italian colony existing from 1912 to 1943. The northern portion of Libya was incorporated directly into Italy in 1939; however the region remained united as a colony under a colonial governor.

The Japanese government justified its actions by claiming that it was seeking to unite [[East Asia]] under Japanese leadership in a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] that would free East Asians from domination and rule by clients of Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Kushner. The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda. University of Hawaii Press, P. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan invoked themes of [[Pan-Asianism]] and said that the Asian people needed to be free from Western influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray. ''Pearl Harbor Reexamined: Prologue to the Pacific War''. University of Hawaii Press, 1990. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States opposed the Japanese war in China, and recognized Chiang Kai-Shek's [[Nationalist Government]] as the legitimate government of China. As a result, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], and as a consequence the embargo resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan, as Japan could not continue its war effort against China without access to petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;Euan Graham. ''Japan's sea lane security, 1940–2004: a matter of life and death?'' Oxon, England; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2006. Pp. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain its military campaign in China with the major loss of petroleum trade with the United States, Japan saw the best means to secure an alternative source of petroleum in the petroleum-rich and natural-resources-rich [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;&gt;Daniel Marston. ''The Pacific War: From Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima''. Osprey Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This threat of retaliation by Japan to the total trade embargo by the United States was known by the American government, including American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] who was negotiating with the Japanese to avoid a war, fearing that the total embargo would pre-empt a Japanese attack on the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Conroy, Harry Wray. ''Pearl Harbor Reexamined: Prologue to the Pacific War''. University of Hawaii Press, 1990. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1941 Roosevelt's cabinet overwhelmingly agreed American public opinion would support going to war if Japan attacked British and Dutch colonies, but not the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/woah-what-if-fdr-had-declared-war-japan-there-was-no-attack-pearl-harbor-167690&lt;/ref&gt; 

Japan identified the American Pacific fleet based in [[Pearl Harbor Naval Base|Pearl Harbor]] as the principal threat to its designs to invade and capture Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;/&gt; Thus Japan initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 as a means to inhibit an American response to the invasion of Southeast Asia, and buy time to allow Japan to consolidate itself with these resources to engage in a [[total war]] against the United States, and force the United States to accept Japan's acquisitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Marston 2011&quot;/&gt; On 7 December 1941 Japan [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire|declared war on the United States and the British Empire]].

The [[Empire of Japan]], a constitutional monarchy with [[Hirohito]] as its Emperor, was the principal Axis power in Asia and the Pacific. Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the [[Imperial General Headquarters]], with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.

As a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.

Japan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet–[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|non-aggression pact]] with it in 1941.

Japan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: &quot;To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. &quot;{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, &quot;Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. &quot;{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275–276}}

With the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying northern [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.

To isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.

====Colonies and dependencies====
{{main|Japanese colonial empire}}
Taiwan was a Japanese dependency established in 1895. Korea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]].

The [[South Seas Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese officers training young Indonesian recruits, circa 1945]]

Japan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Li Narangoa, R. B. Cribb. ''Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia, 1895–1945''. Psychology Press, 2003. P15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Tripartite Pact signatories==
In addition to the three major Axis powers, six other countries signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the additional countries, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia, and Slovakia participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the sixth, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown earlier in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.

===Bulgaria===
{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}
[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]

The [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Тsar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria — if it joined the Axis — an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].

Bulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries—southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.

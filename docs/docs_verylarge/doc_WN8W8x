The interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown American urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding. The often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage, where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mintz1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintz|first1=Lawrence E.|title=Humor and Ethnic Stereotypes in Vaudeville and Burlesque |url= http://melus.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/4/19 |journal=MELUS.

Coupled with their historical presence on the English stage for comic relief,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage, Irish Americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in American popular culture. New arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the Irish on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Conflict between Irish and African Americans saw the promotion of black-face [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]] on the stage, purposefully used to place African Americans beneath the Irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Although the Irish had a strong Celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes, the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor. As the Irish donned their ethnic costumes, groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Germans and Jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the Irish.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville. This was similar to the advent of free broadcast [[television]]'s diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema. Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the US in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many performers and personalities, such as [[Al Jolson]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Mae West]], [[Buster Keaton]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Bill Robinson|Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Eddie Cantor]], used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. In doing so, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years. Other performers who entered in vaudeville's later years, including [[Jack Benny]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Kate Smith]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rose Marie]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Larry Storch]] and [[The Three Stooges]], used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.

The line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business. For example, [[Alexander Pantages]] quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into a partnership with the [[Famous Players-Lasky]], a major Hollywood production company and an affiliate of [[Paramount Pictures]].

By the late 1920s, most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema. Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the &quot;flickering shadow sweethearts&quot; would preclude their usurpation of the paramount place in the public's affection.  With the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue.  Historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when &quot;small time&quot; theatres could offer &quot;big time&quot; performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent? The {{Not a typo|newly-formed}} [[RKO Pictures|RKO studios]] took over the famed [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum vaudeville circuit]] and swiftly turned it into a chain of full-time movie theatres. The half-century tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years.&lt;ref name=KenrickLove&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1927-30film2.htm &quot;History of Musical Film, 1927–30: Part II&quot;]. Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances.  Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade.  Even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal. The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but most theatres were forced by the [[Great Depression]] to economize.

Some in the industry blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.

There was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s. [[Joseph Kennedy Sr.]] in a hostile buyout, acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theatres Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theatres across the United States which had begun showing movies.  The shift of New York City's Palace Theatre, vaudeville's center, to an exclusively cinema presentation on November 16, 1932 is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Senelick |first=Laurence |editor-first=Don B.| editor-last=Wilmeth |title=Cambridge Guide to American Theatre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=October 22, 2007 |page=480 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-521-83538-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYsXbFvjrXkC&amp;q=480 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.

== Architecture ==
The most striking examples of [[Gilded Age]] theatre architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition. Examples of such architecture are the theatres built by impresario [[Alexander Pantages]].  Pantages often used architect [[B. Marcus Priteca]] (1881–1971), who in turn regularly worked with muralist [[Anthony Heinsbergen]].  Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called &quot;Pantages Greek&quot;.

Though classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres, small-time vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses.  Small-time houses were often converted saloons, rough-hewn theatres, or multi-purpose halls, together catering to a wide range of clientele.  Many small towns had purpose-built theatres.

== Vaudeville's cultural influence and legacy ==
[[File:ray wollbrinck vaudeville sm.jpg|thumb|right|upright|As the genre declined, most performers left the theatre. The child [[tap dancer]] Ray Wollbrinck, once called &quot;the cleverest [[buckdancer]] on the vaudeville stage&quot;, later became a bandleader and ended his days as a bank teller.]]

Some of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema, though others were not as successful.  Some performers such as [[Bert Lahr]] fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles. Many others later appeared in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] resorts that constituted the &quot;[[Borscht Belt]]&quot;.

Vaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film, radio, and television. Comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts. Film comedies of the 1920s through the 1940s used talent from the vaudeville stage and followed a vaudeville aesthetic of variety entertainment, both in Hollywood and in Asia, including China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://u.osu.edu/mclc/online-series/rea-jenkins/|title=The Ancient Art of Falling DownVaudeville Cinema between Hollywood and China|date=2017-08-29|work=MCLC Resource Center|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent prime-time radio [[variety show]]s such as ''The [[Rudy Vallée]] Show''. The structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television, from ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'' in 1948 to ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilmes2010p97&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Hilmes| first=Michele| date=February 12, 2010| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG0YsRLUi18C&amp;pg=PA97| title=Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States| page=97| publisher=Cengage Learning| isbn=978-0-495-57051-6| quote=... it is in the form of the variety show itself, network radio's offspring, that we can see the influence of vaudeville on radio most clearly. From ''The Rudy Vallee Show'' through ''Jack Benny'' and ''Bing Crosby'' to TV programs like ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', ''The Smothers Brothers'', ''Saturday Night Live'', ''In Living Color'', and ''Late Night with David Letterman'', we can see strong remnants of vaudeville's typical variety act structure. Combining a host/announcer with comedy sketches, musical performances, dance, monologues, and satiric banter--sometimes even animal acts--the variety show takes myriad forms today. The vaudeville circuit of touring companies and local theatres is gone, but it lives on electronically.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-act format had renewed success in shows such as ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' with [[Sid Caesar]] and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.  Today, performers such as [[Bill Irwin]], a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and [[Tony Award]]-winning actor, are frequently lauded as &quot;New Vaudevillians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957652-2,00.html| journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| title=Theater: Bowing Out with a Flourish| date=1989-05-15| accessdate=2010-05-27| first=William A., III| last=Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/dialogue/dialogue_irwin_3.html |series=[[Great Performances]]| title=Bill Irwin: Clown Prince| network=PBS| airdate=December 15, 2004| season=32| accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout Western popular culture. Words such as &quot;flop&quot; and &quot;gag&quot; were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the American idiom. Though not credited often, vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies.

In [[professional wrestling]], there was a noted tag team, based in [[WWE]], called [[The Vaudevillains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/37365-wwe-nxt-report-6-6-tampa|title=WWE NXT report 6-6 Tampa|work=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=June 7, 2014|author=White, James|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, noted film director Christopher Annino, maker of a new silent feature film, ''Silent Times'', founded Vaudeville Con, a gathering to celebrate the history of vaudeville.

'''Saunders Lewis''' (born '''John Saunders Lewis''') (15 October 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] political activist, poet, dramatist, historian and literary critic. He was a prominent [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]] and one of the founders of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (the National Party of Wales), later known as [[Plaid Cymru]]. Lewis is usually acknowledged as one of the most prominent figures of 20th century Welsh-language literature. In 1970, Lewis was nominated for a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Lewis was voted the tenth greatest Welsh hero in the '[[100 Welsh Heroes]]' poll, released on [[St. David's Day]] 2004. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3523363.stm Bevan is ultimate Welsh hero] extracted 12-04-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Saunders Lewis was born into a Welsh family living in [[Wallasey]], England, on 15 October 1893. He was the second of three sons of Lodwig Lewis (1859–1933), a [[Calvinistic Methodist]] minister, and his wife Mary Margaret (née Thomas, 1862–1900). Lewis attended [[Liscard]] High School for Boys&lt;ref name=DWB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chapman|first1=T. Robin|title=Lewis, John Saunders|url=https://biography.wales/article/s10-LEWI-SAU-1893|website=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=19 May 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to study [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] at [[Liverpool University]].

==First World War==
When the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out, Lewis enlisted as a volunteer with the [[King's Liverpool Regiment]] in September 1914, and in April 1915 applied for a commission with the [[South Wales Borderers]] and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|full lieutenant]] in February 1916. He served in France and was wounded in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alien Face&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Saunders Lewis: Alien Face In The Mirror |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=Writ‌ing On The Line  |first=Gwyn A. |last=Williams |authorlink=Gwyn A. Williams |network=[[Channel 4]] |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Lewis read the series of novels ''[[The Cult of the Self]]'' (French: ''Le Culte du moi'') by the French writer [[Maurice Barrès]]. Barrès, a French nationalist, influenced Lewis' own Welsh nationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alien Face&quot;/&gt;

== Return to Wales ==
In 1922, he was appointed as a lecturer in Welsh at the [[University of Wales, Swansea|University College of Wales, Swansea]]. During his time at Swansea he produced some of his most significant works of literary criticism: ''A School of Welsh Augustans'' (1924), ''[[William Williams Pantycelyn|Williams Pantycelyn]]'' (1927), and ''{{lang|cy|{{ill|Braslun o hanes llenyddiaeth Gymraeg|cy}}}}'' (An outline history of Welsh literature) (1932).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kendall2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=Tim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09LB6-dYwCUC&amp;pg=PA342|title=The Oxford Handbook of British and Irish War Poetry|date=22 February 2007|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-928266-1|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding Plaid Cymru==
Discussions of the need for a &quot;Welsh party&quot; had been conducted since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|pp=415, 454}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the generation or so before 1922 there &quot;had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation,&quot; wrote historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924 there were people in Wales &quot;eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's experiences in [[World War I]], and his sympathy for the cause of [[Irish War of Independence|Irish independence]], brought him to Welsh nationalism.

In 1924, Lewis founded ''{{lang|cy|Y Mudiad Cymreig}}'' (&quot;The Welsh Movement&quot;) with a small group of fellow nationalists. The group met secretly for the first time in Penarth on 7 January 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plaidpenarth.blogspot.com/2013/12/penarths-secret-role-in-welsh-history.html|title=PENARTH'S SECRET ROLE IN WELSH HISTORY|last=|first=|date=5 December 2013|website=Plaid Cymru Penarth|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group continued to meet in secret throughout 1924 and began drawing up a set of aims and policies intended to &quot;rescue Wales from political and cultural oblivion.&quot;

At around the same time as Lewis formed ''{{lang|cy|Y Mudiad Cymreig}}'', another group of nationalists formed ''{{lang|cy|Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru}}'' (&quot;The Welsh Home Rule Army&quot;) in Caernarfon.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historypoints.org/index.php?page=site-of-plaid-cymrus-founding-pwllheli|title=Site of Plaid Cymru’s founding, Pwllheli|last=|first=|date=|website=History Points|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was led by [[Huw Robert Jones]], who made contact with Lewis in early 1925 and proposed to form a new political party.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Lewis met with Jones, [[Lewis Valentine]], Moses Griffith, Fred Jones and D. Edmund Williams in a café called Maes Gwyn&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; during the 1925 [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[Pwllheli]], [[Gwynedd]], with the aim of establishing a &quot;Welsh party&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvp|Davies|1994a|p=547&quot; /&gt; They founded ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}'' (&quot;National Party of Wales&quot;), on 5 August 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ailgeni&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Morgan|2002|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal aim of the party would be to foster a Welsh speaking Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_548&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_548&quot; /&gt; Lewis insisted on these principles before he would agree to the Pwllheli conference.

According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1911.shtml BBCWales History extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609020726/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1911.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1891.shtml BBCWales history extracted 12-03-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609021026/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/language/pages/1891.shtml |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With these pre-requisites, Lewis condemned &quot;'Welsh nationalism' as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter-party conferences, an obsession with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language,&quot; wrote Davies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_548&quot;/&gt; It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_548&quot;/&gt; However, the party's members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; &quot;merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales,&quot; wrote Davies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_548&quot;/&gt;

==The Lewis Doctrine 1926–1939==
During the inter-war years, ''Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru'' was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Saunders Lewis, party president 1926 – 1939, &quot;the chief aim of the party [is] to 'take away from the Welsh their sense of inferiority... to remove from our beloved country the mark and shame of conquest.'&quot; Lewis sought to cast ''Welshness'' into a new context, wrote Davies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;/&gt;

Lewis wished to demonstrate how Welsh heritage was linked as one of the 'founders of European civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;/&gt; Lewis, a self-described &quot;strong [[Monarchism|monarchist]]&quot;, wrote &quot;Civilization is more than an abstraction. It must have a local habitation and name. Here its name is Wales.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm |title=Royal plans to beat nationalism |work=[[BBC News]] |date=8 March 2005 |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Lewis strove for the stability and well-being of Welsh-speaking communities, decried both capitalism and socialism and promoted what he called ''{{lang|cy|perchentyaeth}}'': a policy of &quot;[[distributism|distributing property among the masses]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_591&quot;/&gt;

Lewis was, in fact, ill-equipped to lead any party, or indeed even convince his immediate colleagues of his theories. Historian Geraint H. Jenkins writes:- &quot;..Lewis was a cold fish. His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D.&amp;nbsp;J. Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jenkins|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==

Saunders Lewis perceived the early development of BBC radio broadcasting in Wales (which was almost entirely in English) as serious threat to his aim of arresting the decline of the Welsh language (then down to 36%) and turning Wales back into a 100% Welsh-speaking nation. At the same time he also recognised that if he could exert influence and pressure on the BBC, the Corporation could become a useful tool to serve Plaid Cymru's political ends. In 1929 he declared it would soon be necessary to arrange for &quot;thousands of Welshmen to be prosecuted for refusing to pay for English programmes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Guardian 1 August 1929&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Lewis was commissioned by E.R. Appleton, Director of the BBC's Cardiff radio station, (who had banned broadcasting in Welsh) to broadcast a talk which would &quot;explain Welsh Nationalism&quot;. On vetting the script, which advocated political nationalism in preference to &quot;cultural nationalism&quot;, Appleton decided it was too controversial and inflammatory to be broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_BBC&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1933 the University of Wales Council, which had been lobbying for more Welsh-language broadcasting, appointed a ten-man council to press the case with the BBC. It included [[David Lloyd George]], [[William R. P. George|William George]], [[William John Gruffydd|W.&amp;nbsp;J. Gruffydd]] and Saunders Lewis – who was continuing to incense the BBC by publicly alleging it was &quot;seeking the destruction of the Welsh language&quot;. The University Committee, which was described by BBC Director General [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] as &quot;the most unpleasant and unreliable people with whom it has been my misfortune to deal&quot; gained ever more influence on the BBC in Wales not least in the selection of BBC staff – a function delegated to the Committee by the Corporation. As newspapers of the time noted, appointees seemed primarily drawn from the families of the Welsh-speaking elite including &quot;the son of a professor of Welsh and the offspring of three archdruids&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994b|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders Lewis's assiduous campaigning over the years was to succeed in cementing an ongoing Plaid Cymru influence within the BBC. When the BBC's Welsh Advisory Council was eventually established in 1946, although half its members were Labour, several Plaid Cymru supporters were appointed including Saunders Lewis's successor as Plaid Cymru president, [[Gwynfor Evans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_BBC&quot;/&gt;

==''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' 1936==

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK Government settled on establishing an [[RAF]] training camp and aerodrome at [[Penyberth]]&lt;ref&gt;[[RAF Penrhos]]&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in [[Gwynedd]]. The events surrounding the protest, known as ''{{lang|cy|Tân yn Llŷn}}'' (&quot;Fire in Llŷn&quot;), helped define ''{{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}}''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_593&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government settled on Llŷn as the site for its training camp after similar proposed sites in [[Northumberland]] and [[Dorset]] met with protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Davies|1994a|p=592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, UK Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] refused to hear the case against building this 'bombing school' in Wales, despite a deputation representing 500,000 Welsh protesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt; Protest against the project was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK Government was intent upon turning one of the &quot;essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature&quot; into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt; Construction of this military academy began exactly 400 years after the first [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]] annexing Wales into England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt;

On 8 September 1936, the building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, [[Lewis Valentine]], and [[David John Williams|D.&amp;nbsp;J. Williams]] claimed responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt; They were tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to agree on a verdict. The case was then sent to be retried at the [[Old Bailey]] in London, where the &quot;Three&quot; were convicted, and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], they were greeted as heroes by 15,000 Welsh people at a pavilion in [[Caernarfon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies_592&quot;/&gt;

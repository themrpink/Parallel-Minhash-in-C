=== Power factor correction of linear loads ===
A high power factor is generally desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an [[electric power transmission]] utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.

Power factor correction brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act to cancel the inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power to meet the demand of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow all the way from the utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.

The reactive elements in power factor correction devices can create voltage fluctuations and harmonic noise when switched on or off. They will supply or sink reactive power regardless of whether there is a corresponding load operating nearby, increasing the system's no-load losses. In the worst case, reactive elements can interact with the system and with each other to create resonant conditions, resulting in system instability and severe [[overvoltage]] fluctuations. As such, reactive elements cannot simply be applied without engineering analysis.

[[Capacitor]]s (single-phase or three-phase units, delta-connection); 6. [[Transformer]] (for controls and ventilation fans) ]]

An '''automatic power factor correction unit''' consists of a number of [[capacitor]]s that are switched by means of [[contactor]]s. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures power factor in an electrical network. Depending on the load and power factor of the network, the power factor controller will switch the necessary blocks of capacitors in steps to make sure the power factor stays above a selected value.

In place of a set of switched [[capacitor]]s, an unloaded [[synchronous motor]] can supply reactive power. The [[reactive power]] drawn by the synchronous motor is a function of its field excitation. It is referred to as a '''[[synchronous condenser]]'''. It is started and connected to the [[electrical network]]. It operates at a leading power factor and puts [[volt-ampere reactive|vars]] onto the network as required to support a system's [[voltage]] or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.

The synchronous condenser's installation and operation are identical to those of large [[electric motor]]s. Its principal advantage is the ease with which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a variable capacitor. Unlike with capacitors, the amount of reactive power supplied is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks.  Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as [[steel mill]]s.

For power factor correction of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic devices such as the [[Static VAR compensator]] or [[STATCOM]] are increasingly used. These systems are able to compensate sudden changes of power factor much more rapidly than contactor-switched capacitor banks, and being solid-state require less maintenance than synchronous condensers.

== Non-linear loads ==
Examples of non-linear loads on a power system are rectifiers (such as used in a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, electric [[welding]] machines, or [[arc furnace]]s. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. ''Distortion power factor'' is a measure of how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.
[[File:Power factor 75 2.png|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Sinusoidal voltage and non-sinusoidal current give a distortion power factor of 0.75 for this computer power supply load.]]

=== Non-sinusoidal components ===
In linear circuits having only sinusoidal currents and voltages of one frequency, the power factor arises only from the difference in phase between the current and voltage. This is &quot;displacement power factor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuchsMasoum2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewald Fuchs|author2=Mohammad A. S. Masoum|title=Power Quality in Power Systems and Electrical Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuGcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800988-8|pages=432–|quote=The DPF it the cosine of the angle between these two quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear loads change the shape of the current waveform from a [[sine wave]] to some other form. Non-linear loads create [[harmonic]] currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain [[non-linear]] loads such as [[rectifiers]], some forms of electric lighting, [[electric arc furnace]]s, welding equipment, [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]], variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.

To measure the real power or reactive power, a [[wattmeter]] designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.

=== Distortion power factor ===
The '''distortion power factor''' is the distortion component associated with the harmonic voltages and currents present in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{distortion power factor}
&amp; = \frac{ I_1}{I_{rms}} \\
&amp; = \frac{I_1} {\sqrt{I_1^2+I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} { \sqrt{1+ \frac{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}{I_1^2}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{THD}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total harmonic distortion]] of the load current. 
:&lt;math&gt;THD_i = \frac{\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{h=2}^\infty I_h^2}} {I_1}= \frac{\sqrt{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} {I_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental component of the current and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mbox{rms}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current – both are [[root mean square]]-values (distortion power factor can also be used to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |quote=...and voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result when multiplied with the displacement power factor (DPF) is the overall, true power factor or just power factor (PF):
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{PF} = \frac{\cos{\varphi}} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Distortion in three-phase networks ===
In practice, the local effects of distortion current on devices in a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase distribution network]] rely on the magnitude of certain order harmonics rather than the total harmonic distortion.

For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) have the property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a [[delta-wye transformer]], these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater [[Joule heating|resistive heating]]. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they will result in a non-zero current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral wire]]. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases
and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter-url = http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/harmonics.pdf | title = Power System Harmonics | publisher = Pacific Gas and Electric | chapter = Single-phase load harmonics vs. three-phase load harmonics | chapter-format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter-url = http://energylogix.ca/harmonics_and_ieee.pdf | title = Harmonics and IEEE 519 | publisher = EnergyLogix Solutions | chapter = Harmonic Effects | place = [[Canada|CA]] | chapter-format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger [[eddy currents]] in the magnetic core of the transformer. Eddy current losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer's efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher = Electro-Test |section=Transformers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17th, etc.) combine 120 degrees out of phase, similarly to the fundamental harmonic but in a reversed sequence.  In generators and motors, these currents produce magnetic fields which oppose the rotation of the shaft and sometimes result in damaging mechanical vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |section=Motors |quote=The interaction between the positive and negative sequence magnetic fields and currents produces torsional oscillations of the motor shaft. These oscillations result in shaft vibrations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switched-mode power supplies ===
{{Main|switched-mode power supply#Power factor}}
A particularly important class of non-linear loads is the millions of personal computers that typically incorporate [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1&amp;nbsp;kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple full-wave rectifier that conducted only when the [[Mains electricity|mains]] instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors.  This leads to very high [[peak-to-average ratio|ratios of peak-to-average]] input current, which also lead to a low distortion power factor and potentially serious phase and neutral loading concerns.

A typical switched-mode power supply first converts the AC mains to a DC bus by means of a [[bridge rectifier]]. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the [[rectifier]] is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at [[harmonic]]s of the frequency of the voltage. This presents a particular problem for the power companies, because they cannot compensate for the harmonic current by adding simple capacitors or inductors, as they could for the reactive power drawn by a linear load. Many jurisdictions are beginning to legally require power factor correction for all power supplies above a certain power level.

Regulatory agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all switched-mode power supplies with output power more than 75&amp;nbsp;W must include passive power factor correction, at least. [[80 Plus]] power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.80plus.org/ | publisher = 80 Plus | title = Certified Power Supplies and Manufacturers | section = What is an 80 PLUS certified power supply?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power factor correction (PFC) in non-linear loads ===

==== Passive PFC ====
The simplest way to control the [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] current is to use a [[electronic filter|filter]] that passes current only at [[utility frequency|line frequency]] (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device look more like a [[linear]] load. An example of passive PFC is a [[valley-fill circuit]].

A disadvantage of passive PFC is that it requires larger inductors or capacitors than an equivalent power active PFC circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |publisher=Nuvation |date=Fall 2006 |title=Power Supply Design Principles: Techniques and Solutions, Part 3 |newspaper=Newsletter |first=Ben |last=Schramm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309134617/http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |archive-date=2007-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Xplore | title = Quasi-active power factor correction with a variable inductive filter: theory, design and practice | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 248–255 | publisher = IEEE| doi = 10.1109/TPEL.2002.807135 | bibcode = 2003ITPE...18..248W | year = 2003 | last1 = Wolfle | first1 = W.H. | last2 = Hurley | first2 = W.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Nuigalway |type=project |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/power_electronics/projects/quasi_active.html |place=[[Ireland|IE]] |title=Power electronics |contribution=Quasi-active Power Factor Correction: The Role of Variable Inductance |last1=Wölfle |first1=W.

==== Active PFC ====
[[File:Active pfc PSU packaging.png|right|thumb|Specifications taken from the packaging of a 610 W [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC power supply]] showing active PFC rating]]

Active PFC is the use of [[power electronics]] to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Fairchild Semiconductor | year = 2004 | type = application note | number = 42047 | title = Power Factor Correction (PFC) Basics | url = http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-42047.pdf | access-date = 2009-11-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140611063712/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-42047.pdf | archive-date = 2014-06-11 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of the active PFC are [[Buck converter|buck]], [[Boost converter|boost]], [[Buck-boost converter|buck-boost]] and [[synchronous condenser]].  Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.

In the case of a switched-mode power supply, a [[boost converter]] is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant voltage at its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.

For a three-phase SMPS, the [[Vienna rectifier]] configuration may be used to substantially improve the power factor.

[[Switched-mode power supply|SMPSs]] with passive PFC can achieve power factor of about 0.7–0.75, SMPSs with active PFC, up to 0.99 power factor, while a SMPS without any power factor correction have a power factor of only about 0.55–0.65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Sugawara |first1=I. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Y. |last3=Takeuchi |first3=A. |last4=Teshima |first4=T. |contribution=Experimental studies on active and passive PFC circuits |title=INTELEC 97, 19th International Telecommunications Energy Conference |date=19–23 Oct 1997 |pages=571–78 |doi=10.1109/INTLEC.1997.646051|isbn=978-0-7803-3996-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their very wide input voltage range, many power supplies with active PFC can automatically adjust to operate on AC power from about 100&amp;nbsp;V (Japan) to 240&amp;nbsp;V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.

==== Dynamic PFC ====
Dynamic power factor correction (DPFC), sometimes referred to as &quot;real-time power factor correction,&quot; is used for electrical stabilization in cases of rapid load changes (e.g. at large manufacturing sites). DPFC is useful when standard power factor correction would cause over or under correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Chavez |first=C. |last2=Houdek |first2=J. A. |title=Dynamic Harmonic Mitigation and power factor correction |publisher=IEEE |book-title= EPQU'07 |conference=9th International Conference Electrical Power Quality and Utilisation: October 9-11, 2007, Barcelona, Spain |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424144 |isbn=978-84-690-9441-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DPFC uses semiconductor switches, typically [[thyristor]]s, to quickly connect and disconnect capacitors or inductors to improve power factor.

== Importance in distribution systems ==
[[File:Condensor bank 150kV - 75MVAR.jpg|thumb|upright|75 MVAr capacitor bank in a 150 kV substation]]
Power factors below 1.0 require a utility to generate more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to the square of the current). Alternatively, all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current. When the power factor is close to unity, for the same kVA rating of the transformer more load current can be supplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.electricalclassroom.com/power-factor/|title=Power Factor – Importance, Calculation and Correction techniques|date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilities typically charge additional costs to commercial customers who have a power factor below some limit, which is typically 0.9 to 0.95.  Engineers are often interested in the power factor of a load as one of the factors that affect the efficiency of power transmission.

With the rising cost of energy and concerns over the efficient delivery of power, active PFC has become more common in consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = ON Semiconductor | year = 2007 | title = Power Factor Correction Handbook | url = http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/HBD853-D.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current [[Energy Star]] guidelines for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = US | url = http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/computer/Version5.0_Computer_Spec.pdf | publisher = Energy Star | title = Program Requirements for Computers | edition = Version 5.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC's power supply]]. According to a white paper authored by Intel and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], PCs with internal power supplies will require the use of active power factor correction to meet the ENERGY STAR 5.0 Program Requirements for Computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bolioli |first1=T. |last2=Duggirala |first2=M. |last3=Haines |first3=E. |last4=Kolappan |first4=R. |last5=Wong |first5=H. |year=2009 |publisher=Energy Star |title=Version 5.0 System Implementation |type=white paper |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/program_reqs/Computers_Intel_Whitepaper_Spec5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[IEC EN 61000-3-2|EN 61000-3-2]] requires power factor correction be incorporated into consumer products.

Small customers, such as households, are not usually charged for reactive power and so power factor metering equipment for such customers will not be installed.

== Measurement techniques ==
The power factor in a single-phase circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced poly phase circuit is not uniquely defined.

A direct reading power factor meter can be made with a [[moving coil meter]] of the electrodynamic type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the moving part of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load.  One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |author1-link=Donald G. Fink |first2=H. Wayne |last2=Beaty |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=11 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |place=New York |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-07-020974-9 |page=3‐29 paragraph 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another electromechanical instrument is the polarized-vane type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Manual of Electric Instruments Construction and Operating Principles |id=GET-1087A |publisher=General Electric, Meter and Instrument Department |place=Schenectady, New York |year=1949 |pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, just like a polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application.  A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument can be made to register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.

Digital instruments exist that directly measure the time lag between voltage and current waveforms. Low-cost instruments of this type measure the peak of the waveforms. More sophisticated versions measure the peak of the fundamental harmonic only, thus giving a more accurate reading for phase angle on distorted waveforms. Calculating power factor from voltage and current phases is only accurate if both waveforms are sinusoidal.&lt;ref name=ni_white_paper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4278/en/|title=The Fundamentals of FFT-Based Signal Analysis and Measurement in LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI|work=National Instruments Corporation|access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power Quality Analyzers, often referred to as Power Analyzers, make a digital recording of the voltage and current waveform (typically either one phase or three phase) and accurately calculate true power (watts), apparent power (VA) power factor, AC voltage, AC current, DC voltage, DC current, frequency, IEC61000-3-2/3-12 Harmonic measurement, IEC61000-3-3/3-11 flicker measurement, individual phase voltages in delta applications where there is no neutral line, total harmonic distortion, phase and amplitude of individual voltage or current harmonics, etc.&lt;ref name=Yokogawa_WT3000E&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/ftp/dist/ks/catalog/en/BUWT3000E-01EN_020.pdf|title=WT3000E Series Precision Power Analyzers|work=Yokogawa Corporation|access-date=6 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112155/http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/ftp/dist/ks/catalog/en/BUWT3000E-01EN_020.pdf|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fluke_1760&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.testequity.com/documents/pdf/1760-ds.pdf|title=Fluke 1760 Three-Phase Power Quality Recorder |work=Fluke Corporation|access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mnemonics ==
English-language power engineering students are advised to remember:
&quot;ELI the ICE man&quot; or &quot;ELI on ICE&quot; – the voltage E, leads the current I, in an inductor L. The current I leads the voltage E in a capacitor C.

Another common mnemonic is &quot;CIVIL&quot; – in a capacitor (C) the current (I) leads voltage (V), voltage (V) leads current (I) in an inductor (L).

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''power failure transfer''' has the following meanings:

#The switching of primary utilities to their secondary backup whenever the primary source operates outside its design parameters. This is accomplished via a [[transfer switch]].
#In [[telephony]], a function which, when activated in the event of a commercial [[power failure]] or a low-voltage battery condition at a [[subscriber]] location, supplies power to predesignated subscriber equipment via the [[telephone exchange|central office]] [[Trunking|trunk]].

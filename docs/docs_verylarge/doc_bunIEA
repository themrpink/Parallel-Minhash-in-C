'''Locri''' is a town and ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in the [[province of Reggio Calabria]], [[Calabria]], southern Italy. Its name derives from that of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] region of [[Locris]]. Today it is an important administrative and cultural centre on the Ionian Coast and within its province.

==History==
'''Epizephyrian Locris''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ἐπιζεφύριοι Λοκροί; from  ἐπί ''epi'', &quot;on&quot;, Ζέφυρος (''Zephyros''), [[Zephyrus|West Wind]], and the plural of Λοκρός, ''Lokros'', &quot;a Locrian,&quot; thus &quot;The Western Locrians&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;It was common in classical times to name a city in the plural for the name of its inhabitants and/or its eponymous deity or founder, cp. αἱ Ἀθήναι, literally &quot;The Athenas,&quot; i.e. &quot;[[Athens]].&quot; See also the [[List of traditional Greek place names]]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded about 680 BC on the Italian shore of the [[Ionian Sea]], near modern Capo Zefirio, by the [[Locrians]], apparently by [[Opuntii]] (East Locrians) from the city of [[Opus, Greece|Opus]], but including [[Ozolae]] (West Locrians) and [[Lacedaemonians]]. Its Latin name, ''Locri'', is the plural of the Latin ''Locrus'', which was used both to mean an inhabitant of Locris and the [[Locrus|eponymous ancestor of the Locrians]]. [[Strabo]] suggests that it was the Ozolae who were the main founders. 
[[Image:Locri Pinax Of Persephone And Hades.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pinax]] from Locris: Persephone and Hades sitting on the throne]]
Due to fierce winds at an original settlement, the settlers moved to the present site. After a century, a [[defensive wall]] was built. Outside the city there are several [[necropolis|necropoleis]], some of which are very large.

Epizephyrian Locris was one of the cities of [[Magna Graecia]]. Its renowned lawgiver [[Zaleucus]] decreed that anyone who proposed a change in the laws should do so with a noose about their neck, with which they should be hanged if the amendment did not pass.  [[Plato]] called it &quot;The flower of Italy&quot;, due to the local peoples' characteristics. Locris was the site of two great sanctuaries, that of [[Persephone]] — here worshipped as the protector of fertile marriage — and of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;See the history of the [[Ludovisi Throne]], now thought to have come from Locris.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Locri, perhaps uniquely, Persephone was worshiped as protector of marriage and childbirth, a role usually assumed by [[Hera]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] knew the temple there as the most illustrious in Italy. &lt;ref&gt;https://journals.openedition.org/kernos/2388&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[5th century BC]], votive [[Pinax| pinakes]] in terracotta were often dedicated as offerings to the goddess, made in series and painted with bright colors, animated by scenes connected to the myth of Persephone. Many of these pinakes are now on display in the [[Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia| National Museum of Magna Græcia]] in Reggio Calabria. Locrian pinakes represent one of the most significant categories of objects from Magna Graecia, both as documents of religious practice and as works of art.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.it/books?id=R7PP3wNr4zMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=cult+of+persephone+reggio+calabria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndPam8mZN6&amp;sig=ACfU3U0Bf9hs-u3iDMnhL3-Du1SXxmWlRw&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0kuanm9nhAhULyaQKHSW_BlkQ6AEwBXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cult%20of%20persephone%20reggio%20calabria&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
In the iconography of votive plaques at Locri, her abduction and marriage to [[Hades]] served as an emblem of the marital state, children at Locri were dedicated to Persephone, and maidens about to be wed brought their [[peplos]] to be blessed.

In the early centuries Locris was allied with [[Sparta]], and later with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. It founded two colonies of its own, [[Vibo Valentia|Hipponion]] and [[Medma]]. During the Pyrrhic Wars (280-275 BC) fought between [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and [[Rome]], Locris accepted a Roman garrison and fought against the Epirote king. However, the city changed sides numerous times during the war. Bronze tablets from the treasury of its Olympeum, a temple to [[Zeus]], record payments to a 'king', generally thought to be Pyrrhus. Despite this, Pyrrhus plundered the temple of Persephone at Locris before his return to Epirus, an event which would live on in the memory of the Greeks of Italy. At the end of the war, perhaps to allay fears about its loyalty, Locris minted coins depicting a seated Rome being crowned by 'Pistis', a goddess personifying good faith and loyalty, and returned to the Roman fold.

The city was abandoned in the [[5th century AD]]. The town was finally destroyed by the [[Saracens]] in 915. The survivors fled inland about {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} to the town [[Gerace]] on the slopes of the [[Aspromonte]]. 

In 1982, the famous [[Ludovisi Throne]], found in Rome in 1887, was securely linked to the newly studied Ionic temple at Marasà, in Locri.  A reconstruction of the throne was shown to fit exactly into remaining blocks in the temple's foundations, and it has been suggested that terracotta votive plaques, or pinakes, of cults at Lokri Epizefiri, are the only stylistic parallel to the Throne.&lt;ref&gt;Terra, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
The marble sculpture, in its bas-relief decoration, represents on the front side Aphrodite born from the sea foam (but some scholars sees in it the representation of Persephone coming back from the Hades) and helped by two maidservants to raise from the water, while on the left side is represented a naked flute-girl seated on a cushion and playing the double-flute, and on the right side a veiled woman using an incense-burner.
&lt;!--COMPLETE UNTIL MODERN TIMES--&gt;

==Modern Locri==
After 1850 Gerace developed along the coast, forming a new centre Gerace Marina, to house new public buildings and a railway station. In 1934 it changed its name in Locri, which is now the administrative centre of the [[Locride]] area. The city boasts a National Museum and an Archaeological Park &lt;ref&gt;http://www.locriantica.it/enghome.htm www.locriantica.it&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from the archeological sites, the town is also an important sea-side resort along the ''Costa dei Gelsomini'', or Jasmine Coast, one of the wildest coastlines of Italy.&lt;ref name=jasmine&gt;[http://www.italia.it/en/travel-ideas/the-sea/calabrias-jasmine-coast.html Calabria’s Jasmine Coast], Italia, site of [[ENIT]] - the Italian Government Tourist Board, accessed 14 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Locri, with over 12,000 inhabitants, is an important administrative and cultural centre on the Ionian Coast, in the Italian Province of Reggio Calabria. The town is easily reached by plane; in fact, it is only 90 minutes away from the [[Lamezia Terme International Airport| International Airport]] of [[Lamezia Terme]] and from the Airport of Reggio Calabria. Locri is well connected to all regional and national towns and cities by train, shuttle, taxi, and bus. The A2 autoroute makes Locri easy to reach by car, too. 
[[Sicily]] is accessible by ferry boat from [[Villa San Giovanni]] or Reggio Calabria, both of which are a car or a train journey away from Locri. There are several hotels, residences, hostels, and bed&amp;breakfast establishments where tourists and visitors can find comfortable accommodation for their stay. The Tourist Information Centre can offer assistance and information on matters of accommodation.
In Locri, you can find many administrative bodies and public services, such as a criminal and civil court, a revenue agency, a police station, travel agencies, three post offices (two of which have ATM facilities), banks, the State Archive, the City Hall (built in 1880), trade unions, the bishop's office, several Catholic churches, and an Indian and an Evangelical church.  The city is also home to the most important hospital of the area, an emergency medical service, many private doctors, and three pharmacies. There are in the locality several state schools – including Elementary Schools, High Schools, Lyceums, and Vocational  Schools  – as well as private schools and two private English language schools .
The city boasts a National Museum and an Archaeological Park, two cinemas, two cultural centres, a theatre, and a library. In Locri you will find many shops, restaurants, pizzerias, fast food outlets, pubs, bars, cafeterias, patisseries, farm restaurants, fruit and vegetable market halls, florists, supermarkets, and shopping malls. You also have facilities for a wide range of sports, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, snorkeling, fishing and diving, and, because there is nearby hilly and mountainous terrain, trekking and hiking are further options. Finally, being a seaside city, Locri can offer enjoyable walks on the sea-front boulevard or on the beach and in the summer months it plays host to an assortment of beach-side lidos.

==Main sights==

===Ionic temple of Marasà===
In the first half of the fifth century BC, the Locrians demolished their archaic temple and rebuilt a new temple in the [[Ionic order|Ionic style]]. The temple was designed by [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] architects around 470 BC, based on the idea of [[Hiero I of Syracuse]].

The new temple occupies the same place as the previous one but it has a different orientation. The temple was destroyed in the 11th century. The dimensions of the temple were {{convert|45.5|by|19.8|m|ft}}. The [[cella]] is free of supports on the central axes. The [[pronaos]] had two columns. The temple has seventeen Ionic columns on the long side, and six on the front. The height of the temple was {{convert|12|m|ft}}.

According to Italian scholar [[Margherita Guarducci]], the famous [[Ludovisi Throne]] comes from the temple of Aphrodite of Locri Epizephyrii, where it was used as the parapet of the [[bothros]]. This theory is strengthened by the measures of the sculpture which fit perfectly together with the three great stones of the covering of the ''bothros''; stones still existing and open to visits inside the archaeological area of the Temple of contrada Marasà&lt;ref&gt;https://www.locriantica.it/english/finds/ludovisi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

===The theatre===

The theatre was built in the fourth century BC not far from the ancient city, 
in the Contrada Pirettina, taking advantage of a hillside slope. The original structure had space for more than 4,500 people; now only the central part of the theatre is visible.

Part of the [[Cavea]] was cut into the rocks. Each plane was divided in 7 wedges between 6 scales. A horizontal separation divided the upper theater from the lower theatre.

'''Dick Bruna''' (born Hendrik Magdalenus Bruna, 23 August 1927 – 16 February 2017) was a Dutch author, artist, illustrator and graphic designer.

Bruna was best known for his children's books which he authored and illustrated, numbering over 200. His most notable creation was [[Miffy]] (''Nijntje'' in the original Dutch), a small rabbit drawn with heavy graphic lines, simple shapes and primary colours. Bruna also created stories for characters such as Lottie, Farmer John, and Hettie Hedgehog.

Aside from his prolific catalog of children's books, Bruna also illustrated and designed book covers, posters and promotional materials for his father's publishing company A.W. Bruna &amp; Zoon. His most popular designs graced the covers of the {{ill|Zwarte Beertjes|nl}} series of books. Well known among his designs are those for [[Georges Simenon|Simenon's]] [[Maigret]] books, typified by graphic silhouettes of a pipe on various backgrounds.

== Biography ==
Dick Bruna's father, A. W. Bruna, directed the family-owned publishing company [[A.W. Bruna Uitgevers|Bruna]], with his brother [[Henk Bruna]]. His father's intentions were for Bruna to follow in his footsteps,{{Citation needed|reason=This could be false.|date=February 2017}} but Bruna had different plans and wanted to be an artist. He traveled to London and lived for a while in Paris, where he fell under the influence of [[Ferdinand Leger]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and especially [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3656988/I-saw-Matisse-and-came-up-with-Miffy.html|title='I saw Matisse - and came up with Miffy'|last=Secher|first=Benjamin|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the Netherlands he attended the [[Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten]] in Amsterdam but soon quit; he said afterwards that he had no talent as a painter and could not draw perspective.&lt;ref name=witman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Witman|first1=Bob|title=Dick Bruna (1927–2017) creëerde met Nijntje een universum waarin geen cynisme of kwaad bestaat|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/boeken/dick-bruna-1927-2017-creeerde-met-nijntje-een-universum-waarin-geen-cynisme-of-kwaad-bestaat%7Ea4463928/|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|date=17 February 2017|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, while on family holiday, he saw a rabbit hopping around and later made attempts to draw it, thereby creating &quot;Nijntje&quot; (&quot;Miffy&quot; in English),&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/17/miffy-creator-dick-bruna-has-died-aged-89 | work = The Guardian | title = Miffy creator Dick Bruna has died aged 89 |first = Sian | last = Cain | date = 17 February 2017 | accessdate = 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word a Dutch child might use as the diminutive for &quot;konijntje&quot;, &quot;little rabbit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|JaXkbdpLjX4|Nijntje liedje - lief klein konijntje (refrein) (English: &quot;Miffy song - sweet little bunny (chorus)&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruna illustrated over 2,000 covers and over 100 posters for the family business, A.W. Bruna &amp; Zoon. But when the Amsterdam company Art Unlimited decided to publish Poster &amp; Postcards following Roby Bellemans traveling international exhibitions with Dutch and other children book illustrators, Dick Bruna approached Roby about this collaboration and decided to let Art Unlimited publish his “Nijntje” cards.  
His most recognized illustrations were for the Zwarte Beertjes&lt;!-- http://www.zwartebeertjes.nl/ --&gt; (English: little black bears) series of books, including [[Simon Templar|The Saint]], [[James Bond]], [[Georges Simenon|Simenon]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. He has said that the Japanese character [[Hello Kitty]] was copied from Miffy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3557810/Dick-Bruna-creator-of-the-Miffy-books-talks-about-his-life-and-work.html |title=Dick Bruna, creator of the Miffy books, talks about his life and work |last=Harrod |first=Horatia |date=31 July 2008 |website=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Press Holdings |access-date=17 September 2019 |quote=&lt;small&gt;The only other time in our conversation when Bruna's brow clouds over is when we discuss Hello Kitty, the Japanese cartoon beloved of cute-obsessed schoolgirls and lovers of kitsch throughout the world.

== Influences ==

At a young age Bruna started drawing, but was also influenced by artists of other art forms. He drew covers for his school newspaper in Walt Disney style.{{Citation needed|reason=This could be false.|date=February 2017}} Later he admired [[Rembrandt van Rijn|Rembrandt]] and [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]].{{Citation needed|reason=This could be false.|date=February 2017}}

The biggest influence was perhaps [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]]. Dick Bruna's first works were based on [[collage]]s by the French painter. Bruna has also been noted to have been influenced by the Dutch graphic design movement, [[De Stijl]], in particular the work of architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunnylove&quot;&gt;{{cite news

'''Miffy''' ({{lang-nl|Nijntje}}, pronounced {{IPA-nl|ˈnɛiɲcə|}}) is a small female [[rabbit]] in a series of [[picture book]]s drawn and written by Dutch artist [[Dick Bruna]]. The original Dutch name, &quot;Nijntje&quot;, is a shortening of the [[diminutive]] ''konijntje'', &quot;little rabbit&quot;.

The first Miffy book was produced in 1953, and almost 30 others have followed. In total they have sold over 85 million copies, and led to two separate television series as well as items such as clothes and toys featuring the character. A feature-length film, ''[[Miffy the Movie]]'', was released on 30 January 2013.

Four television series based on the character have been produced: ''[[Dick Bruna]]'s Miffy Storybook Classics: The Original Series'', which ran from January 1, 1984 until December 31, 1992 on [[PBS]] in the [[United States]], ''Miffy: Colors, Numbers, and Shapes'', which ran January 1, 1996 until December 31, 1996 on [[Cartoon Network]] in the [[United States]], ''[[Miffy and Friends]]'', which ran from April 7, 2003 until August 10, 2006 on [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] in the United States, and ''[[Miffy's Adventures Big and Small]]'', which premiered 2 October 2015 on [[Nick Jr.]] in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==

Miffy was created in 1953 after Bruna had been telling his one-year-old son, Sierk, stories about a little rabbit they had seen earlier in the dunes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/15/booksforchildrenandteenagers.lisaallardice |title=Bunny love |date=15 February 2006 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Allardice |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709062546/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/feb/15/booksforchildrenandteenagers.lisaallardice |archivedate=July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while on holiday at [[Egmond aan Zee]]. Miffy became a female after Bruna decided that he wanted to draw a dress and not trousers on his rabbit. Depending on the story, Miffy can range in age from being a baby to being four years old.

At first Miffy looked like a toy animal with floppy ears, but by 1963, her design was changed to her current incarnation, a stylized form of a rabbit. Miffy is drawn in a graphic style, with minimalist black graphic lines.  Bruna chose to only use black, white, the primary colors (red, yellow and blue), green, orange, brown, and gray. It is his use of primarily primary colors that makes Miffy instantly recognisable, and also popular with preschoolers, because of her bright and intense simplistic colors.

There are now almost 32 Miffy titles and many more for the other characters. Bruna has produced a total of 124 picture books for children.
The Miffy books each contain twelve pages of story. Each page has one illustration and four lines of verse, the last word of the second line rhymes with the last of the fourth. They are written about things that children can understand, and situations they will face such as going to the hospital and going to school, and they always have a happy ending. Some books have no text at all, such as ''Miffy's Dream''.

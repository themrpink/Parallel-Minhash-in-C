==Geography==
Catania is located on the east coast of the island of [[Sicily]], at the foot of [[Mount Etna]].

As observed by [[Strabo]], the location of Catania at the foot of [[Mount Etna]] has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p.&amp;nbsp;269)

Two [[subterranean river]]s run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).&lt;ref&gt;Giuffrida Tino, ''Catania dalle origini alla dominazione normanna'', Catania, Bonaccorso.

===Climate===
The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is &quot;[[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]]&quot; (Mediterranean Climate).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6461&amp;cityname=Catania%2C+Sicilia%2C+Italy&amp;units= Climate Summary from Weatherbase.com (Catania, Italy)]&lt;/ref&gt; It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of {{convert|40|°C|0}} are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around {{convert|20|C|F|disp=or}}) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3–4 months). The city receives around {{convert|500|mm|abbr=off}} of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over {{convert|1,200|mm|disp=or|abbr=off}}, driest under {{convert|250|mm|disp=or|abbr=off}},).

During winter nights lows can occasionally go under {{convert|0|°C|0}}. Highs under {{convert|10|°C|0}} can happen during winter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ilmeteo.it/portale/archivio-meteo/Catania&lt;/ref&gt; Snow, due to the presence of [[Mount Etna|Etna]] that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.

==Demographics==
[[File:Cataniavistaarea.jpg|thumb|upright|An aerial view of the port of Catania]]
In January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania,&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).

The average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while [[Italy]] as a whole grew by 3.85 percent.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; The reason for this [[population decline]] in the ''comune'' di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the ''comuni'' of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the ''comune'' di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland ''comuni'' increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt;

The current [[birth rate]] of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. {{As of|2006}}, 98.03% of the population was [[Italian people|Italian]]. The largest immigrant groups come from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]: 0.69%, [[South Asia]]: 0.46%, and from other [[Europe]]an countries (particularly from [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]): 0.33%.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Catania}}

===Foundation===
Around 729 BC, the ancient village of ''Katane'' was occupied by [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] Greek settlers from nearby [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of ''Katánē'' under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly [[Hellenization|Hellenised]].

[[Thucydides]] states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern [[Lentini]]), which he claims was five years after [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], or 730 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 3; [[Strabo]] vi. p. 268; [[Scymnus]] 286; [[Scylax]] § 13; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.

===Greek Catania===

In ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the ''Campus Piorum''; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the [[List of Latin language poets|Latin poets]], of whom the younger [[Lucilius]] and [[Claudian]] have dwelt upon it at considerable length.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] x. 28. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conon, ''Narr.'' 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philostr. ''Vit. Apoll.'' v. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Solinus]] 5. § 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Julius Hyginus 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] v. 4. Ext. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucil. ''Aetn.'' 602-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudian. ''Idyll.'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auson. ''Ordo Nob. Urb.'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator [[Charondas]] (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of [[Magna Graecia]] also, as well as to his own country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Pol.'' ii. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.

It was residence of the poets [[Ibycus]] and [[Stesichorus]] (c. 630–555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of ''Porta Stesichoreia''. [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the [[Velia (town)|Eleatic]] school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city&lt;ref&gt;Diog. Laert. ix. 2. § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.

Catania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hieron of Syracuse]], whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini – said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusans]] and [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]]. At the same time he changed the city's name to '''{{lang|grc|Αἴτνη}}''' (''Aítnē'', Aetna or Ætna, after the nearby [[Mount Etna]], and proclaimed himself the [[Oekist]] or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by [[Pindar]], and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] xi. 49, in 66; Strabo l.c.; Pind. ''Pyth.'' i., and Schol. ''ad loc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]], the Syracusans combined with [[Ducetius]], king of the [[Sicels]], to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of [[Aetna (city)|Inessa]] (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xi. 76; Strabo ''l. c.'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.

In the [[Peloponnesian War]] during the great [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[Sicilian Expedition|expedition to Sicily]]  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that [[Alcibiades]] would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 50–52, 63, 71, 89; Diod. xiii. 4, 6, 7; [[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Nic.'' 15, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.

But in 403 BC it fell into the power of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]], who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with [[Campania]]n mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to [[Aetna (city)|Aetna]], on the approach of the great [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] armament under [[Himilco (general)|Himilco]] and [[Mago (fleet commander)|Mago]]. After the great naval [[Battle of Catana (397 BC)]] which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated [[Leptines of Syracuse]], the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 15, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], the assassin of [[Dion of Syracuse]], held Catania for a time (Plut. ''Dion.'' 58); and when [[Timoleon]] landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot [[Mamercus of Catane|Mamercus]] who at first joined the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]ian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xvi. 69; Plut. ''Timol.'' 13, 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xix. 110, xxii. 8, Exc. Hoesch. p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to [[Andron of Catania|Andron]], a citizen of Catania.&lt;ref&gt;Athen. i. p.&amp;nbsp;22, c.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman rule===
In the [[First Punic War]] Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the [[Roman Republic]] after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by [[Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla|Valerius Messalla]].&lt;ref&gt;Eutrop. ii. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder , Naturalis historia, vii. 60&lt;/ref&gt; A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the [[Comitium]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder , Naturalis historia, VII 214&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the city became a ''civitas decumana'' i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], built a gymnasium here.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Marcellus, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (''foederata civitas''), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern [[Taormina]]) and Messana (modern [[Messina]]), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.

Around 135 BC during the [[First Servile War]], it was conquered by rebel slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, VI 2, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most serious [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]] of [[Mount Etna]] happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Oros. v. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the ''Piana di Catania'', a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], to Leontini or Centuripa (modern [[Centuripe]]), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.

[[Cicero]] repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its [[Chief Magistrate|chief magistrate]] bearing the title of ''Proagorus''; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' iii. 4. 3, 83, iv. 23, 45; [[Livy]] xxvii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sicilian revolt]] from 44 BC [[Sextus Pompeius]] selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at [[Messana]], with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in [[Strabo]]'s time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. pp. 268, 270, 272; [[Dion Cassius]] iv. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 6.2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24&amp;nbsp;km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.

It retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]]; so that in the 4th century [[Ausonius]] in his ''[[Ordo urbium nobilium|Ordo Nobilium Urbium]]'', notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. § 9; Itin. Ant. pp. 87,90, 93, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:OldCatania.png|thumb|right|Picture of Catania in 1575]]
Catania was sacked by the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]] in 440–441. After a period under the [[Ostrogoths]], it was reconquered in 535 by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], under which (aside from a short period in 550–555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.

Catania was under the Islamic [[emirate of Sicily]] from 875 until 1072, when it fell to the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] of [[Roger I of Sicily]]. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194–1197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], who later built a massive castle, ''[[Castello Ursino]]'' and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the [[Sicilian Vespers]] revolt (1282) against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]], and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, [[Peter I of Sicily|Peter I]]. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long [[War of the Vesper]] between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the [[Crown of Aragon]], and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.

In 1434 King [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V]] founded here [[University of Catania|the ''Siciliae Studium Generale'']], the oldest university in the island.

===Early Modern times===

[[File:Etna eruzione 1669 platania.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Etna erupting in 1669]]
With the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] became [[King of Naples]] as Ferdinand III, reuniting Naples with Sicily permanently and for the first time since 1458.&lt;/ref&gt;), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freaknet.org/martin/libri/Longo/revolution.html Translation of an eye-witness account of the 1647 rebellion]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the [[1669 Etna eruption]]. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693]] the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy [[earthquake]] and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the [[Baroque architecture]] that nowadays characterizes it.

===Unified Italy===
Catania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.

In 1860 [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[expedition of the Thousand]] conquered [[Sicily]] for Piedmont from the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly [[unification of Italy|unified Italy]], whose history it shares since then.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}} During [[World War II]], Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily ([[Gerbini Airfield|Gerbini]] and [[Catania-Fontanarossa Airport|Fontanarossa]]) and for its strategically important port and [[marshalling yard]]. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; they caused heavy damage to the city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/catania_res-6c14df7d-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombesullitalia.blogspot.com/2019/04/bombardamenti-di-catania.html Bombardamenti di Catania]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140202213215/http://rcslibri.corriere.it/bombardatelitalia/bombardate1943.pdf Bombardate l'Italia: 1943]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anpi-lissone.over-blog.com/article-i-bombardamenti-aerei-nel-mezzogiorno-d-italia-60089978.html I bombardamenti aerei nel Mezzogiorno d'Italia]&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the [[British 8th Army]] on 5 August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;The Invasion of Sicily 1943 By Jon Diamond, pp. 212–214&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the conflict, and the constitution of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]] (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]], namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of [[Sicilian Mafia|the mafia]]. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the [[Forza Italia]] administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-6b76e15d-a80b-465e-9531-131a194e030b.html?p=0 Documentary about the conditions of the city after the financial turmoil] {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''comuni'' form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.

===City proper===
The city of Catania proper (''comune di Catania'') is divided in six [[Local government|administrative areas]] called ''circoscrizioni''. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.

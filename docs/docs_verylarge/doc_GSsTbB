The Fifth Sunday is dedicated to [[Mary of Egypt|St. Mary of Egypt]], whose ''Life'' was read earlier in the week during the Great Canon.  At the end of the Divine Liturgy many churches celebrate a &quot;Blessing of [[dried fruit|Dried Fruit]]&quot;, in commemoration of St. Mary's profound asceticism.

====Sixth Week====
[[Image:Воскрешение Лазаря2.jpg|thumb|Icon of the [[Lazarus Saturday|Raising of Lazarus]] (15th century, [[Novgorod school]]). In most [[icons]] of [[death]], [[resurrection]] and [[baptism]], the gates of [[Christian views on Hades|hades]] are visible in the background, as they are here.]]
During the Sixth Week the Lenten services are served as they were during the second and third weeks.

Great Lent ends at Vespers on the evening of the Sixth Friday, and the Lenten cycle of Old Testament readings is brought to an end (Genesis ends with the account of the burial of Joseph, who is a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ). At that same service, the celebration of [[Lazarus Saturday]] begins. The [[resurrection]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is understood as a foreshadowing of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and many of the Resurrection hymns normally chanted on Sunday (and which will be replaced the next day with hymns for Palm Sunday) are chanted at Matins on the morning of Lazarus Saturday.

[[Palm Sunday]] differs from the previous Sundays in that it is one of the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church]]. None of the normal Lenten material is chanted on Palm Sunday, and fish, wine and oil are permitted in the [[trapeza]]. The blessing of palms (or pussywillow) takes place at Matins on Sunday morning, and everyone stands holding palms and lit candles during the important moments of the service.

This is especially significant at the [[Great Entrance]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Palm Sunday morning, since liturgically that entrance recreates the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. The themes of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday are tied together, and some of the same hymns (including one of the [[apolytikion|apolytikia]]) are chanted on both days. The Holy Week services begin on the night of Palm Sunday, and the [[liturgical colours]] are changed from the festive hues of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday back to somber Lenten colours.

===Holy Week===
{{main|Holy Week}}
Although technically, Holy Week is separate from Great Lent, its services mirror those of Great Lent and are contained in the same book, the ''Lenten Triodion''. Whereas, during Great Lent each week has its own theme, during Holy Week each day has its own theme, again based upon the Gospel readings for the day:
*[[Holy and Great Monday]]—[[Joseph the all-comely]] as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and the account of [[Parable of the budding fig tree|The Fig Tree]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|21:18-22|KJV}})
*[[Holy and Great Tuesday]]—the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]] ({{bible verse||Matthew|25:1-13|KJV}})
*[[Holy and Great Wednesday]]—The [[anointing of Jesus]] at [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] ({{bible verse||Matthew|26:6-16|KJV}})

Note that for the previous three days, one meal a day is taken a day with xerophagy.
*[[Holy and Great Thursday]]—The [[Mystical Supper]]
One meal may be eaten on this day with wine and oil.
*[[Holy and Great Friday]]—The [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:62-66|KJV}})
No food is to be eaten on this day.
*[[Holy and Great Saturday]]—The [[Holy Sepulchre|Burial of Jesus]] and the [[Harrowing of Hell]]({{bibleverse||Matthew|28:1-20|KJV}})
One meal may be eaten with wine.

During Holy Week, the order of services is often brought forward by several hours: Matins being celebrated by anticipation the evening before, and Vespers in the morning. This &quot;reversal&quot; is not something mandated by the [[typicon]] but has developed out of practical necessity. Since some of the most important readings and liturgical actions take place at Matins, it is celebrated in the evening (rather than early in the morning before dawn, as is usual for Matins) so that more people can attend. Since during Holy Week Vespers is usually joined to either the Presanctified Liturgy or the Divine Liturgy, and since the faithful must observe a total fast from all food and drink before receiving [[Holy Communion]], it is celebrated in the morning (Vespers on Good Friday is an exception to this, usually being celebrated in the afternoon).

The Matins services for Holy Monday through Thursday are referred to as &quot;Bridegroom Prayer&quot; because the [[troparion]] of the day and the [[exapostilarion]] (the hymn that concludes the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]) develop the theme of &quot;Christ the Bridegroom&quot; (Thursday has its own troparion, but uses the same exapostilarion). The [[icon]] often displayed on these days depicts Jesus and is referred to as &quot;the Bridegroom&quot; because the [[crown of thorns]] and the [[robe]] of mockery are parallel to the crown and robe worn by a bridegroom on his wedding day.

This icon is often confused with the visually similar icon of Christ as the [[Man of Sorrows]], which shows Him post-Crucifixion in the same pose but lacking the rod and robe, dead, showing the marks of the nails in his Hands and the spear wound in His side. Incidentally, Thursday has its own icon showing either the [[Mystical Supper]] or the [[Washing of Feet]], or both. The Passion of Christ is seen as the [[wedding]] of the Saviour with his bride, the Church.

====Holy Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday====
[[Image:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ ''The Bridegroom'' (Ό&amp;nbsp;Νυμφίος) at Golgotha in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]

The first three days of Holy Week (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), the services all follow the same pattern and are nearly identical to the order followed on weekdays during the Great Forty Days; however, the number of [[Kathisma]]ta (sections from the Psalter) is reduced and the Old Testament readings are taken from different books. The Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated on each of the first three days, and there is a Gospel reading at each one (during the Forty Days there was no Gospel reading unless it was a feast day). There is also a Gospel reading at [[Matins]] on each day and the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] chanted at Matins is much shorter, consisting of only three or four odes rather than the usual nine.

In addition to the Gospel readings at Matins and Vespers, there is a reading of all four Gospels which takes place during the [[Little Hours]] ([[Third Hour]], [[Sext|Sixth Hour]] and [[Ninth Hour]]) on these first three days. Each Gospel is read in its entirety and in order, beginning with {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:1|KJV}}, and continuing through {{bibleverse||John|13:30|KJV}} (the rest of the Gospel of John will be read during the remainder of Holy Week). The Gospels are divided up into nine sections with one section being read by the priest at each of the Little Hours.

The [[Prayer of Saint Ephrem]] is said for the last time at the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Holy and Great Wednesday. From this moment on, there will be no more prostrations made in the church (aside from those made before the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]]) until Vespers on the afternoon of [[Pentecost]].

In some churches, the [[Holy Mystery]] (Sacrament) of [[Unction]] is celebrated on Holy and Great Wednesday, in commemoration of the [[anointing]] of Jesus' feet in preparation for his burial ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:6-13|KJV}}).

The [[triduum|remaining three days]] of Holy Week retain a smaller degree of Lenten character, but each has elements that are unique to it.

====Holy (Maundy) Thursday====
[[Image:Last Supper by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Mystical Supper]]'' by Theophanes the Cretan (16th century, Stavronikita monastery, Mount Athos).]]

'''Holy and Great Thursday''' is a more festive day than the others of Holy Week in that it celebrates the institution of the Eucharist. The [[antependia|hangings]] in the church and the [[vestment]]s of the clergy are changed from dark Lenten hues to more festive colours (red, in the Russian tradition).

Whereas the [[Divine Liturgy]] is forbidden on other Lenten weekdays, the [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil]] (combined with Vespers) is celebrated on this day. Many of the standard hymns of the Liturgy are replaced with the [[Troparion]] of Great Thursday. In some churches, the [[Holy Table]] (altar) is covered with a simple white linen cloth, in commemoration of the [[Mystical Supper]] (Last Supper).

During this Divine Liturgy, the [[reserved Mysteries]] are renewed (a new [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] being [[consecrated]], and the old Body and Blood of Christ being consumed by the deacon after the Liturgy). Also, when the supply of [[Chrism]] runs low, it is at this Liturgy that the heads of the [[autocephalous]] churches will [https://web.archive.org/web/20030301104732/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8420.asp Sanctify new Chrism], the preparation of which would have been begun during the [[All-Night Vigil]] on Palm Sunday.

After the Liturgy, a meal is served. The rule of [[fasting]] is lessened somewhat, and the faithful are allowed to partake of wine in moderation during the meal and use oil in the cooking.

That night, the hangings and vestments in the church are changed to black, and Matins for Great and Holy Friday is celebrated.

====Good Friday====
[[File:Great and Holy Friday Matins.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Matins]] service, before the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] on Good Friday at a [[St. Joseph the Betrothed Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|church in Chicago]].]]

'''Holy and Great Friday''' is observed as a strict fast day, on which the faithful who are physically able to should not eat anything at all. Some even fast from water, at least until after the Vespers service that evening.

The Matins service (usually celebrated Thursday night) is officially entitled, &quot;The Office of the Holy and Redeeming Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Kallistos, ''op. cit.'', p. 565&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly known as the &quot;Matins of the Twelve Gospels&quot;, because interspersed throughout the service are twelve Gospel readings which recount the entire [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] from the [[Last Supper]] to the sealing of the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]. Before the Sixth Gospel ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:16-32|KJV}}) which first mentions the [[Crucifixion]], the priest carries a large cross into the center of the church, where it is set upright and all the faithful come forward to venerate it. The cross has attached to it a large [[icon]] of the ''soma'' (the crucified body of Christ).

At the beginning of each Gospel, the bell is rung according to the number of the Gospel (once for the first Gospel, two for the second, etc.). As each Gospel is read the faithful stand holding lighted candles, which are extinguished at the end of each reading. After the twelfth Gospel, the faithful do not extinguish their candles but leave them lit and carry the flame to their homes as a blessing. There, they will often use the flame to light the [[lampada]] in their [[icon corner]].

On the morning of Great Friday, the [[Royal Hours]] are served. This is a solemn service of the [[Little Hours]] and [[Typica]] to which [[antiphon]]s, and scripture readings have been added. Some of the fixed psalms which are standard to each of the Little Hours are replaced with psalms which are of particular significance to the Passion.

[[Image:TzanesIcon.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]]'' (c. 1600, Emmanuel Tzanes Bounialis, [[Cretan School]]).]]

Vespers on Good Friday is usually celebrated in the afternoon, around the time of Jesus' death on the Cross. After the [[Little Entrance]] the Gospel reading is a [[concatenation]] of the [[four Evangelists]]' accounts of the Crucifixion and the [[Descent from the Cross]]. At the point during the reading which mentions [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]], two clergymen approach the large cross in the center of the church, remove the ''soma'', wrap it in a piece of white linen, and carry it into the sanctuary.

Later, during the [[Troparion]], the clergy carry the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] (a cloth icon symbolizing the [[winding sheet]] in which Jesus was prepared for burial) into the center of the church, where it is venerated by all the faithful. Special chants and prayers and chanted along with biblical readings and [[psalms]] chanted.

That night, the Matins of Lamentation is normally celebrated in the evening. At this service, special hymns and prayers are chanted. The Lamentations of Great and Holy Friday are the main chants of the service. The Lamentation Praises are chanted to very movingly beautiful ancient tones and words which reflect the lament of the [[Theotokos]] over her son [[Christ]]. The [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] is placed on a beautifully ornate and decorate [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] before the Lamentations representing the tomb of Christ.

The priest then sprinkles [[Rosewater]] and fresh Rose petals all over the tomb, the congregation, and the temple/church. A procession with the ornate tomb then takes place around the church and back into the church where it will be venerated by everyone. As more special prayers and chants are sung especially the chant: &quot;The Noble Joseph...&quot; as the service finishes.

====Holy Saturday====
'''Holy and Great Saturday''' (known also as the '''Great Sabbath''', because on it Jesus &quot;rested&quot; from his labours on the Cross) combines elements of deep sorrow and exultant joy. This, like Good Friday is also a day of strict fasting, though a meal may be served after the Divine Liturgy at which wine (but not oil) may be used.

The Matins of Lamentation (usually celebrated on Friday evening) resembles the Byzantine Rite [[funeral]] service, in that its main component is the chanting of [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]] (the longest Psalm in the Bible), each verse of which is interspersed with laudations (''ainoi'') of the dead Christ. The service takes place with the clergy and people gathered around the epitaphios in the center of the church. Everyone stands holding lighted candles during the psalm. Next are chanted the ''[[Evlogitaria]] of the Resurrection'', hymns which are normally chanted only on Sundays.

This is the first liturgical mention of the impending [[Resurrection of Jesus]]. At the end of the [[Great Doxology]] the epitaphios is carried in [[Procession#Eastern_Orthodox|procession]] around the outside of the church, as is the body at a priest's funeral, and then is brought back in. By local custom, the clergy may raise the epitaphios at the door so that all may pass under it as they enter in, symbolically entering into the death and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospel ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:62-66|KJV}}) is not read at its usual place during Matins, but rather, following readings of the vision in [[Book_of_Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] of the dry bones returning to life and an Epistle, near the end of the service, in front of the epitaphios.

[[Image:Russian Resurrection icon.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century [[Russian icon]] of the descent into Hades of [[Jesus Christ]], which is the icon for Holy and Great Saturday.]]

The next morning (Saturday), the [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil]] is celebrated (combined with [[Vespers]]). At the beginning of the service, the hangings and vestments are still black. The service is much longer than usual, and includes 15 Old Testament readings recounting the history of salvation, including two [[canticles]], the [[Song of the Sea|Song of Moses]] and the [[Song of the Three Holy Children]], and showing [[Typology (theology)|types]] of the death and resurrection of Jesus.

Many parts of the liturgy which are normally performed in front of the [[Holy Doors]] are instead done in front of the epitaphios. Just before the Gospel reading, the hangings and vestments are changed to white, and the entire atmosphere of the service is transformed from sorrow to joy. In the Greek practice, the priest strews the entire church with fresh [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]], symbolizing Christ's victory over death. This service symbolizes the descent of Christ into [[Hades in Christianity|Hades]] and the [[Harrowing of Hell]].

Thus, according to Byzantine Rite theology, Jesus' salvific work on the Cross has been accomplished, and the righteous departed in the [[Bosom of Abraham]] have been released from their bondage; however, the Good News of the Resurrection has not yet been proclaimed to the living on earth, the celebration of which commences at midnight with Matins. For this reason, neither is the fast broken nor the [[Paschal greeting]] exchanged.

At the end of the Divine Liturgy, the priest blesses wine and bread which are distributed to the faithful. This is different from the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (Holy Communion) which were received earlier in the service. This bread and wine are simply [[blessing|blessed]], not [[consecrated]]. They are a remnant of the ancient tradition of the church (still observed in some places) whereby the faithful did not leave the church after the service, but were each given a glass of [[wine]], and some [[bread]] and [[dried fruit]] to give them strength for the vigil ahead. They would listen to the reading of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], read in full, and await the beginning of the [[Paschal Vigil]]. However, this is not usually done nowadays.

The last liturgical service in the Lenten Triodion is the [[Midnight Office]] which forms the first part of the Paschal Vigil. During this service the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of Great Saturday is repeated, near the end of which, during the ninth ode, the priest and deacon take the epitaphios into the sanctuary through the [[Holy Doors]] and lay it on the [[Holy Table]] (altar), where it remains until the feast of the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. After the concluding prayers and a [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]], all of the lights and candles in the church are extinguished, and all wait in silence and darkness for the stroke of midnight, following which the [[Pentecostarion]] replaces the Lenten Triodion, commencing with the resurrection of Christ being proclaimed.

'''Arms trafficking''' or '''gunrunning''' is the illicit trade of contraband [[small arms]] and [[ammunition]], which constitutes part of a broad range of illegal activities often associated with transnational [[Criminal Organizations|criminal organizations]]. The illegal trade of small arms, unlike other [[organized crime]] commodities, is more closely associated with exercising power in communities instead of achieving economic gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kostakos |first1=Panos A. |last2=Arsovska |first2=Jana |year=2008 |title=Illicit arms trafficking and the limits of rational choice theory: the case of the Balkans |url=https://www.academia.edu/12994251 |journal=Trends in Organized Crime |language=en |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=352–378 |doi=10.1007/s12117-008-9052-y |s2cid=154641130 |issn=1936-4830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars estimate illegal arms transactions amount to over US$1 billion annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime |url=https://www.cfr.org/report/global-regime-transnational-crime |website=Council on Foreign Relations |language=en |access-date=2019-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:US_Navy_Fire_Controlman_3rd_Class_Matthew_Burger_returns_to_the_USS_Dewey_during_a_visit,_board,_search,_and_seizure_(VBSS)_operation.jpg|alt=|thumb|260x260px|US Navy Fire Controlman 3rd Class Matthew Burger returns to the USS ''Dewey'' during a visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operation]]To keep track of imports and exports of several of the most dangerous [[armament]] categories, the [[United Nations]], in 1991, created a Register for Conventional Arms, however participation is not compulsory and lacks comprehensive data in regions outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=UN-Register |url=http://www.un-register.org/SmallArms/Index.aspx |website=www.un-register.org |access-date=2019-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329211513/http://www.un-register.org/SmallArms/Index.aspx |archive-date=2019-03-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; [[Africa]], due to a prevalence of corrupt officials and loosely enforced trade regulations, is a region with extensive illicit arms activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Thachuk |first1=Kimberley |last2=Saunders |first2=Karen |date=2014-09-01 |title=Under the Radar: Airborne Arms Trafficking Operations in Africa |journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research |language=en |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361–378 |doi=10.1007/s10610-014-9247-5 |s2cid=144051979 |issn=1572-9869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a resolution to complement the Register with legally binding obligations, a Firearms Protocol was incorporated into the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, which requires states to improve systems that control trafficked ammunition and firearms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The 1999 Report of the UN Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms provides a more refined and precise definition, which has become internationally accepted. This distinguishes between [[small arms]] ([[revolvers]] and [[semi-automatic pistol|self-loading pistol]]s, [[rifle]]s and [[carbine]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, and [[light machine gun]]s), which are weapons designed for personal use, and light weapons ([[heavy machine gun]]s, hand-held under-barrel and mounted [[grenade launcher]]s, portable [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, portable anti-tank guns, [[recoilless rifle]]s, portable launchers of [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]] systems, and [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of calibres less than 100&amp;nbsp;mm), which are designed for use by several persons serving as a unit. [[Ammunition]] and [[explosive]]s also form an integral part of small arms and light weapons used in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greene |first=O. |year=2000 |title=Examining international responses to illicit arms trafficking |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/transcrime/articles/armstraffickingagreements.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |volume=33 |pages=151–190 |doi=10.1023/A:1008398420612 |s2cid=142629830 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323050427/https://www.criminology.fsu.edu/transcrime/articles/armstraffickingagreements.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 16]] has a target to significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows by 2030 as part of measures aimed at combating all forms of organized crime including arms trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Doss|first=Eric|title=Sustainable Development Goal 16|url=https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/sdg-16/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=United Nations and the Rule of Law|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arms trafficking is widespread in regions of political turmoil, it is not limited to such areas, and for example, in [[South Asia]], an estimated 63 million guns have been trafficked into India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Staff Correspondent |date=May 30, 2006 |title=Bangladesh turned into arms smuggling route; Experts critical of govt's indifference |work=The Daily Star |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/30/d6053001107.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

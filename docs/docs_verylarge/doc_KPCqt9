'''Sussex''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|s|ɪ|k|s}}), from the [[Old English]] ''Sūþsēaxe'' ([[South Saxons]]), is a [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] in [[South East England]] and was formerly an [[Kingdom of Sussex|independent medieval kingdom]].  It is bounded to the west by [[Hampshire]], north by [[Surrey]], northeast by [[Kent]], south by the [[English Channel]], and divided for many purposes into the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[West Sussex]] and [[East Sussex]]. 

[[Brighton and Hove]], though part of East Sussex, was made a [[unitary authority]] in 1997, and as such, is administered independently of the rest of East Sussex. Brighton and Hove was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|City status]] in 2000.  Until then, [[Chichester]] was Sussex's only city.  The [[Brighton and Hove built-up area]] is the 15th largest conurbation in the UK and [[Brighton and Hove]] is the most populous city or town in Sussex. [[Crawley]], [[Worthing]] and [[Eastbourne]] are major towns, each with a population over 100,000.  Sussex has three main geographic sub-regions, each oriented approximately east to west.  In the southwest is the fertile and densely populated [[coastal plain]].  North of this are the rolling [[chalk]] hills of the [[South Downs]], beyond which is the well-wooded [[Sussex Weald]].

Sussex was home to some of Europe's earliest known hominids (''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''), whose remains at [[Eartham Pit, Boxgrove|Boxgrove]] have been dated to 500,000 years ago.  Sussex played a key role in the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], with some of the earliest significant signs of a Roman presence in Britain.  Local chieftains allied with Rome, resulting in [[Cogidubnus]] being given a [[client kingdom]] centred on [[Chichester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sussex-historical-county-England|title=Sussex, historical county, England|publisher=Britannica.com|access-date=8 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[kingdom of Sussex]] was founded in the aftermath of the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]].  According to legend, it was founded by [[Ælle of Sussex|Ælle, King of Sussex]], in AD 477. Around 827, it was annexed by the kingdom of [[Wessex]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EcgODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |last=Edwards |first=Heather |title=Ecgberht [Egbert] (d. 839), king of the West Saxons in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |access-date=22 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235747/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently became a county of England. Sussex played a key role in the [[Norman conquest of England]] when in 1066, [[William, Duke of Normandy]] landed at Pevensey and fought the decisive [[Battle of Hastings]].

In 1974, the [[Lord-Lieutenant]] of Sussex was replaced with one each for East and West Sussex, which became separate ceremonial counties.  Sussex continues to be recognised as a geographical territory and [[cultural region]].  It has had a single police force since 1968 and its name is in common use in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCSx&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/sussex/|title=BBC News - Sussex|publisher=BBC|access-date=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, [[Sussex Day]] was created to celebrate the county's rich [[culture of Sussex|culture]] and [[history of Sussex|history]] and in 2011 the [[flag of Sussex]] was recognised by the Flag Institute. In 2013, [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] [[Eric Pickles]] formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England's 39 historic counties, including Sussex.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLG-EP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eric-pickles-celebrate-st-george-and-englands-traditional-counties|title=Eric Pickles: celebrate St George and England's traditional counties|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|date=23 April 2013|access-date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind-EP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/eric-pickless-championing-of-traditional-english-counties-is-something-we-can-all-get-behind-8568394.html|title=Eric Pickles's championing of traditional English counties is something we can all get behind|work=The Independent|first=Simon|last=Kelner|date=23 April 2013|access-date=22 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Sussex&quot; is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Suth-sæxe'', which is in turn derived from the [[Old English]] ''Suth-Seaxe'' which means (land or people) of the [[South Saxons]] (cf. [[Essex#History|Essex]], [[Middlesex#Toponomy|Middlesex]] and [[Wessex]]). The South Saxons were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] that settled in the region from the [[North German Plain]] during the 5th and 6th centuries.

The earliest known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: ''Australes Saxones'') is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, [[Nothhelm of Sussex|Noðhelm]], although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.&lt;ref name=&quot;lowerson&quot;/&gt;

Three [[United States]] [[County (United States)|counties]] (in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Delaware]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Sussex County, Virginia|Virginia]]), and a former [[Lands administrative divisions of Western Australia|county/land division]] of [[Sussex County, Western Australia|Western Australia]], are named after Sussex.

==Symbols==
{{Main|Symbols of Sussex}}
[[File:Sussex shield.svg|thumb|160px|The traditional Sussex emblem first known recording in 1611 by John Speed: ''Azure, six [[martlet]]s or'']]

The [[flag of Sussex]] consists of six gold [[martlet]]s, or heraldic [[swallow]]s, on a blue background, [[blazon]]ed as ''Azure, six [[martlet]]s or''. Officially recognised by the [[Flag Institute]] on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the [[coat of arms of Sussex|heraldic shield of Sussex]]. The first known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer [[John Speed]] deployed it to represent the [[Kingdom of Sussex|Kingdom of the South Saxons]]. However it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county, rather than being the inventor of the association. It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th-century [[Knight of the Shire]], Sir John de Radynden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Sussex County Flag | publisher = The Sussex County Flag| url=http://sussexflag.wordpress.com|date=December 2016 | access-date = 8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sussex's six martlets are today held to symbolise the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as ''[[Rape (county subdivision)|rapes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sussex Martlets | publisher = The Sussex County Flag| url=http://sussexflag.wordpress.com/sussexmartlets/|date=December 2016 | access-date = 8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campanulaceae - Phyteuma orbiculare.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The [[Phyteuma orbiculare|round-headed rampion]], or Pride of Sussex, is Sussex's county flower]]

''[[Sussex by the Sea]]'' is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by [[William Ward-Higgs]] in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem entitled ''Sussex''. Adopted by the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] and popularised in [[World War I]], it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at [[Lewes Bonfire]], and at sports matches, including those of [[Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club]].

The county day, called [[Sussex Day]], is celebrated on 16 June, the same day as the feast day of [[St Richard of Chichester]], Sussex's [[patron saint]], whose shrine at [[Chichester Cathedral]] was an important place of pilgrimage in the [[Middle Ages]].

Sussex's motto, ''[[We wunt be druv]]'', is a [[Sussex dialect]] expression meaning &quot;we will not be pushed around&quot; and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women. The [[Round-headed Rampion|round-headed rampion]], also known as the &quot;Pride of Sussex&quot;, was adopted as Sussex's [[county flower]] in 2002.

===Landscape===
[[File:Seven Sisters cliffs and the coastguard cottages, from Seaford Head showing Cuckmere Haven (looking east - 2003-05-26).jpg|thumb|right|The South Downs meets the sea at the [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]]]]The physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the [[Weald–Artois anticline|Wealden anticline]], the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the [[Weald]] itself and the [[South Downs]]. [[Natural England]] has identified the following seven [[national character area]]s in Sussex:&lt;ref name=&quot;NE-NCAs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/englands/character/areas/southeast.aspx|title=South East and London National Character Area map|publisher=[[Natural England]]|access-date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[South Coast Plain]]
* [[South Downs]]
* [[Greensand Ridge|Wealden Greensand]]
* [[Low Weald]]
* [[High Weald]]
* [[Pevensey Levels]]
* [[Romney Marsh]]es

At 280m, [[Blackdown, West Sussex|Blackdown]] is the highest point in Sussex, or [[List of English counties by highest point|county top]]. [[Ditchling Beacon]] (248m) is the highest point in East Sussex. At {{convert|113|km|mi|abbr=off}} long, the [[River Medway]] is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the [[River Arun]], which is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. Sussex's largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is [[Bewl Water]] on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is [[Ardingly Reservoir]].

===Climate===
The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring [[Hampshire]] are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;MetOff&quot;/&gt; The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsussex.org/page/weather-and-climate/|title=Weather and Climate in Sussex|publisher=Visit Sussex|access-date=14 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430170843/http://www.visitsussex.org/page/weather-and-climate/|archive-date=30 April 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sunshine average is approximately 1,900 hours a year; this is much higher than the UK average of 1,340 hours a year.  Most of Sussex lies in [[hardiness zone]] 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.

Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with {{convert|950|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;/&gt; The close proximity of Sussex to [[the Continent]] of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;/&gt;

The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;/&gt; Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;/&gt;

In winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;VisSx&quot;/&gt; [[Selsey]] is known as a [[tornado]] hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;MetOff&quot;/&gt; with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;MetOff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/so/print.html|title=Southern England: climate|publisher=Met Office|access-date=14 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314025659/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/so/print.html|archive-date=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conurbations===
Most of Sussex's population is distributed in an east-west line along the English Channel coast or on the east-west line of the [[A272]]. The exception to this pattern is the 20th century north-south development on the [[A23 road|A23]]-[[Brighton Main Line|Brighton line]] [[Transport corridor|corridor]], Sussex's main link to London. Sussex's population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of over 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex's population. According to the [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 5 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):

==Population==
The combined population of Sussex as of 2011 is about 1.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONS2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Office for National Statistics|title=Census 2011 result shows increase in population of the South East|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/census-2011-result-shows-increase-in-population-of-the-south-east/censussoutheastnr0712.html|access-date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Combined population of local authority areas of Brighton and Hove (273,400), East Sussex, (527,200) and West Sussex (808,900)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sussex had a population density of 425 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, higher than the average for England of 407 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede, who describes the county as containing in 681 land of 7,000 families; allowing ten to a family (a reasonable estimate at that date), the total population would be 70,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Sussex|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21,537 houses. The 1801 census found that the population was 159,311. The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries, although after the [[massacre of St Bartholomew]] upwards of 1,500 [[Huguenots]] landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], many more refugees were added to the county.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  The population of Sussex was 550,446 in 1891 and was 605,202 in 1901.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Beginnings===

Finds at [[Eartham Pit, Boxgrove|Eartham Pit]] in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''. At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last [[Neanderthals]] in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7466735.stm | work=BBC News | first=Christine | last=McGourty | title='Neanderthal tools' found at dig | date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, [[mammoth]] and [[Woolly rhinoceros|woolly rhinos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3345244/Neanderthal-tools-reveal-advanced-technology.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Roger | last=Highfield | title=Neanderthal tools reveal advanced technology | date=23 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 6000BC the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their [[Mesolithic]] kinsmen to the south. Later in the [[Neolithic]] period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important [[flint]]-mining centres.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSST10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kerridge|Standing|2000|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500BC to 3750BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Flint tools from [[Cissbury]] have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;SteyningMus&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://steyningmuseum.org.uk/prehistory.htm|title=Prehistory: The Downs Above Steyning|publisher=Steyning Museum|access-date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sussex is rich in remains from the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the [[Devil's Jumps, Treyford|Devil's Jumps]] and [[Cissbury Ring]], one of Britain's largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC people from the [[Atrebates]], one of the tribes of the [[Belgae]], a mix of Celtic and German stock, started invading and occupying southern Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong24&quot;&gt;Armstrong. A History of Sussex. Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under [[Julius Caesar]] that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong24&quot;/&gt;
Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic [[Regnenses]] tribe under their leader [[Commius]] occupied the [[Manhood Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong24&quot;/&gt; [[Tincomarus]] and then [[Cogidubnus]] followed Commius as rulers of the Regnenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong24&quot;/&gt;

===Roman canton===
[[File:Fishbourne model.JPG|thumb|Museum model of how Fishbourne Roman Palace may have appeared]]

At the time of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an ''[[oppidum]]'' in the southern part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunliffe169&quot;&gt;Cunliffe. Iron Age communities in Britain. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion of Britain]] in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of [[Richborough]] in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee [[Verica]], king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the [[Catuvellauni]], a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/articles/ancient_world/The_roman_invasion_of_britain/ Osprey Publishing - Military History Books - The Roman Invasion of Britain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222053039/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/articles/ancient_world/The_roman_invasion_of_britain/ |date=22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sussex was home to the magnificent [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Roman Palace at Fishbourne]], by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the [[Regnenses]] or Regni, with its capital at [[Noviomagus Reginorum]], modern-day Chichester. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at [[Bignor]]. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the 5th century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in [[Great Britain|Britain]], probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] around 410 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;white351&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White |first=Sally|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol42/42_088_093.pdf |title=A Mid-Fifth Century Hoard of Roman and Pseudo-Roman Material from Patching, West Sussex |year=1999 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |access-date=16 November 2011 |pages=88–93 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013906/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol42/42_088_093.pdf |archive-date=5 January 2012 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saxon kingdom===
{{main|Kingdom of Sussex}}

The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which states that in the year AD 477 [[Ælle of Sussex|Ælle]] landed with his three sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;welchase9&quot;&gt;Welch. Anglo-Saxon England p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asc477&quot;&gt;ASC Parker MS. 477AD.&lt;/ref&gt; Having fought on the banks of the [[Battle of Mercredesburne|Mearcredesburna]],&lt;ref&gt;ASC 485 Parker MS: ''This year Ælle fought with the Welsh nigh Mecred's- Burnsted.''
&lt;/ref&gt; it seems Ælle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;welchess24&quot;&gt;Welch. ''Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex''; pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; After Ælle's forces seized the [[Saxon Shore]] fort of [[Anderida]], the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of Romano-British control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at [[Highdown Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;welchess24&quot;/&gt; Ælle was recognised as the first '[[Bretwalda]]' or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kings and led the ill-fated campaign against [[King Arthur]] at [[Mount Badon]].

The 214 bridges and 17 tunnels that have been built to date have changed the dynamics and made cross-river development and shared responsibilities more practicable. In 1965, upon the creation of [[Greater London]], the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] incorporated the former 'Middlesex and Surrey' banks, [[Spelthorne]] moved from Middlesex to Surrey; and further changes in 1974 moved some of the boundaries away from the river. For example, some areas were transferred from Berkshire to Oxfordshire, and from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire. On occasion – for example in rowing – the banks are still referred to by their traditional county names.

=== Crossings ===

Many of the present-day road bridges are on the site of earlier fords, ferries and wooden bridges. At [[Swinford Bridge]], a privately owned toll bridge, there was first a ford and then a ferry prior to the bridge being built. The earliest known major crossings of the Thames by the Romans were at [[London Bridge]] and [[Staines Bridge]]. At [[Folly Bridge]] in Oxford the remains of an original Saxon structure can be seen, and medieval stone bridges such as [[Newbridge, Oxfordshire|Newbridge]], [[Wallingford Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Victoria history of Berkshire|last1=Ditchfield|first1=P. H.|last2=Page|first2=William|date=1906|publisher=Constable|location=London|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abingdon Bridge]] are still in use.

Kingston's growth is believed to stem from its having the only crossing between London Bridge and Staines until the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, many stone and brick road bridges were built from new or to replace existing bridges both in London and along the length of the river. These included [[Putney Bridge]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Datchet Bridge]], [[Windsor Bridge]] and [[Sonning Bridge]].

Several central London road bridges were built in the 19th century, most conspicuously [[Tower Bridge]], the only [[Bascule bridge]] on the river, designed to allow ocean-going ships to pass beneath it. The most recent road bridges are the bypasses at [[Isis Bridge]] and [[Marlow By-pass Bridge]] and the motorway bridges, most notably the two on the [[M25 motorway|M25]] route [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge]] and [[M25 Runnymede Bridge]].

Railway development in the 19th century resulted in a spate of bridge building including [[Blackfriars Railway Bridge]] and [[Hungerford Bridge|Charing Cross (Hungerford) Railway Bridge]] in central London, and the railway bridges by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] at [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge]], [[Gatehampton Railway Bridge]] and [[Moulsford Railway Bridge]].

The world's first underwater tunnel was Marc Brunel's [[Thames Tunnel]] built in 1843 and now used to carry the [[East London Line]]. The [[Tower Subway]] was the first railway under the Thames, which was followed by all the deep-level tube lines. Road tunnels were built in East London at the end of the 19th century, being the [[Blackwall Tunnel]] and the [[Rotherhithe Tunnel]]. The latest tunnels are the [[Dartford Crossing]]s.

Many foot crossings were established across the weirs that were built on the non-tidal river, and some of these remained when the locks were built – for example at [[Benson Lock]]. Others were replaced by a footbridge when the weir was removed as at [[Hart's Weir Footbridge]]. Around 2000, several footbridges were added along the Thames, either as part of the Thames Path or in commemoration of the millennium. These include [[Temple Footbridge]], [[Bloomers Hole Footbridge]], the [[Hungerford Footbridge]]s and the [[London Millennium Bridge|Millennium Bridge]], all of which have distinctive design characteristics.

Before bridges were built, the main means of crossing the river was by ferry. A significant number of ferries were provided specifically for navigation purposes. When the [[towpath]] changed sides, it was necessary to take the towing horse and its driver across the river. This was no longer necessary when barges were powered by steam. Some ferries still operate on the river. The [[Woolwich Ferry]] carries cars and passengers across the river in the Thames Gateway and links the [[North Circular]] and [[South Circular Road, London|South Circular]] roads. Upstream are smaller pedestrian ferries, for example [[Hampton Ferry (River Thames)|Hampton Ferry]] and [[Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry]] the last being the only non-permanent crossing that remains on the Thames Path.

== Pollution ==
===Treated sewage===
Treated sewage from all the towns and villages in the Thames catchment flow into the Thames via sewage treatment plants. This includes all the sewage from Swindon, Oxford, Reading and Windsor.

However, untreated sewage still regularly enters the Thames during wet weather. When [[London sewerage system|London's sewerage system]] was built, sewers were designed to overflow through discharge points along the river during heavy storms. Originally, this would happen once or twice a year, however overflows now happen once a week on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tideway.london/the-tunnel/history/|title=Reconnecting London with the River Thames|work=Tideway|access-date=18 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, over 55m tonnes of raw sewage was washed into the tidal Thames. These discharge events kill fish, leave raw sewage on the riverbanks, and decrease the water quality of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/09/fish-thames-sewage|title=Thousands of fish dead after Thames sewerage overflow|last=Vidal|first=John|date=9 June 2011|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085623/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/09/fish-thames-sewage|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/22/water-thames-victorian-london-150-years-sewer-system|title=Water, super-sewers and the filth threatening the River Thames|last=Jeffries|first=Stuart|date=22 July 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085636/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/22/water-thames-victorian-london-150-years-sewer-system|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the release of raw [[sewage]] and [[rain]]water into the river, the [[Thames Tideway Scheme]] is currently under construction at a cost of £4.2&amp;nbsp;billion. This project will collect sewage from the greater London area before it [[Combined sewage overflow|overflows]], before channelling it down a 25&amp;nbsp;km (15&amp;nbsp;mi) tunnel underneath the tidal Thames, so it can be treated at [[Beckton Sewage Treatment Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tideway.london|title=Reconnecting London with the River Thames|work=Tideway|access-date=18 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29175607|title='Super sewer' plans to go ahead|date=12 September 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=18 February 2018|language=en-GB|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085643/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-29175607|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the project will be reduction of sewage discharges into the in the greater London area river by 90%, dramatically increasing water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tideway.london/the-tunnel/river-ecology/|title=Reconnecting London with the River Thames|work=Tideway|access-date=18 February 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210432/https://www.tideway.london/the-tunnel/river-ecology/|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury levels ===
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] (Hg) is an environmentally persistent heavy metal which at high concentrations can be toxic to [[marine life]] and humans. Sixty sediment cores of 1 m in depth, spanning the entire tidal River Thames, between [[Brentford]] and the [[Isle of Grain]] have been analysed for total Hg. The sediment records show a clear rise and fall of Hg pollution through history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rise and fall of Mercury (Hg) pollution in sediment cores of the Thames Estuary, London, UK.&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/511959/1/Vane%20etal.%202015_RSE_Thames%20Hg.pdf |title=Rise and fall of Mercury (Hg) pollution in sediment cores of the Thames Estuary, London, UK. |last1=Vane|first1= C.H.|last2= Beriro |first2=D. |last3= Turner |first3=G. |date=2015 |journal=Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |doi=10.1017/s1755691015000158 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=285–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury concentrations in the River Thames decrease downstream from London to the outer Estuary with the total Hg levels ranging from 0.01 to 12.07&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, giving a mean of 2.10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg which is higher than many other UK and European river estuaries.&lt;ref name=&quot; Mercury contamination in surface sediments and sediment cores of the Mersey Estuary, UK. &quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025326X09001027 |title=Mercury contamination in surface sediments and sediment cores of the Mersey Estuary, UK. |author=Vane, C.H.

The highest amount of sedimentary-hosted Hg pollution in the Thames estuary occurs in the central London area between Vauxhall Bridge and Woolwich.&lt;ref name=&quot; Rise and fall of Mercury (Hg) pollution in sediment cores of the Thames Estuary, London, UK.&quot;/&gt; The majority of sediment cores show a clear decrease in Hg concentrations close to the surface which is attributed to an overall reduction in polluting activities as well as improved effectiveness of recent environmental legalisation and river management (e.g. Oslo-Paris convention).

== Sport ==
There are several watersports prevalent on the Thames, with many clubs encouraging participation and organising racing and inter-club competitions.

=== Rowing ===
{{Main|Rowing on the River Thames}}
[[File:Finish of 2007 Oxford-Cambridge boat race.JPG|thumb|Cambridge cross the finish line ahead of Oxford in the 2007 [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]], viewed from Chiswick Bridge]]

The Thames is the historic heartland of [[sport rowing|rowing]] in the United Kingdom. There are over 200 clubs on the river, and over 8,000 members of [[British Rowing]] (over 40% of its membership).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishrowing.org/2011/12/clubs-celebrate-17-4-million-inspired-facilities-funding/|title=Clubs celebrate £17.4&amp;nbsp;million Inspired Facilities funding|publisher=British Rowing|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most towns and districts of any size on the river have at least one club. Internationally attended centres are [[Oxford]], [[Henley-on-Thames]] and events and clubs on the stretch of river from [[Chiswick]] to [[Putney]].

Two rowing events on the River Thames are traditionally part of the wider English sporting calendar:

The [[The Boat Race|University Boat Race]] (between [[Oxford University Boat Club|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge]]) takes place in late March or early April, on the [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] from [[Putney]] to [[Mortlake]] in the west of London.

[[Henley Royal Regatta]] takes place over five days at the start of July in the upstream town of [[Henley-on-Thames]]. Besides its sporting significance the regatta is an important date on the English [[Season (society)|social calendar]] alongside events like [[Ascot Racecourse|Royal Ascot]] and [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]].

Other significant or historic rowing events on the Thames include:

* The [[Head of the River Race]] and [[Women's Eights Head of the River Race]] (8+) (i.e. coxed eights), [[Schools' Head of the River Race|Schools' Head]], [[Veterans Head]], [[Scullers Head of the River Race|Scullers Head]], [[Head of the River Fours|Fours Head (HOR4s)]], and Pairs Head (shorter) on the [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]]
* [[The Wingfield Sculls]] on the same course: (1x) ([[single scull]]ing) championship
* [[Doggett's Coat and Badge]] for apprentice watermen of London, one of the oldest sporting events in the world
* [[Henley Women's Regatta]]
* The [[Henley Boat Races]] currently for the Lightweight (men's and women's) crews of Oxford and Cambridge universities
* The Oxford University [[bumps race|bumping races]] known as [[Eights Week]] and [[Torpids]]

Other [[regatta]]s, [[head race]]s and university bumping races are held along the Thames which are described under [[Rowing on the River Thames]].

=== Sailing ===
{{Main|Sailing on the River Thames}}
[[File:ThamesRaters01.JPG|thumb|upright|Thames Raters at Raven's Ait, [[Surbiton]]]]

Sailing is practised on both the tidal and non-tidal reaches of the river. The highest club upstream is at Oxford. The most popular sailing craft used on the Thames are [[laser (dinghy)|lasers]], [[GP14 (dinghy)|GP14s]] and [[Wayfarer (dinghy)|Wayfarers]]. One sailing boat unique to the Thames is the [[Thames A Class Rater (scow)|Thames Rater]], which is sailed around [[Raven's Ait]].

=== Skiffing ===
[[Skiffing]] has dwindled in favour of private motor boat ownership but is competed on the river in the summer months. Six clubs and a similar number of skiff regattas exist from [[the Skiff Club]], [[Teddington]] upstream.

=== Punting ===
Unlike the &quot;pleasure [[punt (boat)|punting]]&quot; common on the [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]] in [[Oxford]] and the [[River Cam|Cam]] in [[Cambridge]], punting on the Thames is competitive as well as recreational and uses narrower craft, typically based at the few skiff clubs.

=== Kayaking and canoeing ===
{{Main|Kayaking and canoeing on the River Thames}}
[[Kayaking]] and [[canoeing]] are common, with [[sea kayak]]ers using the [[tidal reach|tidal stretch]] for touring. Kayakers and canoeists use the tidal and non-tidal sections for training, racing and trips. [[Whitewater]] [[playboating|playboaters]] and [[slalom canoeing|slalom]] paddlers are catered for at [[weir]]s like those at [[Hurley Lock]], [[Sunbury Lock]] and [[Boulter's Lock]]. At Teddington just before the tidal section of the river starts is [[Royal Canoe Club]], said to be the oldest in the world and founded in 1866. Since 1950, almost every year at Easter, long distance canoeists have been competing in what is now known as the [[Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwrace.co.uk/ Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race]. Dwrace.org.uk. Retrieved on 27 August 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; which follows the course of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], joins the River Thames at Reading and runs right up to a grand finish at [[Westminster Bridge]].

=== Swimming ===
In 2006 British swimmer and environmental campaigner [[Lewis Pugh]] became the first person to swim the full length of the Thames from outside Kemble to Southend-on-Sea to draw attention to the severe drought in England which saw record temperatures indicative of a degree of global warming. The {{convert|202|mi|km}} swim took him 21 days to complete. The official headwater of the river had stopped flowing due to the drought forcing Pugh to run the first {{convert|26|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Achieving the Impossible. A Fearless Leader. A Fragile Earth |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |author=Lewis Pugh |date=May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2012 the [[Port of London Authority]] has made and enforces a [[by-law]] that bans swimming between Putney Bridge and [[Crossness]], [[Thamesmead]] (thus including all of central London) without obtaining prior permission, on the grounds that swimmers in that area of the river endanger not only themselves, due to the strong current of the river, but also other river users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New by-law bans swimming in River Thames |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18658853 |work=BBC News |access-date=1 July 2012 |date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organised swimming events take place at various points generally upstream of [[Hampton Court]], including Windsor, Marlow and Henley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Big Thames Open Water Swim Series |url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Fundraising/Swimmingevents/SwimforMacmillan/TheBigThamesOpenWaterSeries/TheBigThamesOpenWaterSwimSeries.aspx |work=Macmillan Cancer Support |access-date=1 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328143921/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Fundraising/Swimmingevents/SwimforMacmillan/TheBigThamesOpenWaterSeries/TheBigThamesOpenWaterSwimSeries.aspx |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanrace: Windsor |url=http://swimseries.humanrace.co.uk/events/windsor |work=Speedo Open Water Swim Series |access-date=1 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701194555/http://swimseries.humanrace.co.uk/events/windsor |archive-date=1 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Henley Swim |url=http://www.henleyswim.com/ |access-date=1 July 2012 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085639/https://henleyswim.com/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 comedian [[David Walliams]] swam the {{convert|140|mi|km}} from Lechlade to Westminster Bridge and raised over £1&amp;nbsp;million for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Walliams reflects on epic 140-mile Thames charity swim |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14891217 |work=BBC News |access-date=1 July 2012 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085638/https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-14891217 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-tidal stretches swimming was, and still is, a leisure and fitness activity among experienced swimmers where safe, deeper outer channels are used in times of low stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Caitlin |title=The return of wild swimming: Swimming in the Thames is becoming the norm again |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/the-return-of-wild-swimming-swimming-in-the-thames-is-becoming-the-norm-again-10224427.html |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=Independent |date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meanders ===
A [[Thames meander]] is a long-distance journey over all or part of the Thames by running, swimming or using any of the above means. It is often carried out as an athletic challenge in a competition or for a record attempt.

The River Thames has been a subject for artists, great and minor, over the centuries. Four major artists with works based on the Thames are [[Canaletto]], [[J. M. W.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Seal St. Saviour's Dock London.jpg|thumb|A seal in the river at [[St Saviour's Dock]], London]]
The Thames is mentioned in many works of literature including novels, diaries and poetry. It is the central theme in three in particular:

''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' by [[Jerome K. Jerome]], first published in 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the Thames between [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] and [[Oxford]]. The book was intended initially to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history of places along the route, but the humorous elements eventually took over. The landscape and features of the Thames as described by Jerome are virtually unchanged, and the book's enduring popularity has meant that it has never been out of print since it was first published.

[[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (written in the years 1864–65) describes the river in a grimmer light. It begins with a scavenger and his daughter pulling a dead man from the river near London Bridge, to salvage what the body might have in its pockets, and leads to its conclusion with the deaths of the villains drowned in [[Shepperton Lock|Plashwater Lock]] upstream. The workings of the river and the influence of the tides are described with great accuracy. Dickens opens the novel with this sketch of the river, and the people who work on it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In these times of ours, though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise, a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance, with two figures in it, floated on the Thames, between [[Southwark Bridge]] which is of iron, and [[London Bridge]] which is of stone, as an autumn evening was closing in.''
''The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face, and a girl of nineteen or twenty. The girl rowed, pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man with the rudder-lines slack in his hands, and his hands loose in his waisteband, kept an eager look-out.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', written in 1908, is set in the middle to upper reaches of the river. It starts as a tale of anthropomorphic characters &quot;simply messing about in boats&quot; but develops into a more complex story combining elements of mysticism with adventure and reflection on [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] society. It is generally considered one of the most beloved works of children's literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grahame |first1=Kenneth |title=The Wind in the Willows: An Annotated Edition |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674034471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the illustrations by E.H.Shepard and Arthur Rackham feature the Thames and its surroundings.

The river almost inevitably features in many books set in London. Most of Dickens' other novels include some aspect of the Thames. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' finishes in the slums and [[rookery (slum)|rookeries]] along its south bank. The [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] often visit riverside parts as in ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]''. In ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]], the serenity of the contemporary Thames is contrasted with the savagery of the [[Congo River]], and with the wilderness of the Thames as it would have appeared to a Roman soldier posted to Britannia two thousand years before. Conrad also gives a description of the approach to London from the [[Thames Estuary]] in his essays ''[[q:Joseph Conrad#On the River Thames|The Mirror of the Sea]]'' (1906). Upriver, [[Henry James]]' ''[[Portrait of a Lady]]'' uses a large riverside mansion on the Thames as one of its key settings.

Literary non-fiction works include [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary, in which he recorded many events relating to the Thames including the [[Fire of London]]. He was disturbed while writing it in June 1667 by the sound of gunfire as Dutch warships broke through the [[Royal Navy]] on the Thames.

In poetry, [[William Wordsworth]]'s sonnet [[Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802|On Westminster Bridge]] closes with the lines:

:Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
:The river glideth at his own sweet will:
:Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
:And all that mighty heart is lying still!

[[T. S. Eliot]] makes several references to the Thames in ''The Fire Sermon, Section III'' of ''[[The Waste Land]]''.

:Sweet Thames run softly, till I end my song.
:The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
:Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes cigarette ends
:Or other testimony of summer nights.

and

:The river sweats
:Oil and tar
:The barges drift
:With the turning tide
:Red sails
:Wide
:To leeward, swing on the heavy spar,
:The barges wash
:Drifting logs
:Down Greenwich reach
:Past the Isle of Dogs

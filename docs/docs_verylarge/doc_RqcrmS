==Population==
The population of County Antrim was 615,384 according to recent &lt;!--date?--&gt;census information, making it the most populous county in Northern Ireland.

==Irish language==
Statistics for 2009–2010 show 1,832 students attending the 12 [[Gaelscoil]]eanna (Irish language primary schools) and 1 [[Gaelcholáiste]] (Irish language secondary school).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Oid-Tr%C3%AD-Mhe%C3%A1n-na-Gaeilge-in-%C3%89irinn-sa-Ghalltacht-09_101.doc Statistics from the national Gaelscoil management body, accessed at http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Oid-Tr%C3%AD-Mhe%C3%A1n-na-Gaeilge-in-%C3%89irinn-sa-Ghalltacht-09_101.doc, January 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The [[Catholic Church]] is the largest religious denomination in Ireland. County Antrim is one of two [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] in Ireland in which the majority of people are [[Protestant]], according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the other being [[County Down|Down]]. The strong Presbyterian presence in the county is due largely to the county's historical links with [[lowland Scotland]], which supplied many immigrants to Ireland. Protestants are the majority in most of the county, whilst Catholics are concentrated in Belfast, particularly the west of the city, the northeast, and on the shore of Lough Neagh.

==Administration==
The county was administered by [[Antrim County Council]] from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1972/9/contents|title=Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=29 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional county town is [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. More recently, [[Ballymena]] was the seat of county government. From 1973 Northern Ireland was split into [[Districts of Northern Ireland|districts]]. The majority of County Antrim residents are administered by the following councils:
* [[Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council]]
* [[Belfast City Council]]
* [[Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council]]
* [[Mid and East Antrim Borough Council]]
* [[Carrickfergus Borough Council]] (formerly, to May 2015)
* [[Lisburn and Castlereagh]]

Additionally, the area around the village of [[Aghagallon]] is administered by [[Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council]].

The county contains within it the whole of five [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituencies]]:
* [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]]
* [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]]
* [[East Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|East Antrim]]
* [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]]
* [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]]

Parts of the following five [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituencies]] are also in County Antrim:

==History==
[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890–1900.]]
At what date the county of Antrim was formed is not known, but it appears that a certain district bore this name before the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] (early 14th century), and when the shiring of Ulster was undertaken by Sir [[John Perrot]] in the 16th century, Antrim and Down were already recognised divisions, in contradistinction to the remainder of the province. The earliest known inhabitants were [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s of pre-[[Celt]]ic origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland |last=Waddell |first=John |year=1998 |publisher=Galway University Press Limited |location=Galway |pages=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the names of the [[townland]]s or subdivisions, supposed to have been made in the 13th century, are all of Celtic derivation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In ancient times, Antrim was inhabited by a Celtic people called the [[Darini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Irish History and Mythology |last=O'Rahilly |first=Thomas F. |authorlink=Thomas F. O'Rahilly |year=1946 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |location=Dublin |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Middle Ages, southern County Antrim was part of the Kingdom of [[Ulster|Ulidia]], ruled by the [[Dál Fiatach]] clans Keenan and MacDonlevy/McDunlavey; the north was part of [[Dál Riada]], which stretched into what is now western Scotland over the Irish Sea. Dál Riada was ruled by the O'Lynch clan, who were [[vassals]] of the Ulidians. Besides the Ulidians and Dál Riada, there were the [[Dál nAraide]] of lower County Antrim, and the [[Cruthin]], who were pre-Gaelic Celts and probably related to the Picts of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Irish History and Mythology |last=O'Rahilly |first=Thomas F. |authorlink=Thomas F. O'Rahilly |year=1946 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies |location=Dublin |pages=341–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 8th and 11th centuries Antrim was exposed to the inroads of the [[Vikings]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the late 12th century Antrim became part of the [[Earldom of Ulster]], conquered by [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] invaders. A revival of Gaelic power followed the campaign of [[Edward Bruce]] in 1315, leaving [[Carrickfergus]] as the only significant English stronghold. In the late Middle Ages, Antrim was divided into three parts: northern Clandeboye, the Glynnes and the Route. The [[Cambro-Norman]] [[MacQuillan]]s were powerful in the Route. A branch of the O'Neills of Tyrone migrated to Clandeboye in the 14th century, and ruled it for a time. Their family was called O'Neill Clannaboy. A [[Gallowglass]] sept, the MacDonnells, became the most powerful in the Glynnes in the 15th century.

During the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor era]] (16th century) numerous adventurers from Britain attempted to colonise the region; many Scots settled in Antrim around this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Town of Belfast |url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofb00benn |last=Benn |first=George |authorlink=George Benn |year=1877 |publisher=Marcus Ward &amp; Company |location=Belfast |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofb00benn/page/21 21] ff}}; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (14th edition), '''Antrim'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1588 the Antrim coast was the scene of one of the 24 wrecks of the [[Spanish Armada in Ireland]]. The Spanish vessel ''[[Girona (ship)|La Girona]]'' was wrecked off Lacana Point, Giant's Causeway in 1588 with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;girona&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf|title=La Girona|work=# Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Historic Wrecks, 2005|publisher=Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites|pages=35|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antrim is divided into sixteen baronies. Lower Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was settled by the sept O'Flynn/O'Lynn. Upper Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was the home of the O'Keevans. Belfast was part of Lower Clandeboye and was held by the O'Neill-Clannaboys. Lower Belfast, Upper Belfast, and Carrickfergus were also part of Lower Clandeboye. Cary was part of the Glynnes; ruled originally by the O'Quinn sept, the MacDonnell galloglasses from Scotland took power here in the late Middle Ages and some of the O'Haras also migrated from [[Connacht|Connaught]]. Upper and Lower [[Dunluce, County Antrim|Dunluce]] were part of the Route, and were ruled by the MacQuillans. Upper and Lower [[Glenarm]] was ruled by the O'Flynn/O'Lynn sept, considered part of the Glynns. In addition to that sept and that of O'Quinn, both of which were native, the Scottish [[Gallowglass]] septs of MacKeown, MacAlister, and MacGee, are found there. Kilconway was originally O'Flynn/O'Lynn territory, but was held by the MacQuillans as part of the Route, and later by the [[gallowglass]] sept of MacNeill. Lower Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye and was ruled by the O'Flynns and the O'Heircs. Upper Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye, ruled by the O'Heircs. Upper and Lower Toome, part of the Route, were O'Flynn/O'Lynn territory. Misc was first ruled by the MacQuillans. Later, the Scottish Gallowglass MacDonnells and MacAlisters invaded. The MacDonnells were a branch of the Scottish Clan MacDonald; the MacAlisters traced their origin back to the Irish Colla Uais, eldest of the Three Collas.

[[Islandmagee]] had, besides antiquarian remains, a notoriety as a home of witchcraft, and during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] was the scene of an act of reprisal (for the massacre of [[Protestants]]) against the Catholic population by the Scottish [[Covenanter]] soldiery of [[Carrickfergus]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1689 during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], County Antrim was a centre of Protestant resistance against the rule of the Catholic [[James II of Ireland|James II]]. During the developing crisis James' garrison at [[Carrickfergus]] successfully repulsed an attempt by local Protestants to storm it. After the advance of the [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] under [[Richard Hamilton (officer)|Richard Hamilton]], all of County Antrim was brought under [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] control. Later in the year a major expedition from England under [[Marshal Schomberg]] landed in [[Belfast Lough]] and successfully [[Siege of Carrickfergus|laid siege to Carrickfergus]]. Having captured most of the largest towns of the area, they then marched southwards towards [[Dundalk Camp|Dundalk]].

{{See also|:Category:Castles in County Antrim|l1=Castles in County Antrim}}

The antiquities of the county consist of [[cairn]]s, mounts or forts, remains of ecclesiastical and military structures, and [[Irish round tower|round towers]].

There are three round towers: one at Antrim, one at [[Armoy]], and one on [[Ram's Island, Northern Ireland|Ram's Island]] in Lough Neagh, only that at Antrim being perfect. There are some remains of the ecclesiastic establishments at [[Bonamargy]], where the earls of Antrim are buried, [[Kells, County Antrim|Kells]], Glenarm, [[Glynn]], [[Muckamore]] and Whiteabbey.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The castle at [[Carrickfergus Castle|Carrickfergus]], dating from the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], is one of the best preserved medieval structures in Ireland. There are, however, remains of other ancient castles, as [[Olderfleet]], Cam's, [[Shane's Castle|Shane's]], Glenarm, Garron Tower, Red Bay,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and [[Dunluce Castle]], notable for its dramatic location on a rocky outcrop.

The principal cairns are: one on Colin mountain, near Lisburn; one on [[Slieve True]], near Carrickfergus; and two on Colinward. The [[Dolmen|cromlechs]] most worthy of notice are: one near [[Cairngrainey]], to the north-east of the old road from Belfast to [[Templepatrick]]; the large cromlech at [[Mount Druid]], near [[Ballintoy]]; and one at the northern extremity of Islandmagee. The mounts, forts and entrenchments are very numerous.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The natural rock formations of [[Giant's Causeway]] on the Antrim coast are now designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

===Saint Patrick===
[[Slemish]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} east of Ballymena, is notable as being the scene of St Patrick's early life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; According to tradition [[Saint Patrick]] was a slave for seven years, near the hill of Slemish, until he escaped back to Great Britain.

===Linen===
[[Irish linen|Linen]] manufacturing was previously an important industry in the county. At the time Ireland produced a large amount of [[flax]]. Cotton-spinning by [[Spinning jenny|jennies]] was first introduced to Belfast by industrialists Robert Joy and Thomas M'Cabe in 1777; and twenty-three years later it was estimated that more than 27,000 people were employed in the industry within {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of Belfast. Women were employed in the working of patterns on [[muslin]].

'''Alfred Marshall''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (26 July 1842 – 13 July 1924) was an English economist, who was one of the most influential [[economist]]s of his time. His book, ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890), was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years. It brings the ideas of [[supply and demand]], [[marginal utility]], and [[costs of production]] into a coherent whole. He is known as one of the founders of [[neoclassical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economics.illinoisstate.edu/ntskaggs/eco372/readings/alfred_marshall.htm|title=Alfred Marshall|website=economics.illinoisstate.edu|access-date=2017-06-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107181816/http://economics.illinoisstate.edu/ntskaggs/eco372/readings/alfred_marshall.htm|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Marshall was born in London. His father was a bank cashier and devout Evangelical.  Marshall grew up in [[Clapham]] and was educated at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he demonstrated an aptitude in mathematics, achieving the rank of [[Second Wrangler]] in the 1865 [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MRSL861A|name=Marshall, Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite ODNB

&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall experienced a mental crisis that led him to abandon physics and switch to philosophy. He began with metaphysics, specifically &quot;the philosophical foundation of knowledge, especially in relation to theology.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysics led Marshall to ethics, specifically a [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwickian]] version of utilitarianism; ethics, in turn, led him to economics, because economics played an essential role in providing the preconditions for the improvement of the working class.

He saw that the duty of economics was to improve material conditions, but such improvement would occur, Marshall believed, only in connection with social and political forces. His interest in [[Georgism]], liberalism, socialism, trade unions, women's education, poverty and progress reflect the influence of his early social philosophy on his later activities and writings.

Marshall was elected in 1865 to a fellowship at St John's College at Cambridge, and became lecturer in the moral sciences in 1868. In 1885 he became professor of political economy at Cambridge, where he remained until his retirement in 1908.  Over the years he interacted with many British thinkers including [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[William Kingdon Clifford|W.K. Clifford]], [[Benjamin Jowett]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]], [[John Neville Keynes]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].  Marshall founded the [[Schools of economic thought#Neoclassical economics|Cambridge School]] which paid special attention to increasing returns, the theory of the firm, and welfare economics; after his retirement leaderships passed to [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]].

Marshall desired to improve the mathematical rigour of economics and transform it into a more scientific profession. In the 1870s he wrote a small number of tracts on international trade and the problems of protectionism. In 1879, many of these works were compiled into a work entitled ''The Theory of Foreign Trade: The Pure Theory of Domestic Values''. In the same year (1879) he published ''The Economics of Industry'' with his wife [[Mary Paley]].

Although Marshall took economics to a more mathematically rigorous level, he did not want mathematics to overshadow economics and thus make economics irrelevant to the layman.  Accordingly, Marshall tailored the text of his books to laymen and put the mathematical content in the footnotes and appendices for the professionals.  In a letter to [[A. L. Bowley]], he laid out the following system: {{blockquote|(1) Use mathematics as shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry.  (2) Keep to them till you have done. (3) Translate into English.  (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life (5) Burn the mathematics.  (6) If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3.  This I do often.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dimand|first=Robert W.|year=2007|title=Keynes, IS-LM, and the Marshallian Tradition|journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=39|issue=1|pages=81–95|doi=10.1215/00182702-2006-024}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

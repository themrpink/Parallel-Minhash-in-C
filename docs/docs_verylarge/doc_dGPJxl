The University of Minnesota was founded in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] in 1851 as a college [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], seven years prior to Minnesota's statehood.  As such, the University of Minnesota enjoys much autonomy from other operations of the state government.  The school was closed during the [[American Civil War]], but reopened in 1867.  Minneapolis businessman [[John Sargent Pillsbury]] is known today as the &quot;Father of the University&quot;, and aided the campus through financial troubles as a regent, state senator, and governor.  The [[Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act]] also helped provide funding for the University of Minnesota.

[[File:Folwell Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Folwell Hall]]
In 1869 the school reorganized and became an institution of higher education. [[William Watts Folwell]] served as the University of Minnesota's first president.  An official residence known as [[Eastcliff (mansion)|Eastcliff]] has been used by six university presidents since 1958.  The 20-room house, originally built by [[lumber baron]] [[Edward Brooks, Sr.]], was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.

During the traditional autumn through spring year, classes are not held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] or the Friday after, and the school traditionally has an extended break covering [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]].  Classes don't resume in January until the day after [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]].  A week-long [[spring break]] occurs after the eighth week of the spring term, which sometimes coincides with [[Easter]].

==Sources of funding==
The University of Minnesota system has one of the largest endowments among public universities in the country. As of 2007, the University of Minnesota maintained an endowment of $2.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2008/01/28/72165198 University's endowment fund reaches $2.8 billion - Minnesota Daily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129080314/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2008/01/28/72165198 |date=2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as a public university, the system received an estimated $641 million from the [[State of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budget.state.mn.us/budget/summary/fund_statements/071130_con_fund_state.pdf Microsoft Word - front page.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625070328/http://www.budget.state.mn.us/budget/summary/fund_statements/071130_con_fund_state.pdf |date=2008-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system's total budget for FY 2006 was $2.36 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budget.umn.edu/answer.htm Budget and Finance - The University's Annual Budget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional properties==
There are several other [[research]] and [[outreach]] centers across the state operated by the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities or by the university system.  As of September 2004, these areas plus the campuses are spread across 28,300&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s (44&amp;nbsp;miles² or 115&amp;nbsp;km²).  Other areas owned by the state and university bring this up to a total of 57,200&amp;nbsp; acres (89&amp;nbsp;miles² or 231&amp;nbsp;km²)

[[File:Vacuum cleaner.jpg|thumb|Canister vacuum cleaner for home use]]
A '''vacuum cleaner''', also known simply as a '''vacuum''' or a '''hoover''', is a device that causes [[suction]] in order to remove debris from floors, upholstery, draperies and other surfaces. It is generally electrically driven.

The debris is collected by either a dustbag or a [[cyclonic separation|cyclone]] for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which are used in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic [[central vacuum cleaner]]s, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and self-propelled [[vacuum truck]]s for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil. Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both dust and liquids.

== Name ==
Although ''vacuum cleaner'' and the short form ''vacuum'' are neutral names, in some countries (UK, Ireland, USA) {{Anchor|Hoover}}''hoover'' is used instead as a [[genericized trademark]], and as a verb. The name comes from the [[Hoover Company]], one of the first and more influential companies in the development of the device. In New Zealand, particularly the [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region, it is sometimes called a ''lux'', likewise a genericized trademark and used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/mainlander/293578/Cheerio-to-the-cheerio |title=Cheerio to the cheerio |date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/columns/2828465/You-do-the-luxing-and-you-eat-belgium |title=You do the luxing and you eat belgium |date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is also sometimes called a ''sweeper'' although the same term also refers to a [[carpet sweeper]], a similar invention.

==History==
[[File:VacuumCleanerIXLMuseum.jpg|upright|left|thumb|An early hand-pumped vacuum cleaner]]
The vacuum cleaner evolved from the [[carpet sweeper]] via [[manual vacuum cleaners]]. The first manual models, using bellows, were developed in the 1860s, and the first motorized designs appeared at the turn of the 20th century, with the first decade being the boom decade.

===Manual vacuums===
{{Main|Manual vacuum cleaner}}
[[File:Hess carpet sweeper patent model.png|right|thumb|Patent model of Daniel Hess's carpet sweeper]]
In 1860 a manual vacuum cleaner was invented by Daniel Hess of [[West Union, Iowa]]. Called a 'carpet sweeper', It gathered dust with a rotating brush and had a bellows for generating suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of vacuum cleaner by Daniel Hess in 1860|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/vacleaner.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710060520/http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/vacleaner.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Daniel (10 July 1860) &quot;Carpet-Sweeper&quot; {{US Patent|29077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early model (1869) was the &quot;Whirlwind&quot;, invented in [[Chicago]] in 1868 by [[Ives W. McGaffey]]. The bulky device worked with a belt driven fan cranked by hand that made it awkward to operate, although it was commercially marketed with mixed success.
&lt;ref&gt;McGaffey, Ives W. (8 June 1869) &quot;Improved-Sweeping Machine&quot; {{US Patent|91145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar model was constructed by [[Melville R. Bissell]] of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] in 1876, who also manufactured [[carpet sweeper]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bissellsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bissell.com/Our-History/|title=Our History |publisher=Bissell|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later added portable vacuum cleaners to its line of cleaning tools.

===Powered vacuum cleaners===
{{See|Hubert Cecil Booth#Vacuum cleaner|David T. Kenney}}
[[File:Vacuum Cleaner 1906.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Maid|Housemaid]] using &quot;dedusting pump&quot;, circa 1906.]]

The end of the 19th century saw the introduction of powered cleaners, although early types used some variation of blowing air to clean instead of suction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 45&quot;&gt;Gantz, Carroll (21 Sep 2012). The Vacuum Cleaner: A History. McFarland. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; One appeared in 1898 when John S. Thurman of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] submitted a patent (U.S. No. 634,042) for a &quot;pneumatic carpet renovator&quot; which blew dust into a receptacle.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_4.shtml|title=The Vacuum Cleaner|author=Wohleber, Curt|date=Spring 2006|accessdate=8 December 2010|work=Invention &amp; Technology Magazine|publisher=American Heritage Publishing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313170420/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_4.shtml|archivedate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurman's system, powered by an [[internal combustion engine]], traveled to the customers residence on a horse-drawn wagon as part of a door to door cleaning service. Corrine Dufour of [[Savannah, Georgia]] received two patents in 1899 and 1900 for another blown air system that seems to have featured the first use of an electric motor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 45&quot;/&gt;

In 1901 powered vacuum cleaners using suction were invented independently by British engineer [[Hubert Cecil Booth]] and American inventor [[David T. Kenney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 49&quot;&gt;Gantz, Carroll (21 Sep 2012). The Vacuum Cleaner: A History. McFarland. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage&quot;/&gt; Booth also may have coined the word &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gantz, Carroll 2012 p. 49&quot;/&gt; Booth's horse drawn combustion engine powered &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_booth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1515776.stm|title=Sucking up to the vacuum cleaner|date=30 August 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; maybe derived from Thurman's blown air design,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BVC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvc.co.uk/history.html|title=THE STORY OF THE VACUUM CLEANER|work=bvc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; relied upon just suction with air pumped through a cloth filter and was offered as part of his cleaning services. Kenney's was a stationary 4,000 lb. steam engine powered system with pipes and hoses reaching into all parts of the building.

===Domestic vacuum cleaner===
[[File:Vacuum cleaner 1910.JPG|thumb|upright|A hand-powered pneumatic vacuum cleaner, circa 1910. An early electric-powered model is also shown]]
The first vacuum-cleaning device to be portable and marketed at the domestic market was built in 1905 by Walter Griffiths, a manufacturer in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/vacuum.html|title=The Changes to Vacuum Cleaners over the last 100 years|work=The People History }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Griffith's Improved Vacuum Apparatus for Removing Dust from Carpets'' resembled modern-day cleaners; – it was portable, easy to store, and powered by &quot;any one person (such as the ordinary [[domestic servant]])&quot;, who would have the task of compressing a bellows-like contraption to suck up dust through a removable, flexible pipe, to which a variety of shaped nozzles could be attached.

[[File:NMAH DC - IMG 8859.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Early electric vacuum cleaner by Electric Suction Sweeper Company, circa 1908]]
In 1906 [[Jim Kirby|James B. Kirby]] developed his first of many vacuums called the &quot;Domestic Cyclone&quot;. It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions came to be known as the [[Kirby Company|Kirby]] Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor [[James M. Spangler|James Murray Spangler]] (1848–1915) of [[Canton, Ohio]] invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner,&lt;ref name=&quot;VacuumCleaner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Joel|title=Really useful: the origins of everyday things|publisher=Firefly Books|url=https://archive.org/details/reallyusefulorig00levy|url-access=registration|isbn=155297622X|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/reallyusefulorig00levy/page/147 147]}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on 2 June 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|889823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer [[William Henry Hoover]] (1849–1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the [[Hoover Company]]. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 (&quot;It beats as it sweeps as it cleans&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1364554}}&lt;/ref&gt; disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.

In [[Continental Europe]], the [[Nilfisk-Advance|Fisker and Nielsen company]] in [[Denmark]] was the first to sell vacuum cleaners in 1910. The design weighed just {{cvt|17.5|kg}} and could be operated by a single person. The Swedish company [[Electrolux]] launched their Model V in 1921 with the innovation of being able to lie on the floor on two thin metal runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Vacuum cleaner lasts for 70 years | work = BBC News | date = 27 January 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7205825.stm | accessdate = 28 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the Germany company [[Vorwerk (company)|Vorwerk]] started marketing vacuum cleaners of their own design which they sold through [[direct sales]].

===Post-Second World War===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner - 20140913.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Kirby Company|Kirby]] G5 vacuum cleaner]]
For many years after their introduction, vacuum cleaners remained a luxury item, but after the Second World War, they became common among the [[middle class]]es. Vacuums tend to be more common in Western countries because in most other parts of the world, [[Fitted carpet|wall-to-wall carpeting]] is uncommon and homes have [[tile]] or [[hardwood floor]]s, which are easily swept, wiped or mopped manually without power assist.

The last decades of the 20th century saw the more widespread use of technologies developed earlier, including filterless cyclonic dirt separation, central vacuum systems and rechargeable hand-held vacuums. In addition, miniaturized computer technology and improved batteries allowed the development of a new type of machine – the autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. In 1997 Electrolux of Sweden demonstrated the [[Electrolux Trilobite]], the first autonomous cordless robotic vacuum cleaner on the BBC-TV program ''Tomorrow's World'', introducing it to the consumer market in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robot cleaner hits the shops|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3031219.stm|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=BBC News|date=16 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In 2004 a British company released [[Airider]], a hovering vacuum cleaner that floats on a cushion of air, similar to a [[hovercraft]]. It has claimed to be light-weight and easier to maneuver (compared to using wheels), although it is not the first vacuum cleaner to do this – the Hoover Constellation predated it by at least 35 years.

A British inventor has developed a new cleaning technology known as Air Recycling Technology, which, instead of using a vacuum, uses an air stream to collect dust from the carpet.&lt;ref&gt;Edginton, B. (2008) [http://www.g0cwt.co.uk/arc/ “The Air Recycling Cleaner”]. g0cwt.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was tested by the Market Transformation Programme (MTP) and shown to be more energy-efficient than the vacuum method.&lt;ref&gt;Market Transformation Programme (2006), [http://www.mtprog.com/spm/download/document/id/613 “BNXS30: Vacuum cleaners – UK market, technologies, energy use, test methods and waste”]. Retrieved 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although working prototypes exist, Air Recycling Technology is not currently used in any production cleaner.

==Modern configurations==
A wide variety of technologies, designs, and configurations are available for both domestic and commercial cleaning jobs.{{Citation needed|reason=This entire section lacks almost any references.|date=August 2017}}

===Upright===
Upright vacuum cleaners are popular in the United States, Britain and numerous Commonwealth countries, but unusual in some [[Continental Europe]]an countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} They take the form of a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or beater bar, which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).

The older of the two designs, direct-fan cleaners have a large impeller (fan) mounted close to the suction opening, through which the dirt passes directly, before being blown into a bag. The motor is often cooled by a separate cooling fan. Because of their large-bladed fans, and comparatively short airpaths, direct-fan cleaners create a very efficient airflow from a low amount of power, and make effective carpet cleaners. Their &quot;above-floor&quot; cleaning power is less efficient, since the airflow is lost when it passes through a long hose, and the fan has been optimized for airflow volume and not suction.

Fan-bypass uprights have their motor mounted after the filter bag. Dust is removed from the airstream by the bag, and usually a filter, before it passes through the fan. The fans are smaller, and are usually a combination of several moving and stationary turbines working in sequence to boost power. The motor is cooled by the airstream passing through it. Fan-bypass vacuums are good for both carpet and above-floor cleaning, since their suction does not significantly diminish over the distance of a hose, as it does in direct-fan cleaners. However, their air-paths are much less efficient, and can require more than twice as much power as direct-fan cleaners to achieve the same results.

The most common upright vacuum cleaners use a drive-belt powered by the suction motor to rotate the brush-roll. However, a more common design of dual motor upright is available. In these cleaners, the suction is provided via a large motor, while the brushroll is powered by a separate, smaller motor, which does not create any suction. The brush-roll motor can sometimes be switched off, so hard floors can be cleaned without the brush-roll scattering the dirt. It may also have an automatic cut-off feature which shuts the motor off if the brush-roll becomes jammed, protecting it from damage.

===Canister===
Canister models (in the UK also often called cylinder models) dominate the European market. They have the motor and dust collector (using a bag or bagless) in a separate unit, usually mounted on wheels, which is connected to the vacuum head by a flexible hose. Their main advantage is flexibility, as the user can attach different heads for different tasks, and maneuverability (the head can reach under furniture and makes it very easy to vacuum stairs and vertical surfaces). Many cylinder models have power heads as standard or add-on equipment containing the same sort of mechanical beaters as in upright units, making them as efficient on carpets as upright models. Such beaters are driven by a separate electric motor or a turbine which uses the [[suction power]] to spin the brushroll via a drive belt.

===Drum===
[[File:Craftsman 16 Gallon Wet-Dry Vac.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Wet/dry vacuum for home use]]
Drum or shop vac models are essentially heavy-duty industrial versions of cylinder vacuum cleaners, where the canister consists of a large vertically positioned drum which can be stationary or on wheels. Smaller versions, for use in garages or small workshops, are usually electrically powered. Larger models, which can store over {{convert|200|L}}, are often hooked up to compressed air, utilizing the [[Venturi effect]] to produce a partial vacuum. Built-in [[dust collection system]]s are also used in many workshops.

===Wet/dry===
{{redirect|Shop Vac|the Jonathan Coulton song|Thing a Week}}
Wet or wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of the cylinder/drum models that can be used to clean up wet or liquid spills. They are generally designed to be used both indoors and outdoors and to accommodate both wet and dry debris; some are also equipped with an exhaust port or detachable blower for reversing the airflow, a useful function for everything from clearing a clogged hose to blowing dust into a corner for easy collection.

===Pneumatic===
Pneumatic or pneumatic wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of wet/dry models that hook up to compressed air. They commonly can accommodate both wet and dry soilage, a useful feature in industrial plants and manufacturing facilities.

===Backpack===
Backpack vacuum cleaners are commonly used for commercial cleaning: they allow the user to move rapidly about a large area. They are essentially small canister vacuums strapped onto the user's back.

===Hand-held===

Lightweight hand-held vacuum cleaners, either powered from [[rechargeable batteries]] or mains power, are also popular for cleaning up smaller spills. Frequently seen examples include the [[Black &amp; Decker DustBuster]], which was introduced in 1979, and numerous handheld models by [[Dirt Devil]], which were first introduced in 1984. Some battery-powered handheld vacuums are wet/dry rated; the appliance must be partially disassembled and cleaned after picking up wet materials to avoid developing unpleasant odors.

===Robotic===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several companies developed [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]s, a form of [[carpet sweeper]] usually equipped with limited suction power. Some prominent brands are [[Roomba]], [[Neato Robotics|Neato]], and [[bObsweep]]. These machines move [[autonomous robot|autonomously]] while collecting surface dust and debris into a [[dustbin]]. They can usually navigate around furniture and come back to a docking station to charge their batteries, and a few are able to empty their dust containers into the dock as well. Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a vacuum motor to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.

In December 2009, Neato Robotics launched the world's first robotic vacuum cleaner which uses a rotating laser-based range-finder (a form of [[lidar]]) to scan and map its surrounding. It uses this map to clean the floor methodically, even if it requires the robot to return to its base multiple times to recharge itself. In many cases it will notice when an area of the floor that was previously inaccessible becomes reachable, such as when a dog wakes up from a nap, and return to vacuum that area. It also has the strongest impeller among robotic vacuum cleaners, pulling in 35 CFM (1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min) of air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605141056/http://www.delta-america.com/Products/FanUploads/Specification/BCB1012UH-F00%28REV01%29.pdf DC Blower Specifications].

===Cyclonic===

Portable vacuum cleaners working on the [[cyclonic separation]] principle became popular in the 1990s. This dirt separation principle was well known and often used in [[central vacuum]] systems. Cleveland's P.A. Geier Company had obtained a patent on a cyclonic vacuum cleaner as early as 1928, which was later sold to Health-Mor in 1939, introducing the Filter Queen cyclonic canister vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/HMI-Industries-Inc-Company-History.html History of HMI Industries, Inc. – FundingUniverse].

In 1979, [[James Dyson]] introduced a portable unit with cyclonic separation, adapting this design from industrial saw mills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111002084315/http://www.dyson.co.uk/insidedyson/article.asp?aID=newidea A new idea]. dyson.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He launched his cyclone cleaner first in Japan in the 1980s at a cost of about US$1800 and in 1993 released the Dyson [[DC01]] upright in the UK for £200. Critics expected that people would not buy a vacuum cleaner at twice the price of a conventional unit, but the Dyson design later became the most popular cleaner in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0752809814/ Against the Odds: An Autobiography: Amazon.co.uk: James Dyson: Books].

Cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags. Instead, the dust is separated in a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]]. The dust particles and other debris move to the outside of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to gravity.

In fixed-installation [[#Central|central vacuum cleaners]], the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration. A well-designed cyclonic filtration system loses suction power due to airflow restriction only when the collection vessel is almost full. This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which lose suction when pores in the filter become clogged as dirt and dust are collected.

In portable cyclonic models, the cleaned air from the center of the vortex is expelled from the machine after passing through a number of successively finer filters at the top of the container. The first filter is intended to trap particles which could damage the subsequent filters that remove fine dust particles. The filters must regularly be cleaned or replaced to ensure that the machine continues to perform efficiently.

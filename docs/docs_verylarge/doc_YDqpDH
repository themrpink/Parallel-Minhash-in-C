This explains why the quality of a [[preamplifier]] or [[Low-noise amplifier|RF amplifier]] is of particular importance in an amplifier chain. In most cases only the noise figure of the first stage need be considered. However one must check that the noise figure of the second stage is not so high (or that the gain of the first stage is so low) that there is SNR degradation due to the second stage  anyway. That will be a concern if the noise figure of the first stage plus that stage's gain (in decibels) is not much greater than the noise figure of the second stage.

One corollary of the [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis equation]] is that an [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] prior to the first amplifier will degrade the noise figure due to the amplifier. For instance, if stage 1 represents a 6&amp;nbsp;dB attenuator so that &lt;math&gt;G_1 = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eq} = T_1 + 4 T_2 +  \cdots&lt;/math&gt;. Effectively the noise temperature of the amplifier  &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; has been quadrupled, in addition to the (smaller) contribution due to the attenuator itself  &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; (usually room temperature if the attenuator is composed of [[resistor]]s). An antenna with poor [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] is an example of this principle, where &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; would represent the antenna's efficiency.

A '''noise weighting''' is a specific amplitude-vs.-[[frequency]] characteristic that is designed to allow subjectively valid measurement of noise. It emphasises the parts of the spectrum that are most important.

Usually, noise means audible noise, in audio systems, broadcast systems or telephone circuits. In this case the [[weighting]] is sometimes referred to as [[Psophometric weighting]], though this term is best avoided because, although strictly a general term, the word Psophometric is sometimes assumed to refer to a particular weighting used in telecommunications.

A major use of noise weighting is in the measurement of residual noise in [[audio equipment]], usually present as hiss or hum in quiet moments of programme material. The purpose of weighting here is to emphasise the parts of the audible spectrum that our ears perceive most readily, and attenuate the parts that contribute less to our perception of loudness, in order to get a measured figure that correlates well with subjective effect. 

The [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] was devised specifically for this purpose, and is widely used in broadcasting, especially in the UK and Europe. [[A-weighting]] is also used, especially in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Advocacy|date=April 2020}} though this is only really valid for the measurement of tones, not noise, and is widely incorporated into sound level meters. 

In [[telecommunication]], noise weightings are used by agencies concerned with public telephone service, and various standard curves are based on the characteristics of specific commercial [[telephone]] instruments, representing successive stages of technological development. The [[Channel coding|coding]] of commercial apparatus appears in the nomenclature of certain weightings. The same weighting nomenclature and units are used in military versions of commercial noise measuring sets.

Telecommunication measurements are made in lines terminated either by the measuring set or an instrument of the relevant class.

      <text bytes="12233" xml:space="preserve">[[File:NRZcode.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The binary signal is encoded using rectangular pulse-amplitude modulation with polar NRZ(L), or polar non-return-to-zero-level code]]

In [[telecommunication]], a '''non-return-to-zero''' ('''NRZ''') [[line code]] is a [[Binary coding|binary]] code in which ones are represented by one [[significant condition]], usually a positive voltage, while zeros are represented by some other significant condition, usually a negative voltage, with no other neutral or rest condition. The pulses in NRZ have more energy than a [[return-to-zero]] (RZ) code, which also has an additional rest state beside the conditions for ones and zeros.  NRZ is not inherently a [[self-clocking signal]], so some additional synchronization technique must be used for avoiding [[bit slip]]s; examples of such techniques are a [[run-length limited|run-length-limited]] constraint and a parallel synchronization signal.

For a given [[data signaling rate]], i.e., [[bit rate]], the NRZ code requires only half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|baseband bandwidth]] required by the [[Manchester code]] (the passband bandwidth is the same).  When used to represent data in an [[asynchronous communication]] scheme, the absence of a neutral state requires other mechanisms for bit synchronization when a separate clock signal is not available.

NRZ-level itself is not a synchronous system but rather an encoding that can be used in either a synchronous or asynchronous transmission environment, that is, with or without an explicit clock signal involved.  Because of this, it is not strictly necessary to discuss how the NRZ-level encoding acts &quot;on a clock edge&quot; or &quot;during a clock cycle&quot;, since all transitions happen in the given amount of time representing the actual or implied integral clock cycle. The real question is that of sampling—the high or low state will be received correctly provided the transmission line has stabilized for that bit when the physical line level is sampled at the receiving end.

However, it is helpful to see NRZ transitions as happening on the trailing (falling) clock edge in order to compare NRZ-level to other encoding methods, such as the mentioned [[Manchester code]], which requires clock edge information (is the XOR of the clock and NRZ, actually) see the difference between NRZ-mark and NRZ-inverted.

NRZ can refer to any of the following [[Serializer (Digital Communications) | serializer]] line codes:

|'''NRZ(L)'''
|NRZL
|Non-return-to-zero level

The NRZ code also can be classified as a '''polar''' or '''non-polar''', where polar refers to a mapping to voltages of +V and −V, and non-polar refers to a voltage mapping of +V and 0, for the corresponding binary values of 0 and 1.

===Unipolar non-return-to-zero level===
{{Main|Unipolar encoding}}
[[File:Nrz-lb.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.4| Unipolar NRZ(L), or unipolar non-return-to-zero level]]

&quot;One&quot; is represented by a [[DC bias]] on the transmission line (conventionally positive), while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by the absence of bias – the line at 0 volts or grounded. For this reason it is also known as &quot;on-off keying&quot;. In clock language, a &quot;one&quot; transitions to or remains at a biased level on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit, while &quot;zero&quot; transitions to or remains at no bias on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit.  Among the disadvantages of unipolar NRZ is that it allows for long series without change, which makes synchronization difficult, although this is not unique to the unipolar case. One solution is to not send bytes without transitions. More critically, and unique to unipolar NRZ, are issues related to the presence of a transmitted DC level – the power spectrum of the transmitted signal does not approach zero at zero frequency. This leads to two significant problems: first, the transmitted DC power leads to higher power losses than other encodings, and second, the presence of a DC signal component requires that the transmission line be DC-coupled.

===Bipolar non-return-to-zero level===
&quot;One&quot; is represented by one physical level (usually a positive voltage), while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by another level (usually a negative voltage).  In clock language, in bipolar NRZ-level the voltage &quot;swings&quot; from positive to negative on the trailing edge of the previous bit clock cycle.

An example of this is [[RS-232]], where &quot;one&quot; is −12&amp;nbsp;V to −5&amp;nbsp;V and &quot;zero&quot; is +5&amp;nbsp;V to +12&amp;nbsp;V.

==={{Anchor|NRZS}}Non-return-to-zero space===
[[File:Nrz-s.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Non-return-to-zero space]]
[[File:Nrzi encoder 2.svg|thumb|Encoder for NRZS, toggle on zero]]
&quot;One&quot; is represented by no change in physical level, while &quot;zero&quot; is represented by a change in physical level.  In clock language, the level transitions on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit to represent a &quot;zero&quot;.

This &quot;change-on-zero&quot; is used by [[High-Level Data Link Control]] and [[USB]]. They both avoid long periods of no transitions (even when the data contains long sequences of 1 bits) by using [[zero-bit insertion]]. HDLC transmitters insert a 0 bit after 5 contiguous 1 bits (except when transmitting the frame delimiter &quot;01111110&quot;). USB transmitters insert a 0 bit after 6 consecutive 1 bits. The receiver at the far end uses every transition — both from 0 bits in the data and these extra non-data 0 bits — to maintain clock synchronization. The receiver otherwise ignores these non-data 0 bits.

Phelps ([[IBM]]) in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasic_2005_NRZI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phelps_1956_NRZI&quot;/&gt; It is a method of [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] to a physical signal for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] over some transmission medium.  The two-level NRZI signal distinguishes data [[bit]]s by the presence or absence of a transition at a clock boundary.

''Which'' bit value corresponds to a transition varies in practice, and the name NRZI is used for both.  [[Run-length limited]] (RLL) codes are generally described using the convention that a logical 1 is transmitted as a transition, and a logical 0 is transmitted as no transition.  The [[HDLC]] and [[Universal Serial Bus]] protocols use the opposite convention: a logical 0 is transmitted as a transition, and a logical 1 is transmitted as no transition.

A long series of no-transition bits can be difficult for a receiver to count accurately, so some means for forcing a transition at reasonable intervals is generally used in addition to NRZI.  Magnetic disk and tape storage devices generally use fixed-rate RLL codes, while HDLC and USB use [[bit stuffing]]: they insert an additional 0 bit (forcing a transition) after 5 or 6 (respectively) consecutive 1 bits.   While bit stuffing is efficient, it results in a variable data rate because it takes slightly longer to send a long string of 1 bits than it does to send a long string of 0 bits.

''Synchronized NRZI'' (''NRZI-S'', ''SNRZI'') and ''[[group-coded recording]]'' (GCR) are modified forms of NRZI.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patel_1988_MR&quot;/&gt; In NRZI-S, each 8-bit group is extended to 9 bits by a 1 in order to establish a transition for synchronisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patel_1988_MR&quot;/&gt;

==={{Anchor|RNRZ|RNRZI}}Randomized non-return-to-zero===

[[Return-to-zero]] describes a [[line code]] used in [[Telecommunication|telecommunications]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] in which the signal drops (returns) to zero between each [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]]. This takes place even if a number of consecutive 0s or 1s occur in the signal. The signal is [[Self-clocking signal|self-clocking]]. This means that a separate clock does not need to be sent alongside the signal, but suffers from using twice the bandwidth to achieve the same data-rate as compared to non-return-to-zero format.

The &quot;zero&quot; between each bit is a neutral or rest condition, such as a zero amplitude in [[pulse amplitude modulation]] (PAM), zero [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] in [[phase-shift keying]] (PSK), or mid-[[frequency]] in [[frequency-shift keying]] (FSK). That &quot;zero&quot; condition is typically halfway between the [[significant condition]] representing a 1 bit and the other significant condition representing a 0 bit.

Although return-to-zero contains a provision for synchronization, it still has a DC component resulting in “baseline wander” during long strings of 0 or 1 bits, just like the line code [[non-return-to-zero]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n''-entity}}
In [[telecommunication]], a '''''n''-entity''' is an active element in the ''n''-th layer of the [[Open Systems Interconnection--Reference Model]] (OSI-RM) that (a) interacts directly with elements, ''i.e.'', entities, of the layer immediately above or below the ''n''-th layer, (b) is defined by a unique set of rules, ''i.e.'', [[syntax]], and [[information]] formats, including [[data]] and control formats, and (c) performs a defined set of functions.

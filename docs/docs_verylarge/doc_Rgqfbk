{{Main|High-speed rail in the United Kingdom}}
The UK's fastest high-speed line ([[High Speed 1]]) connects [[St Pancras station|London St Pancras]] with [[Brussels]] and Paris through the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link|Channel Tunnel]]. At speeds of up to {{cvt|300|km/h|mph|0}}, it is the only high-speed line in Britain with an operating speed of more than {{cvt|125|mph|km/h|0}}.

The [[Great Western Main Line]], [[South Wales Main Line]], [[West Coast Main Line]], [[Midland Main Line]], [[Cross Country Route]] and [[East Coast Main Line]] all have maximum speed limits of {{cvt|125|mph|km/h|0}} in some areas. Attempts to increase speeds to {{cvt|140|mph|km/h|0}} on both the West Coast Main Line and East Coast Main Line have failed because the trains on those lines do not have [[cab signalling]], which is a legal requirement in the UK for trains to be permitted to operate at speeds greater than {{cvt|125|mph|km/h|0}} due to the impracticality of observing lineside signals at such speeds.

====United States====
{{Main|High-speed rail in the United States}}
The United States has domestic definitions for high-speed rail varying between jurisdictions.
* The [[United States Code]] defines high-speed rail as services &quot;reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than {{cvt|125|mph}}&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;title49&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t49t50+641+8++|title=US Code Title 49 § 26105 –Definitions|date=1 February 2010|work=US Code Title 49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317074713/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t49t50+641+8++|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=27 May 2011|quote=reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than 125&amp;nbsp;mph}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Federal Railroad Administration]] uses a definition of top speeds at {{cvt|110|mph}} and above.&lt;ref name=&quot;fra.dot.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/details/L02833|title=High-Speed Rail Strategic Plan|date=1 April 2009|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Congressional Research Service]] uses the term &quot;[[higher-speed rail]]&quot; for speeds up to {{cvt|150|mph}} and &quot;very high speed rail&quot; for the rail on dedicated tracks with speeds over 150&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42584.pdf|title=Development of High Speed Rail in the United States: Issues and Recent Events|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Acela Express]]'' (reaching {{cvt|150|mph}}), ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', ''[[Keystone Service]]'', ''[[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]]'', ''[[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]]'' and certain [[MARC Train|MARC]] [[Penn Line]] express trains (the three reaching {{cvt|125|mph}}) are currently the only high-speed services in the country, and all are limited to the [[Northeast Corridor]]. The ''Acela Express'' links [[Boston]], New York City, [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and Washington, D.C., and while ''Northeast Regional'' trains travel the whole of the same route, but make more station stops. All other high-speed rail services travel over portions of the route. The [[California High-Speed Rail]] project, eventually linking the 5 largest cities in California, is planned to have its first operating segment, between [[Merced, California|Merced]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], in 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2019/2/15/18225441/california-high-speed-rail-gavin-newsom|title=California's high-speed rail is still on.

== Inter-city effects ==
With high speed rail there has been an increase in accessibility within cities. It allows for urban regeneration, accessibility in cities near and far, and efficient inter-city relationships. Better inter-city relationships lead to high level services to companies, advanced technology, and marketing. The most important effect of HSR is the increase of accessibility due to shorter travel times. HSR lines have been used to create long-distance routes which in many cases cater to business travelers. However, there have also been short-distance routes that have revolutionized the concepts of HSR. They create commuting relationships between cities opening up more opportunities. Using both longer distance and shorter distance rail in one country allows for the best case of economic development, widening the labor and residential market of a metropolitan area and extending it to smaller cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Garmendia|first1=Maddi|last2=Ribalaygua|first2=Cecilia|last3=Ureña|first3=José María|date=1 December 2012|title=High speed rail: implication for cities|journal=Cities|series=Current Research on Cities|volume=29|pages=S26–S31|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2012.06.005|issn=0264-2751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closures==
The KTX Incheon International Airport to Seoul Line (operates on [[AREX|Incheon AREX]]) was closed in 2018, due to a mix of issues, including poor ridership and track sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/south-korea-closes-266m-high-speed-rail-line-passe/ |title=South Korea closes $266m high-speed rail line as passengers prefer the bus |work=Globalconstructionreview.com |date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AREX was not constructed as high-speed rail, resulting a cap of 150 [[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] on KTX service in its section.

In China, many conventional lines upgraded up to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h had high-speed services shifted to parallel high-speed lines. These lines, often passing through towns and having level crossings, are still used for local trains and freight trains. For example, all (passenger) [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] services on the [[Hankou–Danjiangkou railway]] were routed over the [[Wuhan–Xiaogan intercity railway|Wuhan–Shiyan high-speed railway]] on its opening to free up capacity for freight trains on the slower railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=29 November 2019|title=今天，湖北多县市，告别无高铁历史！|trans-title=Officially opened to traffic!

The '''Illinois and Michigan Canal''' connected the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In [[Illinois]], it ran {{convert|96|mi|km}} from the [[Chicago River]] in [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]], [[Chicago]] to the [[Illinois River]] at [[LaSalle, Illinois|LaSalle]]-[[Peru, Illinois|Peru]]. The canal crossed the [[Chicago Portage]], and helped establish Chicago as the transportation hub of the United States, before the [[railroad]] era. It was opened in 1848.  Its function was largely replaced by the wider and shorter [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] in 1900, and it ceased transportation operations with the completion of the [[Illinois Waterway]] in 1933.

'''Illinois and Michigan Canal Locks and Towpath''', a collection of eight engineering structures and segments of the canal between [[Lockport, Illinois|Lockport]] and LaSalle-Peru, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000332}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Illinois and Michigan Canal|date=September 14, 1975 |format=PDF |author1=Blanche Schroer |author2=Grant Peterson |author3=S.

Portions of the canal have been filled in.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv2&quot;/&gt;  Much of the former canal, near the [[Heritage Corridor]] transit line, has been preserved as part of the Illinois and Michigan Canal [[National Heritage Corridor]].

==Significance==
[[Canals]], in the 1800s, were important modes of transportation. The Illinois and Michigan Canal connected the [[Mississippi Basin]] to the [[Great Lakes Basin]]. The canal influenced Illinois's north border. The [[Erie Canal]] and the Illinois and Michigan Canal cemented cultural and trade ties to the [[American Northeast|Northeast]] rather than the [[American South|South]]. Before the canal, farming in the region was limited to [[subsistence farming]]. The canal made agriculture in northern Illinois profitable, opening up connections to eastern markets.

==History==

===Conception===
The first known Europeans to travel the [[Illinois Country|area]], [[Father Marquette]] and [[Louis Joliet]] went through the [[Chicago Portage]] on their return trip. Joliet remarked that with a canal they could remove the need to [[portage]] and the French could create an empire spanning the continent.

The first quantitative survey of the portage was performed in 1816 by [[Stephen H. Long]].  It was on the basis of these measurements that he was able to make a specific proposal for a canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Long |first=Stephen H. |authorlink=Stephen H. Long |editor-last1=Kane |editor-first1=Lucile M. |editor-last2=Holmquist |editor-first2=June D. |editor-last3=Gliman |editor-first3=Carolyn |title=The Northern Expeditions of Stephen H. Long |url=https://archive.org/details/northernexpediti0000long|url-access=registration |accessdate= |year=1978 |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |location= |page=[https://archive.org/details/northernexpediti0000long/page/7 7] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several [[slave states]] recently admitted to the Union, [[Nathaniel Pope]] and [[Ninian Edwards]] saw the opportunity to make [[Illinois]] a state. They proposed moving the border northward from the southern tip of Lake Michigan to allow the canal to be within a single state. They believed that the canal would firmly align Illinois with the free states and so Congress granted them [[U.S. state|statehood]] even though Illinois did not meet the population requirements.

===Construction===
[[File:Illinois-michigan-canal.png|thumb|The location and course of the Illinois and Michigan Canal]]

In 1824, [[Samuel D. Lockwood]], one of the first commissioners of the canal, was given the authorization to hire contractors to survey a route for the canal to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;coffin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Coffin | first = William | title = Life and Times of Hon. Samuel D. Lockwood | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924018816870 | publisher = Knight &amp; Leonard Co. | year = 1889 | location = Chicago, IL | page = [https://archive.org/details/cu31924018816870/page/n50 41]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the canal began in 1836, although it was stopped for several years due to an [[Illinois]] state financial crisis related to the [[Panic of 1837]]. The Canal Commission had a grant of {{convert|284000|acre|ha}} of federal land which it sold at {{convert|1.25|$/acre|$/sqkm}} to finance the construction. Still, money had to be borrowed from [[Eastern U.S. states|eastern U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] investors to finish the canal.

Most of the canal work was done by [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants who [[Navvy|previously worked]] on the [[Erie Canal]]. The work was considered dangerous and many workers died, although no official records exist to indicate how many. The Irish immigrants who toiled to build the canal were often derided as a sub-class and were treated very poorly by other citizens of the city.

The canal was finished in 1848 at a total cost of $6,170,226. Chicago Mayor [[James Hutchinson Woodworth]] presided over the opening ceremony. Pumps were used to draw water to fill the canal near Chicago, which was soon supplemented by water from the Calumet Feeder Canal. The feeder was supplied by water from the Calumet River and originated in [[Blue Island, Il]]. The [[DuPage River]] provided water farther south. In 1871 the canal was deepened to speed up the current and to improve [[sewage]] disposal.

===Completion===
The canal was eventually {{Convert|60|ft}} wide and {{Convert|6|ft}} deep, with [[towpath]]s constructed along each edge to permit mules to be harnessed to tow barges along the canal. Towns were planned out along the path of the canal spaced at intervals corresponding to the length that the mules could haul the barges. It had seventeen [[canal lock|locks]] and four [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]] to cover the {{Convert|140|ft|adj=on}} height difference between Lake Michigan and the Illinois River. From 1848 to 1852 the canal was a popular passenger route, but passenger service ended in 1853 with the opening of the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] that ran parallel to the canal. The canal had its peak shipping year in 1882 and remained in use until 1933.

Experiencing a remarkable recovery from the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, Chicago rebuilt rapidly along the shores of the Chicago River. The river was especially important to the development of the city since all wastes from houses, farms, the stockyards, and other industries could be dumped into the river and carried out into Lake Michigan.

===Decline and replacement===
[[File:Starved Rock Lock (COE) tow downbound.jpg|thumb|New lock and dam structures that replaced the historic Illinois and Michigan Canal]]

The lake, however, was also the source of drinking water. During a tremendous storm in 1885, the rainfall washed refuse from the river, especially from the highly polluted [[Bubbly Creek]], far out into the lake (the city water intakes are located {{convert|2|mi|km}} offshore). Although [[Chicago 1885 cholera epidemic myth|no epidemics occurred]], the Chicago Sanitary District (now [[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago|The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District]]) was created by the Illinois legislature in 1889 in response to this close call.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041112.html The Straight Dope: Did 90,000 people die of typhoid fever and cholera in Chicago in 1885?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This new agency devised a plan to construct channels and canals to reverse the flow of the rivers away from Lake Michigan and divert the contaminated water downstream where it could be diluted as it flowed into the [[Des Plaines River]] and eventually the Mississippi.

In 1892, the direction of part of the Chicago River was reversed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] with the result that the river and much of Chicago's sewage flowed into the canal instead of into [[Lake Michigan]]. The complete reversal of the river's flow was accomplished when the [[Sanitary and Ship Canal]] was opened in 1900.

It was replaced in 1933 by the [[Illinois Waterway]], which remains in use.

[[File:I and M canal near Willow Springs 2.jpg|left|thumb|The left|Illinois and Michigan Canal west of [[Willow Springs, Illinois|Willow Springs]], where the unused canal is clogged with fallen trees]]

===Rejuvenation===
The actual origin site of the Illinois and Michigan Canal has been converted into a nature park that integrates history, ecology and art to communicate the Canal's importance in the development of Chicago. In 2003 the Chicago Park District - in cooperation with the I &amp; M Canal Association, hired Conservation Design Forum to develop plans to convert the [[brownfield land|brownfield site]] into a landscape that provided for passive recreational uses in a landscape setting with native plant species. Interpretive panels built into a wall along a bike trail were designed by local high school art students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdfinc.com/Project?project_id=54 Conservation Design Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; also consulted on landscape stabilization techniques to repair a significantly degraded shoreline (water levels can fluctuate as much as 5 feet).

Today much of the canal is a long, thin [[linear park]] with canoeing and a {{convert|62.5|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking and biking trail (constructed on the alignment of the mule tow paths). It also includes museums and historical canal buildings. It was designated the first [[National Heritage Corridor]] by [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]] in 1984.

==Adjacent communities==
Many towns in Northern Illinois owe their existence directly to the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Lockport, Morris, Ottawa, and LaSalle were [[plat]]ted by the Canal Commissioners to raise funds for the canal's construction. From east to west the towns along the path of the canal include:

* [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] (Chicago neighborhood)

The '''National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality''' ('''NARTH'''), also known as the '''NARTH Institute''', is a US organization that promotes [[conversion therapy]], a [[pseudoscientific]] and potentially harmful practice used in attempts to change the [[sexual orientation]] of people with [[same-sex attraction]].&lt;ref name = Haldeman /&gt;  NARTH was founded in 1992 by [[Joseph Nicolosi]], Benjamin Kaufman, and  [[Charles Socarides]]. Its headquarters are in [[Encino, California|Encino]], California, at its Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic. It has operated under the name '''Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity''' ('''ATCSI''') since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sutton |first1=Philip M. |title= Professional care for unwanted same-sex attraction: What does the research say?|journal= The Linacre Quarterly |date= Nov 2015 |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages= 351–363 |doi= 10.1179/0024363915Z.000000000147 |pmc= 4771007 |pmid= 26997676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Quandt |first= Katie Rose |title= &quot;Ex-Gay&quot; Conversion Therapy Group Rebrands, Stresses &quot;Rights of Clients&quot; |url= https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/08/ex-gay-group-attempts-rebranding-narth-conversion-therapy |accessdate= 29 November 2016 |agency= Mother Jones |date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The policy manual of the American Psychological Association states that [[homosexuality]] is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and is not a mental disorder.&lt;ref name = APAResolution&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.pdf|chapter = Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts|title = APA Policy Statement on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender concerns|author = [[American Psychological Association|American Psychological Association Council of Representatives]]|date = August 5, 2009|website = www.apa.org|publisher = [[American Psychological Association]]}}&lt;br /&gt;Also included within: {{cite journal|title = Proceedings of the American Psychological Association for the legislative year 2009: Minutes of the annual meeting of the Council of Representatives and minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors|last = Anton|first = Barry S.|journal = [[American Psychologist]]|volume = 65|issue = 5|year = 2010|pages = 385–475|doi = 10.1037/a0019553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation affirms the tension between some religious values and other organizations, as well as the existence of a subset of individuals who are distressed about their same-sex attractions. Nevertheless, it says it has not found adequately rigorous studies that suggest sexual orientation change efforts are successful. The APA Task Force has also found that some individuals reported being harmed by change efforts.&lt;ref name = APAResolution /&gt;

The consensus of the world's major mental health organizations is that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = R.

== History ==

NARTH was founded in 1992 by Benjamin Kaufman, [[Charles Socarides]], and [[Joseph Nicolosi]]. In an article titled &quot;In Defense of the Need for Honest Dialogue&quot;, Kaufman wrote that the three of them founded NARTH because the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and similar professional organizations &quot;had totally stifled the scientific inquiry that would be necessary to stimulate a discussion&quot; about homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narth.com/docs/indefense.html |title=In Defense of the Need for Honest Dialogue |publisher=NARTH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

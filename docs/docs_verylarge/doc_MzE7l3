Year '''340''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCXL]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Tuesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Acindynus and Valerius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1093 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 340 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Myra'''  ({{lang-grc|Μύρα}}, ''Mýra'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], then Roman Greek, then [[Byzantine Greek]], then [[Ottoman Greek]] town in [[Lycia]], which became the small Turkish town of Kale, renamed [[Demre]] in 2005, in the present-day [[Antalya Province]] of [[Turkey]]. In 1923 its Greek inhabitants had been required to leave by the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], at which time its church was finally abandoned. It was founded on the river Myros ({{lang-grc|Μύρος}}; Turkish: ''Demre Çay''), in the fertile [[alluvial plain]] between Alaca Dağ, the Massikytos range and the [[Aegean Sea]].

== History ==
[[File:Myra_Rock_Tombs.jpg|thumb|left|Rock-cut tombs in Myra.]]
[[File:Myra Tombs Temples.jpg|thumb|left|Rock-cut tombs in Myra.]]

Although some scholars equate Myra with the town Mira in [[Arzawa]], there is no proof for the connection.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} There is no substantiated written reference for Myra before it was listed as a member of the [[Lycia#Lycian League|Lycian league]] (168 BC – AD 43); according to [[Strabo]] (14:665) it was one of the largest towns of the alliance.

The ancient Greek citizens worshiped [[Artemis]] [[Eleutheria]], who was the protective goddess of the town. [[Zeus]], [[Athena]] and [[Tyche]] were venerated as well. [[Pliny the Elder]] writes that in Myra there was the spring of [[Apollo]] called Curium and when summoned three times by the pipe the fishes come to give oracular responses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/153#32.8.1 Pliny the Elder, Natural History, §32.8.1]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Roman period Myra formed a part of the [[Koine Greek]] speaking world that rapidly embraced Christianity. One of its early Greek bishops was [[Saint Nicholas]].

The ruins of the Lycian and Roman town are mostly covered by alluvial silts. The [[Acropolis]] on the Demre-plateau, the Roman [[theatre]] and the [[Roman baths]] (''eski hamam'') have been partly excavated. The semi-circular theater was destroyed in an [[141 Lycia earthquake|earthquake in 141]], but rebuilt afterwards.

There are two [[necropolis|necropoleis]] of [[Lycia]]n [[rock-cut tombs]] in the form of temple fronts carved into the vertical faces of cliffs at Myra: the river necropolis and the ocean necropolis. The ocean necropolis is just northwest of the theater. The best-known tomb in the river necropolis, {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} up the Demre Cayi from the theater, is the &quot;Lion's tomb&quot;, also called the &quot;Painted Tomb&quot;. When the traveller [[Charles Fellows]] saw the tombs in 1840 he found them still colorfully painted red, yellow and blue.

[[File:Lycian tomb relief at Myra 4th century BCE.jpg|thumb|Lycian tomb relief at Myra, 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fant |first1=Clyde E. |last2=Reddish |first2=Mitchell G. |title=A Guide to Biblical Sites in Greece and Turkey |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199881451 |page=485 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPDXFPxKBzIC&amp;pg=PT485 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Andriaca|Andriake]] was the harbour of Myra in classical times, but silted up later on. The main structure there surviving to the present day is a granary ([[horrea]]) built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] (117–138 AD). Beside this granary is a large heap of ''Murex'' shells, evidence that Andriake had an ongoing operation for the production of purple dye.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Forstenpointer, et al., &quot;Purple-Dye Production in Lycia – Results of an Archaeozoological Field Survey in Andriake (South-west Turkey).&quot; ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 26, 2 (2007):201–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have been carried out at Andriake since 2009. The granary was turned into the Museum of Lycian Civilizations. The granary has seven rooms and measures 56 meters long and 32 meters wide. Artifacts found during the excavations in the [[Lycia#Lycian League|Lycian League]] were placed in the museum. The structures in the Harbor market as well as the agora, synagogue and a six-meter deep, 24-meter long and 12-meter wide cistern were restored. A 16-meter long Roman-era boat, a crane and a cargo car were placed in front of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/andriake-opens-partially-to-visits-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=83721&amp;NewsCatID=375''Andriake opens partially to visits'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==

The author of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] (probably [[Luke the Evangelist]]){{sfn|Charlesworth|2008|p=no page numbers}}{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=195}} and [[Paul the Apostle]] changed ships here during their journey from [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] to [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] for Paul's trial, arriving in a [[coastal trading vessel]] and changing to a sea-faring [[skiff]] secured by the Roman centurion responsible for Paul's transportation to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 27:5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Acta Pauli]]'' probably testify to the existence of a Christian community at Myra in the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums'', 465, 487 (cited by Salaviel)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Quien]] opens his list of the bishops of this city with [[St. Nicander]], martyred under [[Domitian]] in 95, who, according to the Greek [[Menologion]], was ordained bishop by [[Saint Titus]]. In 325, Lycia again became a [[Roman province]] distinct from that of [[Pamphylia]], with Myra as its capital. Ecclesiastically, it thus became the [[metropolitan see]] of the province. The bishop of Myra at that time was [[Saint Nicholas]]. The 6th-century ''Index'' of [[Theodorus Lector]] is the first document that lists him among the fathers of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Patrum Nicaenorum nomina'', 67, n. 161 (cited by Salaviel)&lt;/ref&gt; Many other bishops of Myra are named in extant documents, including Petrus, the author of theological works in defence of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] quoted by Saint [[Sophronius of Jerusalem]] and by [[Photius]] (''Bibliotheca'', Codex 23). Theodorus and Nicolaus were both at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787, the former recanting his previous [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclast]] position, the latter being the Catholic bishop whom the iconoclasts had expelled. The ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of Pseudo-Epiphanius, composed in about 640 under the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]], reports that Myra at that time had 36 [[suffragan see]]s. The early 10th-century ''Notitia'' attributed to Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] lists only 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{Oriens Christianus|volume=1|at=cols. 965–970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sévérien Salaville, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10661a.htm v. &quot;Myra&quot;] in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', vol. X, New York 1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;449&lt;/ref&gt;

Myra is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]] both in general and as a bishopric of the [[Melkite Catholic Church]] in particular. While [[Latin Church|Latin]] bishops are no longer appointed to this Eastern titular see, Melkite bishops are.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 931&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siege of 809 ==
[[File:St._Nicholas_Church,_Demre_5922.jpg|thumb|[[St. Nicholas Church, Demre]] in Myra]]

After a [[siege]] in 809, Myra fell to [[Abbasid]] troops under [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Early in the reign of [[Alexius I Comnenus]] (ruled between 1081 and 1118), Myra was again overtaken by Islamic invaders, this time the [[Seljuk Turks]].  In the confusion, sailors from [[Bari]] in Italy seized the [[relic]]s of Saint Nicholas, over the objections of the [[monk]]s caring for them, and spirited the remains away to Bari, where they arrived on May 9, 1087, and soon brought that city visitors making [[pilgrimage]] to Saint Nicholas.

==Church of St. Nicholas at Myra ==
[[File:Grab Nikolaus.jpg|thumb|left|The original tomb of St. Nicholas at the [[basilica]] in Myra.]]
{{main|Saint Nicholas}}{{main|St. Nicholas Church, Demre}}

The earliest church of St. Nicholas at Myra was built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] in the 6th century.  The present-day church was constructed mainly from the 8th century onward for the city's [[Byzantine Greek]] inhabitants; a [[Greek Orthodox]] monastery was added in the second half of the 11th century.

In 1863, [[Emperor of All Russia|Imperor]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] purchased the building and began restoration, but the work was never completed. In 1923 the church was abandoned when the city's Christian inhabitants were forced to leave for Greece by the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. In 1963 the eastern and southern sides of the church were excavated. In 1968 the former ''confessio'' ([[tomb]]) of St. Nicholas was roofed over.

The floor of the church is made of ''[[opus sectile]]'', a [[mosaic]] of coloured marble, and there are some remains of [[fresco]]es on the walls.  An [[ancient Greek]] [[marble]] [[sarcophagus]] had been reused to bury the Saint; but his bones were stolen in 1087 by merchants from [[Bari]], and are now held in that city, in the [[Basilica di San Nicola (Bari)|Basilica of Saint Nicholas]].

The church is currently undergoing restoration. In 2007 the Turkish Ministry of Culture gave permission for the [[Divine Liturgy]] to be celebrated in the church for the first time in centuries. On 6 December 2011 Metropolitan Chrysostomos, who has the title of Myra, accordingly officiated.&lt;ref&gt;romfea.gr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Myra_Medusa.jpg|thumb|A medusa head at Myra]]

Archaeologists first detected the ancient city in 2009 using ground-penetrating radar that revealed anomalies whose shape and size suggested walls and buildings. Over the next two years they excavated a small, stunning 13th-century chapel sealed in an uncanny state of preservation. Carved out of one wall is a cross that, when sunlit, beams its shape onto the altar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/science/under-turkish-mud-well-preserved-byzantine-chapel.html Sealed Under Turkish Mud, a Well-Preserved Byzantine Chapel]&lt;/ref&gt;

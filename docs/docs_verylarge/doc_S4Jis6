==Logo==
[[File:Engrenages - 85.488 -.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The gears with ''[[Herringbone gear|double chevrons]]'' that reputedly were the basis of the Citroën logo.]]

The origin of the logo may be traced back to a trip made by the 22-year-old André Citroën to [[Łódź]] city, [[Poland]], where he discovered an innovative design for a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-shaped [[gear]] used in [[Milling (grinding)|milling]]. He bought the patent for its application in steel. Mechanically a gear with [[helix|helical]] teeth produces an axial force. By adding a second helical gear in opposition, this force is cancelled. The two [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s of the logo represent the intermeshing contact of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citroën Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/citroen-logo|publisher=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Citroën cars used a herringbone bevel gear [[final drive]] in the rear axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The presentation of the logo has evolved over time. Before the war, it was rendered in yellow on a blue background. After the war, the chevrons became more subtle [[Herringbone pattern|herringbones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citroen-mania.com.ar/logo-citroen.htm |title=Logo: Citroën |access-date=18 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216084114/http://www.citroen-mania.com.ar/logo-citroen.htm |archive-date=16 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually on a white background. With the company searching for a new image during the 1980s, the logo became white on red to give an impression of dynamism.

In February 2009 Citroën launched a new brand identity to celebrate its 90th anniversary, replacing the 1977 design. The new logo was designed by Landor Associates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=323:pimp-my-ride&amp;catid=44:currentissue&amp;Itemid=113 / Communicate magazine]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045020/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=323%3Apimp-my-ride&amp;catid=44%3Acurrentissue&amp;Itemid=113 |date=8 October 2011 }} / Communicate magazine, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; — a 3D metallic variation of the double chevron logo accompanied by a new font for the Citroën name and the new slogan &quot;Créative Technologie&quot;.

{{For|the natural history of the Antarctic continent|Antarctica}}
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufoy''.]]
The history of [[Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as [[Terra Australis]], believed to exist in the far south of the globe. The term ''Antarctic'', referring to the opposite of the [[Arctic Circle]], was coined by [[Marinus of Tyre]] in the 2nd century AD.

The rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Horn]] in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (&quot;Unknown Southern Land&quot;), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. In 1773 [[James Cook]] and his crew crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] for the first time but although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. It is believed he was as close as {{convert|240|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from the mainland.

On 27 January 1820, a [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] discovered an ice shelf at [[Princess Martha Coast]] that later became known as the [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]]. Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see and officially discover the land of the continent of Antarctica. Three days later, on 30 January 1820, a British expedition captained by Irishman [[Edward Bransfield]] sighted [[Trinity Peninsula]], and ten months later an American sealer [[Nathaniel Palmer]] sighted Antarctica on 17 November 1820. The first landing was probably just over a year later when [[United States|American]] [[Captain John Davis (sealer)|Captain John Davis]], a [[Seal hunter|sealer]], set foot on the ice.

Several expeditions attempted to reach the [[South Pole]] in the early 20th century, during the &quot;[[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]&quot;. Many resulted in injury and death. [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Roald Amundsen]] finally reached the Pole on 13 December 1911, following a dramatic race with the [[British nationality law|Briton]] [[Robert Falcon Scott]].

==Early exploration==

===The search for ''Terra Australis Incognita''===
{{main|Terra Australis}}
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|In 1570 a rudimentary map by [[Ortelius]] showed the imagined link between the proposed continent of Antarctica and [[South America]]. Note also the proposed landmasses surrounding the [[North Pole]].]]
Aristotle speculated, &quot;Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html ''Meteorologica'' Book II 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] began in 1418 to encourage the penetration of the [[tropics|torrid zone]] in the effort to reach [[India]] by circumnavigating [[Africa]] that European exploration of the southern hemisphere began.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Polar Regions#Antarctic_Region|display=Polar Regions § ''Antarctic Region'' |first=Hugh Robert |last=Mill |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1473 [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[Lopes Gonçalves]] proved that the [[equator]] could be crossed, and cartographers and sailors began to assume the existence of another, temperate continent to the south of the known world.

The doubling of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1487 by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating [[Africa]] from any Antarctic land that might exist.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Ferdinand Magellan]], who passed through the [[Straits of Magellan]] in 1520, assumed that the islands of [[Tierra del Fuego]] to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land, and it appeared as such on a map by [[Ortelius]]: ''Terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita'' (&quot;Southern land recently discovered but not yet fully known&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=William|date=2014|title=Review of OF MAPS AND MEN: THE MYSTERIOUS DISCOVERY OF ANTARCTICA|jstor=24363785|journal=Arctic|volume=67|issue=3|pages=410–411|doi=10.14430/arctic4411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geography world map.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Map from 1771, showing &quot;Terres Australes&quot; label without any charted landmass.]]
European geographers connected the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of [[New Guinea]] on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans they sketched the outlines of the ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (&quot;Unknown Southern Land&quot;), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics.  The search for this great south land or Third World was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
In 1599, according to the account of [[Jacob le Maire]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Dirck Gerritsz Pomp]] observed mountainous land at latitude (64°). If so, these were the [[South Shetland Islands]], and possibly the first European sighting of Antarctica (or offshore-lying islands belonging to it). Other accounts, however, do not note this observation, casting doubt on their accuracy. It has been argued that the [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[Gabriel de Castilla]] claimed to have sighted &quot;snow-covered mountains&quot; beyond the [[64th parallel south|64° S]] in 1603, but this claim is not generally recognized.

[[Pedro Fernández de Quirós|Quirós]] in 1606 took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the [[New Hebrides]]) and those he would discover &quot;even to the Pole&quot;.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Francis Drake]] like Spanish explorers before him had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. Indeed, when [[Willem Schouten|Schouten]] and [[Jacob Le Maire|Le Maire]] discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Finally, in 1642 [[Abel Tasman|Tasman]] showed that even [[New Holland (Australia)]] was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent. Voyagers round the Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[Dutch expedition to Valdivia]] of 1643 intended to round Cape Horn sailing through [[Le Maire Strait]] but strong winds made it instead drift south and east.&lt;ref name=Arana280&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia general de Chile|last=Barros Arana|first=Diego|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|location=Alicante|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/historia-general-de-chile-tomo-cuarto--0/html/ff2f1efc-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_67.html|edition=Digital edition based on the second edition of 2000|volume=Tomo cuarto|language=es|chapter=Capítulo XI|author-link=Diego Barros Arana|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northerly winds pushed the expedition as far south as 61°59 S where [[iceberg]]s were abundant before a southerly wind that begun on April 7 allowed the fleet to advance west.&lt;ref name=Arana280/&gt; The small fleet led by [[Hendrik Brouwer]] managed to enter the Pacific Ocean sailing south of [[Isla de los Estados]] disproving earlier beliefs that it was part of Terra Australis.&lt;ref name=Arana280/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Kris E. |title=Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas 1500–1750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRgFqADzOLkC |year=1998 |publisher=M.E.

===South of the Antarctic Convergence===
The visit to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] by the English merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, Alexander. (1771). ''A Collection of Voyages Made to the Ocean Between Cape Horn and Cape of Good Hope''. Two volumes. London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Headland, Robert K. (1984).  ''The Island of South Georgia'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-25274-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict ‘[[Anthony de la Roché#Maps showing la Roché's discovery|Roché Island]]’, honouring the discoverer.

[[James Cook]] was aware of la Roché's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, James. (1777).  [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15869/15869-8.txt ''A Voyage Towards the South Pole, and Round the World. Performed in His Majesty's Ships the Resolution and Adventure, In the Years 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775.  In which is included, Captain Furneaux's Narrative of his Proceedings in the Adventure during the Separation of the Ships'']. Volume II. London: Printed for W. Strahan and T. Cadell. ([[:wikisource:James Cook and South Georgia in 1775|Relevant fragment]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmond Halley]]'s voyage in [[HMS Paramour|HMS ''Paramour'']] for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in [[52nd parallel south|52°&amp;nbsp;S]] in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140&amp;nbsp;mi off the north coast of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]) was his farthest south.  A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer [[Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier]] to discover the &quot;South Land&quot; – described by a half legendary [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville|&quot;sieur de Gonneyville&quot;]] – resulted in the discovery of [[Bouvet Island]] in 54°10′&amp;nbsp;S, and in the navigation of [[48th meridian west|48° of longitude]] of ice-cumbered sea nearly in [[55th parallel south|55°&amp;nbsp;S]] in 1739.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1771, [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec|Yves Joseph Kerguelen]] sailed from [[France]] with instructions to proceed south from [[Mauritius]] in search of &quot;a very large continent.&quot;  He lighted upon a land in [[50th parallel south|50°&amp;nbsp;S]] which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent.  He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which [[Kerguelen Islands|was ultimately named after him]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===The Antarctic Circle===
{{Further|Second voyage of James Cook}}
[[File:Cook-1777.jpg|thumb|300px|[[James Cook]]'s 1777 south-up map of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]].]]
The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of [[Alexander Dalrymple]], the brilliant and erratic [[hydrographer]] who was nominated by the [[Royal Society]] to command the [[Transit of Venus]] expedition to [[Tahiti]] in 1769.  The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain [[James Cook]]. Sailing in 1772 with the ''Resolution'', a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and the ''Adventure'' of 336 tons under Captain [[Tobias Furneaux]], Cook first searched in vain for [[Bouvet Island]], then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in [[58th parallel south|latitude 58°&amp;nbsp;S]], and then 30° eastward for the most part south of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]], a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel.  On 17 January 1773 the [[Antarctic Circle]] was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached {{nowrap|67° 15' S}} by {{nowrap|39° 35' E}}, where their course was stopped by ice.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Cook then turned northward to look for [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], of the discovery of which he had received news at [[Cape Town]], but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10° too far east and did not see it.  He turned south again and was stopped by ice in {{nowrap|61° 52′ S}} by 95°&amp;nbsp;E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]] to [[147th meridian east|147°&amp;nbsp;E]]. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to [[New Zealand]] and the tropical islands of the Pacific.  In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the ''Adventure'', and reached [[60th parallel south|60°&amp;nbsp;S]] by [[177th meridian west|177°&amp;nbsp;W]], whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed.  The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching {{nowrap|67° 31′ S}} to stand north again in [[135th meridian west|135°&amp;nbsp;W]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A long detour to {{nowrap|47° 50′ S}} served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at {{nowrap|109° 30′ W}} before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at {{nowrap|71° 10′ S}} by {{nowrap|106° 54′ W}}.  This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century.  With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment.  In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between [[53rd parallel south|53°]] and [[57th parallel south|57°&amp;nbsp;S]] to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered [[Anthony de la Roché#Maps showing la Roché's discovery|Roché Island]] renaming it [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|Isle of Georgia]], and discovered the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] (named ''Sandwich Land'' by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between [[55th parallel south|55°]] and [[60th parallel south|60°]]. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the [[60th parallel south|60th parallel]], and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and of no economic value.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica, on 27 January 1820, is attributed to the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]], discovering an ice shelf at Princess Martha Coast that later became known as the Fimbul Ice Shelf. Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see and officially discover the land of the continent of Antarctica.

It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships ''Vostok'' and ''Mirny'', reached on 28 January 1820 a point within {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Princess Martha Coast]] and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at {{coord|69|21|28|S|2|14|50|W|}}&lt;ref name=tammiksaar&gt;{{cite news|author=Erki Tammiksaar|title=Punane Bellingshausen|newspaper=[[Postimees]].

On 30 January 1820, [[Edward Bransfield]] sighted [[Trinity Peninsula]], the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered [[Peter I Island]] and [[Alexander I Island]], the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.

===Early exploration===
{{See also|List of Antarctic expeditions}}
The first landing on the Antarctic mainland is thought to have been made by the American Captain [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]], a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Gurney, ''Below the Convergence: Voyages Toward Antarctica, 1699–1839'', Penguin Books, New York, 1998. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; though this is not accepted by all historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Na7_hnQdz0C&amp;q=Captain%2520John%2520Davis%2520antarctica&amp;pg=PA6 |title=Amazing Antarctica: Resource book |last=Bourke |first=Jane |date=2004 |publisher=Ready-Ed Publications |isbn=9781863975841 |language=en |access-date=2019-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1820, Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer looking for seal breeding grounds, using maps made by the Loper whaling family, sighted what is now known as the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], located between 55 and 80 degrees west. In 1823, [[James Weddell]], a British sealer, sailed into what is now known as the [[Weddell Sea]]. Until the twentieth century, most expeditions were for commercial purpose, to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting. A piece of wood, from the [[South Shetland Islands]], was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica, obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829–31, commanded by Captain [[Benjamin Pendleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000079.htm|title=Charles Wilkes|publisher=South-Pole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

[[Charles Wilkes]], as commander of a [[United States Navy]] expedition in 1840,&lt;ref name=&quot;antarcticchronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/antarctica/exploration.shtml |title=ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION—CHRONOLOGY |access-date=2006-10-20 |publisher=Quark Expeditions |year=2004 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908120017/http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/antarctica/exploration.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered what is now known as [[Wilkes Land]], a section of the continent around 120 degrees East.

After the [[North Magnetic Pole]] was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. One of the explorers, [[James Clark Ross]], a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on [[Ross expedition|his 4 year-expedition]] from 1839 to 1843. Commanding the British ships ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'', he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], a massive floating [[ice shelf]] over {{convert|100|ft|m}} high.  His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: [[Mount Erebus]], the most active volcano on Antarctica, and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]].&lt;ref name=&quot;antarcticchronology&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Polar Regions exploration 1911.png|thumb|left|Map of exploration routes, 1911.]]
The first documented landing on the mainland of [[East Antarctica]] was at [[Victoria Land]] by the American sealer [[Mercator Cooper]] on 26 January 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarctic-circle.org/firsts.htm Antarctic Circle—Antarctic First]. Antarctic-circle.org. Retrieved on 2012-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

These explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were unable to penetrate the interior of the continent and, rather, formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica. Following the expedition South by the ships ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' under [[James Clark Ross]] (January, 1841), he suggested that there were no scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogg 2000&quot;/&gt; What followed is what historian [[Hugh Robert Mill|H.R. Mill]] called 'the age of averted interest'&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogg 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first= G.E.|last= Fogg|title= The Royal Society and the Antarctic|publisher= Notes and Records of the Royal Society London, Vol. 54, No. 1|year= 2000|location= London, The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there was a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fogg 2000&quot;/&gt;

==Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration==
The [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] began at the end of the 19th century and closed with [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Harrowfield |title= Polar Castaways: The Ross Sea Party of Sir Ernest Shackleton, 1914–1917 |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2004 |location= Montreal |isbn= 978-0-77-357245-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the [[Antarctic]] continent became the focus of an international effort that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration and in which 17 major [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic expeditions]] were launched from ten countries.&lt;ref name= B19&gt;Barczewski, pp. 19–20. (Barczewski mentions a figure of 14 expeditions)&lt;/ref&gt;

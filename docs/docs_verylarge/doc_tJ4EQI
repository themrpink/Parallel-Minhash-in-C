IP address spoofing is most frequently used in [[denial-of-service attack]]s, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid non routable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large [[botnet]]s makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets.  [[Denial-of-service attack#Backscatter|Backscatter]], a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers' use of IP spoofing for its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=GRIN - Today's Impact on Communication System by IP Spoofing and Its Detection and Prevention|url=https://www.grin.com/document/190620|access-date=2020-07-21|website=www.grin.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate uses==
The use of packets with a false source IP address is not always evidence of malicious intent. For example, in performance testing of websites, hundreds or even thousands of &quot;vusers&quot; (virtual users) may be created, each executing a test script against the website under test, in order to simulate what will happen when the system goes &quot;live&quot; and a large number of users log in simultaneously.

Since each user will normally have its own IP address, commercial testing products (such as [[HP LoadRunner]], [[WebLOAD]], and others) can use IP spoofing, allowing each user its own &quot;return address&quot; as well.

==Services vulnerable to IP spoofing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Configuration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:

* RPC ([[Remote Procedure Call|Remote procedure call]] services)
* Any service that uses IP address authentication
&lt;!-- * The [[X Window System]]--&gt;
* The R services suite ([[rlogin]], [[Remote Shell|rsh]], etc.)

==Defense against spoofing attacks==
[[Network layer firewall|Packet filtering]] is one defense against IP [[spoofing attack]]s. The gateway to a network usually performs [[ingress filtering]], which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform [[egress filtering]] on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a common use of packet filtering, which has been used to secure the environments for sharing data over network and host based IDS approaches. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chaudhary|first1=Manoj|last2=Bharti|first2=Abhishek Kumar|last3=Goyal|first3=Maggi|date=2013|title=A REVIEW ON DETECTION OF SESSION HIJACKING AND IP SPOOFING|url=|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science|volume=4|issue=9|pages=104–107|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the source IP address for authentication.

===Upper layers===
Some [[upper layer protocol]]s provide their own defense against IP spoofing attacks. For example, [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.

== Other definitions ==
The term '''''spoofing''''' is also sometimes used to refer to ''header forgery'', the insertion of false or misleading information in [[e-mail spoofing|e-mail]] or [[netnews]] headers. Falsified headers are used to mislead the recipient, or network applications, as to the origin of a message. This is a common technique of [[spamming|spammers]] and [[sporgery|sporgers]], who wish to conceal the origin of their messages to avoid being tracked.

{{Short description|ability of systems to work with each other}}
{{lead too short|date=December 2016}}

'''Interoperability''' is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=Copyright AFUL under CC BY-SA |url=http://interoperability-definition.info/en/ |title=Definition of Interoperability |website=dedicated website for a Definition of Interoperability at interoperability-definition.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term was initially defined for [[information technology]] or [[systems engineering]] services to allow for information exchange,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY: 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system to system performance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [http://www.ncoic.org/what-is-interoperability &quot;What is Interoperability?&quot;], [http://www.ncoic.org/ ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hence interoperability involves the task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Willium y Arms 2000(afifa iqbal)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
If two or more systems use a common [[File format|data format]]s and [[communication protocol]]s and are capable of communicating with each other, they exhibit ''syntactic interoperability''. [[XML]] and [[SQL]] are examples of common data formats and protocols. Lower-level data formats also contribute to syntactic interoperability, ensuring that alphabetical characters are stored in the same [[ASCII]] or a [[Unicode]] format in all the communicating systems.

Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, [[semantic interoperability]] is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems. To achieve semantic interoperability, both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model. The content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined: what is sent is the same as what is understood. The possibility of promoting this result by user-driven convergence of disparate interpretations of the same information has been the object of study by research prototypes such as [[S3DB]].

[[Cross-domain interoperability]] involves multiple social, organizational, political, legal entities working together for a common interest and/or information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [https://www.ncoic.org/cross-domain-interoperability &quot;Cross-Domain Interoperability&quot;], [https://www.ncoic.org/home ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability and open standards==
Interoperability imply Open standards ''[[ab-initio]],'' i.e. by definition. Interoperability implies exchanges between a range of products, or similar products from several different vendors, or even between past and future revisions of the same product. Interoperability may be developed ''[[wikt:ex post facto|post-facto]]'', as a special measure between two products, while excluding the rest, by using Open standards. When a vendor is forced to adapt its system to a dominant system that is not based on Open standards, it is not interoperability but only [[Computer compatibility|compatibility]].

===Open standards===
{{Main|Open standard}}
Open standards rely on a broadly consultative and inclusive group including representatives from vendors, academics and others holding a stake in the development that discusses and debates the technical and economic merits, demerits and feasibility of a proposed common protocol. After the doubts and reservations of all members are addressed, the resulting common document is endorsed as a ''common standard.'' This document is subsequently released to the public, and henceforth becomes an ''open standard.'' It is usually published and is available freely or at a nominal cost to any and all comers, with ''no further encumbrances.'' Various vendors and individuals (even those who were not part of the original group) can use the standards document to make products that implement the common protocol defined in the standard and are thus '''interoperable by design,''' with no specific liability or advantage for any customer for choosing one product over another on the basis of standardized features. The vendors' products compete on the quality of their implementation, user interface, ease of use, performance, price, and a host of other factors, while keeping the customer's data intact and transferable even if he chooses to switch to another competing product for business reasons.

===''Post facto'' interoperability===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}''Post facto'' interoperability may be the result of the absolute market dominance of a particular product in contravention of any applicable standards, or if any effective standards were not present at the time of that product's introduction. The vendor behind that product can then choose to ''ignore'' any forthcoming standards and not co-operate in any standardization process at all, using its near-monopoly to insist that its product sets the ''de facto'' standard by its very market dominance. This is not a problem if the product's implementation is open ''and'' minimally encumbered, but it may as well be both closed and heavily encumbered (e.g. by patent claims). Because of the [[network effect]], achieving interoperability with such a product is both critical for any other vendor if it wishes to remain relevant in the market, and difficult to accomplish because of lack of co-operation on equal terms with the original vendor, who may well see the new vendor as a potential competitor and threat. The newer implementations often rely on [[clean-room reverse engineering]] in the absence of technical data to achieve interoperability. The original vendors can provide such technical data to others, often in the name of 'encouraging competition,' but such data is invariably encumbered, and may be of limited use. Availability of such data is ''not'' equivalent to an open standard, because:
# The data is provided by the original vendor on a discretionary basis, who has every interest in blocking the effective implementation of competing solutions, and may subtly alter or change its product, often in newer revisions, so that competitors' implementations are almost, but not quite completely interoperable, leading customers to consider them unreliable or of lower quality. These changes can either not be passed on to other vendors at all, or passed on after a strategic delay, maintaining the market dominance of the original vendor.
# The data itself may be encumbered, e.g. by patents or pricing, leading to a dependence of all competing solutions on the original vendor, and possibly leading a revenue stream from the competitors' customers back to the original vendor. This revenue stream is only a result of the original product's market dominance and not a result of any innate superiority.
# Even when the original vendor is genuinely interested in promoting a healthy competition (so that he may also benefit from the resulting innovative market), post-facto interoperability may often be undesirable as many defects or quirks can be directly traced back to the original implementation's technical limitations. Although in an open process, anyone may identify and correct such limitations, and the resulting cleaner specification may be used by all vendors, this is more difficult post-facto, as customers already have valuable information and processes encoded in the faulty but dominant product, and other vendors are forced to replicate those faults and quirks even if they could design better solutions, for the sake of preserving interoperability. Alternatively, it can be argued that even open processes are subject to the weight of past implementations and imperfect past designs and that the power of the dominant vendor to unilaterally correct or improve the system and impose the changes to all users facilitates innovation.
# Lack of an open standard can also become problematic for the customers, as in case of the original vendor's inability to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technical limitations in the original product. The customer wants that fault fixed, but the vendor has to maintain that faulty state, even across newer revisions of the same product, because that behavior is a de facto standard and many more customers would have to pay the price of any break in interoperability caused by fixing the original problem and introducing new behavior.

== Government ==

=== eGovernment ===
Speaking from an e-government perspective, interoperability refers to the collaboration ability of cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Exchanging data can be a challenge due to language barriers, different specifications of formats and varieties of categorizations. Many more hindrances can be identified.

If data is interpreted differently, collaboration is limited, takes longer and is not efficient. For instance, if a citizen of country A wants to purchase land in country B, the person will be asked to submit the proper address data. Address data in both countries include full name details, street name and number as well as a post code. The order of the address details might vary. In the same language, it is not an obstacle to order the provided address data; but across language barriers, it becomes more and more difficult. If the language requires other characters it is almost impossible, if no translation tools are available.

Hence eGovernment applications need to exchange data in a semantically interoperable manner. This saves time and money and reduces sources of errors. Fields of practical use are found in every policy area, be it justice, trade or participation, etc. Clear concepts of interpretation patterns are required.

=== Flood risk management ===
''Interoperability'' is used by researchers in the context of urban flood risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vercruysse|first=Kim|last2=Dawson|first2=David A.|last3=Wright|first3=Nigel|title=Interoperability: A conceptual framework to bridge the gap between multifunctional and multisystem urban flood management|journal=Journal of Flood Risk Management|language=en|volume=0|pages=e12535|doi=10.1111/jfr3.12535|issn=1753-318X|year=2019|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities and urban areas worldwide are expanding, which creates complex spaces with many interactions between the environment, infrastructure and people.  To address this complexity and manage water in urban areas appropriately, a [[system of systems]] approach to water and [[flood management]] is necessary. In this context, interoperability is important to facilitate system of systems thinking in flood management,  and is defined as: “''the ability of any water management system to redirect water and make use of other system(s) to maintain or enhance its performance function during water exceedance events''”. By assessing the complex properties of urban infrastructure systems, particularly the interoperability between the [[drainage]] systems and other urban systems (e.g. infrastructure such as transport), it could be possible to expand the capacity of the overall system to manage flood water towards achieving improved urban flood resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanfloodresilience.ac.uk/|title=Urban Flood Resilience|website=www.urbanfloodresilience.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military forces===
{{anchor| Military}}
''Force interoperability'' is defined in NATO as the ability of the forces of two or more nations to train, exercise and operate effectively together in the execution of assigned missions and tasks. Additionally NATO defines interoperability more generally as the ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve Allied tactical, operational and strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, NATO AAP-06]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the strategic level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing the world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability is an element of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and tactical levels is where strategic/political interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and tactical levels generally derive from the fungibility or interchangeability of force elements and units. &quot;Technological interoperability&quot; reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility or incompatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and tactical levels in terms of enhancing fungibility and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Interoperability: A continuing Challenge in Coalition Air Operations - Chapter 2 “A broad Definition of Interoperability”, by Myron Hura, Gary McLeod, James Schneider and others, RAND Monograph Report, 2000, [http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1235/MR1235.chap2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Public safety===
Interoperability is an important issue for [[police|law enforcement]], [[fire fighting]], [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], and other public health and safety departments, because first responders need to be able to communicate during wide-scale emergencies. It has been a major area of investment and research over the last 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, D. K., Karanasios, S., &amp; Norman, A. (2013). Information sharing and interoperability: the case of major incident management. European Journal of Information Systems, 10.1057/ejis.2013.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, G. (2010). Report of the workshop on “Interoperable communications for Safety and Security”. Ispra: European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, agencies could not exchange information because they operated widely disparate hardware that was incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firerescue1.com/fire-products/communications/interoperability/articles/424190-Interoperability-system-bridges-communications-gap/|title=Interoperability system bridges communications gap|newspaper=FireRescue1|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies' information systems such as computer-aided dispatch systems (CAD) and records management systems (RMS) functioned largely in isolation, so-called &quot;information islands.&quot; Agencies tried to bridge this isolation with inefficient, stop-gap methods while large agencies began implementing limited interoperable systems. These approaches were inadequate and, in the US, the lack of interoperability in the public safety realm become evident during the [[9/11 attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grier|first=Robin|title=Interoperability Solutions|url=http://www.catcomtec.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=34|work=Interoperability|publisher=Catalyst Communications|access-date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Pentagon and World Trade Center structures. Further evidence of a lack of interoperability surfaced when agencies tackled the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

In contrast to the overall national picture, some states, including Utah, have already made great strides forward. The [[Utah Highway Patrol]] and other departments in Utah have created a statewide [[data sharing]] network using technology from a company based in [[Bountiful, Utah]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180710230842/https://www.fatpot.com/ FATPOT Technologies].

The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of the leading states in the United States in improving interoperability and is continually recognized as a National Best Practice by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Virginia's proven practitioner-driven governance structure ensures that all the right players are involved in decision making, training and exercises, and planning efforts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Interoperability Coordinator leverages a regional structure to better allocate grant funding around the Commonwealth so that all areas have an opportunity to improve communications interoperability. Virginia's strategic plan for communications is updated yearly to include new initiatives for the Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;– all projects and efforts are tied to this plan, which is aligned with the National Emergency Communications Plan, authored by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC).

The State of Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.wa.gov|title=Governor Jay Inslee - Washington State|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to enhance interoperability statewide. The State Interoperability Executive Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siec.wa.gov|title=SIEC|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SIEC), established by the legislature in 2003, works to assist emergency responder agencies (police, fire, sheriff, medical, hazmat, etc.) at all levels of government (city, county, state, tribal, federal) to define interoperability for their local region.

Washington recognizes collaborating on system design and development for wireless radio systems enables emergency responder agencies to efficiently provide additional services, increase interoperability, and reduce long-term costs.

This work saves the lives of emergency personnel and the citizens they serve.

The U.S. government is making an effort to overcome the nation's lack of public safety interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security's [[Office for Interoperability and Compatibility]] (OIC) is pursuing the SAFECOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecomprogram.gov/|title=SAFECOM - Homeland Security|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221211800/http://www.safecomprogram.gov/|archive-date=2014-12-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CADIP]] and [[Project 25]] programs, which are designed to help agencies as they integrate their CAD and other IT systems.

The OIC launched CADIP in August 2007. This project will partner the OIC with agencies in several locations, including [[Silicon Valley]]. This program will use case studies to identify the best practices and challenges associated with linking CAD systems across jurisdictional boundaries. These lessons will create the tools and resources public safety agencies can use to build interoperable CAD systems and communicate across local, state, and federal boundaries.

=== Information technology and computers ===

====Desktop====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}

The desktop interoperability (also known as interop) is a sub-section of the software interoperability. In the early days, the focus of ‘interop’ was to integrate web-applications with other web-applications. Over time, open-system ‘containers’ were developed to create a virtual desktop environment in which these applications could be registered and then communicate with each other using simple pub/sub patterns. Rudimentary UI capabilities were also supported allowing windows to be grouped with other windows. Today, the desktop interoperability has evolved into full-service interop platforms which include container support, basic exchange between web and web, but also native support for other application types and advanced window management. The very latest interop platforms also include application services such as universal search, notifications, user permissions and preferences, 3rd party application connectors and language adapters for in-house applications.

====Information search====
Search interoperability refers to the ability of two or more information collections to be searched by a single query.

Specifically related to web-based search, the challenge of interoperability stems from the fact designers of web resources typically have little or no need to concern themselves with exchanging information with other web resources. [[Federated Search]] technology, which does not place format requirements on the data owner, has emerged as one solution to search interoperability challenges. In addition, standards, such as [[OAI-PMH]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and [[SPARQL]], have emerged recently that also help address the issue of search interoperability related to web resources. Such standards also address broader topics of interoperability, such as allowing data mining.

====Software====
[[Image:Interoperable software.png|250px|thumb|Interoperability: playing the two role network game, when one of the player clients (top left) runs under [[Sun Microsystems]] and another under [[GNU Classpath]] with [[JamVM]]. The applications execute the same [[bytecode]] and interoperate using the standard [[RMI-IIOP]] messages for communication]]
{{Main|Language interoperability|Semantic interoperability}}

With respect to [[software]], the term ''interoperability'' is used to describe the capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats, to read and write the same [[file format]]s, and to use the same [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]s. (The ability to execute the same [[executable|binary code]] on different [[Central processing unit|processor]] platforms is 'not' contemplated by the definition of interoperability.) The lack of interoperability can be a consequence of a lack of attention to [[standardization]] during the design of a program. Indeed, interoperability is not taken for granted in the non-standards-based portion of the computing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official Guide to the SSCP Book|last=Gordon and Hernandez|publisher=SYBEX|isbn=978-1119278634|date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ISO/IEC 2382]]-01, ''Information Technology Vocabulary, Fundamental Terms'', interoperability is defined as follows: &quot;The capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|title=Proposed Draft Technical Report for: ISO/IEC xxxxx, Information technology -- Learning, education, and training -- Management and delivery -- Specification and use of extensions and profiles|author=SC36 Secretariat|date=2003-11-13|publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129034634/http://old.jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|archive-date=2007-11-29|url-status=dead|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the definition is somewhat ambiguous because the ''user'' of a program can be another program and, if the latter is a portion of the set of program that is required to be interoperable, it might well be that it does need to have knowledge of the characteristics of other units.

This definition focuses on the technical side of interoperability, while it has also been pointed out{{By whom|date=August 2016}} that interoperability is often more of an organizational issue: often interoperability has a significant impact on the organizations concerned, raising issues of ownership (do people want to share their data? or are they dealing with [[information silo]]s?), labor relations (are people prepared to undergo training?) and usability. In this context, a more apt definition is captured in the term ''[[business process interoperability]]''.

Interoperability can have important [[economic]] consequences; for example, research has estimated the cost of inadequate interoperability in the U.S. capital facilities industry to be $15.8 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=MP Gallaher|author2=AC O’Connor|author3=JL Dettbarn, Jr.|author4=LT Gilday|date=August 2004|title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2004/NIST.GCR.04-867.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=iv|access-date=2012-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204225252/http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2004/NIST.GCR.04-867.pdf|archive-date=2016-02-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; If competitors' products are not interoperable (due to causes such as [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s or [[Coordination failure (economics)|coordination failures]]), the result may well be [[monopoly]] or [[market failure]]. For this reason, it may be prudent for user communities or governments to take steps to encourage interoperability in various situations. At least 30 international bodies and countries have implemented [[eGovernment]]-based interoperability framework initiatives called [[e-GIF]] while in the United States there is the [[NIEM]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tgf/201101/pdf00010.pdf |title=e-Government Interoperability A comparative analysis of 30 countries |publisher=CS Transform |year=2010 |access-date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) provide open public software specifications to facilitate interoperability; examples include the [[Oasis-Open]] organization and [[buildingSMART]] (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability). As far as user communities, [[Neutral Third Party]] is creating standards for business process interoperability. Another example of a neutral party is the [[Request for Comments|RFC]] documents from the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

The OSLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open-services.net/|title=Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration) community is working on finding a common standard in order that software tools can share and exchange data e.g. bugs, tasks, requirements etc. The final goal is to agree on an open standard for interoperability of open source [[Application Lifecycle Management|ALM]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/olberger/presentation-icssea2011|title=OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration): open standard for i…|date=30 November 2011|access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Java is a great example of an interoperable programming language that allows for programs to be written once and run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Write once, run anywhere]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}} One writing a program in Java, so long as it does not use system-specific functionality, will maintain interoperability with all machines that have a Java Virtual Machine. There are many implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, such as Oracle, IBM, Android, etc... If a Java Virtual Machine is created to specification, applications will maintain compatibility because while the implementation is different, the underlying language interfaces are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clojure-programming/9781449310387/ch09.html|title=9.

=====Achieving software=====
Software interoperability is achieved through five interrelated ways:
# Product testing
#: Products produced to a common standard, or to a sub-profile thereof, depend on the clarity of the standards, but there may be discrepancies in their implementations that system or unit testing may not uncover. This requires that systems formally be tested in a production scenario&amp;nbsp;– as they will be finally implemented&amp;nbsp;– to ensure they actually will intercommunicate as advertised, i.e. they are interoperable. Interoperable product testing is different from conformance-based product testing as conformance to a standard does not necessarily engender interoperability with another product which is also tested for conformance.
# Product engineering
#: Implements the common standard, or a sub-profile thereof, as defined by the industry/community partnerships with the specific intention of achieving interoperability with other software implementations also following the same standard or sub-profile thereof.
# Industry/community partnership
#: Industry-community partnerships, either domestic or international, sponsor standard workgroups with the purpose to define a common standard that may be used to allow software systems to intercommunicate for a defined purpose. At times an industry/community will sub-profile an existing standard produced by another organization to reduce options and thus making interoperability more achievable for implementations.
# Common technology and IP
#: The use of a common technology or IP may speed up and reduce the complexity of interoperability by reducing variability between components from different sets of separately developed software products and thus allowing them to intercommunicate more readily. This technique has some of the same technical results as using a common vendor product to produce interoperability. The common technology can come through 3rd party libraries or open-source developments.
# Standard implementation
#: Software interoperability requires a common agreement that is normally arrived at via an industrial, national or international [[standardisation|standard]].

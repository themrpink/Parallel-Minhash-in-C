==History==
===Early history===
The first settlement in the area of Celje appeared during the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] era. The settlement was known in the Celtic times and to Ancient Greek historians as ''Kelea'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Celje: From the Celts and Romans to the Counts and Yugoslavia to the EU|url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/celje/History|accessdate=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003190530/https://www.inyourpocket.com/celje/History|archive-date=2016-10-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; findings suggest that [[Celt]]s coined [[Noricum|Noric]] money in the region.

Once the area was incorporated in the [[Roman Empire]] in 15 BC, it was known as ''Civitas [[List of Latin place names in the Balkans|Celeia]]''. It received [[town privileges|municipal rights]] in AD 45 under the name ''municipium [[Claudia Celeia]]'' during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius]] (41-54). Records suggest that the town was rich and densely populated, secured with the walls and towers, containing multi-storied marble palaces, wide squares, and streets. It was called ''Troia secunda'', the second; or small [[Troy]]. A [[Roman road]] through Celeia led from [[Aquileia]] (Sln. ''Oglej'') to [[Pannonia]]. Celeia soon became a flourishing [[Roman colony]], and many great buildings were constructed, such as the temple of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], which was known across the Empire. Celeia was incorporated into Aquileia ca. 320 under the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] (272-337).

The city was razed by [[Slavic tribes]] during the [[Migration period]] of the 5th and 6th centuries, but was rebuilt in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The first mention of Celje in the Middle Ages was under the name of ''Cylie'' in [[Wolfhold von Admont]]'s Chronicle, which was written between 1122 and 1137. The town was the seat of the [[Counts of Celje]] from 1341 to 1456 It acquired market-town status in the first half of the 14th century and [[town privileges]] from Count [[Frederick II of Celje|Frederick&amp;nbsp;II]] on 11&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1451.

[[File:017 Celje, Cilli Kreisstadt - J.F.Kaiser Lithografirte Ansichten der Steiermark 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Celje, 1830 - Lith. Kaiser, Graz]]
After the Counts of Celje died out in 1456, the region was inherited by the [[Habsburg]]s of [[Austria]] and administered by the [[Duchy of Styria]]. The [[city wall]]s and defensive [[moat]] were built in 1473. The town defended itself against [[Turkish people|Turks]] and in 1515 during great [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515|Slovene peasant revolt]] against peasants, who had taken [[Celje Castle|Old Castle]].

Many local nobles converted to [[Protestantism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]], but the region was converted back to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Celje became part of the Habsburgs' [[Austrian Empire]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1867, after the defeat of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the town became part of [[Austria-Hungary]].

===19th century===
The first [[train|service]] on the [[Vienna]]-[[Trieste]] [[Austrian Southern Railway|railway line]] came through Celje on 27 April 1846. In 1895, [[I. high school in Celje|Celje secondary school]], established in 1808, began to teach in [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

At the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, Celje was a center of German [[nationalism]] which had repercussions for [[Slovenes]]. The 1910 census showed that 66.8% of the population was German.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, see ''Geographischer Atlas zur Vaterlandskunde an der österreichischen Mittelschulen''. K. u. k. Hof-Kartographische Anstalt G. Freytag &amp; Berndt, [[Vienna]] 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol of this was the German Cultural Center ({{lang-de|Deutsches Haus}}), built in 1906 and opened on 15 May 1907, today it is [[Celje Hall]] ({{lang-sl|Celjski dom}}). The centuries-old German name of the town, ''Cilli'', sounded no longer German enough to some German residents, the form ''Celle'' being preferred by many.

Population growth was steady during this period. In 1900, Celje had 6,743 inhabitants and by 1924 this had grown to 7,750. The [[National Hall, Celje|National Hall]] (''Narodni dom''), which hosts the Mayors Office and Town Council today, was built in 1896. The first [[telephone]] line was installed in 1902 and the city received [[electricity|electric power]] in 1913.

Slovene and German [[ethnic nationalism]] increased during the 19th and early 20th centuries. With the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 as a result of World War I, Celje became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later known as [[Yugoslavia]]). During this period, the town experienced a rapid industrialization and a substantial growth in population.

===Second World War===
Celje was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] in April 1941. The [[Gestapo]] arrived in Celje on 16 April 1941 and were followed three days later by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leader [[Heinrich Himmler]], who inspected ''Stari pisker'' prison. During the war the city suffered from [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Aerial warfare#World War II|bombing]], aimed at important communication lines and military installations. The [[Celje National Hall|National Hall]] was severely damaged.

The toll of the war on the city was heavy. The city (including nearby towns) had a pre-war population of 20,000 and lost 575 people during the war, mostly between the ages of 20 and 30. More than 1,500 people were deported to [[Serbia]] or into the German interior of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Around 300 people were interned and around 1,000 people imprisoned in Celje's prisons. An unknown number of citizens were forcibly conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht|German army]]. Around 600 &quot;stolen children&quot; were taken to Nazi Germany for [[Germanization]]. A monument in Celje called ''Vojna in mir'' (War and Peace) by the sculptor [[Jakob Savinšek]], commemorates the World War II era.

After the end of the war, the remaining German-speaking portion of the populace was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]]. Anti-tank [[Trench warfare|trenches]] and other sites were used to create 25 [[mass graves in Celje]] and its immediate surroundings and were filled with [[Croatia]]n, Serbian, and Slovenian militia members that had collaborated with the Germans, as well as ethnic German civilians from Celje and surrounding areas.

===Independent Slovenia===
Celje became part of independent Slovenia following the [[Ten-Day War]] in 1991. On 7 April 2006, Celje became the seat of a new [[Diocese of Celje]], created by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] within the [[Archdiocese of Maribor]]. The town's tourist sights include a [[Franciscan|Grayfriars']] monastery founded in 1241&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cilli|volume=6|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[palace]] from the 16th century.

{{short description|Italian opera genre}}
{{italic title}}'''''Opera buffa''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔːpera ˈbufːa|lang}};  &quot;comic opera&quot;, plural: ''opere buffe'') is a genre of [[opera]]. It was first used as an informal description of Italian [[comic opera]]s variously classified by their authors as ''commedia in musica'', ''commedia per musica'', ''dramma bernesco'', ''dramma comico'', ''divertimento giocoso''.

Especially associated with developments in [[Naples]] in the first half of the 18th century, whence its popularity spread to [[Rome]] and [[northern Italy]], ''buffa'' was at first characterized by everyday settings, local dialects, and simple vocal writing (the [[basso buffo]] is the associated voice type), the main requirement being clear diction and facility with [[patter song|patter]].

''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'' considers ''La Cilla'' (music by [[Michelangelo Faggioli]], text by {{ill|Francesco Antonio Tullio|it}}, 1706) and [[Luigi Ricci (composer)|Luigi]] and [[Federico Ricci]]'s'' [[Crispino e la comare]]'' (1850) to be the first and last appearances of the genre, although the term is still occasionally applied to newer work (for example [[Ernst Krenek]]'s ''[[Zeitoper]]'' ''[[Schwergewicht]]''). High points in this history are the 80 or so libretti by Carlindo Grolo, Loran Glodici, Sogol Cardoni&lt;ref name =tenth&gt;Patrick J. Smith: ''The Tenth Muse'' (Schirmer 1970) p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other approximate [[anagram]]s of [[Carlo Goldoni]], the three [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]/[[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]] collaborations, and the comedies of [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti]].

Similar foreign genres such as French ''[[opéra comique]]'', English ''[[ballad opera]]'', Spanish ''[[zarzuela]]'' or German ''[[singspiel]]'' differed as well in having spoken dialogue in place of ''[[recitativo]] secco'', although one of the most influential examples, [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]]'s ''[[La serva padrona]]'' (which is an [[intermezzo]], not ''opera buffa''), sparked the ''[[querelle des bouffons]]'' in Paris as an adaptation without sung [[recitative]]s.

== Opéra bouffon==
[[Opéra bouffon]] is the French term for the Italian genre of opera buffa (comic opera) performed in 18th-century France, either in the original language or in French translation. It was also applied to original French [[opéras comiques]] having Italianate or near-farcical plots.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlet, M Elizabeth C: &quot;Opéra bouffon&quot;  in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. [[Stanley Sadie]] (London, 1992, Volume three, p. 685) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also later used by [[Jacques Offenbach]] for five of his [[operetta]]s (''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', ''[[Le pont des soupirs]]'', ''[[Geneviève de Brabant]]'', ''{{ill|Le roman comique|fr|Le Roman comique (opéra)}}'' and ''Le voyage de MM. Dunanan père et fils''&lt;ref&gt;[[Scores:Le voyage de MM. Dunanan père et fils (Offenbach, Jacques)]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and is sometimes confused with the French [[opéra comique]] and [[opéra bouffe]].&lt;ref&gt;Notably André-Guillaume Contant d'Orville (''Histoire de l'opéra bouffon'', Amsterdam, 1768, [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k81713/f1.image Vol. I] and [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k8172d/f7.image Vol. II])  used the term as a synonym for ''opéra comique'' (Bartlet, cited above).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alessandro Scarlatti.jpg|thumb|[[Alessandro Scarlatti]], one of the first major composers of ''opera buffa'']]
Comic characters had been a part of opera until the early 18th century, when ''opera buffa'' began to emerge as a separate genre, an early precursor having been the operatic comedy, ''[[Il Trespolo tutore]]'', by [[Alessandro Stradella]], in 1679. ''Opera buffa'' was a parallel development to ''[[opera seria]]'', and arose in reaction to the so-called first reform of [[Apostolo Zeno]] and [[Pietro Metastasio]].&lt;ref name=tenth/&gt; It was, in part, intended as a genre that the common man could relate to more easily. Whereas ''opera seria'' was an entertainment that was both made for and depicted kings and nobility, ''opera buffa'' was made for and depicted common people with more common problems. High-flown language was generally avoided in favor of dialogue that the lower class would relate to, often in the local dialect, and the stock characters were often derived from those of the Italian ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''.

In the early 18th century, comic operas often appeared as short, one-act interludes known as [[intermezzo|intermezzi]] that were performed in between acts of opera seria. There also existed, however, self-contained operatic comedies. ''[[La serva padrona]]'' (1733) by [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]] (1710–1736), is the one intermezzo still performed with any regularity today, and provides an excellent example of the style. ''[[Lo frate 'nnamorato]]'' (1732) and ''[[Il Flaminio]]'' (1735), by Pergolesi as well, are examples of the three-act ''commedia per musica''.

Apart from Pergolesi, the first major composers of ''opera buffa'' were [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (''[[Il trionfo dell'onore]]'', 1718), [[Nicola Logroscino]] (''Il governatore'', 1747) and [[Baldassare Galuppi]] (''[[Il filosofo di campagna]]'', 1754), all of them based in [[Naples]] or [[Venice]]. The work of these was then resumed and expanded by [[Niccolò Piccinni]] (''[[La buona figliuola|La Cecchina]]'', 1760), [[Giovanni Paisiello]] (''[[Nina (opera)|Nina]]'', 1789) and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (''[[Il matrimonio segreto]]'', 1792). The genre declined in the mid-19th century, despite [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' staged in 1893.

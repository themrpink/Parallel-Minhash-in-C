The multi-centred heritage site '''[[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]]''' includes 111 individual objects in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Slovenia, of which ten are located in Lombardy. Each of these objects consists of remnants of buildings erected on wooden piles in sub-alpine rivers, lakes and wetlands, built between 5000{{Nbsp|1}}BC and 500{{Nbsp|1}}BC. In general, only the submerged wooden parts have been preserved in the alluvial sediment, although in some places pile buildings have been reconstructed.

Another multi-centred site, '''[[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568–774 A.D.)]]''', comprises seven locations across mainland Italy which illustrate the history of the Lombard period which has given the region its name. Two of the individual sites are in the modern region of Lombardy: the fortifications (the ''castrum'' and the [[Torba Tower]]) and the church of Santa Maria ''foris portas'' (&quot;outside the gates&quot;) with its Byzantinesque frescoes at [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]], and the [[San Salvatore, Brescia|monastic complex of San Salvatore-Santa Giulia]] at Brescia. The UNESCO site of Brescia also includes the [[Brescia#UNESCO World Heritage monuments|remains of its Roman forum]], the best-preserved in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Comunicati/visualizza_asset.html_1468318012.html|title=Italia langobardorum, la rete dei siti Longobardi italiani iscritta nella Lista del Patrimonio Mondiale dell'UNESCO |website=Beniculturali.it |language=Italian |trans-title=Italia langobardorum, the network of the Italian Longobards sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/1318.pdf|title=THE LONGOBARDS IN ITALY.

'''The Church and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Convent of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in Milan with &quot;[[The Last Supper]]&quot; by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]''' represent architectural and painting styles of the Renaissance period of the 15th century. The towns of [[Mantua]] and [[Sabbioneta]] are also listed as a combined World Heritage site relating to this period, here focussing more on town planning aspects of the time than on architectural detail. While Mantua was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries according to Renaissance principles, Sabbioneta was planned as a new town in the 16th century.

The '''[[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]]''' are a group of nine sites in northwest Italy, of which two are in Lombardy. The concept of holy mountains can also be found elsewhere in Europe. These sites were created as centres of pilgrimage by placing chapels in the natural landscape and were loosely modelled on the topography of Jerusalem. In Lombardy, Sacro Monte del Rosario di Varese and Sacro Monte della Beata Vergine del Soccorso, built in the early to mid-17th century, mark the architectural transition from the late Renaissance to the Baroque style.

'''[[Crespi d'Adda]]''' is a [[company town]] founded in 1878 to accommodate workers of a local textile mill. At its height, the town was home to 3,200 employees and their families.

Parco Naturalistico-Archeologico della [[Rocca di Manerba del Garda (Lombardy)|Rocca di Manerba del Garda]], a fortress of Manerba del Garda.

The [[Bernina Railway|'''Rhaetian Railway in the Albula/Bernina Landscapes''']] is mostly located in the Swiss canton [[Graubünden]], but also extends over the border into [[Tirano]]. The site is listed because of the complex railway engineering (tunnels, viaducts and avalanche galleries) necessary to take the narrow-gauge railway across the main chain of the Alps. The two railway lines were opened in several stages between the years of 1904 and 1910.

The '''[[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar]]''' is a transnational system of fortifications built by the [[Republic of Venice]] on its [[Domini di Terraferma|mainland domains]] (''Stato da Terra'') and its territories stretching along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast (''[[Stato da Mar]]''). This site includes the [[Bergamo|Fortified City of Bergamo]].

===Museums===

Lombardy contains numerous museums (over 330) of different types (e.g. ethnographic, historical, technical-scientific, artistic and naturalistic) which testify to the historical-cultural and artistic development of the region. Among the most famous ones are the [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;|National Museum of Science and Technology &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;]] (Milan), the [[Accademia Carrara]] (Bergamo), the [[Mille Miglia#Mille Miglia Museum|Mille Miglia]], the Santa Giulia Museum (both in Brescia), the [[Tempio Voltiano|Volta Temple]], the [[Villa Olmo]] (both in Como), the Stradivari Museum (Cremona), the [[Palazzo Te]] (Mantua), the Museum Sacred Art of the Nativity, the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta (both in [[Gandino]]), and the [[Royal Villa of Monza]] (Monza).

===Cuisine===
{{main|Lombard cuisine}}
[[Rice]] is popular in the region, often found in soups as well as ''[[Risotto|risotti]]'', such as &quot;risotto alla milanese&quot;, with [[saffron]]. In the city of [[Monza]], a popular recipe also adds pieces of sausages to the risotto. [[Polenta]] is also common throughout the region. Regional cheeses include ''[[Robiola]]'', ''[[Crescenza]]'', ''[[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]]'', ''[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]]'' and ''[[Grana Padano]]'' (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). Butter and [[cream]] are used. Single pot dishes, which take less work to prepare, are popular. Common types of pasta include [[Casoncelli]] in [[Brescia]] and [[Bergamo]] and [[Pizzoccheri]] in Valtellina. In [[Mantua]], festivals feature ''tortelli di zucca'' ([[ravioli]] with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by [[turkey meat|turkey]] stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Among typical regional desserts is [[Canzo#Cuisine|Nocciolini di Canzo]]—dry biscuits.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Lombardy|Music of Milan}}
[[File:Architettura La Scala operahouse.jpg|thumb|The auditorium of the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan.]]

Besides Milan, the region of Lombardy has 11 other provinces, most of them with equally great musical traditions. Bergamo is famous for being the birthplace of [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and home of the Teatro Donizetti; Brescia hosts the impressive 1709 Teatro Grande; Cremona is regarded as the birthplace of the commonly used violin and is home to several of the most prestigious [[luthier]]s in the world; and Mantua was one of the founding and most important cities in 16th- and 17th-century opera and classical music.

Other cities such as Lecco, Lodi, Varese and Pavia also have rich musical traditions, but Milan is the hub and centre of the Lombard musical scene. It was the workplace of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], one of the most famous and influential opera composers of the 19th century, and boasts a variety of acclaimed theatres, such as the [[Piccolo Teatro (Milan)|Piccolo Teatro]] and the Teatro Arcimboldi; however, the most famous is the 1778 [[Teatro alla Scala]], one of the most important and prestigious operahouses in the world.

===Language===
{{Main|Lombard language||}}
[[Lombard language|Lombard]] is widely used in Lombardy, in [[diglossia]] with Italian. Lombard is a language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=LMO|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: LMO|website=|quote=Identifier: LMO / Name: Lombard / Status: Active / Code set: 639-3 / Scope: Individual / Type: Living}}&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the [[Gallo-Italic]] group, within the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-ZBCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=lombard+cluster+of+homogeneous&amp;pg=PA130|title=Policy and Planning for Endangered Languages|last1=Jones|first1=Mary C.|last2=Soria|first2=Claudia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9781316352410|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=130|chapter=Assessing the effect of official recognition on the vitality of endangered languages: a case of study from Italy|quote=Lombard (Lumbard, ISO 639-9 lmo) is a cluster of essentially homogeneous varieties (Tamburelli 2014: 9) belonging to the Gallo-Italic group. It is spoken in the Italian region of Lombardy, in the Novara province of Piedmont, and in Switzerland. Mutual intelligibility between speakers of Lombard and monolingual Italian speakers has been reported as very low (Tamburelli 2014). Although some Lombard varieties, Milanese in particular, enjoy a rather long and prestigious literary tradition, Lombard is now mostly used in informal domains.  According to Ethnologue, Piedmontese and Lombard are spoken by between 1,600,000 and 2,000,000 speakers and around 3,500,000 speakers, respectively. These are very high figures for languages that have never been recognised officially nor systematically taught in school}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Dialect#Dialect and language clusters|cluster of homogeneous varieties]] used by at least 3,500,000 native speakers in Lombardy and some areas of neighbouring regions, notably the eastern side of [[Piedmont]] and Southern [[Switzerland]] (cantons of [[Ticino]] and [[Graubünden]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The Lombard language should not be confused with that of the [[Lombards]] – [[Lombardic language]], a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] extinct since the Middle Ages.

===Fashion===
{{Main|Fashion in Milan}}
[[File:Dolce &amp; Gabbana (8184624219).jpg|thumb|right|[[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] is headquartered in [[Milan]].]]
Lombardy has always been an important centre for silk and textile production, notably the cities of [[Pavia]], [[Vigevano]] and [[Cremona]], but [[Milan]] is the region's most important centre for clothing and high fashion. In 2009, Milan was regarded as the world [[fashion capital]], even surpassing New York, Paris and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;languagemonitor.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor &quot; Fashion |website=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101191133/http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |archivedate=1 November 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the major [[Italian fashion]] brands, such as [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Versace]], [[Prada]], [[Armani]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], are currently headquartered in the city.

==Sports==
The most famous sport in Lombardy, as in all Italy, is football. In fact, Lombardy is home to some of the most important football teams in the country. Considering the [[2020–21 Serie A|2020-21 Serie A]] season, Lombardy hosts 3 out of 20 teams: [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]] (both based in Milan) and [[Atalanta B.C.]] (based in Bergamo). Other big teams of the region are [[Brescia Calcio]], [[A.C. Monza]] and [[U.S. Cremonese]] (playing in the [[2020–21 Serie B|2020-21 Serie B]]) and [[Calcio Lecco 1912]], [[U.C.

Pro Sesto]] and [[U.S. Pergolettese 1932]] (playing in the [[2020–21 Serie C|2020-21 Serie C]]).

The region's city [[Milan]] will host the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] alongside [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]].
The [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza]], located outside of Milan, hosts the Formula One [[Italian Grand Prix]].

'''George Mortimer Pullman''' (March 3, 1831 – October 19, 1897) was an American engineer and industrialist. He designed and manufactured the [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] [[sleeping car]] and founded a [[company town]], [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]], for the workers who manufactured it. His Pullman Company also hired African-American men to staff the Pullman cars, who became known as Pullman porters, providing elite service.

Struggling to maintain profitability during an 1894 downturn in manufacturing demand, he halved wages and required workers to spend long hours at the plant, but did not lower prices of rents and goods in his company town. He gained presidential support by [[Grover Cleveland]] for the use of federal military troops which left 30 strikers dead in the violent suppression of workers there to end the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. A national commission was appointed to investigate the strike, which included assessment of operations of the company town. In 1898 the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] ordered the Pullman Company to divest itself of the town, which became a neighborhood of the city of Chicago.

==Early life==
Pullman was born in 1831 in [[Brocton, New York]], the son of Emily Caroline (Minton) and carpenter James Lewis Pullman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pullman-museum.org/theMan/&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Albion (village), New York|Albion, New York]], along the [[Erie Canal]] in 1845, so his father could help widen the canal. His father had invented a machine using jackscrews that could move buildings or other structures out of the way and onto new foundations and had patented it in 1841. By that time, [[packet boats]] carried people on day excursions along the canal, plus travellers and freight craft would be towed across the state along the busy canal.

Pullman attended local schools and helped his father, learning other skills that contributed to his later success. He dropped out of school. In 1855 his father died.

== Career ==
Pullman was a clerk for a country merchant.
Pullman took over the family business. In 1856, Pullman won a contract with the State of New York to move 20 buildings out of the way of the widening canal.

=== Chicago ===
In 1857, as a young engineer, Pullman arrived in Chicago, Illinois as the city prepared to build the nation's first comprehensive sewer system. 
Pullman formed a partnership known as Ely, Smith &amp; Pullman. Chicago was built on a low-lying bog, and people described the mud in the streets as deep enough to drown a horse.&lt;ref&gt;A common expression describing a need for drainage [https://books.google.com/books?id=F77GcWagSLQC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=chicago++%22drown+a+horse%22+-%22arrived+-in+-chicago%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qeCtXg6NP7&amp;sig=7qkCOevblDOq7mgyeN6RHCzK3gQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ldsCSr-VNJqxtgf70tmVBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA13,M1 as applied in Brooklyn].&lt;/ref&gt; The growing city needed a sewer system, and Pullman's became one of several companies hired to lift multi-story buildings four to six feet—to both allow sewers to be constructed and to improve the foundations. The project would involve effectively raising the street level 6–8 feet, first constructing the sewers at ground level, then covering them.&lt;ref&gt;Randall J. Soland, Utopian Communities of Illinois: Heaven on the Prairie (History Press 2017) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The Ely, Smith &amp; Pullman partnership gained favorable publicity for  [[Raising of Chicago|raising]] the massive [[Tremont House (Chicago)|Tremont House]], a six-story brick hotel, while the guests remained inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nike-of-samothrace.net/csc.html#y1861_m01_d22 ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' January 22, 1861] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507042514/http://www.nike-of-samothrace.net/csc.html#y1861_m01_d22 |date=May 7, 2013 }}. nike-of-samothrace.net.

=== Pullman sleeping car ===
[[File:Pullman's Palace Car Comp 1892.JPG|thumb|Share of the Pullman's Palace Car Company, issued 20. April 1892, made out to George M. Pullman]]

Pullman developed a railroad [[sleeping car]], the Pullman sleeper or &quot;palace car.&quot; These were designed after the packet boats that travelled the [[Erie Canal]] of his youth in Albion. The first one was finished in 1864.

After President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was assassinated, Pullman arranged to have his body carried from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] on a sleeper, for which he gained national attention, as hundreds of thousands of people lined the route in homage.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lincoln's body was carried on the [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln|Presidential train car that]] Lincoln himself had commissioned that year. Pullman had cars in the train, notably for the President's surviving family. The pullman had a wider wheel set, requiring wider track. And as a result of the many people seeing the Palace car, it became sought after and resulted in a major change to all rail track widths. Orders for his new car began to pour into his company. The sleeping cars proved successful although each cost more than five times the price of a regular railway car. They were marketed as &quot;luxury for the middle class.&quot;

In 1867 Pullman introduced his first &quot;hotel on wheels,&quot; the ''President'', a sleeper with an attached kitchen and dining car. The food rivaled the best restaurants of the day and the service was impeccable. A year later in 1868, he launched the ''Delmonico'', the world's first sleeping car devoted to fine cuisine. The ''Delmonico'' menu was prepared by chefs from New York's famed [[Delmonico's Restaurant]].

Both the ''President'' and the ''Delmonico'' and subsequent Pullman sleeping cars offered first-rate service. The company hired [[African-American]] [[freedmen]] as Pullman porters. Many of the men had been former domestic slaves in the South. Their new roles required them to act as porters, waiters, valets, and entertainers, all rolled into one person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Tye |url=http://aliciapatterson.org/stories/choosing-servility-staff-americas-trains |title=Choosing Servility To Staff America's Trains &amp;#124; Alicia Patterson Foundation |publisher=Aliciapatterson.org |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they were paid relatively well and got to travel the country, the position became considered prestigious, and Pullman porters were respected in the black communities.

Pullman believed that if his sleeper cars were to be successful, he needed to provide a wide variety of services to travelers: collecting tickets, selling berths, dispatching wires, fetching sandwiches, mending torn trousers, converting day coaches into sleepers, etc. Pullman believed that former house slaves of the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] South had the right combination of training to serve the businessmen who would patronize his &quot;Palace Cars.&quot; Pullman became the biggest single employer of African Americans in post-Civil War America.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

In 1869 Pullman bought out the Detroit Car and Manufacturing Company. Pullman bought the patents and business of his eastern competitor, the Central Transportation Company in 1870. In the spring of 1871, Pullman, [[Andrew Carnegie]], and others bailed out the financially troubled Union Pacific; they took positions on its board of directors. By 1875 the Pullman firm owned $100,000 worth of patents, had 700 cars in operation, and had several hundred thousand dollars in the bank.

In 1887, Pullman designed and established the system of &quot;[[vestibuled train]]s,&quot; with cars linked by covered gangways instead of open platforms. The [[Gangway connection|vestibules]] were first put in service on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] trunk lines.&lt;ref name=appletons&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Pullman, George Mortimer|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French social scientist [[Paul de Rousiers]] (1857–1934), who visited Chicago in 1890, wrote of Pullman's manufacturing complex, &quot;Everything is done in order and with precision. One feels that some brain of superior intelligence, backed by a long technical experience, has thought out every possible detail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=235 |last=Miller|first=Donald L.|title=City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TNXWkIf0wC&amp;pg=PA235 |accessdate=2017-07-09|date=1997-04-03|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83138-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Pullman bought {{convert|4000|acre|km2}}, near [[Lake Calumet]] some {{convert|14|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of Chicago, on the [[Illinois Central]] Railroad for $800,000. 
Pullman hired [[Solon Spencer Beman]] to design his new plant there. Trying to solve the issue of labor unrest and poverty, he also built a company town adjacent to his factory; it featured housing, shopping areas, churches, theaters, parks, hotel and library for his factory employees. The 1300 original structures were entirely designed by [[Cleveland Spencer Beman]]. The centerpiece of the complex was the Administration Building and a man-made lake. The [[Hotel Florence]], named for Pullman's daughter, was built nearby.

Pullman believed that the country air and fine facilities, without agitators, saloons and city vice districts, would result in a happy, loyal workforce. The model planned community became a leading attraction for visitors who attended the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893. It attracted nationwide attention. The national press praised Pullman for his benevolence and vision. According to mortality statistics, it was one of the most healthful places in the world.&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt;

The industrialist still expected the town to make money as an enterprise. By 1892 the community, profitable in its own right, was valued at over $5 million. Pullman ruled the town like a feudal baron. Pullman prohibited independent newspapers, public speeches, town meetings or open discussion. His inspectors regularly entered homes to inspect for cleanliness and could terminate workers' leases on ten days' notice. The church stood empty since no approved denomination would pay rent, and no other congregation was allowed. He prohibited private charitable organizations. In 1885 Richard Ely wrote in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' that the power exercised by [[Otto Von Bismarck]] (known as the unifier of modern [[Germany]]), was &quot;utterly insignificant when compared with the ruling authority of the Pullman Palace Car Company in Pullman.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/pullpar.htm |title=&quot;The Parable of Pullman&quot; |accessdate=2011-08-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513231452/http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/pullpar.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}, ''Kent Law Journal'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pullman community is a historic district that has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

===Pullman strike===
{{main|Pullman strike}}
In 1894, when manufacturing demand fell off, Pullman cut jobs and wages and increased working hours in his plant to lower costs and keep profits, but he did not lower rents or prices in the company town. The workers eventually launched a strike. When violence broke out, he gained the support of President [[Grover Cleveland]] for the use of United States troops. Cleveland sent in the troops, who harshly suppressed the strike in action that caused many injuries, over the objections of the Illinois governor, [[John Altgeld]].

In the winter of 1893–4, at the start of a depression, Pullman decided to cut wages by 30%. This was not unusual in the age of the robber barons, but he didn't reduce the rent in Pullman, because he had guaranteed his investors a 6% return on their investments in the town. A workman might make $9.07 in a fortnight, and the rent of $9 would be taken directly out of his paycheck, leaving him with just 7 cents to feed his family. One worker later testified: &quot;I have seen men with families of eight or nine children crying because they got only three or four cents after paying their rent.&quot; Another described conditions as &quot;slavery worse than that of Negroes of the South.&quot;

      <text bytes="46616" xml:space="preserve">A '''wavelet''' is a [[wave]]-like [[oscillation]] with an [[amplitude]] that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a &quot;brief oscillation&quot; like one recorded by a [[seismograph]] or [[heart monitor]]. Generally, wavelets are intentionally crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for [[signal processing]]. Using [[convolution]], wavelets can be combined with known portions of a damaged signal to extract information from the unknown portions.
[[File:Seismic Wavelet.jpg|thumb|Seismic wavelet]]
For example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of [[Middle C]] and a short duration of roughly a [[32nd note]]. If this wavelet were to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a melody, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the wavelet will correlate with the signal if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency. This concept of [[correlation]] is at the core of many practical applications of wavelet theory.

As a mathematical tool, wavelets can be used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including – but not limited to – [[audio signal]]s and images. Sets of wavelets are generally needed to analyze data fully. A set of &quot;complementary&quot; wavelets will decompose data without gaps or overlap so that the decomposition process is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of complementary wavelets are useful in [[Wavelet compression|wavelet based compression]]/decompression algorithms where it is desirable to recover the original information with minimal loss.

In formal terms, this representation is a [[wavelet series]] representation of a [[square-integrable function]] with respect to either a [[Complete orthogonal system#Incomplete orthogonal sets|complete]], [[orthonormal]] set of [[basis function]]s, or an [[Complete orthogonal system#Incomplete orthogonal sets|overcomplete]] set or [[frame of a vector space]], for the [[Hilbert space]] of square integrable functions. This is accomplished through [[Coherent states in mathematical physics#The group-theoretical approach|coherent states]].

== Wavelet theory ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of [[time-frequency representation]] for [[continuous-time]] (analog) signals and so are related to [[harmonic analysis]]. Discrete wavelet transform (continuous in time) of a [[discrete-time]] (sampled) signal by using [[discrete-time]] [[filterbank]]s of dyadic (octave band) configuration is a wavelet approximation to that signal. The coefficients of such a filter bank are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) or [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a [[continuous wavelet transform]] (CWT) are subject to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]] of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the [[scaleogram]] of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Yves (1992), Wavelets and Operators, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chui, Charles K. (1992), An Introduction to Wavelets, San Diego, CA: Academic Press, {{ISBN|0-12-174584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daubechies, Ingrid. (1992), Ten Lectures on Wavelets, SIAM, {{ISBN|978-0-89871-274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akansu, Ali N.; Haddad, Richard A. (1992), Multiresolution Signal Decomposition: Transforms, Subbands, and Wavelets, Boston, MA: Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0-12-047141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wavelet transforms are broadly divided into three classes: continuous, discrete and multiresolution-based.

=== Continuous wavelet transforms (continuous shift and scale parameters) ===
In [[continuous wavelet transform]]s, a given signal of finite energy is projected on a continuous family of frequency bands (or similar subspaces of the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'']] [[function space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''') ). For instance the signal may be represented on every frequency band of the form [''f'', 2''f''] for all positive frequencies ''f'' &gt; 0. Then, the original signal can be reconstructed by a suitable integration over all the resulting frequency components.

The frequency bands or subspaces (sub-bands) are scaled versions of a subspace at scale 1. This subspace in turn is in most situations generated by the shifts of one generating function ψ in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), the ''mother wavelet''. For the example of the scale one frequency band [1, 2] this function is
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(t)=2\,\operatorname{sinc}(2t)-\,\operatorname{sinc}(t)=\frac{\sin(2\pi t)-\sin(\pi t)}{\pi t}&lt;/math&gt;
with the (normalized) [[sinc function]]. That, Meyer's, and two other examples of mother wavelets are:

| [[File:MexicanHatMathematica.svg|thumb|360px|[[Mexican hat wavelet|Mexican hat]]]]
|}

The subspace of scale ''a'' or frequency band [1/''a'', 2/''a''] is generated by the functions (sometimes called ''child wavelets'')
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{a,b} (t) = \frac1{\sqrt a }\psi \left( \frac{t - b}{a} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is positive and defines the scale and ''b'' is any real number and defines the shift. The pair (''a'', ''b'') defines a point in the right halfplane '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; × '''R'''.

The projection of a function ''x'' onto the subspace of scale ''a'' then has the form
:&lt;math&gt;x_a(t)=\int_\R WT_\psi\{x\}(a,b)\cdot\psi_{a,b}(t)\,db&lt;/math&gt;
with ''wavelet coefficients''
:&lt;math&gt;WT_\psi\{x\}(a,b)=\langle x,\psi_{a,b}\rangle=\int_\R x(t){\psi_{a,b}(t)}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

For the analysis of the signal ''x'', one can assemble the wavelet coefficients into a [[scaleogram]] of the signal.

See a list of some [[Continuous wavelets]].

=== Discrete wavelet transforms (discrete shift and scale parameters, continuous in time) ===
It is computationally impossible to analyze a signal using all wavelet coefficients, so one may wonder if it is sufficient to pick a discrete subset of the upper halfplane to be able to reconstruct a signal from the corresponding wavelet coefficients. One such system is the [[wikt:affine|affine]] system for some real parameters ''a'' &gt; 1, ''b'' &gt; 0. The corresponding discrete subset of the halfplane consists of all the points (''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''na&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;b'') with ''m'', ''n'' in '''Z'''. The corresponding ''child wavelets'' are now given as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{m,n}(t) = \frac1{\sqrt{a^m}}\psi\left(\frac{t - nb}{a^m}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A sufficient condition for the reconstruction of any signal ''x'' of finite energy by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; x(t)=\sum_{m\in\Z}\sum_{n\in\Z}\langle x,\,\psi_{m,n}\rangle\cdot\psi_{m,n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
is that the functions &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_{m,n}:m,n\in\Z\}&lt;/math&gt; form an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''').

=== Multiresolution based discrete wavelet transforms (continuous in time)===

[[Image:Daubechies4-functions.svg|thumb|right|D4 wavelet]]
In any discretised wavelet transform, there are only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a [[multiresolution analysis]]. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the ''father wavelet'' φ in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''), and that ''a'' is an integer. A typical choice is ''a'' = 2 and ''b'' = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the [[Daubechies wavelets|Daubechies]] 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=David R. |year=2007 |title= Wavelet Analysis and Applications (See: Unitary systems and wavelet sets) |series = Appl. Numer. Harmon. Anal. |publisher=Birkhäuser |pages=143–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mother and father wavelets one constructs the subspaces
:&lt;math&gt;V_m=\operatorname{span}(\phi_{m,n}:n\in\Z),\text{ where }\phi_{m,n}(t)=2^{-m/2}\phi(2^{-m}t-n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W_m=\operatorname{span}(\psi_{m,n}:n\in\Z),\text{ where }\psi_{m,n}(t)=2^{-m/2}\psi(2^{-m}t-n).&lt;/math&gt;
The father wavelet &lt;math&gt;V_{i}&lt;/math&gt; keeps the time domain properties, while the mother wavelets &lt;math&gt;W_{i}&lt;/math&gt; keeps the frequency domain properties.

From these it is required that the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;\{0\}\subset\dots\subset V_{1}\subset V_{0}\subset V_{-1}\subset V_{-2}\subset\dots\subset L^2(\R)&lt;/math&gt;
forms a [[multiresolution analysis]] of ''L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and that the subspaces &lt;math&gt;\dots,W_1,W_0,W_{-1},\dots\dots&lt;/math&gt; are the orthogonal &quot;differences&quot; of the above sequence, that is, ''W&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the orthogonal complement of ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' inside the subspace ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;V_m\oplus W_m=V_{m-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In analogy to the [[sampling theorem]] one may conclude that the space ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' with sampling distance 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; more or less covers the frequency baseband from 0 to 2&lt;sup&gt;−''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt;. As orthogonal complement, ''W&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' roughly covers the band [2&lt;sup&gt;−''m''−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;−''m''&lt;/sup&gt;].

From those inclusions and orthogonality relations, especially &lt;math&gt;V_0\oplus W_0=V_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, follows the existence of sequences &lt;math&gt;h=\{h_n\}_{n\in\Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g=\{g_n\}_{n\in\Z}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the identities
:&lt;math&gt;g_n=\langle\phi_{0,0},\,\phi_{-1,n}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)=\sqrt2 \sum_{n\in\Z} g_n\phi(2t-n),&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;h_n=\langle\psi_{0,0},\,\phi_{-1,n}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\psi(t)=\sqrt2 \sum_{n\in\Z} h_n\phi(2t-n).&lt;/math&gt;
The second identity of the first pair is a [[Refinable function|refinement equation]] for the father wavelet φ. Both pairs of identities form the basis for the algorithm of the [[fast wavelet transform]].

From the multiresolution analysis derives the orthogonal decomposition of the space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;L^2=V_{j_0}\oplus W_{j_0}\oplus W_{j_0-1}\oplus W_{j_0-2}\oplus W_{j_0-3}\oplus\dots&lt;/math&gt;
For any signal or function &lt;math&gt;S\in L^2&lt;/math&gt; this gives a representation in basis functions of the corresponding subspaces as
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{k} c_{j_0,k}\phi_{j_0,k} + \sum_{j\le j_0}\sum_{k} d_{j,k}\psi_{j,k}&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients are
:&lt;math&gt;c_{j_0,k} = \langle S,\phi_{j_0,k}\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;d_{j,k} = \langle S,\psi_{j,k}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

== Mother wavelet ==
For practical applications, and for efficiency reasons, one prefers continuously differentiable functions with compact support as mother (prototype) wavelet (functions). However, to satisfy analytical requirements (in the continuous WT) and in general for theoretical reasons, one chooses the wavelet functions from a subspace of the [[Lp space|space]] &lt;math&gt;L^1(\R)\cap L^2(\R).&lt;/math&gt; This is the space of [[Lebesgue integration|measurable functions]] that are (in absolute value) square [[integrable function|integrable]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|\, dt &lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|^2 \, dt &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Being in this space ensures that one can formulate the conditions of zero mean and square norm one:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi (t)\, dt = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the condition for zero mean, and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|^2\, dt = 1&lt;/math&gt; is the condition for square norm one.

For ψ to be a wavelet for the [[continuous wavelet transform]] (see there for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, a kind of half-differentiability) in order to get a stably invertible transform.

For the [[discrete wavelet transform]], one needs at least the condition that the [[wavelet series]] is a representation of the identity in the [[Lp space|space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''). Most constructions of discrete WT make use of the [[multiresolution analysis]], which defines the wavelet by a scaling function. This scaling function itself is a solution to a functional equation.

In most situations it is useful to restrict ψ to be a continuous function with a higher number ''M'' of vanishing moments, i.e. for all integer ''m'' &lt; ''M''
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} t^m\,\psi (t)\, dt = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The mother wavelet is scaled (or dilated) by a factor of ''a'' and translated (or shifted) by a factor of ''b'' to give (under Morlet's original formulation):

:&lt;math&gt;\psi _{a,b} (t) = {1 \over \sqrt a}\psi \left( {t - b \over a} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

For the continuous WT, the pair (''a'',''b'') varies over the full half-plane '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; × '''R'''; for the discrete WT this pair varies over a discrete subset of it, which is also called ''affine group''.

These functions are often incorrectly referred to as the basis functions of the (continuous) transform. In fact, as in the continuous Fourier transform, there is no basis in the continuous wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat).

Restriction：

(1) &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi_{a1,b1}(t)\varphi\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) \, dt&lt;/math&gt; when a1 = a and b1 = b,

(2) &lt;math&gt;\Psi (t)&lt;/math&gt; has a finite time interval

== Comparisons with Fourier transform (continuous-time) ==
The wavelet transform is often compared with the [[Fourier transform]], in which signals are represented as a sum of sinusoids. In fact, the [[Fourier transform]] can be viewed as a special case of the continuous wavelet transform with the choice of the mother wavelet
&lt;math&gt;\psi (t) = e^{-2 \pi i t}&lt;/math&gt;.
The main difference in general is that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard [[Fourier transform]] is only localized in [[frequency]]. The [[Short-time Fourier transform]] (STFT) is similar to the wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off.

In particular, assuming a rectangular window region, one may think of the STFT as a transform with a slightly different kernel

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (t) = g(t-u) e^{-2 \pi i t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g(t-u)&lt;/math&gt; can often be written as &lt;math&gt;\rm{rect}\left(\frac{t-u}{\Delta_t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_t&lt;/math&gt; and u respectively denote the length and temporal offset of the windowing function. Using [[Parseval's theorem]], one may define the wavelet's energy as
:&lt;math&gt;
E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi (t)|^2\, dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\hat{\psi}(\omega)|^2 \, d\omega
&lt;/math&gt;
From this, the square of the temporal support of the window offset by time u is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_t^2 = \frac{1}{E}\int |t-u|^2|\psi(t)|^2 \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

and the square of the spectral support of the window acting on a frequency &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;

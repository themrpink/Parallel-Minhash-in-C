*''kuä´tted vuâstta'': against a ''kota''

This can be replaced with ''kuä´đ vuâstta''.

3. It can be used with the [[comparative]] to express that which is being compared:

* ''Kå´lled pue´rab'' : better than gold

This would nowadays more than likely be replaced by ''pue´rab ko kå´ll''

==Russian==

The [[Russian language]] usually uses the [[genitive case]] to express partialness. However, some Russian [[mass noun]]s have developed a distinct partitive case, also referred to as the &quot;second genitive case&quot;. The partitive arose from the merger of the declensions of ''*-ŏ'' and ''*-ŭ'' stem nouns in [[Old East Slavic]], which left the former ''*-ŭ'' stem genitive suffix available for a specialized use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivanov|first1=V. V.|script-title=ru:Историческая грамматика русского языка|title=Istoricheskaya grammatika russkogo yazyka|date=1990|publisher=Prosveshcheniye|location=Moscow|isbn=5-09-000910-4|page=256|edition=3rd|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Russian, use of the partitive case is often facultative. In many situations, the partitive and the genitive can be used almost synonymously: {{lang|ru|чашка ча'''ю'''}}, ''{{transl|ru|cháshka chá'''yu'''}}'' (partitive) and {{lang|ru|чашка ча'''я'''}} ''{{transl|ru|cháshka chá'''ya'''}}'' (genitive) both mean &quot;a cup of tea&quot;; {{lang|ru|много дым'''у'''}}, ''{{transl|ru|mnógo dým'''u'''}}'' (partitive) and {{lang|ru|много дым'''а'''}} ''{{transl|ru|mnógo dým'''a'''}}'' (genitive) both mean &quot;lots of smoke&quot;. The partitive variant is preferred with verbs: {{lang|ru|выпить ча'''ю'''}}, ''{{transl|ru|výpit' chá'''yu'''}}'', &quot;to have a drink of tea&quot;. The genitive variant is used more frequently when the mass noun is modified by an adjective: {{lang|ru|чашка горячего ча'''я'''}} ''{{transl|ru|cháshka goryáchevo chá'''ya'''}}'', &quot;a cup of hot tea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rozental|first1=D.

In [[grammar]], the '''absolutive case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''abs'''}}) is the case of nouns in [[ergative–absolutive language]]s that would generally be the subjects of [[intransitive verb]]s or the objects of [[transitive verb]]s in the translational equivalents of [[nominative–accusative language]]s such as [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Absolutive case definition at SIL Glossary of Linguistic Terms|url=https://glossary.sil.org/term/absolutive-case|website=SIL International|accessdate=June 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ergative–absolutive languages==
In [[ergative–absolutive language]]s, the absolutive is the case used to mark both the subject of an [[intransitive verb]] and the object of a [[transitive verb]] in addition to being used for the citation form of a noun. It contrasts with the marked [[ergative case]], which marks the subject of a transitive verb.

For example, in [[Basque language|Basque]] the noun ''mutil'' (&quot;boy&quot;) takes the bare singular [[article (grammar)|article]] ''-a'' both as the subject of the intransitive clause ''mutila etorri da'' (&quot;the boy came&quot;) and as the object of the transitive clause ''Irakasleak mutila ikusi du'' (&quot;the teacher has seen the boy&quot;) in which the subject bears the ergative ending ''-a-k''.

In very few cases, a marked absolutive has been reported, including in [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Sochiapam Chinantec]].

==In marked nominative languages==
In [[marked nominative]] languages, the nominative has a case inflection, and it is the accusative and citation form that are unmarked. The unmarked accusative/citation form may be called absolutive to clarify that the citation form is used for the accusative case role rather than for the nominative, as it is in most nominative–accusative languages.

==In tripartite languages==
In [[tripartite language]]s, both the agent and object of a transitive clause have case forms, ergative and accusative, and the agent of an intransitive clause is the unmarked citation form. It is occasionally called the [[intransitive case]], but ''absolutive'' is also used and is perhaps more accurate since it is not limited to core agents of intransitive verbs.

==In nominative–accusative languages==
In [[nominative–accusative language]]s, both core cases may be marked, but often, it is only the accusative that is marked. In such situations, the term 'absolutive' could aptly describe the nominative, but the term is seldom used that way.

'''''The Bridge on the River Kwai''''' is a 1957 [[epic film|epic]] [[war film]] directed by [[David Lean]] and based on the [[The Bridge over the River Kwai|1952 novel]] written by [[Pierre Boulle]]. The film uses the historical setting of the construction of the [[Burma Railway]] in 1942–1943. The cast includes 
[[Alec Guinness]], [[William Holden]], [[Jack Hawkins]], and [[Sessue Hayakawa]].

It was initially scripted by screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], who was later replaced by [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]]. Both writers had to work in secret, as they were on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] and had fled to the UK in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oscars Go to Writers of 'Kwai' |author=Aljean Harmetz |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=16 March 1985 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/16/movies/oscars-go-to-writers-for-kwai.html |accessdate=14 March 2019 |author-link=Aljean Harmetz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bridge on the River Kwai'' was [[1957 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1957]] and received overwhemingly positive reviews from critics. The film won seven [[Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]) at the [[30th Academy Awards]]. In 1997, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New to the National Film Registry (December 1997) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9712/nfr.html|access-date=2020-09-18|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been included on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of best American films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;On the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] lists, in 1998 (#13) and 2007 (#36)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_first100 |title=Great Movies: The First 100 |author=Roger Ebert |accessdate=25 February 2013|author-link=Roger Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] voted ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|11th greatest British film of the 20th century]].

==Plot==
In early 1943, British [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] arrive at a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] prison camp in [[Burma]]. The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a railway bridge over the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Conventions]] exempts officers from manual labour. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because they were ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders.

At the morning assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men march off to work. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.

Three prisoners escape. Two are shot dead, but [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant Commander Shears gets away. He wanders half-dead into a Siamese village, where he is nursed back to health before completing his escape to the British colony of Ceylon.

The prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage what they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit [[seppuku|ritual suicide]]. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's 1905 victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour.

Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves and Major Hughes to build a proper bridge, in order to maintain his men's morale and pride in their professionalism. As the Japanese engineers chose a poor site, a new bridge is begun downstream.

Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a [[British Commando|commando]] mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears is so appalled at going back he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy had agreed to transfer him to the British Army, along with Shears receiving a [[commissioned officer|commission]] of major, to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears &quot;volunteers&quot;.

Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. For him, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the [[British Army]]. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts pitch in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he already gave the order. Nicholson erects a sign commemorating the bridge's construction by the British Army.

The four commandos parachute in, though one is killed on landing. Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers.

A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, so Warden waits to destroy both. By daybreak the river level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate.

Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, &quot;What have I done?&quot; Warden fires a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], wounding Nicholson. The dazed colonel stumbles towards the detonator and collapses on the plunger, blowing up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head, muttering, &quot;Madness!&amp;nbsp;... Madness!&quot;

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The screenwriters, [[Carl Foreman]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], were on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] and, even though living in exile in England, could only work on the film in secret. The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman's work. The official [[credit (creative arts)|credit]] was given to [[Pierre Boulle]] (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 17 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising &quot;what have I done?&quot;) does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax.&lt;ref name=1974ref&gt;Joyaux, Georges.

The film was an [[international co-production]] between companies in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monaco, Paul|title=A History of American Movies: A Film-by-film Look at the Art, Craft, and Business of Cinema

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director David Lean clashed with his cast members on multiple occasions, particularly Alec Guinness and James Donald, who thought the novel was anti-British. Lean had a lengthy row with Guinness over how to play the role of Nicholson; Guinness wanted to play the part with a sense of humour and sympathy, while Lean thought Nicholson should be &quot;a bore.&quot; On another occasion, they argued over the scene where Nicholson reflects on his career in the army. Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and exploded in anger when Guinness asked him why he was doing this. After Guinness was done with the scene, Lean said, &quot;Now you can all fuck off and go home, you English actors. Thank God that I'm starting work tomorrow with an American actor (William Holden).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Piers Paul Read, ''Alec Guinness'', 293)&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was made in [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). The bridge in the film was near [[Kitulgala]].

Guinness later said that he subconsciously based his walk while emerging from &quot;the Oven&quot; on that of his eleven-year-old son [[Matthew Guinness|Matthew]],&lt;ref name=GuinnessWalkscene&gt;Jason, Gary.

Lean nearly drowned when he was swept away by the river current during a break from filming.&lt;ref name=PurbeckFestival&gt;[http://www.purbeckfilm.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=672:the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai&amp;catid=24:film-notes&amp;Itemid=86 &quot;''The Bridge on the River Kwai''(disasters on the film set)&quot;], ''Purbeck Film Festival'', published 08-24-2014. Retrieved 09-24-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 interview with Barry Norman, Lean confirmed that Columbia almost stopped filming after three weeks because there was no white woman in the film, forcing him to add what he calls, &quot;a very terrible scene&quot; between William Holden and the nurse on the beach.

The filming of the bridge explosion was to be done on 10 March 1957, in the presence of [[Solomon Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]], then [[Prime Minister of Ceylon]], and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming. The train crashed into a generator on the other side of the bridge and was wrecked. It was repaired in time to be blown up the next morning, with Bandaranaike and his entourage present.&lt;ref name=PurbeckFestival/&gt;

The producers nearly suffered a catastrophe following the filming of the bridge explosion. To ensure they captured the one-time event, multiple cameras from several angles were used. Ordinarily, the film would have been taken by boat to London, but due to the [[Suez crisis]] this was impossible; therefore the film was taken by air freight. When the shipment failed to arrive in London, a worldwide search was undertaken. To the producers' horror, the film containers were found a week later on an [[Cairo International Airport|airport]] tarmac in [[Cairo]], sitting in the hot sun. Although it was not exposed to sunlight, the heat-sensitive colour film stock should have been hopelessly ruined; however, when processed the shots were perfect and appeared in the film.&lt;ref name=GoldsteinC&gt;Goldstein, Carly.

He described the music for ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' as the &quot;worst job I ever had in my life&quot; from the point of view of time. Despite this, he won an Oscar and a Grammy.

A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the first strain of the march &quot;[[Colonel Bogey]]&quot;—when they enter the camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516125503/http://www.ulujain.org/media/colonelbogeymarch.mid The Colonel Bogey March MIDI file]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gavin Young]]&lt;ref&gt;In his 1981 book ''Slow Boats to China'', chapter 39, {{ISBN|978-0571251032}}&lt;/ref&gt; recounts meeting Donald Wise, a former prisoner of the Japanese who had worked on the [[Burma Railway]]. Young: &quot;Donald, did anyone whistle ''Colonel Bogey'' ... as they did in the film?&quot; Wise: &quot;I never heard it in Thailand. We hadn't much breath left for whistling. But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean, the film's director, became mad at the extras who played the prisoners—us—because they couldn't march in time. Lean shouted at them, 'For God's sake, whistle a march to keep time to.' And a bloke called George Siegatz ...  —an expert whistler—began to whistle ''Colonel Bogey'', and a hit was born.&quot;

The march was written in 1914 by [[Kenneth J. Alford]], a pseudonym of British Bandmaster Frederick J. Ricketts. The Colonel Bogey strain was accompanied by a [[counter-melody]] using the same chord progressions, then continued with film composer Malcolm Arnold's own composition, &quot;[[The River Kwai March]],&quot; played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers, though Arnold's march was not heard in completion on the soundtrack. [[Mitch Miller]] had a hit with a recording of both marches.

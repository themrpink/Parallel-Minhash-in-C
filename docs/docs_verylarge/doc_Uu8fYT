The verbs in these sentences are in the {{em|absolute state grade}},{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=208}} which requires that its direct object be introduced with the preposition {{IPA|/ən, əm/}}.  This preposition functions like [[accusative case]].

There is also an alternative {{em|nominal state grade}} of the verb in which the direct object of the verb follows with no preposition:

There is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.

Coptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.

=== Upper Egypt ===

==== Sahidic ====
[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Pottery shard inscribed with 5 lines in Coptic Sahidic. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]

'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] ({{lang-cop|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛⲉⲓⲛ|translit=Shmounein}}). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.

While texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.

==== Akhmimic ====
'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] ({{lang-grc|Πανὸς πόλις|translit=Panopolis}}). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.

==== Lycopolitan ====
'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnostic]] and [[Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].

=== Lower Egypt ===

==== Bohairic ====
The '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.

==== Fayyumic ====
'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|ⲗ}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use {{coptic|ⲣ}} {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.

==== Oxyrhynchite ====
'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.

__NOTOC__
Year '''320''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCXX]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Friday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Constantinus and Constantinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1073 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 320 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

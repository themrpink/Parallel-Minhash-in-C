After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks and recreational areas were erected in new residential districts.

==Geography==
[[File:Cagliari11.jpg|thumb|The so-called Sella del Diavolo]]
{{quote|And suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the formless hollow bay. It is strange and rather wonderful, not a bit like Italy. The city piles up lofty and almost miniature, and makes me think of Jerusalem: without trees, without cover, rising rather bare and proud, remote as if back in history, like a town in a monkish, illuminated missal. One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like Spain—or Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed away. Impossible that one can actually walk in that city: set foot there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer, nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.|[[D. H. Lawrence]], ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]'' (1921)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.online-literature.com/dh_lawrence/sea-and-sardinia/2/ Ch. 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the centre of the eponymous gulf, also called [[Golfo degli Angeli]] (&quot;Bay of Angels&quot;) after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello and nine other limestone hills of the middle-to-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a [[Graben]] formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] of the [[Cenozoic]], which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where the [[Gulf of Lion]] is now. The Graben filled in the course of [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movements associated with the breakup of the ancient island [[Paleozoic]] skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlante della Sardegna|editor1=R.

[[File:Castello_San_Michele_(CA).jpg|thumb|left|San Michele hill with the [[Castle of San Michele|castle]] on the top]]
[[File:Cagliari panorama.jpg|thumb|View over the historical district of Villanova]]
The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the [[Middle Age]] near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the ''Sella del Diavolo'' (&quot;Saddle of the Devil&quot;) for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (the mountains of [[Capoterra]]). On the cold, clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of [[Gennargentu]] can be seen from the highest points of the city.

[[File:Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Fonsarda]]
The city has four historic neighbourhoods: Castello, Marina, Stampace and Villanova and several modern districts (such as San Benedetto, Monte Urpinu and Genneruxi at the east, Sant'Avendrace at the west, Is Mirrionis/San Michele at north and Bonaria, La Palma and Poetto at the south), grown when part of the ancient walls had been demolished in the middle of the 19th century. The comune of Cagliari has one [[circoscrizione]], the town of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]] (about 30.000 inhabitants), former village of the Campidano absorbed in the fast growth after the [[Second World War]].

===Parks and recreation===
[[File:Cagliari Giardini pubblici.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Old public gardens]]

Cagliari is one of the &quot;greenest&quot; Italian cities. Every inhabitant of Cagliari has access to {{convert|87.5|m2|ft2}} of public gardens and parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204010425/http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf |date=4 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia]]'', ''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'', with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari|University Botanic Gardens]], ''[[Erythrina caffra]]'' with its stunning red flowers, ''[[Ficus retusa]]'', which provides shade for several of the city's streets, ''[[Araucaria heterophylla]]'', the date palm (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]''), the Canary Islands palm (''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'') and the Mexican Fan Palm (''[[Washingtonia robusta]]'').

Major city parks include:
[[File:Monte_Urpinu_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cagliari, panorama from Monti Urpinu Park]]
[[File:Parco di Monte Claro (CA).jpg|thumb|Park of Monte Claro]]

* Monte Urpinu Park, the most wooded, is a low hill covered by a pine (''[[Pinus halepensis|Pinus halepensis Mill.]]'') and evergreen oak (''[[Quercus ilex|Quercus ilex L.]]'') forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus|Pistacia lentiscus L.]]''), juniper (''[[Juniperus phoenicea|Juniperus phoenicea L.]]''), Kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera|Quercus coccifera L.]]''), wild olive (''[[Olea europaea|Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris]]'') and tree spurge (''[[Euphorbia dendroides|Euphorbia dendroides L.]]''). It extends for about {{convert|25|ha|acre}}.
* Park of San Michele hill (about 25 hectares), with its medieval castle on the top;
* Terramaini Park, about {{convert|13|ha|acre}}, with a little pond which is home to flamingos and other wading birds;
* Monte Claro Provincial Park, about {{convert|22|ha|acre}}, which hosts the provincial library in an old mansion on the top of the hill;
* Ex-vetreria Pirri Park, about {{convert|2.5|ha|acre}};
* Public gardens, the oldest public esplanade of the city, planted in the 19th century, with a wonderful promenade of ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia|Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don]]''.

The [[Molentargius - Saline Regional Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parcomolentargius.it/ |title=Parco Molentargius - Saline |publisher=Parcomolentargius.it |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby.

[[File:Poetto spiaggia.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Aerial view of Poetto Beach]]

====Beaches====
{{Main|Poetto}}
The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about {{convert|8|km|mi|0}}, from Sella del Diavolo (&quot;Devil's Saddle&quot;) up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius (&quot;Molentargius's Salt Mine&quot;).

Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant'Elia district. On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto beaches, among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lies Cala Fighera, a small bay.

Cagliari is close to other seaside locations such as Santa Margherita di Pula, [[Chia, Italy|Chia]], Geremeas, [[Solanas]], [[Villasimius]] and [[Costa Rei]].

===Climate===
[[File:Unusual snowy Cagliari, 1910.jpg|thumb|220px|Snow in Cagliari, 1910]]
Cagliari has a [[Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''), with hot, dry summers and mild winters like other historical regions along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6561&amp;cityname=Cagliari,+Sardinia,+Italy&amp;units=|title=Cagliari, Italy Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its precipitation values also bring it closer to [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServizioMeteorologico2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wickens|first=Gerald E.|chapter=Arid and Semi-arid Environments of the World|date=1998|pages=5–15|editor-last=Wickens|editor-first=Gerald E.|series=Adaptations of Desert Organisms|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03700-3_2|isbn=9783662037003|title=Ecophysiology of Economic Plants in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summer extreme values can be slightly over {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, sometimes with very high humidity, while in winter, under special and rare conditions, the temperature drops slightly below zero. Heavy snowfalls occur on average every thirty years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and of the warmest month, August, about {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}}. But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone, starting in June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, limited to brief afternoon storms. The rainy season starts in September, and the first cold days come in December.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Winds are frequent, especially the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] and [[sirocco]]; in summer a marine sirocco breeze (called ''s'imbattu'' in [[Sardinian language]]) lowers the temperature and brings some relief from the heat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

According to ISTAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bilmens2014gen/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 there were 154,356 people residing in Cagliari (+3.0% compared with 2011), of whom 71,522 were male and 82,834 female for a [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of 0.86. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.

{{As of|2012}}, 4.26% (6,658 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were [[Filipinos]] (21.33%), followed by [[Ukrainians]] (11.93%), [[Romanians]] (10.93%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (9.49%) and [[Senegalese]] (9.49%).

In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighbouring municipalities of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]], [[Monserrato]], [[Selargius]], [[Quartucciu]] and [[Elmas]], were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini's regime wanted to streamline the local administration by eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many large cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy, except for the former town of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]].

The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population including the merged municipalities.

===Metropolitan City===
{{Main|Metropolitan City of Cagliari}}
[[File:Map of comune of Cagliari (metropolitan city of Cagliari, region Sardinia, Italy) - 2016.svg|thumb|left|Map of the metropolitan city of Cagliari, the capital in red]]
The Metropolitan City of Cagliari has been established in 2016 by a Sardinia Regional Law and totals about 431,000 inhabitants according to ISTAT. It is composed of 17 municipalities along the coast of the gulf and up to {{convert|20|km|mi}} of the inner Campidano plain.

It covers an area on the plain of Campidano between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 30 km2 (3200 acres), ponds ([[Molentargius]], 16,22 km2 (40,10 acres) and the depopulated mountains up to {{convert|1100|m|ft}} above sea level. The mountains are largely covered by forests mostly managed by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. To the west these amount to {{convert|256|km2|mi2}} on the Capoterra and Pula mountains. Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve has another {{convert|36|km2|mi2}}, and to the east on Mount Serpeddì and Sette Fratelli there are a total of {{convert|132|km2|mi2}} of forest.

The Metropolitan City is defined by municipalities where the population increased between the last two censuses, in a region where the population is otherwise generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high number of elderly people.

In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase was respectively 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanisation towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated. This urbanisation is also reflected in the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.

Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the [[Banco di Sardegna]], which belongs to the BPER Group and is listed on [[Borsa Italiana]], of the [[Banca di Cagliari]]. [[Banca di Credito Sardo]] was based in Cagliari until it was absorbed by the parent company [[Intesa Sanpaolo]].

The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at Giorgino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cict.it]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101258/http://www.cict.it/ |date=1 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside having one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy offering for sale a vast array of fish to both the public and traders. The communications provider [[Tiscali]] also has its headquarters in Cagliari.

Multinational corporations like [[Coca-Cola]], [[Heineken]], [[Unilever]], [[Bridgestone]] and [[Eni|Eni Group]] have factories in town. One of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe, [[Saras S.p.A.|Saras]], is located within the metropolitan area at [[Sarroch]].

Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early modern period]] defence system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins are less highlighted compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often stop for passengers at Cagliari, and the city is a traffic hub to the nearby beaches of [[Villasimius]], [[Chia, Italy|Chia]], [[Pula, Sardinia|Pula]] and [[Costa Rei]], as well as to the urban beach of Poettu. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of [[Nora, Italy|Nora]]. Especially in summer many clubs and pubs are goals for young locals and tourists. Pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, in the Marina district, near the port and in the Castello district, The clubs are mostly to be found on the Poetto Beach (in summer) or in Viale Marconi (in winter).
In Cagliari there are 180 B&amp;B and 22 hotels that totals 3,300 beds. There are many others hotels in seaside resort of his gulf.

==Main sights==
Considerable remains of the ancient city of Karalis are still visible, including those of the [[Tuvixeddu necropolis]] (the largest Punic necropolis still in existence), the [[Roman amphitheatre (Cagliari)|Roman amphitheatre]], traditionally called ''Is centu scalas'' (&quot;One hundred steps&quot;), and of an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] used to provide generally scarce water. Still visible are also some ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town that appear to have formed the necropolis of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth's ''Sardinia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;206, 215Valery, ''Voyage en Sardaigne'', c. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The amphitheatre stages open-air operas and concerts during the summer.

[[File:Basilica di S.Saturnino.jpg|thumb|220px|right|San Saturnino Basilica, 5th century]]

The Palaeo-Christian [[Basilica of San Saturnino]], dedicated to a martyr killed under [[Diocletian]]'s reign, [[Saturninus of Cagliari]], patron saint of the city, was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the dome and the central part remain, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) were added later. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of ''San Lucifero'' (1660), dedicated to [[Saint Lucifer]], a bishop of the city. The church has a Baroque façade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which came from the nearby [[necropolis]].

[[File:Facciata 1 - ridotta.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Church of San Michele]]
The old medieval town (called ''Castello'' in Italian, ''Casteddu de susu'' in Sardinian, &quot;the upper castle&quot;) lies on top of a hill with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels' Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact and include two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the [[Torre di San Pancrazio]] and the [[Torre dell'Elefante]], typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many other buildings, besides the towers. The exact period of construction of a fortress on this hill is unknown at present, due to the superposition of layers of buildings along the history. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ferrucio Barreca, La Sardegna fenicia e punica, Storia della Sardegna antica e moderna, edizioni Chiarella, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a first urbanization of the quarter in the Punic era on the basis of similarity of the planimetry with the contemporary Carthaginian fortress of [[Monte Sirai]]. Recently, archaeological excavations have identified Punic and Roman buildings under the ramparts of the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-it-2012-264.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Already the Roman poet [[Varro]] called the city &quot;Vicus munitus&quot;, a fortified city, and sixteenth-century authors describe a Roman acropolis perhaps still visible in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Carmona, Hymno a Càller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderigo Hunno Baeza, Caralis panegyricus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. H. Lawrence]], in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]'', that he undertook in January 1921, described the effect of warm Mediterranean sunlight on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a &quot;white Jerusalem&quot;.
[[File:Cattedrale_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The cathedral (left) and the old city hall (right)]]
The [[Cagliari Cathedral|cathedral]] was restored in the 1930s, returning the former [[Baroque]] façade into a [[Medieval Pisan]]-style façade more akin to the original appearance of the church in the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159–1162) sculpted for the [[Cathedral of Pisa]] but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the cathedral is the palace of the provincial government. Before 1900 it was the island's governor's palace.
[[File:Basilica di Bonaria.JPG|thumb|[[The Basilica of Our Lady of Bonaria]]]]
[[File:Sant'Anna (Cagliari).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Collegiata di Sant'Anna]]
The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria]] ([[Names of Buenos Aires|from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, gets its name]]) was built by the Catalans in 1324–1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in Castello. It has a small [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portal in the façade and the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been thrown off a Spanish ship, landed at the foot of Bonaria hill. Bonaria hill is also the location of the [[Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria]].

The ''Chiesa della Purissima'' is a [[Catalan Gothic]] church built in the 16th century in the Castello distinct.

The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace and Villanova) retain much of their original character. In Stampace the [[Torre dello Sperone]], another tower built by the Pisans in the late 13th century, is located, as well as two important monumental churches: the ''Collegiata di Sant'Anna'' and the ''Chiesa di San Michele'', both built in the 18th century in a baroque style. Many more churches, both old and modern, can be found throughout the city.

The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by the engineers Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building was built of white and yellow limestone in a classical style with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]]. It was opened in 1901. A staircase with two flights provides access from Constitution Square. It is interrupted by a covered walkway and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict they were faithfully reconstructed.

From the Terrazza Umberto I the Bastion of Santa Caterina can be accessed via a short flight of steps. Here there was once an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to tradition, the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the surroundings of the monastery.

The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War as an infirmary. In the 1930s, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of [[autarky]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions.

The modern districts built in the late 19th and early 20th century contain examples of [[Art Deco]] architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist [[neoclassicism]] architecture, such as the Court of Justice (''Palazzo di Giustizia'') in Republic Square. The Court of Justice is near the biggest city park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees, artificial lakes, and a vast area with a hill. The [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari]], the city's botanical garden, is also of interest.

==Culture==
[[File:OldUniversityLibraryCagliari.jpg|thumb|18th-century University Library]]

The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousands of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present.
In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/267/biblioteche/22/biblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909052702/http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it%2F267%2Fbiblioteche%2F22%2Fbiblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari |date=9 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincia.cagliari.it/ProvinciaCa/it/bibliotecaprovincialeragazzi2.page |title=Provincia di Cagliari &amp;#124; Biblioteca Provinciale Ragazzi |publisher=Provincia.cagliari.it |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Regional Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html |title=Sardegna Biblioteche - Attività - Biblioteca regionale |publisher=Sardegnabiblioteche.it |date= |accessdate=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204082452/http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page;jsessionid=D5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |title=Comune di Cagliari&amp;#124; MEM - Mediateca del Mediterraneo: Biblioteca Comunale Generale e di Studi Sardi - Archivio Storico - Mediateca |publisher=Comune.cagliari.it |accessdate=3 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209164310/http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page%3Bjsessionid%3DD5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |archivedate=9 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains the municipal archive and library collection.

In the first century B.C. a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome and was satirized by [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]]. The history of Sardinian literature begins in Cagliari in the first century A.D. In the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have literary merit.

The first Sardinian literary author known was Bishop [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], who wrote severe pamphlets against the [[Arian heresy]] in the fourth century A.D. Only in the eleventh century A.D. did the first texts of an administrative nature appear in the modern [[Sardinian language]], together with [[Hagiography|hagiographs]] of local martyrs written in Latin.

Life in Cagliari has been depicted by many writers, starting with the late Roman poet [[Claudian]]. In the late 16th century, the local humanist Roderigo Hunno Baeza dedicated to his town a didactic Latin poem, ''Caralis Panegyricus''.&lt;ref&gt;Miscellaneous codex preserved in the Civic Library of Cagliari, edited by Francesco Alziator, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 17th century Juan Francisco Carmona wrote a hymn to Cagliari in Spanish; Jacinto Arnal De Bolea published in 1636, in Spanish, the first novel set in Cagliari, entitled'' El Forastero''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacinto Arnal de Bolea, El Forastero, Emprenta A. Galgerin, Càller, 1636, republished by the editor Marìa Dolores, Garcìa Sànchez, CFS/CUEC, Cagliari, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence|David Herbert Lawrence]] wrote about the city in his ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]''.

Modern writers connected to Cagliari include [[Giuseppe Dessì]], [[Giulio Angioni]], [[Giorgio Todde]], [[Sergio Atzeni]], (who set many of his novels and short stories, such as ''Bakunin's Son'', in ancient and modern Cagliari), [[Flavio Soriga]].

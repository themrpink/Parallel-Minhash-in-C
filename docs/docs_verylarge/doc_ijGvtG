The morphological principle in the orthography had been strengthened, which also had been proposed in 1920s.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;

The &quot;removal of the influences of the Polonisation&quot; had been represented, effectively, by the:
* Reducing the use of the &quot;consonant+non-iotified vowel&quot; in assimilated Latinisms in favour of &quot;consonant+iotified vowel,&quot; leaving only Д, Т, Р ''unexceptionally'' &quot;hard.&quot;
* Changing the method of representing the sound &quot;L&quot; in Latinisms to another variant of the Belarusian sound Л (of 4 variants existing), rendered with succeeding non-iotified vowels instead of iotified.
* Introducing the new preferences of use of the letters Ф over Т for ''theta'', and В over Б for ''beta'', in Hellenisms. [Stank 1936]

The &quot;removing of the artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages&quot; (virtually the often-quoted &quot;[[Russification of Belarus|Russification of the Belarusian language]]&quot;, which may well happen to be a term coined by Yan Stankyevich) had, according to Stankyevich, moved the normative Belarusian morphology and syntax closer to their Russian counterparts, often removing from use the indigenous features of the Belarusian language. [Stank 1936]

Stankyevich also observed that some components of the reform had moved the Belarusian grammar to the grammars of other Slavonic languages, which would hardly be its goal. [Stank 1936]

====West Belarus====
In [[West Belarus]], there had been some voices raised against the reform, chiefly by the non-Communist/non-socialist wing of the Belarusian national scene. Yan Stankyevich was named to the Belarusian Scientific Society, Belarusian National Committee and Society of the Friends of Belarusian Linguistics at Wilno University. Certain political and scientific groups and figures went on using the pre-reform orthography and grammar, however, thus multiplying and differing versions.

However, the reformed grammar and orthography had been used, too, for example during the process of [[Siarhei Prytytski]] in 1936.

===Second World War===

During the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany]] (1941–1944), the Belarusian collaborationists influenced newspapers and schools to use the Belarusian language. This variant did not use any of the post-1933 changes in vocabulary, orthography and grammar. Much publishing in [[Belarusian Latin alphabet|Belarusian Latin script]] was done. In general, in the publications of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan movement]] in Belarus, the normative 1934 grammar was used.

=== Post Second World War ===

After the Second World War, several major factors influenced the development of the Belarusian language. The most important was the implementation of the &quot;[[russification|rapprochement and unification of Soviet people]]&quot; policy, which resulted by the 1980s in the Russian language effectively and officially assuming the role of the principal means of communication, with Belarusian relegated to a secondary role. The post-war growth in the number of publications in the Belarusian language in BSSR drastically lagged behind those in Russian. The use of Belarusian as the main language of education was gradually limited to rural schools and humanitarian faculties. The BSSR counterpart of the USSR law &quot;On strengthening of ties between school and real life and on the further development of popular education in the USSR&quot; (1958), adopted in 1959, along with introduction of a mandatory 8-year school education, made it possible for the parents of pupils to opt for non-mandatory studying of the &quot;second language of instruction,&quot; which would be Belarusian in a Russian language school and vice versa. However, for example in the 1955/56 school year, there were 95% of schools with Russian as the primary language of instruction, and 5% with Belarusian as the primary language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Станкевіч С. |title=Русіфікацыя беларускае мовы ў БССР і супраціў русіфікацыйнаму працэсу [1962]. / Прадмова В. Вячоркі. |place=Мн. |publisher=Навука і тэхніка |year=1994 |isbn=5-343-01645-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That was the source of concern for the nationally minded and caused, for example, the series of publications by [[Barys Sachanka]] in 1957–61 and the text named &quot;Letter to a Russian Friend&quot; by [[Alyaksyey Kawka]] (1979). The BSSR Communist party leader [[Kirill Mazurov]] made some tentative moves to strengthen the role of Belarusian language in the second half of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Modern history of Belarus'' by Mironowicz.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the beginning of Perestroika and the relaxing of political control in the late 1980s, a new campaign in support of the Belarusian language was mounted in BSSR, expressed in the &quot;Letter of 58&quot; and other publications, producing a certain level of popular support and resulting in the BSSR Supreme Soviet ratifying the &quot;Law on Languages&quot; (&quot;{{lang|be|Закон аб мовах}}&quot;; 26 January 1990) requiring the strengthening of the role of Belarusian in state and civic structures.

==== 1959 reform of grammar ====

A discussion on problems in Belarusian orthography and on the further development of the language was held from 1935–1941. From 1949–1957 this continued, although it was deemed there was a need to amend some unwarranted changes to the 1933 reform. The Orthography Commission, headed by [[Yakub Kolas]], set up the project in about 1951, but it was approved only in 1957, and the normative rules were published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;The BSSR Council of Ministers approved the project of the Commission on Orthography &quot;On making more precise and on partially changing the acting rules of Belarusian orthography&quot; ({{lang|be|«Аб удакладненні і частковых зменах існуючага беларускага правапісу»}}) on 11 May 1957. The project served as a basis for the normative ''Rules of the Belarusian Orthography and Punctuation'' ({{lang|be|«Правілы беларускай арфаграфіі і пунктуацыі»}}), published in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; This grammar had been accepted as normative for the Belarusian language since then, receiving minor practical changes in the 1985 edition.

A project to correct parts of the 1959 grammar was conducted from 2006 to 2007.

=== Post-1991 ===
The process of government support for &quot;Belarusization&quot; began even before the breakup of the Soviet Union, with the Supreme Soviet of the BSSR passing a law on languages in 1990 that aimed for the gradual increase in prestige and general use of the Belarusian language over the next 10 years, followed by the creation that same year of a National Language Program to support this endeavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~postcomm/papers/2012-2013/bekus.pdf|title=Belarusian Language Policy in the Context of Linguistic Human Rights.|last=Bekus|first=Nelly|website=Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Belarus became independent in 1991, support for the cause of the Belarusian language gained prestige and popular interest, with the post-Soviet Belarusian government the continued creation of policies to actively promote the use of the Belarusian language, especially in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00331538&amp;AN=75063402&amp;h=sJfl1nBh%2byv2sJFaixhQPWfp5%2f4sZqWUHDINT1BLRIPmi4UY3AtgPRh6dOSqn7Mhmpbd94ZXmMR69K1BXpSJ3g%3d%3d&amp;crl=f&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00331538%26AN%3d75063402|title=Internationalizing teacher education: The case of Belarus|date=Mar 2012|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The creation of the 1994 Constitution declared Belarusian to be the sole official language, though Russian was given the status as &quot;language of inter-ethnic communication&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; However, the implementation of the 1992–94 &quot;Law on Languages&quot; took place in such a way that it provoked public protests and was dubbed &quot;Landslide Belarusization&quot; and &quot;undemocratic&quot; by those opposing it in 1992–94{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In a [[1995 Belarusian referendum|controversial referendum]] held on 14 May 1995 the Belarusian language lost its exclusive status as the only [[state language]]. State support for Belarusian language and culture in general has dwindled since then, and Russian is dominant in everyday life in today's Belarus.&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; In a 2006 article, [[Roy Medvedev]] compared the position of the Belarusian language in Belarus with that of the [[Irish language]] in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Медведев |first1= Р.|date= March 2006 |title= Непрерывное развитие языков: их влияние друг на друга и конкуренция |url= http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/4556 |journal= Наука и жизнь |access-date= 2017-11-23 | quote = Положение дел с языком в Белоруссии сходно с положением в Ирландии.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spelling reform of the official Belarusian language, making the spelling of some words more similar to Taraškievič's system, was decided on July 23, 2008, and went into effect on September 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
A detailed account can be found in the article [[:be-tarask:Правілы беларускай артаграфіі і пунктуацыі (2008)]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination against Belarusian speakers===
Under the regime of the authoritarian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]], members of the Belarusian speaking minority in Belarus complained about discrimination against the Belarusian language in Belarus.&lt;ref name=us2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5rs8UkMj64C&amp;q=discrimination+belarusian+language&amp;pg=PA1163|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2007|year=2008|publisher=House, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations - 2008|page=1163|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a formally equal status of Russian and Belarusian, Russian is primarily used by the Belarusian government, and cases of discrimination against the Belarusian language are not rare, even though the discrimination is not institutionalized. Authorities occasionally make minor concessions to demands for a widening of the usage of the Belarusian language.&lt;ref name=us2008/&gt;

Organisations promoting Belarusian language such as the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]] were reported as being the object of attacks by Belarus-based [[Russian nationalism|Russian neo-Nazi groups]] in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name=us2008/&gt;

The [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]] has reported about the following categories of violations against the rights of Belarusian speakers in Belarus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbm-mova.by/monitoring15.html?lang=en|title=A review of language policy in Belarus|date=3 April 2012|publisher=[[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]]|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The right to receive public and private services in the Belarusian language;
* The right to access legislation in the Belarusian language;
* The right to receive education in the Belarusian language;
* The right to an equitable presence of the Belarusian language in the media;
* The right to receive full oral and written information in the Belarusian language on the products and services proposed by commercial companies.

Belarusian speakers are facing numerous obstacles when trying to arrange Belarusian language education for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spring96.org/en/news/75147|title=Parents of Belarusian-language pupils in Baranavichy petition Prosecutor General over discrimination|date=19 January 2015|publisher=Viasna Human Rights Center|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2016}} there are no Belarusian-language universities in the country.&lt;ref name=Brli2010&gt;{{in lang|uk}} [http://m.dw.com/uk/білоруська-мова-в-білорусі-державний-статус-чи-декорація/a-19063646?maca=ukr-VGUS-Link-YedynkaUpMobileManual-dwukr Belarusian language in Belarus: state status or scenery?], [[DW.com]] (22 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2016 human rights in Belarus report, the US State Department also stated that there was &quot;discrimination against ... those who sought to use the Belarusian language.&quot;&lt;ref name=statedep2016/&gt; &quot;Because the government viewed many proponents of the Belarusian language as political opponents, authorities continued to harass and intimidate academic and cultural groups that sought to promote Belarusian and routinely rejected proposals to widen use of the language,&quot;.&lt;ref name=statedep2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2016&amp;dlid=265398#wrapper|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|year=2017|publisher=US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2020 Belarusian protests there have been fixed many occasions when Lukashenko's police (who's regime Russia supports) uses special coloured marks on protesters that speak Belarusian language to treat them more cruelly.

=== 2010s ===
In the 2010s the situation of Belarusian has started to change slightly due to the efforts of language-advocacy institutions, of individual representatives of such educational, cultural, scientific and linguistic organizations as the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]], the [[Belarus Academy of Sciences]], the [[Belarusian Writers' Union]], and in response to the endeavours of pro-Belarusian public figures from the media and communication field, musicians, philosophers, entrepreneurs and benefactors.&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; And despite the language losing its exclusive position in the wake of the [[1995 Belarusian referendum]], new signs of the spread of Belarusian have appeared, trickling down into Belarusian society — with advertising campaigns supporting the cause (outdoor billboards promoting&lt;ref name=Brli2010/&gt; and acquainting people with the Belarusian language, branding campaigns for the leading telecommunication providers like Velcom, etc.), the simplified version of the [[Belarusian Latin alphabet]] on the metro map being introduced into the messages of the transport network, dedicated advertising festivals like AD!NAK upholding marketing communication in Belarusian, and informal language-courses (such as [[Mova Nanova]], Mova ci kava, Movavedy) having sprung up in Minsk and around Belarus and spurring further interest of people, especially of young people, in developing good Belarusian communication skills in [[everyday life]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== {{lang|be-Latn|Taraškievica}} or {{lang|be-Latn|Klasyčny pravapis}} (Classical orthography) ===
{{main|Taraškievica}}
{{Anchor|Taraškievica|Tarashkevica}}
There exists an alternative literary norm of the Belarusian language, named {{lang|be-Latn|Taraškievica}} ({{lang|be-Latn|Tarashkevica}}). The promoters and users of it prevalently refer to it as {{lang|be-Latn|Klasyčny pravapis}} (''Classic orthography'').

== Names ==
There are a number of names under which the Belarusian language has been known, both contemporary and historical.  Some of the most dissimilar are from the Old Belarusian period.

=== Official, romanised ===
* ''Belarusian'' (also spelled ''Belarusan'', ''Byelarusian'') – derived from the name of the country &quot;Belarus&quot;, officially approved for use abroad by the Belarusian MFA (ca. 1992) and promoted since then.
* ''Byelorussian'' (also spelled ''Belorussian'', ''Bielorussian'' ) – derived from the Russian name of the country &quot;Byelorussia&quot; ({{lang-ru|Белоруссия}}), used officially (in the [[Russian language]]) in the times of the [[USSR]] and, later, in [[Russia]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.
* ''White Ruthenian'' (and its equivalents in other languages) – literally, a word-by-word translation of the parts of the composite word ''Belarusian''.

=== Alternative ===
* ''Great Lithuanian'' ({{lang|be|вялікалітоўская (мова)}}) – proposed and used by [[Yan Stankyevich]] since the 1960s, intended to part with the &quot;diminishing tradition of having the name related to the Muscovite tradition of calling the Belarusian lands&quot; and to pertain to the &quot;great tradition of Belarusian statehood&quot;.
* ''Kryvian'' or ''Krivian'' ({{lang|be|крывіцкая/крывічанская/крыўская (мова)}}, {{lang-pl|język krewicki}}) – derived from the name of the Slavonic tribe [[Krivichi]], one of the main tribes in the foundations of the forming of the Belarusian nation. Created and used in the 19th century by Belarusian Polish-speaking writers Jaroszewicz, Narbut, Rogalski, [[Jan Czeczot]]. Strongly promoted by [[Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski]].

=== Vernacular ===
* ''Simple'' ({{lang|be|простая (мова)}}) or ''[[Tutejszy|local]]'' ({{lang|be|тутэйшая (мова)}}) – used mainly in times preceding the common recognition of the existence of the Belarusian language, and nation in general. Supposedly, the term can still be encountered up to the end of the 1930s, e.g., in [[Western Belarus]].
* ''Simple Black Ruthenian'' ({{lang-ru|простой чернорусский}}) – used in the beginning of the 19th century by the Russian researcher Baranovski and attributed to contemporary vernacular Belarusian.&lt;ref&gt;Acc. to: Улащик Н. Введение в белорусско-литовское летописание. – Moscow, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer representation ==
Belarusian is represented by the [[ISO 639]] code ''be'' or ''bel'', or more specifically by [[IETF language tag]]s ''be-1959acad'' (so-called &quot;Academic&quot; [&quot;governmental&quot;] variant of Belarusian as codified in 1959) or ''be-tarask'' (Belarusian in Taraskievica orthography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry |title=Type: language |date=2016-10-12 |website=Iana.org |access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alistair Leslie Graham''', better known as '''Ali G''', is a satirical fictional character created and performed by English comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. Originally appearing on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', and subsequently as the [[title character]] of Channel 4's ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' in 2000 and on [[HBO]] in 2003–2004, he is also the title character of the film ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]''. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4 Ali G was ranked eighth on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatestTVcharacters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160558/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_characters/results.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |title=100 Greatest TV Characters |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/ITVProgs/2001/05/05/Y22090001/ |title=100 Greatest ...

In December 2007, in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Baron Cohen announced that Ali G, along with [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]], had been retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;shed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.actressarchives.com/news/baron-cohen-borat-and-ali-g-are-dead-to-me|title=Borat and Ali G are dead for Sacha Baron Cohen|work=actressarchives.com|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=15 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072349/http://www.actressarchives.com/news/baron-cohen-borat-and-ali-g-are-dead-to-me|archivedate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ali G returned at the 2012 [[British Comedy Awards]] to accept Baron Cohen's Outstanding Achievement Award, causing controversy by making jokes about [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]] and [[Jimmy Savile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James|title=Ali G mocks Jimmy Savile at British Comedy Awards|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/stage/comedy/article3630059.ece|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=The Times|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali G returned to television with ''Ali G Rezurection'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/06/ali-g-tv-series_n_4737938.html |title=Ali G Has Been 'Rezurected' For New TV Series On FXX |newspaper=[[HuffPost]] |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rezurection'' features new introductions by Ali G to some old highlights of ''Da Ali G Show'' and Borat reappeared for ''Borat 2.''

==Development==
Ali G is a fictional [[stereotype]] of a British suburban male &quot;[[chav]]&quot; who imitates inner-city urban [[British hip hop]] culture and [[British Jamaican]] culture, particularly through [[hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[drum and bass]] and [[Oldschool jungle|jungle music]], as well as speaking in [[rude boy]]-style [[Multicultural London English]] from [[Jamaican Patois]]. Ali G was part of a group called the &quot;West [[Staines]] Massiv&quot;, and grew up near Staines in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], Berkshire. He also lived part of his life in [[Staines]] (now called [[Staines-upon-Thames]]), north [[Surrey]], 16 miles south-west of London. Baron Cohen has stated that [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Tim Westwood]] was an influence on the development of his character – Westwood used to host Radio 1's Rap Show and speaks in a [[Multicultural London English]] dialect. Ali G's middle-class credentials mirror Westwood's: the latter was brought up in [[Lowestoft]], Suffolk as a bishop's son.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-man-behind-the-mustache-20061130?page=4 Sacha Baron Cohen – The Real Borat – finally speaks], ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his character's first appearance on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', Baron Cohen had portrayed a similar character named MC Jocelyn Cheadle-Hume on a show he presented called ''[[F2F (TV series)|F2F]]'', which ran on the [[ITV Digital Channels|ITV/Sky]] owned satellite channel [[Granada Talk TV]]. While chatting to a group of skateboarders, in character, Baron Cohen realised that people could be led to believe his character was real, and filmed a number of segments which were ordered off-air by [[London Weekend Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot; /&gt;

==History and appearances==

Ali G, a faux-streetwise [[poseur]] with a deeply stereotypical view of the world, first came to prominence on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' as the &quot;voice of da yoof&quot; in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1883923,00.html &quot;'He becomes the character, certainly with Ali G and Borat. He has a mix of Sellers' acting and Rod Hull's bottle'&quot;] by Kirsty Scott, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He interviewed various public figures in the United Kingdom, always either embarrassing his interviewee by displaying a mixture of uninformed [[political incorrectness]], or getting the interview 'victim' to agree to some breathtaking inaccuracy or insult.

Other examples of his bold interviewing style include getting [[Lindsay Urwin]], the [[Bishop of Horsham]], to admit that God created the Universe, and then asked him, &quot;And since then, [God]'s just chilled?&quot; Ali G asked the Bishop about God's appearance, to which the Bishop replied, &quot;Well, he's sort of Jesus-shaped.&quot;  During an interview with [[James Ferman]] (former director of the [[British Board of Film Classification]]), Ali G asks whether his made-up vulgarities would restrict a film to an over-18 audience, and suggests that [[film censorship]] be performed by younger persons who understand contemporary slang. In an interview with the chairman of the [[Arts Council of England]] [[Gerry Robinson]] Ali G's first question was: ''&quot;Why is the arts so – excuse me French, but – crap?&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=katrLNbHE9I&amp;t=3192 Interview with Gerry Robinson from ''Ali G – Innit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali G appeared in the 2003 short film ''Spyz'', directed by James Bobin. It showcases Ali G as James Bond in a series of inexplicably occurring action and sex scenes.

Ali G was in a series of ads for the [[2005–06 NBA season]], in which he used his brand of off-kilter journalism to interview various NBA stars. The spots were directed by [[Spike Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lao-ocean.com/2005/11/06/nba-commercials-with-ali-g/ |title=NBA commercials with Ali G |access-date=13 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021307/http://lao-ocean.com/2005/11/06/nba-commercials-with-ali-g/ |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali G was also featured in the music video &quot;[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]&quot; by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as her limo driver. He complains that her &quot;babylons&quot; are not as big as they appear to be on TV and calls her &quot;[[Diego Maradona|Maradona]]&quot; when asking to be in her next video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2008/11/12/top-trl-video-cameos-ali-g-shows-madonna-the-real-big-ben/ |title=Top 'TRL' Video Cameos: Ali G Shows Madonna The Real Big Ben! |publisher=MTV |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/731080.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Ali G 'stars in Madonna video' | date=30 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

At the receiver, due to the presence of the multiple electromagnetic paths, more than one pulse will be received, and each one of them will arrive at different times. In fact, since the electromagnetic signals travel at the [[speed of light]], and since every path has a geometrical length possibly different from that of the other ones, there are different air travelling times (consider that, in [[free space]], the light takes 3&amp;nbsp;μs to cross a 1&amp;nbsp;km span). Thus, the received signal will be expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;y(t)=h(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{\rho_n e^{j\phi_n} \delta(t-\tau_n)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of received impulses (equivalent to the number of electromagnetic paths, and possibly very large), &lt;math&gt;\tau_n&lt;/math&gt; is the time delay of the generic &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; impulse, and &lt;math&gt;\rho_n e^{j\phi_n}&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[complex amplitude]] (i.e., magnitude and phase) of the generic received pulse. As a consequence, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; also represents the impulse response function &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the equivalent multipath model.

More in general, in presence of time variation of the geometrical reflection conditions, this impulse response is time varying, and as such we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_n=\tau_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_n=\rho_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n=\phi_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Very often, just one parameter is used to denote the severity of multipath conditions: it is called the '''[[multipath time]]''', &lt;math&gt;T_M&lt;/math&gt;, and it is defined as the time delay existing between the first and the last received impulses

:&lt;math&gt;T_M=\tau_{N-1}-\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Multipath transfer function.png|thumb|320px|Mathematical model of the multipath channel transfer function.]]
In practical conditions and measurement, the multipath time is computed by considering as last impulse the first one which allows receiving a determined amount of the total transmitted power (scaled by the atmospheric and propagation losses), e.g. 99%.

Keeping our aim at linear, time invariant systems, we can also characterize the multipath phenomenon by the channel transfer function &lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the continuous time [[Fourier transform]] of the impulse response &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H(f)=\mathfrak{F}(h(t))=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{h(t)e^{-j 2\pi f t} d t}=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{\rho_n e^{j\phi_n} e^{-j2 \pi f \tau_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last right-hand term of the previous equation is easily obtained by remembering that the Fourier transform of a Dirac pulse is a complex exponential function, an [[eigenfunction]] of every linear system.

The obtained channel transfer characteristic has a typical appearance of a sequence of peaks and valleys (also called ''notches''); it can be shown that, on average, the distance (in Hz) between two consecutive valleys (or two consecutive peaks), is roughly inversely proportional to the multipath time. The so-called '''coherence bandwidth''' is thus defined as

:&lt;math&gt;B_C \approx \frac{1}{T_M}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, with a multipath time of 3&amp;nbsp;μs (corresponding to a 1&amp;nbsp;km of added on-air travel for the last received impulse), there is a coherence bandwidth of about 330&amp;nbsp;kHz.

For example, the output of a group [[multiplexer]] consists of a band of frequencies from 60&amp;nbsp;kHz to 108&amp;nbsp;kHz. This is the group-level [[baseband]] that results from combining 12 [[voice-frequency]] input channels, having a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of 4&amp;nbsp;kHz each, including guard bands. In turn, 5 groups are multiplexed into a super group having a baseband of 312&amp;nbsp;kHz to 552&amp;nbsp;kHz. This baseband, however, does not represent a group-level baseband. Ten super groups are in turn multiplexed into one master group, the output of which is a baseband that may be used to modulate a [[microwave]]-frequency carrier.

[[File:Multiplexing diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Multiple low data rate signals are multiplexed over a single high data rate link, then demultiplexed at the other end]]

In [[telecommunications]] and [[computer networks]], '''multiplexing''' (sometimes contracted to '''muxing''') is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a [[shared medium]]. The aim is to share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several [[telephone call]]s may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated in [[#Telegraphy|telegraphy]] in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. In [[#Telephony|telephony]], [[George Owen Squier]] is credited with the development of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.

The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.

A device that performs the multiplexing is called a [[multiplexer]] (MUX), and a device that performs the reverse process is called a [[demultiplexer]] (DEMUX or DMX).

[[Inverse multiplexing]] (IMUX) has the opposite aim as multiplexing, namely to break one data stream into several streams, transfer them simultaneously over several communication channels, and recreate the original data stream.

In [[computing]], '''I/O multiplexing''' can also be used to refer to the concept of processing multiple [[input/output]] [[Event (computing)|events]] from a single [[event loop]], with system calls like [[poll (Unix)|poll]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1= Charles M. Hannum |author2= The [[NetBSD]] Foundation |date= 1998 |url= http://bxr.su/n/lib/libc/sys/poll.2 |title= poll, pollts — synchronous I/O multiplexing |website= BSD Cross Reference |publisher= [[NetBSD]] |lay-url= http://mdoc.su/-/poll.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[select (Unix)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1= [[Computer Systems Research Group]] |date= 1994 |url= http://bxr.su/n/lib/libc/sys/select.2 |title= select, pselect — synchronous I/O multiplexing |website= BSD Cross Reference |publisher= [[NetBSD]] |lay-url= http://mdoc.su/-/select.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Multiple [[variable bit rate]] digital [[bit stream]]s may be transferred efficiently over a single fixed [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] channel by means of [[statistical multiplexing]]. This is an [[asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] mode time-domain multiplexing which is a form of time-division multiplexing.

Digital bit streams can be transferred over an analog channel by means of code-division multiplexing techniques such as [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (FHSS) and [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS).

In [[wireless communication]]s, multiplexing can also be accomplished through alternating [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] ([[Horizontal plane|horizontal]]/[[vertical direction|vertical]] or [[clockwise]]/[[counterclockwise]]) on each [[adjacent channel]] and satellite, or through [[phased array|phased multi-antenna array]] combined with a [[multiple-input multiple-output communications]] (MIMO) scheme.

===Space-division multiplexing===
{{main|Space-division multiple access}}
In wired communication, [[Spatial multiplexing|space-division multiplexing]], also known as space-division multiple access (SDMA) is the use of separate point-to-point electrical conductors for each transmitted channel. Examples include an analogue stereo audio cable, with one pair of wires for the left channel and another for the right channel, and a multi-pair [[telephone cable]], a switched [[star network]] such as a telephone access network, a switched Ethernet network, and a [[mesh network]].

In wireless communication, space-division multiplexing is achieved with multiple antenna elements forming a [[phased array antenna]]. Examples are [[multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO), single-input and multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input and single-output (MISO) multiplexing.  An IEEE 802.11g wireless router with ''k'' antennas makes it in principle possible to communicate with ''k'' multiplexed channels, each with a peak bit rate of 54 Mbit/s, thus increasing the total peak bit rate by the factor ''k''. Different antennas would give different [[multi-path propagation]] (echo) signatures, making it possible for [[digital signal processing]] techniques to separate different signals from each other. These techniques may also be utilized for [[space diversity]] (improved robustness to fading) or [[beamforming]] (improved selectivity) rather than multiplexing.

===Frequency-division multiplexing===
[[File:Frequenzmultiplex001.svg|right|thumb|400px|Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM): The spectrum of each input signal is shifted to a distinct frequency range.]]
[[Frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM) is inherently an analog technology. FDM achieves the combining of several signals into one medium by sending signals in several distinct frequency ranges over a single medium. '''In FDM the signals are electrical signals.'''
One of the most common applications for FDM is traditional radio and television broadcasting from terrestrial, mobile or satellite stations, or cable television.  Only one cable reaches a customer's residential area, but the service provider can send multiple television channels or signals simultaneously over that cable to all subscribers without interference.  Receivers must tune to the appropriate frequency (channel) to access the desired signal.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bates&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = Voice and Data Communications | first1 = Regis J | first2 = Marcus | last1= Bates| last2 = Bates | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780072257328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant technology, called [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] (WDM) is used in [[optical communication]]s.

===Time-division multiplexing===
[[File:Telephony multiplexer system.gif|right|thumb|400px|Time-division multiplexing (TDM).]]
[[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) is a digital (or in rare cases, analog) technology which uses time, instead of space or frequency, to separate the different data streams. TDM involves sequencing groups of a few bits or bytes from each individual input stream, one after the other, and in such a way that they can be associated with the appropriate receiver. If done sufficiently quickly, the receiving devices will not detect that some of the circuit time was used to serve another logical communication path.

Consider an application requiring four terminals at an airport to reach a central computer. Each terminal communicated at 2400 [[baud]], so rather than acquire four individual circuits to carry such a low-speed transmission, the airline has installed a pair of multiplexers. A pair of 9600 baud modems and one dedicated analog communications circuit from the airport ticket desk back to the airline data center are also installed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bates&quot; /&gt; Some [[Proxy server#Web proxy servers|web proxy servers]] (e.g. [[polipo]]) use TDM in [[HTTP pipelining]] of multiple [[HTTP]] transactions onto the same [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP/IP connection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = rfc2068 - HTTP/1.1 |url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068 |accessdate = 2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carrier sense multiple access]] and [[multidrop]] communication methods are similar to time-division multiplexing in that multiple data streams are separated by time on the same medium, but because the signals have separate origins instead of being combined into a single signal, are best viewed as [[channel access method]]s, rather than a form of multiplexing.

TD is a legacy multiplexing technology still providing the backbone of most National fixed line Telephony networks in Europe, providing the 2m/bit voice and signalling ports on Narrow band Telephone exchanges such as the DMS100. Each E1 or 2m/bit TDM port provides either 30 or 31 speech timeslots in the case of CCITT7 signalling systems and 30 voice channels for customer connected Q931, DASS2, DPNSS, V5 and CASS signalling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breakthroughs in telephone technology : from Bell to smartphones|date=2012|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Educational Services|others=Curley, Robert, 1955-|isbn=978-1-61530-724-1|edition=1st|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=69|oclc=769190186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarization-division multiplexing ===
[[Polarization-division multiplexing]] uses the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of electromagnetic radiation to separate orthogonal channels. It is in practical use in both radio and optical communications, particularly in 100 Gbit/s per channel [[fiber optic transmission system]]s.

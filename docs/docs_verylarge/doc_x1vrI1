The rail network is of growing importance in Leicester, and with the start of [[Eurostar]] international services from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] in November 2007 [[Leicester railway station]] has gained connections at St Pancras station to Lille, Brussels and Paris onwards.

InterCity services are operated by [[East Midlands Railway]] providing connectivity on 'fast' and 'semi-fast' services to London and the south east, and to major cities and towns in the East Midlands and Yorkshire in addition to providing local services within the East Midlands region. Trans-regional services to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]] are provided by [[CrossCountry]], enabling connexions at nearby Nuneaton onto the West Coast mainline and at Peterborough with the East Coast mainline.

The {{convert|99|mi|}} from [[Leicester Railway Station]] to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] on the Midland Main Line, are covered in an average of 1h 25m during the morning peak, with journey times as low as 1h 06m later in the day. Transfers onto [[London Underground]] or [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] train services to London City or West End add another 15 to 25 minutes to the journey time and to Canary Wharf, double. The journey time to [[Sheffield]] is around one hour, with Leeds and York taking approximately two. [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] is 50 minutes away and [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] via [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] can be reached in around 1 hour 55m with further direct services available onto Stansted Airport in north Essex.

====Great Central Railway====
{{Main|Great Central Railway}}
The decommissioned [[Leicester Central railway station]] is on the late Victorian Great Central Railway line that ran from London Marylebone northwards. [[Beeching cuts]] closed the route in the late 1960s. A preserved section, however, remains operational in the East Midlands centred on Loughborough Great Central railway station providing touristic services through central Leicestershire'','' passing Swithland Reservoir on to the [[Leicester North railway station]] terminus.

===Schools===
{{Main|List of schools in Leicester}}

Leicester is home to a number of comprehensive schools and independent schools. There are three sixth form colleges, all of which were previously grammar schools.

The Leicester City [[Local Education Authority]] initially had a troubled history when formed in 1997 as part of the local government reorganisation – a 1999 [[Ofsted]] inspection found &quot;few strengths and many weaknesses&quot;, although there has been considerable improvement since then.

[[Tudor Grange Samworth Academy]] an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] whose catchment area includes the Saffron and Eyres Monsell estates, was co-sponsored by the [[Church of England]] and David Samworth, chairman of Samworth Brothers pasty makers.

Under the &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; project, Leicester City Council has contracted with developers Miller Consortium for £315&amp;nbsp;million to rebuild [[Beaumont Leys School]], [[Judgemeadow Community College]], the [[City of Leicester College]] in Evington, and [[Soar Valley College]] in Rushey Mead, and to refurbish Fullhurst Community College in Braunstone.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132407&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=132390&amp;contentPK=19305931&amp;moduleName=InternalSearch&amp;formname=sidebarsearch Schools building deal is signed and sealed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513085442/http://thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132407&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=132390&amp;contentPK=19305931&amp;moduleName=InternalSearch&amp;formname=sidebarsearch |date=13 May 2015 }}'' – ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', 19 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester is home to two universities, the [[University of Leicester]], which attained its [[Royal Charter]] in 1957 and was ranked 12th by the 2009 Complete University Guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-main-league-table-2009-813839.html|title=The main league table 2009|date=23 April 2008|work=The Independent|access-date=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515214413/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-main-league-table-2009-813839.html|archive-date=15 May 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[De Montfort University]], which opened in 1969 as [[Leicester Polytechnic]] and achieved university status in 1992.

It is also home to the [[National Space Centre]] off Abbey Lane, due in part to the University of Leicester being one of the few universities in the UK to specialise in space sciences.

The Church of England [[parish church]] of [[St Nicholas Church, Leicester|St Nicholas]] is the oldest place of worship in the city. Parts of the church certainly date from about 880 AD, and a recent architectural survey suggested possible Roman building work. The tower is [[Norman architecture|Norman]].  By 1825 the church was in an extremely poor condition, and plans were made for its demolition. Instead, it was extensively renovated between 1875 and 1884, including the building of a new north [[aisle]].  Renovation continued into the twentieth century. A fifteenth-century octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]]. from the redundant [[Church of St Michael the Greater, Stamford]], was transferred to St Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=20th Century |url=https://history.stnicholasleicester.com/1900-s.html |website=Welcome to St Nicholas Church in Leicester History Section |accessdate=15 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Otters: ecology, behaviour and conservation| author=Kruuk H| page=7| publisher=Oxford Biology| isbn=978-0-19-856587-1 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[collective noun]]s for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.&lt;ref&gt;M &amp; P Briggs, ''The Natural History of British Isles'', pp. 334–35{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OTWO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otter-world.com/facts-about-otters/|title=Facts about otters|publisher=Otter World|access-date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[feces]] of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;&lt;ref name=&quot;btinternet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm|website=archive.today|title=Spraint Analysis|access-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm|archive-date=8 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are known as [[spraint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What Shat That?: A Pocket Guide to Poop Identity |author=Pagett, Matt |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58008-885-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle ==
The [[gestation]] period in otters is about 60 to 86 days. The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring. Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years. The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland. It is lined with moss and grass.

After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim. The pup lives with its family for approximately one year. Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups. Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds.

== Description ==
Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful [[webbed foot|webbed feet]] used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from {{convert|0.6|to|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|1|to|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. The [[Asian small-clawed otter]] is the smallest otter species and the [[giant otter]] and [[sea otter]] are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long [[guard hairs]]. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat [[buoyant]] under water.

Several otter species live in cold waters and have high [[metabolic rate]]s to help keep them warm. [[European otter]]s must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and [[sea otter]]s 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, an otter needs to catch {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}} of fish per hour to survive. Most [[species]] hunt for three to five hours each day and [[nursing]] mothers up to eight hours each day.

==Feeding==
For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, [[crayfish]] and [[crabs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Otters: ecology, behavior and conservation| author=Kruuk H| pages=99–116| publisher=Oxford Biology| isbn=978-0-19-856587-1 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some otters are experts at opening [[shellfish]], and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of [[clams]], [[sea urchins]] and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONKI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters/|title=Tool use in otters|publisher=OneKind|access-date=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104064517/http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to prevent their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives.

Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and then sliding on them into the water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others live in groups&amp;nbsp;– in a few species these groups may be fairly large.

=== European otter ===
{{Main|European otter}}
[[File:Otter in Southwold.jpg|thumb|left|European otter, England]]
The European otter (''Lutra lutra''), also called the Eurasian otter, inhabits Europe, most of Asia and parts of North Africa. In the [[British Isles]], they were common as recently as the 1950s, but became rare in many areas due to the use of [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]] [[pesticide]]s, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of Scotland and Ireland). Population levels reached a low point in the 1980s, but are now recovering strongly. The UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] envisages the re-establishment of otters by 2010 in all the UK rivers and coastal areas they inhabited in 1960. [[Roadkill]] deaths have become one of the significant threats to the success of their re-establishment.

=== North American river otter ===
{{Main|North American river otter}}
[[File:LutraCanadensis fullres.jpg|thumb|North American river otters]]

The North American river otter (''Lontra canadensis'') became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for [[fur]] in North America after European contact. River otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish, as well as small land mammals and birds. They grow to one meter (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;ft) in length and weigh from five to 15 kilograms (10 to 30&amp;nbsp;lb).

In some areas, this is a protected species, and some places have otter sanctuaries that help sick and injured otters to recover.

=== Sea otter ===
{{Main|Sea otter}}
[[File:Sea otter cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Sea otter in [[Morro Bay]], California]]

Sea otters (''Enhydra lutris'') are classified as [[marine mammal]]s and live along the Pacific coast of North America. Their historic range included shallow waters of the [[Bering Strait]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]], and as far south as Japan. Sea otters have about 26,000 to 165,000 hairs per square centimeters of skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Otters&amp;nbsp;– Physical Characteristics | url = http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/otters/physical-characteristics.htm | work = seaworld.org | access-date = 17 November 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071102220803/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/otters/physical-characteristics.htm | archive-date = 2 November 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. By the time the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911|1911 Fur Seal Treaty]] gave them protection, so few sea otters remained that the fur trade had become unprofitable.
Sea otters eat shellfish and other [[invertebrate]]s (especially [[clam]]s, [[abalone]], and [[sea urchin]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;www.defenders.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Sea Otter&amp;nbsp;– Enhydra lutris&amp;nbsp;– facts, video, and sound|work=Defenders of Wildlife | url = http://www.defenders.org/wildlife_and_habitat/wildlife/sea_otter.php | access-date =17 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Otter populations are affected by the density of prey they hunt. Because the otter food source is easier to excavate from rocky-bottom habitats, as opposed to soft-bottom habitats, more otters tend to live in waters with rocky bottoms with access to shallow-burrowing prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otterproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Laidre_etal_2001_An_estimation_of_carrying_capacity_for_sea_otters_along_the_CA_coast.pdf|title=Carrying Capacity of Otters|author1=Laidre, Kristin |author2=Jameson, Donald |author3=DeMaster, Douglas |date=2001|website=otterproject.org|publisher=Marine Mammal Science|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They frequently carry a rock in a pouch under their forearm and use this to smash open [[Animal shell|shells]], making them one of the relatively small number of animals that [[Tool use by animals|use tools]]. They grow to {{convert|1.0|to|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weigh {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in California and [[Alaska]].

Unlike most marine mammals (such as [[Pinniped|seals]] or whales), sea otters do not have a layer of insulating [[blubber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www.defenders.org&quot; /&gt; As with other species of otter, they rely on a layer of air trapped in their fur, which they keep topped up by blowing into the fur from their mouths. They spend most of their time in the water, whereas other otters spend much of their time on land.

=== Giant otter ===
{{Main|Giant otter}}
[[File:giantotter.jpg|thumb|right|Giant otter]]
The giant otter (''Pteronura brasiliensis'') inhabits South America, especially the Amazon river basin, but is becoming increasingly rare due to poaching, habitat loss, and the use of mercury and other toxins in illegal alluvial gold mining. This gregarious animal grows to a length of up to {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is more aquatic than most other otters.

== Relation with humans ==

=== Hunting ===
Otters have been hunted for their [[Fur|pelts]] from at least the 1700s, although it may have begun well before then. Early hunting methods included darts, arrows, nets and snares but later, traps were set on land and guns used.

There has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for the royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them. The tails of otters were often made into items for men to wear. These included hats and belts. Even some types of mittens for children have been made from the fur of otters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otter-world.com/otter-hunting.html|title=Otter hunting|publisher=Otter-World.com|year=2009|access-date=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054937/http://otter-world.com/otter-hunting.html|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otters have also been hunted using dogs, specifically the [[otterhound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britishpathe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/otter-hunting-aka-otter-hunting-begins|title=Otter Hunting AKA Otter Hunting Begins – British Pathé|website=britishpathe.com|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1958 to 1963, the 11 otter hunts in England and Wales killed 1,065 otters between them. In such hunts, the hunters notched their poles after every kill. The prized trophy that hunters would take from the otters was the [[Baculum|penis bone]], which would be worn as a [[Tie clip|tie-pin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ACIGAWIS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acigawis.org.uk/bloodsports/otterhunting|title=Otterhunting|publisher=Animal Cruelty Investigation Group/Animal Welfare Information Service|access-date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traffic (conservation programme)|Traffic]] (the wildlife trade monitoring network) reported that otters are at serious risk in Southeast Asia and have disappeared from parts of their former range. This decline in populations is due to hunting to supply the demand for skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2009/12/9/otters-feel-the-heat-in-southeast-asia.html|date=9 December 2009|title=Otters feel the heat in Southeast Asia |publisher=[[Traffic (conservation programme)]]|access-date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fishing for humans ===
{{main|Otter fishing}}
For many generations, fishermen in southern Bangladesh have bred [[smooth-coated otter]]s and used them to chase fish into their nets. Once a widespread practice, passed down from father to son throughout many communities in Asia, this traditional use of domesticated wild animals is still in practice in the district of [[Narail]], Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=de Trey-White, Simon |year=2007|title=Fisherman's friend|journal=Geographical|volume=79|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Feeroz, M.M., Begum, S. and Hasan, M.

=== Religion and mythology ===
[[Norse mythology]] tells of the [[Norse dwarves|dwarf]] [[Ótr]] habitually taking the form of an otter. The myth of &quot;Otter's Ransom&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Irish mythology]], the character [[Lí Ban (mermaid)|Lí Ban]] was turned from a woman into a mermaid, half human and half salmon, and given three hundred years of life to roam the oceans. Her lapdog assumed the form of an otter and shared her prolonged lifetime and her extensive wanderings.   

In some Native American cultures, otters are considered [[totem animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends-otter.htm|title=Native American Indian Otter Legends, Meaning and Symbolism from the Myths of Many Tribes|website=www.native-languages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The otter is held to be a clean animal belonging to [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] belief, and taboo to kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper92&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |pages=171–72|year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-85538-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular Korean mythology, it is told that people who see an otter (''soodal'') will attract 'rain clouds' for the rest of their lives.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the Buddhist Jataka tales, The Otters and The Wolf, two otters agreed to let a fox settle their dispute in dividing their caught fish but it was taken away by the  cunning fox. &lt;ref&gt;Jataka Tales: The Otters and The Wolf https://mocomi.com/jataka-tales-the-otters-and-the-wolf/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese, otters are called &quot;kawauso&quot; ({{nihongo2|獺、川獺}}). In Japanese folklore, they fool humans in the same way as foxes ([[kitsune]]) and [[bake-danuki|tanuki]].

In the [[Noto, Ishikawa (Fugeshi)|Noto region]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], there are stories where they shapeshift into beautiful women or children wearing checker-patterned clothing.

In the Ishikawa and Kochi Prefectures, they are said to be a type of kappa, and there are stories told about how they engage in sumo with otters.&lt;ref name=&quot;村上&quot; /&gt; In places like the [[Hokuriku region]], [[Kii Province|Kii]], and [[Shikoku]], the otters are seen as a type of kappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=村上健司|editor=講談社コミッククリエイト編|title=DISCOVER 妖怪 日本妖怪大百科|year=2007|publisher=講談社|series=KODANSHA Official File Magazine|volume=1|isbn=978-4-06-370031-2|page=19|chapter=河童と水辺の妖怪たち}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kagakushū]], a dictionary from the [[Muromachi period]], an otter that grew old becomes a kappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=香川雅信|editor=吉良浩一編|title=怪 (ムック)|year=2012|publisher=角川書店|series=カドカワムック|volume=37|isbn=978-4-04-130038-1|page=34|chapter=カッパは緑色か?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an Ainu folktale, in Urashibetsu (in [[Abashiri, Hokkaido|Abashiri]], [[Hokkaido]]), there are stories where monster otters shapeshift into humans, go into homes where there are beautiful girls, and try to kill the girl and make her its wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=知里真志保|title=アイヌ民譚集|orig-year=1937|year=1981|publisher=岩波書店|series=岩波文庫|isbn=978-4-00-320811-3 |pages=198–200|chapter=えぞおばけ列伝}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, like in Japan, there are stories where otters shapeshift into beautiful women in old books like ''[[In Search of the Supernatural]]'' and the ''Zhenyizhi'' ({{nihongo2|甄異志}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;柴田&quot; /&gt;

The '''Egyptian language''' (Egyptian: ''r n km.t'', {{IPA-all|ˈraʔ n̩ˈku.mat|Middle Egyptian pronunciation:}}, [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Erman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l7&quot; /&gt; is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]] which was spoken in [[ancient Egypt]]. Its attestation stretches over an extraordinarily long time, from the [[Old Egyptian]] stage (mid-4th millennium BC, [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]]). Its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC, which makes it one of the [[List of languages by first written accounts|oldest recorded languages]] known, along with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2013|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[classical language|classical]] form is known as [[Middle Egyptian]], the [[vernacular]] of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] which remained the literary language of Egypt until the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. The spoken language had evolved into [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] by the time of [[Classical Antiquity]], and finally into [[Coptic language|Coptic]] by the time of [[History of the Copts|Christianisation]]. Spoken Coptic was almost extinct by the 17th century, but it remains in use as the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=extinct&gt;The language may have survived in isolated pockets in [[Upper Egypt]] as late as the 19th century, according to James Edward Quibell, &quot;When did Coptic become extinct?&quot; in ''Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde'', 39 (1901), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Star Egypt&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721071828/http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=106 &quot;Coptic language's last survivors&quot;. ''Daily Star Egypt'', December 10, 2005 (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Egyptian language belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;l1&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[typology (linguistics)|typological]] features of Egyptian that are typically Afroasiatic are its [[fusional language|fusional]] morphology, [[nonconcatenative morphology]], a series of [[emphatic consonant]]s, a three-vowel system {{IPA|/a i u/}}, nominal feminine suffix *''-at'', nominal ''m-'', adjectival *''-ī'' and characteristic personal verbal affixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;l1&quot; /&gt; Of the other Afroasiatic branches, linguists have variously suggested that the Egyptian language shares its greatest affinities with [[Berber languages|Berber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIeEPQAACAAJ|title=The Afroasiatic Languages|last1=Frajzyngier|first1=Zygmunt|last2=Shay|first2=Erin|date=2012-05-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521865333|location=|pages=102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;l5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Keith |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics |date=2013 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0199585847 |page=264 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=BzfRFmlN2ZAC&amp;pg=PA264 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egyptian, the [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] voiced consonants {{IPA|*/d z ð/}} developed into pharyngeal {{angbr|ꜥ}} {{IPA|/ʕ/}}: Egyptian ''ꜥr.t'' 'portal', Semitic ''dalt'' 'door'. Afroasiatic {{IPA|*/l/}} merged with Egyptian {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|r}}, {{angbr|ꜣ}}, and {{angbr|j}} in the dialect on which the written language was based, but it was preserved in other Egyptian varieties. Original {{IPA|*/k g ḳ/}} palatalise to {{angbr|ṯ j ḏ}} in some environments and are preserved as {{angbr|k g q}} in others.&lt;ref name=&quot;l31&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian language has many biradical and perhaps monoradical roots, in contrast to the Semitic preference for triradical roots. Egyptian is probably more conservative, and Semitic likely underwent later regularizations converting roots into the triradical pattern.&lt;ref name=&quot;l52&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

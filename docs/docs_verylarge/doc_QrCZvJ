Although women's praenomina were infrequently used in the later Republic, they continued to be used, when needed, into [[Roman Empire|imperial times]].  Among the other peoples of Italy, women's praenomina continued to be used regularly until the populace was thoroughly Romanized.  In the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] culture, where women held a markedly higher social status than at Rome or in other ancient societies, inscriptions referring to women nearly always include praenomina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kajava&quot;/&gt;

[[File:0293 - Roma - S. Silvestro in Capite - Lapide romana - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 11-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|{{Smallcaps|Avlia L.F. Secunda}}&lt;br/&gt;Aulia Secunda, daughter of Lucius]]
Most Roman women were known by their nomina, with such distinction as described above for older and younger siblings.  If further distinction were needed, she could be identified as a particular citizen's daughter or wife.  For instance, [[Cicero]] refers to a woman as ''Annia P. Anni senatoris filia'', which means &quot;Annia, daughter of Publius Annius, the senator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salway&quot;/&gt;  However, toward the end of the Republic, as hereditary cognomina came to be regarded as proper names, a woman might be referred to by her cognomen instead, or by a combination of nomen and cognomen; the daughter of [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] was usually referred to as ''[[Caecilia Metella Dalmatica|Caecilia Metella]]''.  Sometimes these cognomina were given diminutive forms, such as ''Agrippina'' from the masculine ''Agrippa'', or ''Drusilla'' from ''Drusus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD:Names&quot;/&gt;

In imperial times, other, less formal names were sometimes used to distinguish between women with similar names.  Still later, Roman women, like men, adopted ''signa'', or alternative names, in place of their Roman names.

With the fall of the western empire in the fifth century, the last traces of the distinctive Italic nomenclature system began to disappear, and women too reverted to single names.

==Foreign names==
As Roman territory expanded beyond Italy, many foreigners obtained Roman citizenship, and adopted Roman names.  Often these were discharged auxiliary soldiers, or the leaders of annexed towns and peoples.  Customarily a newly enfranchised citizen would adopt the praenomen and nomen of his patron; that is, the person who had adopted or manumitted him, or otherwise procured his citizenship.  But many such individuals retained a portion of their original names, usually in the form of cognomina.  This was especially true for citizens of [[Ancient Greece|Greek origin]].  A name such as {{Smallcaps|T. Flavius Aristodemus}} or {{Smallcaps|[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]}} would be typical of such persons, although in form these names are not distinguishable from those of freedmen.{{efn-lr|In such cases, the filiation, if present, would indicate if someone were a freedman; but in these particular instances the nomina suggest citizens of provincial origin, who have been enfranchised by imperial decree.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD:Names&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'' promulgated by [[Caracalla]] in AD 212 was perhaps the most far-reaching of many imperial decrees enfranchising large numbers of non-citizens living throughout the empire.  It extended citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire, all of whom thus received the name ''Marcus Aurelius'', after the emperor's praenomen and nomen.  The result was that vast numbers of individuals who had never possessed praenomina or nomina formally shared the same names.  In turn, many of the &quot;new Romans&quot; promptly discarded their praenomina, and ignored their nomina except when required by formality.  As a result, the cognomina adopted by these citizens, often including their original non-Latin names, became the most important part of their nomenclature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salway&quot;/&gt;

==Imperial names==
During the Republic, a person's names were usually static and predictable, unless he were adopted into a new family or obtained a new surname.  In imperial times, however, names became highly variable and subject to change.  Perhaps no names were more variable than those of the emperors.

For example, the first emperor, known conventionally as [[Augustus]], began life as {{Smallcaps|C. Octavius C. f.}}, or Gaius Octavius, the son of [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]].  His ancestors had borne the same name for at least four generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|6|41023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Octavia gens|Octavii]] were an old and distinguished plebeian family, the gens was not divided into ''stirpes'' and had no hereditary cognomina; Octavius' father had put down a slave revolt at [[Thurii]] and was sometimes given the surname ''Thurinus'' (a cognomen ''ex virtute''), but this name was not passed down to the son.

At the age of eighteen in 44 BC, Octavius was nominated ''[[magister equitum]]'' by his granduncle, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], who held the office of [[Roman dictator|dictator]].  On the [[Ides of March]], Caesar was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]], without legitimate children; but in his will he adopted his nephew, who then became {{Smallcaps|C. Julius C. f. Caesar Octavianus}}, &quot;Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, son of Gaius&quot;.  Thus far, his name follows the Republican model, becoming that of his adoptive father, followed by his original nomen in the form of an agnomen.

Two years later, Caesar was deified by the [[Roman Senate]], and Octavian, as he was then known, was styled {{Smallcaps|Divi f.}}, &quot;son of the divine (Caesar)&quot;, instead of {{Smallcaps|C. f.}}.  Still later, after having been acclaimed ''[[Imperator]]'' by the troops under his command, Octavian assumed this title as an additional praenomen, becoming {{Smallcaps|Imp. C. Julius Divi f. Caesar Octavianus}}; in some inscriptions his original praenomen is discarded altogether.  In 27 BC, the Senate granted him the title of ''Augustus'', which would ever after be affixed as a cognomen to the names of the Roman emperors.

A similar pattern was followed by Augustus' heirs.  The emperor's stepson and eventual successor was born ''[[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]];'' after his adoption by the emperor, he became ''Tiberius Julius Caesar'' (retaining his original praenomen).  His brother, born ''[[Nero Claudius Drusus|Decimus Claudius Nero]]'', subsequently became ''Nero Claudius Drusus'', exchanging his original praenomen for his paternal cognomen, and assuming a new cognomen from his maternal grandfather.  Other members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] used praenomina such as ''Drusus'' and ''Germanicus''.

In subsequent generations, all reigning emperors assumed ''Imperator'' as an additional praenomen (usually without foregoing their original praenomina), and ''Augustus'' as a cognomen.  ''Caesar'' came to be used as a cognomen designating an heir apparent; and for the first two centuries of the empire, most emperors were adopted by their predecessors. The result was that each emperor bore a series of names that had more to do with the previous emperor than the names with which he had been born. They added new cognomina as they fought and conquered enemies and new lands, and their filiations recorded their descent from a series of gods.  As the names of the emperors themselves changed, so did the names of the members of their families.

==Later development==
During the Empire, a variety of new naming conventions developed which, while differing, were internally coherent.&lt;ref name=Salway145&gt;Salway, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binary nomenclature and polyonymy===
Under the &quot;High Empire&quot;, the new aristocracy began adopting two or more nomina â€“ a practice which has been termed 'binary nomenclature'.&lt;ref name=Salway131&gt;Salway, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; This arose out of a desire to incorporate distinguished maternal ancestry in a name or, in order to inherit property, an heir was required by a will to incorporate the [[testator]]'s name into his own name.&lt;ref name=Salway132&gt;Salway, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the suffect consul of AD 118/9, [[Gaius Bruttius Praesens Lucius Fulvius Rusticus]], has a name which is composed of two standard sets of tria nomina: he was the natural son of a Lucius Bruttius, and added the nomina of his maternal grandfather, Lucius Fulvius Rusticus, to his paternal nomina.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt;

In order to reflect an illustrious pedigree or other connections, the aristocracy expanded the binary nomenclature concept to include other nomina from an individual's paternal and maternal ancestry.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt; There was no limit to the number of names which could be added in this way (known as polyonomy), and, for example, the consul of 169 AD, (usually called [[Quintus Pompeius Senecio Sosius Priscus|Q. Sosius Priscus]]) had thirty-eight names comprising fourteen sets of nomina reflecting a complex pedigree stretching back three generations.&lt;ref name=Salway132/&gt;

===Cognomen replaces praenomen===
The praenomen, even under the classic system, had never been particularly distinctive because of the limited number of praenomina available.&lt;ref name=Flower&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|last=Flower|first=Harriet (ed.)|isbn=978-0-521-00390-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/119 119]|date=2004-01-19|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the late Republic and the second century AD, the praenomen gradually became less used and eventually disappeared altogether.&lt;ref name=Salway131/&gt; Even among the senatorial aristocracy it became a rarity by about 300 AD.&lt;ref name=Salway131/&gt; In part this came about through a tendency for the same praenomen to be given to all males of a family, thereby fossilizing a particular preaenomen/nomen combination and making the praenomen even less distinctive e.g. all males in the emperor [[Vespasian]]'s family (including all his sons) had the praenomen/nomen combination Titus Flavius:&lt;ref name=Salway130&gt;Salway, p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tree chart/end}}
The cognomen, as in Vespasian's family, then assumed the distinguishing function for individuals; where this happened, the cognomen replaced the praenomen in intimate address.&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt; The result was that two names remained in use for formal public address but instead of praenomen + nomen, it became nomen + cognomen.&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt;

===Edict of Caracalla===
With the [[Constitutio Antoniniana]] in 212, the emperor [[Caracalla]] granted Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire. It had long been the expectation that when a non-Roman acquired citizenship he, as part of his enfranchisement, took on a Roman name.&lt;ref name=Salway133&gt;Salway, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass enfranchisement of 212, the new citizens adopted the nomen &quot;Aurelius&quot; in recognition of Caracalla's beneficence&lt;ref name=Salway130/&gt; (the emperor's full name was Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Augustus, with Aurelius as the nomen). &quot;Aurelius&quot; quickly became the most common nomen in the east and the second most common (after &quot;Julius&quot;) in the west.&lt;ref name=Salway134&gt;Salway, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The change in the origins of the new governing elite that assumed control of the empire from the end of the third century can be seen in their names: seven of the eleven emperors between [[Gallienus]] and [[Diocletian]] ([[Claudius Gothicus]], [[Quintillus]], [[Probus (emperor)|Probus]], [[Carus]], [[Carinus]], [[Numerian]] and [[Maximian]]) bore the name &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;&lt;ref name=Salway136&gt;Salway, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Although praenomina were not adopted by the new citizens, reflecting the pre-existing decline amongst &quot;old&quot; Romans,&lt;ref name=Salway133/&gt; in the west the new names were formulated on the same basis as the existing Roman practices.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt; In the east, however, the new citizens formulated their names by placing &quot;Aurelius&quot; before versions of their non-Roman given name and a patronymic.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt; Ultimately, the ubiquity of &quot;Aurelius&quot; meant that it could not function as a true distinguishing nomen, and became primarily just a badge of citizenship added to any name.&lt;ref name=Salway134/&gt;

===Traditional nomen replaced===
Although a nomen would long be required for official purposes, and, in isolated corners of the empire and in parts of Italy, its usage would persist into the seventh century, the nomen was generally omitted from the name (even of emperors) by the third century.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt;

Two factors encouraged its frequent non-use. Firstly, the cognomen increasingly became the distinguishing name and general name of address.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt; As a result, &quot;New Romans&quot; and, under their influence, &quot;old Romans&quot; too, either dropped the nomen from their name&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt; or, in some cases, treated the nomen as a praenomen.&lt;ref name=Salway136/&gt;

Secondly, with the nomen becoming an increasingly fossilized formality, non-Italian families, even those who had acquired citizenship and a nomen prior to 212, began to ignore their nomen.&lt;ref name=Salway135&gt;Salway, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; When a nomen was required for official purposes they would simply put the default nomen of &quot;Aurelius&quot; in front of their name, rather than use their actual nomen.&lt;ref name=Salway135/&gt;

Until 1871, Alsace included the area now known as the [[Territoire de Belfort]], which formed its southernmost part. From 1982 to 2016, Alsace was the smallest administrative ''[[regions of France|rÃ©gion]]'' in [[metropolitan France]], consisting of the [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]] [[Departments of France|departments]]. [[Regions of France#Reform and mergers of regions|Territorial reform]] passed by the French legislature in 2014 resulted in the merger of the Alsace administrative region with [[Champagne-Ardenne]] and [[Lorraine]] to form [[Grand Est]].
Due to protests it was decided in 2019 that Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin would form the future [[European Collectivity of Alsace]] in 2021.

[[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] is an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect closely related to [[Swabian German|Swabian]] and [[Swiss German]], although since World War II most [[Alsatians (people)|Alsatians]] primarily speak French. Internal and international migration since 1945 has also changed the ethnolinguistic composition of Alsace. For more than 300 years, from the [[Thirty Years' War]] to [[World War II]], the political status of Alsace was heavily contested between France and various German states in wars and diplomatic conferences. The economic and cultural capital of Alsace, as well as its largest city, is [[Strasbourg]], which sits right on the contemporary German international border. The city is the seat of [[European institutions in Strasbourg|several international organizations and bodies]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Alsace'' can be traced to the [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Ali-saz}} or ''Elisaz'', meaning &quot;foreign domain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bostock |first=John Knight |title=A Handbook on Old High German Literature |year=1976 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-815392-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookonoldhig00bost |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |author2=Kenneth Charles King |author3=D.

==History==
In prehistoric times, Alsace was inhabited by nomadic hunters. Later the province became a diffuse border region between the French and the German cultures and languages. After the end of the [[Thirty Years War]], southern Alsace was annexed by France in 1648, with most of the remainder captured later in the century. In contrast to other parts of France, Protestants were permitted to practice their faith in Alsace even after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] of 1685 that abolished their privileges in the rest of France.

After the 1870-71 [[Franco-Prussian War]], Alsace became a part of the 1871 [[Unification of Germany|unified]] [[German Empire]] as a formal Emperor's Land. After [[World War I]] the province went to the [[Third French Republic]]. After having been occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], like the entire France, it returned to France during the end of [[World War II]].

===Pre-Roman Alsace===
The presence of hominids can be traced back 600,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities |publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3 |editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl |volume=Volume 1|location=New York |pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://bellefrance.com/holidays/alsace/history/ |title=History |publisher=Belle France  |access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celt]]s began to settle in Alsace, clearing and cultivating the land. Alsace is a plain surrounded by the [[Vosges]] mountains (west) and the [[Black Forest]] mountains (east). It creates [[Foehn wind]]s which, along with natural irrigation, contribute to the fertility of the soil. In a world of agriculture, Alsace has always been a rich region which explains why it has suffered so many invasions and annexations in its history.

===Roman Alsace===
By 58 BC, the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] had invaded and established Alsace as a center of [[viticulture]]. To protect this highly valued industry, the Romans built fortifications and military camps that evolved into various communities which have been inhabited continuously to the present day. While part of the [[Roman Empire]], Alsace was part of [[Germania Superior]].

===Alemannic and Frankish Alsace===
{{Main|Duchy of Alsace}}
In 357 AD, Germanic tribes attempted to conquer Alsace but they were rebuffed by the Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Alsace became the territory of the Germanic [[Alemanni]]. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). [[Clovis I|Clovis]] and the [[Franks]] defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the [[Battle of Tolbiac]], and Alsace became part of the [[Austrasia|Kingdom of Austrasia]]. Under Clovis' [[Merovingian]] successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the [[Frankish realm]], following the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the [[Treaty of Verdun]]; the grandsons of [[Charlemagne]] divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the [[Middle Francia]], which was ruled by the eldest grandson [[Lothar I]]. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as [[Lotharingia]], or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers [[Charles the Bald]] (ruler of the [[Western Francia|West Frankish]] realm) and [[Louis the German]] (ruler of the [[Eastern Francia|East Frankish]] realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the [[stem duchy]] of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] in Eastern Francia after the [[Treaty of Ribemont]] in 880. Alsace was united with the other Alemanni east of the Rhine into the stem [[duchy of Swabia]].

===Alsace within the Holy Roman Empire===
At about this time, the surrounding areas experienced recurring fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of [[feudalism|feudal]] secular and ecclesiastical lordships, a common process in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen emperors]].

[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] set up Alsace as a province (a ''[[procuratio]]'', not a ''[[provincia]]'') to be ruled by [[ministeriales]], a non-noble class of civil servants. The idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the [[fief]] from the crown out of their own greed. The province had a single provincial court (''[[Landgericht (medieval)|Landgericht]]'') and a central administration with its seat at [[Haguenau|Hagenau]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] designated the [[Bishop of Strasbourg]] to administer Alsace, but the authority of the bishop was challenged by Count [[Rudolf of Habsburg]], who received his rights from Frederick II's son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]]. Strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region.

In 1262, after a long struggle with the ruling bishops, its citizens gained the status of [[free imperial city]]. A stop on the Paris-[[Vienna]]-[[Orient]] trade route, as well as a port on the Rhine route linking [[southern Germany]] and Switzerland to the Netherlands, England and [[Scandinavia]], it became the political and economic center of the region. Cities such as [[Colmar]] and [[Hagenau]] also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the &quot;[[DÃ©capole]]&quot; (or &quot;ZehnstÃ¤dtebund&quot;), a federation of ten free towns.

Though little is known about the early history of the [[Jews of Alsace]], there is a lot of information from the 12th century onwards.  They were successful as moneylenders and had the favor of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wigoder |first1=Geoffrey |title=Jewish Art and Civilization |date=1972 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in much of Europe, the prosperity of Alsace was brought to an end in the 14th century by a series of harsh winters, bad harvests, and the [[Black Death]]. These hardships were blamed on Jews, leading to the [[pogrom]]s of 1336 and 1339. In 1349, Jews of Alsace were accused of poisoning the wells with [[plague (disease)|plague]], leading to the massacre of thousands of Jews during the [[Strasbourg pogrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The power of plagues |first=Irwin W. |last=Sherman |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2006 |isbn=1-55581-356-9 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOjqWL-u9VMC&amp;q=strasbourg+pogrom+february+14+1349&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were subsequently forbidden to settle in the town. An additional natural disaster was the [[Rhine rift]] earthquake of 1356, one of Europe's worst which made ruins of [[Basel]]. Prosperity returned to Alsace under [[Habsburg]] administration during the [[Renaissance]].

Holy Roman Empire central power had begun to decline following years of imperial adventures in Italian lands, often ceding hegemony in Western Europe to France, which had long since centralized power. France began an aggressive policy of expanding eastward, first to the rivers [[RhÃ´ne]] and [[Meuse]], and when those borders were reached, aiming for the Rhine. In 1299, the French proposed a marriage alliance between [[Philip IV of France]]'s sister [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Austria|Blanche]] and [[Albert I of Germany]]'s son [[Rudolf I of Bohemia|Rudolf]], with Alsace to be the dowry; however, the deal never came off. In 1307, the town of [[Belfort]] was first chartered by the Counts of [[MontbÃ©liard]]. During the next century, France was to be militarily shattered by the [[Hundred Years' War]], which prevented for a time any further tendencies in this direction. After the conclusion of the war, France was again free to pursue its desire to reach the Rhine and in 1444 a French army appeared in Lorraine and Alsace. It took up winter quarters, demanded the submission of [[Metz]] and [[Strasbourg]] and launched an attack on [[Basel]].

In 1469, following the {{Interlanguage link multi|Treaty of St. Omer|fr|3=TraitÃ© de Saint-Omer}}, Upper Alsace was sold by Archduke [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund of Austria]] to [[Charles the Bold]], Duke of Burgundy. Although Charles was the nominal landlord, taxes were paid to [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The latter was able to use this tax and a dynastic marriage to his advantage to gain back full control of Upper Alsace (apart from the free towns, but including Belfort) in 1477 when it became part of the demesne of the Habsburg family, who were also rulers of the empire. The town of Mulhouse joined the [[Swiss Confederation]] in 1515, where it was to remain until 1798.

By the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, Strasbourg was a prosperous community, and its inhabitants accepted Protestantism in 1523. [[Martin Bucer]] was a prominent Protestant reformer in the region. His efforts were countered by the Roman Catholic Habsburgs who tried to eradicate heresy in Upper Alsace. As a result, Alsace was transformed into a mosaic of Catholic and Protestant territories. On the other hand, [[MontbÃ©liard|MÃ¶mpelgard (MontbÃ©liard)]] to the southwest of Alsace, belonging to the Counts of [[WÃ¼rttemberg]] since 1397, remained a Protestant enclave in France until 1793.

===German ''Land'' within the Kingdom of France===
This situation prevailed until 1639, when most of Alsace was conquered by France to keep it out of the hands of the [[Spanish Habsburgs]], who by [[OÃ±ate treaty|secret treaty]] in 1617 had gained a clear road to their valuable and rebellious possessions in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Spanish Road]]. Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526â€“1867)|Hungary]], the Habsburgs sold their [[Sundgau]] territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million [[Thaler]]s. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. The treaty stipulations regarding Alsace were complex. Although the French king gained sovereignty, existing rights and customs of the inhabitants were largely preserved. France continued to maintain its customs border along the [[Vosges mountains]] where it had been, leaving Alsace more economically oriented to neighbouring German-speaking lands. The German language remained in use in local administration, in schools, and at the (Lutheran) [[University of Strasbourg]], which continued to draw students from other German-speaking lands. The 1685 [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], by which the French king ordered the suppression of [[Huguenot|French Protestantism]], was not applied in Alsace. France did endeavour to promote Catholicism. [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], for example, which had been Lutheran from 1524 to 1681, was returned to the Catholic Church. However, compared to the rest of France, Alsace enjoyed a climate of religious tolerance.

France consolidated its hold with the 1679 [[Treaties of Nijmegen]], which brought most remaining towns under its control. France seized Strasbourg in 1681 in an unprovoked action. These territorial changes were recognised in the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] that ended the [[War of the Grand Alliance]].
But Alsace still contained islands of territory nominally under the sovereignty of German princes and an independent city-state at Mulhouse. These enclaves were established by law, prescription and international consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |first=William |last=Doyle |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |page=7 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-history-of-the-french-revolution-9780198804932?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From French Revolution to the Franco-Prussian War===

The year 1789 brought the French Revolution and with it the first division of Alsace into the dÃ©partements of [[Haut-Rhin|Haut-]] and [[Bas-Rhin]]. Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the [[Storming of the Bastille]] in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle|Rouget de Lisle]] composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song &quot;[[La Marseillaise]]&quot; (as ''Marching song for the Army of the Rhine''), which later became the anthem of France. &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Strasbourg [[Philippe-FrÃ©dÃ©ric de Dietrich]]. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably [[FranÃ§ois Christophe Kellermann|Kellermann]], the victor of [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]], [[Jean Baptiste KlÃ©ber|KlÃ©ber]], who led the armies of the French Republic in [[Revolt in the VendÃ©e|VendÃ©e]] and [[FranÃ§ois Joseph Westermann|Westermann]], who also fought in the VendÃ©e.

[[Mulhouse]] (a city in southern Alsace) which became part of Switzerland back in 1466, joined France in 1798.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and sympathetic to the restoration of the monarchy pursued by the invading forces of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] who sought to crush the nascent [[revolutionary republic]]. Many of the residents of the [[Sundgau]] made &quot;pilgrimages&quot; to places like [[Mariastein Abbey]], near [[Basel]], in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the [[French Revolutionary Army]] of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1803â€“4 and again in 1808. A poignant retelling of this event based on what [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]''.

Æthelred died on 23 April 1016, making Edmund king. It was not until the summer of 1016 that any serious fighting was done: Edmund fought five battles against the Danes, ending in his defeat on 18 October at the [[Battle of Assandun]], after which they agreed to divide the kingdom, Edmund taking [[Wessex]] and Cnut the rest of the country. Edmund died shortly afterwards on 30 November, leaving two sons, [[Edward the Exile|Edward]] and [[Edmund Ætheling|Edmund]]; however, Cnut became the king of all England, and exiled the remaining members of Edmund's family.

==Early life==
The exact date of Edmund's birth is unclear, but it could have been no later than 993 when he was a signatory to charters along with his two elder brothers. He was the third of the six sons of King [[Æthelred the Unready]] and his first wife, [[Ælfgifu of York|Ælfgifu]], who was probably the daughter of [[Thored|Earl Thored of Northumbria]]. His elder brothers were [[Æthelstan Ætheling|Æthelstan]] (died 1014) and Egbert (died c. 1005), and younger ones, [[Eadred Ætheling|Eadred]], [[Eadwig Ætheling|Eadwig]] and [[Edgar Ætheling|Edgar]].{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} He had four sisters, Eadgyth (or Edith), Ælfgifu, Wulfhilda, and the Abbess of Wherwell Abbey.  His mother died around 1000,{{sfn|Keynes|2009}} after which his father remarried, this time to [[Emma of Normandy]], who had two sons, [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]] and a daughter [[Godgifu, daughter of Æthelred the Unready|Goda]].

Æthelstan and Edmund were close, and they probably felt threatened by Emma's ambitions for her sons.{{sfn|Lavelle|2008|pp=172–173}} The Life of Edward the Confessor, written fifty years later, claimed that when Emma was pregnant with him, all Englishmen promised that if the child was a boy they would accept him as king.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} However that claim may just be [[propaganda]].

==Warrior prince==
When [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] seized the throne at the end of 1013 and Æthelred fled to Normandy, the brothers do not appear to have followed him, but stayed in England. Æthelstan died in June 1014 and left Edmund a sword which had belonged to king [[Offa of Mercia]].{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} His will also reflected the close relationship between the brothers and the nobility of the East Midlands.{{sfn|Lavelle|2008|p=172}}

Sweyn died in February 1014, and the [[Five Boroughs of the Danelaw|Five Boroughs]] accepted his son Cnut as king. However, Æthelred returned to England and launched a surprise attack which defeated the Vikings and forced Cnut to flee England. In 1015 [[Sigeferth (died 1015)|Sigeferth]] and [[Morcar]] came to an assembly in Oxford, probably hoping for a royal pardon, but they were murdered by [[Eadric Streona]]. King Æthelred then ordered that Sigeferth's widow, [[Ealdgyth (wife of Edmund Ironside)|Ealdgyth]], be seized and brought to [[Malmesbury Abbey]], but Edmund seized and married her in defiance of his father, probably to consolidate his power base in the East Midlands.{{sfn|Lavelle|2008|pp=169–172}} He then received the submission of the people of the Five Boroughs. At the same time, Cnut launched a new invasion of England. In late 1015 Edmund raised an army, possibly assisted by his wife's and mother's links with the midlands and the north, but the Mercians under Eadric Streona joined the West Saxons in submitting to Cnut. In early 1016 the army assembled by Edmund dispersed when Æthelred did not appear to lead it, probably due to illness. Edmund then raised a new army and in conjunction with [[Uhtred the Bold|Earl Uhtred of Northumbria]] ravaged Eadric Streona's Mercian territories, but when Cnut occupied Northumbria Uhtred submitted to him, only to be killed by Cnut. Edmund went to London.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}}

==King of England==
Æthelred died on 23 April 1016, and the citizens and councillors in London chose Edmund as king and probably crowned him, while the rest of the [[Witenagemot|Witan]], meeting at [[Southampton]], elected Cnut.{{sfn|Phillips|1911}} Edmund then mounted a last-ditch effort to revive the defence of England. While the Danes laid siege to [[London]], Edmund headed for [[Wessex]], where the people submitted to him and he gathered an army. He fought inconclusive battles against the Danes and their English supporters at [[Penselwood]] in Somerset and [[Sherston, Wiltshire|Sherston]] in Wiltshire. He then raised the siege of London, which had been successfully resisted by the citizens,{{sfn|Phillips|1911}} and defeated the Danes near [[Brentford]]. They renewed the siege while Edmund went to Wessex to raise further troops, returning to again relieve London, defeat the Danes at [[Otford]], and pursue Cnut into Kent. Eadric Streona now went over to Edmund, but at the decisive [[Battle of Assandun]] on 18 October, Eadric and his men fled and Cnut decisively defeated Edmund. There may have been one further battle in the [[Forest of Dean]], after which the two kings, persuaded by the Witan, negotiated a peace dividing the country between them. Edmund received [[Wessex]] while Cnut took Mercia and probably Northumbria.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}}

==Death==
On 30 November 1016, Edmund died. The location of his death is uncertain though it is generally accepted that it occurred in London, rather than in Oxford where [[Henry of Huntingdon]] claimed it to be in his version of events, which included Edmund's death from multiple stab-wounds whilst he was defecating on a privy.{{sfn|Henry of Huntingdon|2002| p= 15}} [[Geoffrey Gaimar]] narrates a similar occurrence with the weapon being a crossbow; but with a number of other medieval chroniclers, including the ''[[Encomium Emmae Reginae]]'', not mentioning murder, it is thought Edmund's cause of death may possibly have been caused by wounds received in battle or by some disease. It is certainly possible, however, that he was murdered.

Edmund was buried near his grandfather Edgar at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] in [[Somerset]]. However the abbey was destroyed during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century, and any remains of a monument or crypt would have been plundered and the location of his remains is unclear.

==Reputation==
In the view of M. K. Lawson, the intensity of Edmund's struggle against the Danes in 1016 is only matched by [[Alfred the Great]]'s in 871, and contrasts with Æthelred's failure. Edmund's success in raising one army after another suggests that there was little wrong with the organs of government under competent leadership. He was &quot;probably a highly determined, skilled and indeed inspiring leader of men&quot;. Cnut visited his tomb on the anniversary of his death and laid a cloak decorated with peacocks on it to assist in his salvation, peacocks symbolising resurrection.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}}

==Descendants==
Edmund had two children by Ealdgyth, [[Edward the Exile]] and [[Edmund Ætheling]]. According to [[John of Worcester]], Cnut sent them to [[Sweden]] where he probably hoped they would be murdered and forgotten, but [[Olof Skötkonung|Olof]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] instead forwarded them on to [[Principality of Kiev|Kiev]], where his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden|Ingegerd]] was the grand princess consort of the [[Kievan Rus']].  The two boys eventually ended up in [[Hungary]] where Edmund died but Edward prospered. Edward returned from exile to England in 1057 only to die within a few days of his arrival.{{sfn|Lawson|2004}} His son [[Edgar Ætheling|Edgar the Ætheling]] was briefly proclaimed king after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, but later submitted to [[William the Conqueror]]. Edgar would live a long and eventful life; fighting in rebellion against William the Conqueror from 1067 to 1075; fighting alongside the Conqueror's son [[Robert Curthose|Robert of Normandy]] in campaigns in [[Sicily]] (1085–1087); and accompanying Robert on the [[First Crusade]] (1099–1103). He was still alive in 1125.

In 1070 Edward the Exile's daughter, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], became Queen consort to [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]. Through her and her descendants, Edmund is the direct ancestor of almost every subsequent Scottish monarch, every English monarch from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] onward, and every monarch of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom, down to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone]] (1765) ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' [https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-103/ Book 1, Chapter 3: &quot;Of the King, and His Title&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has recorded with Moby, The Prodigy, Arthur Baker, Prince Paul, and Grandmaster Flash, amongst others.

Her musical style, as she describes it, is &quot;flip-flop&quot;—a mixture of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[electroclash]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackman, Guy.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/flipflop-pop/2008/05/29/1211654219258.html &quot;Flip Flop Pop&quot;], ''[[The Age]]'', June 1, 2008&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2014 she debuted her reality television show ''I Love Princess Superstar'' on her YouTube channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/princess-superstar-inspired-by-i-love-lucy-lands-on-youtube-1406859424 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Tad |last=Hendrickson |title=Princess Superstar, Inspired by 'I Love Lucy,' Lands on YouTube |date=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 she released a children's record called ''These Are the Magic Days''.

==Background==
Kirschner was born in [[Spanish Harlem]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kagen |first=Wendy |title=Biography |work=Musician Guide |date=2005-09-13 |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003444/Princess-Superstar.html |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Jewish]] father with ancestry from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], and a [[Sicilian-American]] mother who converted to [[Judaism]]. Kirschner identifies herself as a spiritual Jew.&lt;ref name=princesssome&gt;Westbrook, Caroline. [http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/279_interview_with_a_jew.htm Interview with a Jewish Princess] June 2, 2002, accessdate=2008-09-30&lt;/ref&gt;
Her parents were [[psychology|psychologists]]. When Kirschner was a child, the family moved to rural [[Pennsylvania]] and then to the suburbs of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=princessbio&gt;Kagan, Wendy.[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003444/Princess-Superstar.html Princess Superstar biography]&lt;/ref&gt; She attended school at the [[Germantown Academy]], a private high school, where she was a member of the Theatre Club and the Black Student Union. She moved to New York City at the age of 17 and went to NYU, where she got her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in drama. She is an active member of Superstar Machine, and was a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_time_machine/index.html |title=Time Machine |publisher=Emusician.com |date=2005-10-01 |accessdate=2012-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061215/http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_time_machine/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In New York City she took up the [[guitar]],&lt;ref name=princesssome /&gt; and her interest in music surpassed her interest in acting. She joined the Gamma Rays, an all-girl power psychedelic band that recorded a 7&quot; single called &quot;Lovely&quot; for [[TeenBeat Records]]. Their other recordings appeared on various compilations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gamma+Rays Gamma Rays at Discogs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Kirschner was composing hip hop-styled songs on a 4-track recorder.

===Princess Superstar===
In 1994, Kirschner made a demo tape, ''Mitch Better Get My Bunny'', under the name &quot;Princess Superstar&quot;. She sent the tape to the ''[[College Music Journal]]'' and to the [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Grand Royal Records]].&lt;ref name=princessbio /&gt; While she got callbacks from CMJ and Grand Royal, she went on to sign with Dark Beloved Cloud Records, who released her song &quot;I'm White&quot; on their ''Sympathy for Count Pococurante'' compilation.

In 1995, she teamed up with three backing musicians and signed with 5th Beetle Records.&lt;ref name=princessbio /&gt; They recorded her debut album, ''[[Strictly Platinum]]'', which gained her some notoriety as being one of very few white female rappers.

In 1997, Kirschner went on to launch her own record label, first calling it &quot;A Big Rich Major Label&quot;, but then eventually settling on &quot;Corrupt Conglomerate&quot;. She recruited a new crew of backing musicians and recorded ''CEO'', a concept album about corporate culture.

Her next album, 2000's ''Last of the Great 20th Century Composers'', was co-produced by Curtis Curtis and contains the song &quot;Kool Keith's Ass&quot;, and a remix of &quot;Do It Like a Robot&quot; by [[Blues Explosion]].

Kirschner went on to collaborate with [[Kool Keith]] on &quot;Keith and Me&quot; for the 2001 ''Princess Superstar Is'' LP released on Ruthless Records/[[Studio !K7]]. The album, co-produced Curtis Curtis, has guest appearances by [[Beth Orton]] and [[Bahamadia]]. The single &quot;Bad Babysitter&quot; was number 11 on the UK Singles Chart.

For 2005's ''My Machine'', a futuristic hip-hopera concept double album,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Princess+Superstar Princess Superstar at Discogs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; she collaborated with various producers such as [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[Jacques Lu Cont]], [[Junior Sanchez]], [[Armand Van Helden]], [[Todd Terry]], and [[High and Mighty (band)|DJ Mighty Mi]]. This went to number 3 on the UK chart in 2007.

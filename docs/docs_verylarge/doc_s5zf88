==Investment climate==
{{Overly detailed|date=March 2015|section=yes}}

[[Image:Appl0405.loselesslycropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former President [[Marc Ravalomanana]] of Madagascar]]

Following the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with [[international financial institution]]s and donors. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration with the private sector and donors and presented it at a &quot;Friends of Madagascar&quot; conference organized by the [[World Bank]] in [[Paris]] in July 2002.  Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The Malagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principal priority and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a joint public-private sector steering committee.

The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]) and Malagasian artisan producers in Madagascar in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;un.org&quot;&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/documents/website/Handicrafts%20Table%20of%20Contents,%20Introduction.doc &quot;Made in Madagascar: Exporting Handicrafts to the U.S. Market: a Project with the UN Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development; Final Report&quot;], A Project with the UN Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.

The government of former President [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was aggressively seeking foreign investment and had planned to tackle many of the obstacles to such investment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws, encouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active pursuit of foreign investors. President Ravalomanana rose to prominence through his agro-foods [[TIKO]] company, and is known for attempting to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the government. Prior to [[Madagascar#Ravalomanana's resignation|Ravalomanana's resignation]], concerns had arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the activities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a production shortfall in the country.

Madagascar's appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work force. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were organized under the country's [[export processing zone]] (EPZ) system since it was established in 1989. The absence of quota limits on textile imports to the European market under the [[Lome Convention]] helped stimulate this growth.

[[Image:Port Toamasina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Port [[Toamasina]]]]

Growth in output in 1992–97 averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been held back by a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic commitment of the government to [[economic reform]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO Statistic Yearbook 2010&amp;nbsp;– Resources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Madagascar at a glance, 2/25/11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--FIND WEB LINKS--&gt;
During a period of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001 virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of 2002. [[Real GDP]] dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] dropped sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an AGOA standout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003. [[Currency depreciation]] and rising [[inflation]] in 2004 hampered economic performance, but growth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the end of the year. In 2005 inflation was brought under control by tight monetary policy of raising the ''Taux Directeur'' (central bank rate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was expected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.

During Ravalomanana's presidency, the government adopted a series of business laws and regulations, including the commercial companies law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897214.shtml|title=Loi n° 2003-036 sur les sociétés commerciales|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003), labor law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897224.shtml|title=Loi n° 2003-044 portant Code du travail|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003), regulations on the application of commercial companies law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897221.shtml|title=Décret n° 2004-453 fixant les modalités d'application de la Loi sur les sociétés commerciales|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2004), public procurement law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902899025.shtml|title=Loi n° 2004-009 portant Code des marchés publics|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2004), competition law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902898996.shtml|title=Loi n° 2005-020 sur la concurrence|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005), foreign exchange law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897223.shtml|title=Loi n° 2006-008 portant Code des changes|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006), investment law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897216.shtml|title=Loi n° 2007-036 sur les investissements à Madagascar|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2007), and free zones and free enterprises law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/policy/Madagascar/201909/20190902897217.shtml|title=Loi n° 2007-037 sur les zones et entreprises franches à Madagascar|last=|first=|date=|website=mofcom.gov.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2007).

==Food security, vulnerability and risk management==
{{Main|Food Security in Madagascar}}
[[Image:Antananarivo Street.JPG|thumb|Vibrant [[Antananarivo]] is the political and economic capital of Madagascar]]

Despite a wealth of abundant and diverse natural resources, Madagascar is one of the world's poorest countries. Madagascar holds great potential for agricultural development, mainly due to the large variety of soil types and climatic diversity. Nevertheless, [[natural hazards]] ([[cyclones]], [[drought]], [[locust]] invasions) combined with old-fashioned farming practices limit production.

The standard of living of the Malagasy population has been declining dramatically over the past 25 years. The country has gone from being a net exporter of agricultural products in the 1960s to a net importer since 1971. Inappropriate traditional agricultural methods cause soil to erode and soil quality to decline, and the basis of survival for Madagascar's people is under serious threat.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poverty reduction==
[[Image:Marktdag.jpg|thumb|left|Local market vendors.]]In 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper]] (PRSP) under the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) Initiative. The boards of the IMF and of the [[World Bank]] concurred in December 2000 that the country was eligible under the HIPC Initiative, and Madagascar reached the decision point for [[debt relief]]. On March 1, 2001, the IMF Board granted the country $103 million for 2001–03 under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGR). Resources were intended for improving access to health, education, rural roads, water, and direct support to communities. In addition, on March 7, 2001, the [[Paris Club]] approved a debt cancellation of $161 million. On February 28, 2001, the [[African Development Bank]] (ADB) approved under the HIPC a debt cancellation of $71.46 million and granted in June 2001 an additional credit of $20 million to fight against [[AIDS]] and [[poverty]].

Partly as a result of these credits but also as a result of previous reforms, average GDP growth exceeded the population growth rate of 2.8% in 1997 (3.5%), 1998 (3.9%), 1999 (4.7%) and 2000 (4.8%).

In October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the [[World Bank]] determined that Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

===Press freedom===

While the constitution provides for [[freedom of the press]], the ability of the press to criticize the regime is severely limited. In particular the absence of a communications code protecting press freedoms allows authorities to prosecute journalists under [[libel]] law and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting offends the facto regime.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

In November 2012 the de facto minister of communications stated that assertions harming the &quot;general interest&quot; were banned from public media. Gendarmes interrogated the editor-in-chief of ''Le Courrier de Madagascar'' for several hours in April 2012 after he ran a story entitled, &quot;Governance--the Brothel Takes Hold at High Levels.&quot; Investigative journalists are often targets of threats and harassment from authorities. In May 2012 police stopped a journalist from ''La Verite'', a pro-regime newspaper, on his way to cover an event in Antananarivo. Police reportedly beat him and broke his arm. All journalists released on bail remained subject to rearrest at any time.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

===Media restrictions===

Although the law provides for [[freedom of speech]], authorities severely restrict freedom of speech by intimidating opponents and resorting to imprisonment or violence when threats fail to dissuade critics. The de facto minister of communications targeted those who expressed dissent, sending official warning letters to news outlets whose coverage displeased the regime. From 2010 through 2012 an estimated 80 radio and television station licenses withdrawn and the stations ordered suspend broadcasting immediately. By the end of 2012 they had not been authorized to reopen. In September 2012 the editor of the national television station was suspended, reportedly for having opposition politicians on the air. Authorities also suspend journalists who continue to broadcast despite government warnings. To maintain access to sources and remain safe, journalists widely practiced [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

On 2 May 2012, authorities imprisoned the editors of the private radio station Free FM, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy and Fidel Razara Pierre, for a two-day investigation following a libel suit brought by Mamy Ravatomanga, a well-known backer of the de facto regime. Following a series of public rallies that same month marking the first anniversary of Free FM and calling for greater press freedom, the radio's editors were charged with provoking outrage against the regime, destruction of public goods, mounting opposition to security forces, and holding a public demonstration without authorization. On 22 July 2012, authorities closed the radio station, and the two journalists and another colleague went into hiding. By the end of 2012 Free FM remained closed. But after a deal consented with the two journalists and the regime, initiated by Mamy Ravatomanga, Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy is free and become the allied of the Rajoelina's regime.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Madagascar-2012/&gt;

The process of being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the [[Baptist]] and other [[Congregational]] groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.

Some Protestant denominations require that candidates for ordination be &quot;licensed&quot; to the ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries, such as music ministry or youth ministry.

Many Protestant denominations reject the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress the ''priesthood of all believers''. Based on this theological approach, most Protestants do not have a [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders|ordination]] like the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule, as the [[Book of Concord|Lutheran Book of Concord]] allows ordination to be received as a sacrament.

Some Protestant denominations dislike the word ''clergy'' and do not use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as [[pastor]]s or [[Religious minister|minister]]s, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as he or she holds a particular office.

== Islam ==

[[Islam]], like [[Judaism]], has no clergy in the [[sacerdotal]] sense; there is no institution resembling the Christian priesthood. Islamic religious leaders  do not &quot;serve as intermediaries between mankind and God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pipes-1983-38&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pipes |first1=Daniel |title=In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power |date=1983 |publisher=Routledge. |page=38 |isbn=9781351512916 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK00DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=clerics+in+Islam+are+more+like+rabbi+than+priest+daniel+pipes&amp;pg=PT61 |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have &quot;process of ordination&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|author-link = Jonathan A.C. Brown|title = Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy|date = 2014|publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]]|isbn = 978-1780744209|url = https://archive.org/details/misquotingmuhamm0000brow/page/24|access-date = 4 June 2018|ref = JACBMM2014|page = [https://archive.org/details/misquotingmuhamm0000brow/page/24 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor  &quot;sacramental functions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pipes-1983-38&quot;/&gt; They have been said to resemble more rabbis, serving as &quot;exemplars, teachers, judges, and community leaders,&quot; providing religious rules to the pious on &quot;even the most minor and private&quot; matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;pipes-1983-38&quot;/&gt;

The title ''[[mullah]]'' (a Persian variation of the Arabic ''maula'', &quot;master&quot;), commonly translated &quot;cleric&quot; in the West and thought to be analogous to &quot;priest&quot; or &quot;rabbi&quot;, is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The title ''[[sheikh]]'' (&quot;elder&quot;) is used similarly.

Most of the religious titles associated with Islam are scholastic or academic in nature: they recognize the holder's exemplary knowledge of the theory and practice of ''ad-dín'' (religion), and do not confer any particular spiritual or sacerdotal authority. The most general such title is ''`alim'' (pl. ''[[Ulama|`ulamah]]''), or &quot;scholar&quot;. This word describes someone engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences ''(`ulum)'' at an Islamic university or ''[[Madrasa|madrasah jami`ah]]''. A scholar's opinions may be valuable to others because of his/her knowledge in religious matters; but such opinions should not generally be considered binding, infallible, or absolute, as the individual Muslim is directly responsible to God for his or her own religious beliefs and practice.

There is no sacerdotal office corresponding to the Christian priest or Jewish ''kohen'', as there is no sacrificial rite of atonement comparable to the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Korban]]. [[Ritual slaughter]] or ''[[dhabihah]]'', including the ''qurban'' at ''[[Eid al-Adha|`Idu l-Ad'ha]],'' may be performed by any adult Muslim who is physically able and properly trained. Professional butchers may be employed, but they are not necessary; in the case of the ''qurban'', it is especially preferable to slaughter one's own animal if possible.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

===Sunni===
[[File:Gérôme - Mufti Reading in His Prayer Stool.jpg|thumb|A [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] cleric ([[mufti]]) delivering a sermon on the [[Chair|kursi]]]]
The nearest analogue among Sunni Muslims to the parish priest or pastor, or to the &quot;pulpit [[rabbi]]&quot; of a synagogue, is called the ''imam khatib.'' This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader ''(imam)'' of the congregational prayer, which in most mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher ''(khatib)'' of the sermon or ''khutba'' of the obligatory congregational prayer at midday every Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques ''imam khatib'' is a permanent part-time or full-time position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority – e.g., the national government, or the [[waqf]] which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as an ''imam khatib'' is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam.

The title ''[[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]]'' (lit. &quot;preserver&quot;) is awarded to one who has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the purpose; the ''imam khatib'' of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a ''hafiz.''

There are several specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or ''[[Sharia|shari`ah]].'' A scholar with a specialty in ''fiqh'' or jurisprudence is known as a ''[[faqih]]''. A ''[[qadi]]'' is a judge in an Islamic court. A ''[[mufti]]'' is a scholar who has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial opinions or ''[[fatwa|fatawah]]''.

===Shia===
[[File:Nahavandi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iranian people|Iranian]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] cleric and author Sheikh Ali Akbar Nahavandi.]]
In modern [[Shia Islam]], scholars play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam; and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as ''[[Ayatollah]]''. Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been used in [[Twelver]] Shi`ism, namely ''marjaʿ at-taqlid''. ''[[Marjaʿ]]'' (pl. ''marajiʿ'') means &quot;source&quot;, and ''taqlid'' refers to religious emulation or imitation. Lay Shi`ah must identify a specific ''marjaʿ'' whom they emulate, according to his legal opinions ''(fatawah)'' or other writings. On several occasions, the ''Marjaʿiyyat'' (community of all ''marajiʿ'') has been limited to a single individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living in the Twelver Shi'ah world. Of broader importance has been the role of the ''mujtahid'', a cleric of superior knowledge who has the authority to perform ''[[ijtihad]]'' (independent judgment). Mujtahids are few in number, but it is from their ranks that the ''marajiʿ at-taqlid'' are drawn.

===Sufism===
[[File:Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] cleric [[Ali Khan (Sufi)|Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan]].]]
The spiritual guidance function known in many Christian denominations as &quot;pastoral care&quot; is fulfilled for many Muslims by a ''murshid'' (&quot;guide&quot;), a master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as ''tasawuf'' or [[Sufism]]. Sufi guides are commonly styled ''Shaikh'' in both speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called ''[[marabout]]s''. They are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching lineage reaching back to [[Muhammad]]. (The lineal succession of guides bears a superficial similarity to Christian ordination and apostolic succession, or to Buddhist dharma transmission; but a Sufi guide is regarded primarily as a specialized teacher and Islam denies the existence of an earthly hierarchy among believers.)

Muslims who wish to learn Sufism dedicate themselves to a ''murshid''&amp;apos;s guidance by taking an oath called a ''[[Bay'ah|bai'ah]]''. The aspirant is then known as a ''murid'' (&quot;disciple&quot; or &quot;follower&quot;). A ''murid'' who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is sometimes known as a [[dervish]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], it was common for scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the &quot;exterior sciences&quot; ''(`ulum az-zahir)'' of the madrasahs as well as the &quot;interior sciences&quot; ''(`ulum al-batin)'' of Sufism. [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi]] are two notable examples.

===Ahmadiyya===
The highest office an Ahmadi can hold is that of [[Khalifatul Masih|''Khalifatu l-Masih'']]. Such a person may appoint amirs who manage regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Resurgence in Ghana Since 1950: Nathan Samwini - 2003 p151&lt;/ref&gt; The consultative body for Ahmadiyya is called the ''Majlis-i-Shura'', which ranks second in importance to the ''Khalifatu l-Masih''.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice'', p.93, Simon Ross Valentine, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ahmadiyya community is declared as [[Persecution of Ahmadis|non-Muslims]] by many mainstream Muslims and they reject the messianic claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.

== Judaism ==
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Jewry]]
[[Rabbinic Judaism]] does not have clergy as such, although according to the [[Torah]] there is a tribe of priests known as the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] who were leaders of the religion up to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD when most [[Sadducee]]s were wiped out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the synagogue and perform the ''[[Pidyon haben]]'' (redemption of the first-born son) ceremony.

Since the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the religious leaders of Judaism have often been [[rabbi]]s, who are technically scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]]. All types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be ordained as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |title=Orthodox Women To Be Trained As Clergy, If Not Yet as Rabbis – |publisher=Forward.com |access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml |title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult male Jew (or adult Jew in non-traditional congregations) can lead prayer services. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah; the first time this word is mentioned is in the [[Mishnah]]. The modern form of the rabbi developed in the [[Talmud]]ic era. Rabbis are given authority to make interpretations of [[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]]. Traditionally, a man obtains one of three levels of [[Semicha]] (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an arduous learning program in Torah, [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud, [[Midrash]], Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].

[[File:ReginaJonas1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Regina Jonas]], the world's first female rabbi, ordained in 1935, killed in the [[Holocaust]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/jonas-regina |title=Jonas Regina}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the early medieval era an additional communal role, the ''[[Hazzan]]'' (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services, primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or &quot;sacramental&quot; distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to perform weddings, and certify births and deaths.

Additionally, Jewish authorities license ''[[mohel]]s'', people specially trained by experts in Jewish law and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision.&lt;ref name=&quot;jweekly1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/ |title=Making the cut {{pipe}} j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=3 March 2006 |access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Orthodox Judaism does not license women as mohels, but other types of Judaism do. They are appropriately called ''mohelot'' (pl. of ''mohelet,'' f. of mohel)
[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/]. As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California states, &quot;...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but] none exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be undertaken by a Jewish man.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jweekly1&quot;/&gt;

In many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual purity, cannot act as mohels, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but some mohels are also either rabbis or cantors.

Another licensed cleric in Judaism is the ''[[shochet]]'', who are trained and licensed by religious authorities for [[kosher]] slaughter according to ritual law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandin|first=Temple|year=1980|title=Problems With Kosher Slaughter|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_faafp/21/|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|volume=1 |issue=6|pages=375–390|via=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then there is the ''[[mashgiach]]''. A ''mashgiach'' is someone who supervises the ''[[kashrut]]'' status of a kosher establishment. The ''mashgiach'' must know the Torah laws of ''kashrut'', and how they apply in the environment he is supervising. Obviously, this can vary. In many instances, the ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi. This helps, since rabbinical students learn the laws of kosher as part of their syllabus. However, not every ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi, and not every rabbi is qualified to be a ''mashgiach''.

=== Orthodox Judaism ===
In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming rabbis or cantors.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Most Orthodox rabbinical seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but few require a formal degree from a civil education institution that often define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education.

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], generally understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual leaders known as ''[[Rebbe]]s'', often translated in English as &quot;Grand Rabbi&quot;. The office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, but may also be passed from Rebbe to student or by recognition of a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an ordained rabbi to be a Rebbe, at some points in history there were female Rebbes as well, particularly the [[Maiden of Ludmir]].

=== Conservative Judaism ===
In [[Conservative Judaism]], both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous.  First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and [[rabbinic literature]], philosophy and theology, liturgy, Jewish history, and Hebrew literature of all periods.

=== Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism ===
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] do not maintain the traditional requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law, but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.

== Sikhism ==
[[Sikh]] clergy consists of five ''[[Jathedar]]s'', one each from five ''[[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]]'' or sacred seats. The ''Jathedars'' are appointed by the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs sometimes called the &quot;Parliament of Sikhs.&quot; The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called ''[[Akal Takht]]'' and the ''Jathedar'' of ''Akal Takht'' makes all the important decisions after consultations with the ''Jathedars'' of the other four ''takhts'' and the SGPC.

==Traditional religions==
{{See also|Imperial cult}}

Historically [[Ethnic religion|traditional]] (or ''[[pagan]]'') religions typically combine religious authority and political power. What this means is that the [[sacred king|sacred king or queen]] is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high priest or priestess (see, for example, the [[Maya priesthood]]). When the functions of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, [[Apotheosis|deification]] could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s. The [[Vedic priesthood]] of India is an early instance of a structured body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon the priestly monarchs of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] holy city of [[Ile-Ife]] in [[Nigeria]], whose reigning [[List of rulers of Ife|Oni]]s have performed ritual ceremonies for centuries for the sustenance of the entire planet and its people.

== Health risks for ministry in the United States ==

In recent years, studies have suggested that American clergy in certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions are more at risk than the general population of obesity, hypertension and depression. Their life expectancies have fallen in recent years and in the last decade their use of antidepressants has risen.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Several religious bodies in the United States ([[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Baptists|Baptist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]) have implemented measures to address the issue, through [[Workplace wellness|wellness]] campaigns, for example - but also by simply ensuring that clergy take more time off. It is unclear whether similar symptoms affect American [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics, although an anecdotal comment by one American imam suggested that leaders of mosques may also share these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02burnout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clergy&amp;st=cse|title=Evidence Grows of Problem of Clergy Burnout|first=Paul|last=Vitello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the findings of these studies is the case of American [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests, who are required by [[canon law]] to take a spiritual retreat each year, and four weeks of vacation. Sociological studies at the [[University of Chicago]] have confirmed this exception; the studies also took the results of several earlier studies into consideration and included Roman Catholic priests nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;
See A. M. Greeley, ''Priests: A Calling in Crisis'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004).
&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear whether American clergy in other religious traditions experience the same symptoms, or whether clergy outside the United States are similarly affected.

'''Post-Keynesian economics''' is a [[Schools of economic thought|school]] of [[economic thought]] with its origins in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|The General Theory]]'' of [[John Maynard Keynes]], with subsequent development influenced to a large degree by [[Michał Kalecki]], [[Joan Robinson]], [[Nicholas Kaldor]], [[Sidney Weintraub (economist born 1914)|Sidney Weintraub]], [[Paul Davidson (economist)|Paul Davidson]], [[Piero Sraffa]] and [[Jan Kregel]]. Historian [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]] argues that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes' original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skidelsky|2009|loc=p. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial markets, money and the real world, by Paul Davidson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88XA6OHxVAcC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;q=post-keynesian pp. 88–89]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Heterodox economics|heterodox approach to economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lavoie|first=Marc|date=2006|pages=1–24|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780230626300_1|isbn=9781349283378|title=Introduction to Post-Keynesian Economics|chapter=Post-Keynesian Heterodoxy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dequech|first=David|date=2012|title=Post Keynesianism, Heterodoxy and Mainstream Economics|journal=Review of Political Economy|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=353–368|doi=10.1080/09538259.2012.664364|issn=0953-8259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The term &quot;post-Keynesian&quot; was first used to refer to a distinct school of economic thought by [[Alfred Eichner|Eichner]] and Kregel (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eichner and Kregel|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the establishment of the ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' in 1978. Prior to 1975, and occasionally in more recent work, ''post-Keynesian'' could simply mean economics carried out after 1936, the date of Keynes's ''General Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|King|2002|loc=p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Keynesian economists are united in maintaining that Keynes' theory is seriously misrepresented by the two other principal Keynesian schools: [[neo-Keynesian economics]], which was orthodox in the 1950s and 60s, and [[new Keynesian economics]], which together with various strands of [[neoclassical economics]] has been dominant in mainstream [[macroeconomics]] since the 1980s. Post-Keynesian economics can be seen as an attempt to rebuild economic theory in the light of Keynes' ideas and insights. However, even in the early years, post-Keynesians such as Joan Robinson sought to distance themselves from Keynes and much current post-Keynesian thought cannot be found in Keynes. Some post-Keynesians took a more progressive view than Keynes himself, with greater emphases on worker-friendly policies and redistribution. Robinson, Paul Davidson and  [[Hyman Minsky]] emphasized the effects on the economy of practical differences between different types of investments, in contrast to Keynes' more abstract treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hayes|2008}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundation of post-Keynesian economics is the principle of [[effective demand]], that demand matters in the long as well as the short run, so that a competitive market economy has no natural or automatic tendency towards [[full employment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arestis|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the views of new Keynesian economists working in the neoclassical tradition, post-Keynesians do not accept that the theoretical basis of the market's failure to provide full employment is rigid or [[sticky prices]] or wages. Post-Keynesians typically reject the [[IS–LM model]] of [[John Hicks]], which is very influential in neo-Keynesian economics, because they argue endogenous bank lending to be more significant than central banks' money supply for the interest rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palley|first=Thomas|date=2008-01-01|title=Macroeconomics without the LM: A Post-Keynesian Perspective|url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/peri_workingpapers/175|journal=PERI Working Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of post-Keynesian economics&lt;ref&gt;For a general introduction see {{Harvnb|Holt|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; has extended beyond the theory of aggregate employment to theories of income distribution, growth, trade and development in which money demand plays a key role, whereas in neoclassical economics these are determined by the forces of technology, preferences and endowment. In the field of monetary theory, post-Keynesian economists were among the first to emphasise that money supply responds to the demand for bank credit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaldor|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that a [[central bank]] cannot control the quantity of money, but only manage the interest rate by managing the quantity of monetary reserves.

This view has largely been incorporated into [[monetary policy]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which now targets the interest rate as an instrument, rather than the quantity of money. In the field of finance, Hyman Minsky put forward a theory of financial crisis based on [[financial fragility]], which has received renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palley|first=Thomas|date=April 2010|title=The Limits of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis as an Explanation of the Crisis|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2010/04/01/the-limits-of-minskys-financial-instability-hypothesis-as-an-explanation-of-the-crisis/|journal=Monthly Review|volume=61|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minsky|1975}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strands ==
There are a number of strands to post-Keynesian theory with different emphases. Joan Robinson regarded [[Michał Kalecki]]’s theory of effective demand to be superior to Keynes’ theories. Kalecki's theory is based on a [[class division]] between workers and capitalists and imperfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson also led the critique of the use of aggregate production functions based on homogeneous capital – the [[Cambridge capital controversy]] – winning the argument but not the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pasinetti|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Piero Sraffa]] were a significant influence on the post-Keynesian position in this debate, though Sraffa and his [[Neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian]] followers drew more inspiration from [[David Ricardo]] than Keynes. Much of [[Nicholas Kaldor]]’s work was based on the ideas of increasing returns to scale, path dependency, and the key differences between the primary and industrial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harcourt|2006}},  {{Harvnb|Pasinetti|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Davidson&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows Keynes closely in placing time and uncertainty at the centre of theory, from which flow the nature of money and of a monetary economy. [[Monetary circuit theory]], originally developed in continental Europe, places particular emphasis on the distinctive role of money as means of payment. Each of these strands continues to see further development by later generations of economists.

[[Modern Monetary Theory]] is a relatively recent offshoot influenced by the macroeconomic modelling of [[Wynne Godley]] and [[Hyman Minsky]]'s ideas on the labour market, as well as [[chartalism]] and [[functional finance]].

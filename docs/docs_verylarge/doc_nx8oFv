Omaha's position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the [[Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge]] that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L.H., Cottrell, B.J., Dalstrom, H.A.

In the 1890s, the [[Illinois Central]] drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha's Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the [[Works Progress Administration]]-financed [[South Omaha Bridge]], now called Veteran's Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the [[Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge]], which opened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbparksandrec.org/documents/BOB-KERREY-PEDESTRIAN-BRIDGE-FACTS---revised.pdf &quot;Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge Facts&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206153244/http://www.cbparksandrec.org/documents/BOB-KERREY-PEDESTRIAN-BRIDGE-FACTS---revised.pdf |date=February 6, 2009 }}, City of Council Bluffs, Iowa Parks and Recreation Department.

It described 2008 presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] as &quot;the most radical candidate ever to stand at the precipice of acquiring his party's presidential nomination. It is apparent that he is a member of an international socialist movement.&quot;  It also criticized the media's response to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; 

AIM, which opposes the scientific consensus on climate change, has criticized media reporting on climate change. The organization gives out the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award. Past recipients include [[Marc Morano]] (who runs the [[climate change denial]] website ClimateDepot), Tucker Carlson, and Jim Hoft (who runs the far-right conspiracy website [[Gateway Pundit]]).

==History==
Accuracy in Media (AIM) was founded in 1969 by [[Reed Irvine]], an economist at the [[Federal Reserve Bank]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7e5nBwAAQBAJ|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|last2=Ciment|first2=James|date=March 17, 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317473503|location=|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goss|first=Brian Michael|date=August 1, 2009|title=The Left-Media's Stranglehold|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=10|issue=4|pages=455–473|doi=10.1080/14616700902783895|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce what they perceive as bias in media reporting, AIM works to &quot;investigate complaints, take proven cases to top media officials, seek corrections and mobilize public pressure to bring about remedial action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/us/reed-irvine-82-the-founder-of-a-media-criticism-group-dies.html|title=Reed Irvine, 82, the Founder of a Media Criticism Group, Dies|date=2004-11-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed Irvine and then-executive secretary Abraham Kalish sent letters to the editors of many newspapers and magazines they identified as skewed, calling out slanted news stories. If the newspaper rejected the letter, AIM bought space and printed the letter in that newspaper. Beginning in 1975, Accuracy in Media began purchasing [[stock]] in major media companies, allowing Irvine to attend annual shareholder meetings. He used these opportunities to express the AIM's concerns to the various companies' owners. Reed's son, Don, chairs the organization. Don Irvine referred to his father as a &quot;die-hard anti-communist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine&quot;&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58852-2004Nov17.html Obituary of Reed Irvine, 82], ''The Washington Post'', November 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Irvine was mentioned by Walter Goodman of ''[[The New York Times]]'' for &quot;his efforts to put pressure on networks and advertisers to crack down on reporters to whom he takes exception do not mark him as an enthusiast of unfettered expression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTFairnessAndAccuracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Walter|title=TV VIEW; Let's Be Frank About Fairness And Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/arts/tv-view-let-s-be-frank-about-fairness-and-accuracy.html?mcubz=0|accessdate=October 2, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=June 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Irvine's death in 2004, an editorial in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' said that &quot;[Irvine] was stone blind to his own prejudices, and he could be scurrilous and unfair in his attacks, but he knew something about our major media&quot; and credited Irvine in part for the rise of the popular conservative view that the American media is imbued with a liberal bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;CJRDefiningBias&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Hoyt|first1=Mike|title=Defining Bias Downward: Holding Political Power to Account Is Not Some Liberal Plot|url=http://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/defining_bias_downward_holding.php|accessdate=October 2, 2017|magazine=Columbia Journalism Review|date=January 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', while Irvine worked at the [[Federal Reserve]], co-workers he would eat lunch with often “complained that conservative points of view were not adequately reported in the media.” In his way of changing this, Irvine formed AIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Media Watchdog Reed Irvine, 82 (washingtonpost.com)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58852-2004Nov17.html|access-date=2020-06-30|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also said that [[Reed Irvine]] was urged to start the organization after the 1968 [[Democratic National Convention]] because he thought the mainstream media networks were overly sympathetic to antiwar protestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman&quot; /&gt;

Membership to AIM grew significantly when [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] was president, topping 40,000 members with a budget of $1.5 million. As the organization grew, [[Reed Irvine]] was also a shareholder in media companies. During a shareholder meeting for [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] in 1989, Irvine said at the meeting that conservative leaning organizations had a difficult time getting their views presented on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] and this was not the case for more liberal leaning groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/arts/media-critic-accuses-turner-s-tbs-of-bias.html|title=Media Critic Accuses Turner's TBS of Bias|date=1989-07-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2020, the current president of AIM is Adam Guillette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aim.org/aim-column/aim-hires-adam-guillette-as-new-president/|title=AIM Hires Adam Guillette as New President|date=2019-10-18|website=Accuracy in Media|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
AIM's income in 1971 was $5,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; By the early 1980s, it was $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In 2009, AIM received $500,000 in contributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/deciding-whats-true/9780231542227|title=Deciding What's True: The Rise of Political Fact-Checking in American Journalism|last=Graves|first=Lucas|date=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231542227|location=|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least eight separate oil companies are known to have been contributors in the early 80s. Only three donors are given by name: the Allied Educational Foundation (founded and chaired by [[George Barasch]]), [[Shelby Cullom Davis]], and billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. Scaife gave $2.2&amp;nbsp;million to Accuracy in Media between 1977 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/05/02/decades-of-contributions-to-conservatism/711c6621-3c29-401d-8d53-990cc298f020/|title=Decades of Contributions to Conservatism|year=1999|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIM has been funded by [[Exxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbVcIc8w6w4C&amp;dq=Oreskes+haydn+Climate+Change+Denial|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand|last=Washington|first=Haydn|date=May 13, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136530043|location=|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===War coverage===
AIM was critical of media reports about the harmful effects of [[Agent Orange]], a military herbicide with adverse health effects for humans, in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; AIM blamed the U.S. media for the loss in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; AIM criticized the 1983 [[PBS]] documentary series ''Vietnam: A Television History'' as being pro-communist. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', one of AIM's greatest accomplishments was the documentary, ''Television's Vietnam: The Real Story'' in response to the PBS series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/01/22/PBS-accused-of-pro-communist-programming/2948506754000/|title=PBS accused of 'pro-communist' programming|agency=United Press International|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIM charged the alliance conducting the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO Kosovo intervention]] in 1999 with distorting the situation in Kosovo and lying about the number of civilian deaths in order to justify U.S. involvement in the conflict under the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Irvine |first1=Reed |last2=Kincaid |first2=Cliff |title=Deceit And Lies Over Kosovo |url=https://www.aim.org/media-monitor/deceit-and-lies-over-kosovo/ |website=aim.org |publisher=Accuracy in Media |date=November 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIM supported the Iraq War and accused the media of bias against the Iraq War in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; and alleged bias in mainstream media's coverage of the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In 2008, AIM asserted &quot;Waterboarding Is Not Torture&quot; in a sub-heading. The article said that [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detainees &quot;are enjoying hotel living conditions&quot; and that torture is what &quot;left-wingers associate with anything that makes an accused terrorist uncomfortable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Human rights===
In 1982, ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Raymond Bonner]] broke the story of the [[El Mozote massacre]] in El Salvador. The report was strongly criticized by AIM and the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], and Bonner was pressured into business reporting, later deciding to resign. Although the report was embarrassing to the Reagan administration, which was heavily aiding the right-wing junta at the time, skeletons unearthed a decade later confirmed the original story's veracity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consortiumnews.com/2007/012907.html&lt;/ref&gt; AIM was critical of journalist Helen Marmor, who in 1983 produced a documentary for [[NBC]] concerning the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rightweb.irc-online.org/gw/1488 |title=Group Watch Profile: Accuracy In Media |access-date=September 6, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609160922/http://rightweb.irc-online.org/gw/1488 |archive-date=June 9, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; AIM contended that &quot;it ignored the repressive religious policies of the Soviet state.&quot;

===Vince Foster conspiracy theory===
AIM received a substantial amount of funding from [[Richard Mellon Scaife]] who paid [[Christopher W. Ruddy]] to investigate allegations that President [[Bill Clinton]] was connected to the suicide of [[Vince Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Trudy |last=Lieberman |url=http://archives.cjr.org/year/96/2/foster.asp |title=The Vincent Foster Factory|magazine=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=April 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223081215/http://archives.cjr.org/year/96/2/foster.asp |archive-date=February 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIM contended that &quot;Foster was murdered&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim.org/aim_report/A2212_0_4_0_C/ AIM Report: Evidence Proving Foster Was Murdered] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914082336/http://www.aim.org/aim_report/A2212_0_4_0_C/ |date=September 14, 2006 }} July 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; which is contrary to three independent reports including one by [[Kenneth Starr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Starrreport&quot;&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/docs/foster.htm Full text] of the report on the 1993 death of White House counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., compiled by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr. After an exhaustive three-year investigation, Starr reaffirmed that Foster's death was a suicide&lt;/ref&gt; AIM faulted the media for not picking up on the conspiracy,&lt;ref name=&quot;evidence&quot;&gt;[http://www.realnews247.com/accuracy_in_media_vince_foster.htm Vincent Foster Murder Evidence] Accuracy in Media.&lt;/ref&gt; and applied itself for [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) disclosure of Foster's death-scene photographs. Its suit to compel disclosure was denied by the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District Court of Columbia]] in a summary judgment, unanimously affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cann|first=Steven J.|title=Administrative Law|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6V_lVpZGyIIC&amp;pg=PA246|year=2005|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-1396-6|page=246|chapter=National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish 124 Ct. 1570 (2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIM credited much of its reporting on the Foster case to Ruddy.&lt;ref&gt;See: Notes Section for &quot;Chris Ruddy&quot; [http://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/2001/6.html The Case Against James T. Riady], Accuracy in Media 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his work was called a &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;discredited&quot; by conservatives such as [[Ann Coulter]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Even if Christopher Ruddy's ''[[The Strange Death of Vincent Foster]]'' was considered a conservative hoax book, it was also conservatives who discredited it.&quot; Chapter Six Endnote 105, pp. 224–225, ''[[Slander (book)|Slander]]'', [[Ann Coulter]].&lt;/ref&gt; it was also disputed by the ''[[American Spectator]]'', which caused Scaife to end his funding of the [[Arkansas Project]] with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife092998.htm Anti-Clinton Billionaire Goes Before Grand Jury]'' Washington Post'', September 29, 1998,&lt;/ref&gt; As [[CNN]] explained on February 28, 1997, &quot;The [Starr] report refutes claims by conservative political organizations that Foster was the victim of a murder plot and coverup&quot;, but &quot;despite those findings, right-wing political groups have continued to allege that there was more to the death and that the president and First Lady tried to cover it up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/02/23/starr.report/ Report: Starr Rules Out Foul Play In Foster Death] CNN February 23, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
AIM has been critical of the [[United Nations]] and its coverage by the media. In February 2005, AIM alleged that United Nations correspondents, including Ian Williams, a correspondent for ''[[The Nation]]'' had accepted money from the UN while covering it for their publications. AIM also asserted that the [[United Nations Correspondents Association]] may have violated immigration laws by employing the Williams' wife.&lt;ref&gt;Accuracy in Media press release, [http://www.aim.org/press_release/2682_0_19_0_C/ &quot;U.N.

AIM has campaigned against the United States signing the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; AIM writes, &quot;UNCLOS is a foot in the door for a wide-ranging international agenda... America's survival as a sovereign nation hangs in the balance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; AIM argued that signing up to UNCLOS could lead to the prohibition of spanking children.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Climate change===
AIM rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In 2008, AIM wrote, &quot;the theory of man-made global warming is designed to increase government control over our economy and our lives through higher taxes and energy rationing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In November 2005, AIM columnist [[Cliff Kincaid]] criticized [[Fox News]] for broadcasting a program ''The Heat is On'', which reported that [[global warming]] represents a serious problem (the program was broadcast with a disclaimer). Kincaid argued the piece was one-sided and stated that this &quot;scandal&quot; amounted to a &quot;hostile takeover of Fox News.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Kincaid, [http://www.aim.org/aim_column/4184_0_3_0_C &quot;Hostile Takeover of Fox News&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227014515/http://www.aim.org/aim_column/4184_0_3_0_C |date=December 27, 2005 }}, November 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Kincaid criticized Fox for &quot;tilting to the left&quot; on the issue of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/fox-news-drifting-left/9366/|title=Fox News Drifting Left?|website=Adweek|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIM criticized the media for not covering a 1995 study on climate change, which it argued cast doubt on climate change. One of the authors of the study responded to AIM, &quot;The paper... focused on a discrepancy between observations and theoretical climate model predictions—the sort of thing that climate change deniers love to take out of context and hype. The conservative organization Accuracy in Media took note of the study, citing lack of media coverage of it as some sort of evidence of media bias in coverage of climate change—something that I, to this day, find puzzling as the paper actually dealt with a relatively obscure technical detail of climate models and hardly challenged the mainstream view that human activity was leading to the warming of the globe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-hockey-stick-and-the-climate-wars/9780231152549|title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines|last=Nye|first=Michael E. Mann With a foreword by Bill|date=March 2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231526388|location=|pages=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barack Obama ===
In 2008, AIM described [[Barack Obama]], who was at the time a candidate in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], as &quot;the most radical candidate ever to stand at the precipice of acquiring his party's presidential nomination. It is apparent that he is a member of an international socialist movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; AIM titled one of its reports, &quot;Is Barack Obama a Marxist Mole?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In the lead-up to the 2008 election, AIM wrote, &quot;there is a pattern of people who hate America showing up at critical junctures in Obama's life and career to influence and advise him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== COVID-19 Pandemic ===
In March 2020, the president of AIM, Adam Guillette, took a stance on the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] outbreak, asserting that the media is exaggerating the pandemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Coronavirus Crisis: Still Dividing Americans More Than Uniting Them?|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/816273140/coronavirus-crisis-still-dividing-americans-more-than-uniting-them|access-date=2020-06-24|website=NPR.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accuracy in Media Award ===

The organization gives out the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award, which has attracted controversy for some of its recipients.

In 2010, AIM gave the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award to political activist [[Marc Morano]], who is known for running the website ClimateDepot, which rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Accuracy in Media|title=AIM: Marc Morano upon receiving The Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award at CPAC 2010|date=February 22, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apjAsonHFpg|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2012/12/27/climate-change-misinformer-of-the-year-marc-mor/191878|title=Climate Change Misinformer of the Year: Marc Morano|date=December 17, 2012|website=Media Matters for America|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrdc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/frances-beinecke/climate-change-scientific-reality-not-political-debate|title=Climate Change Is a Scientific Reality, Not a Political Debate|last=March 17|last2=Beinecke|first2=2010 Frances|website=NRDC|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, AIM gave the award to [[Tucker Carlson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2011/01/31/tucker_carlson/|title=Tucker Carlson to receive media &quot;accuracy&quot; award|date=January 31, 2011|website=Salon|access-date=June 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, ''vowel harmony'' refers only to ''progressive'' vowel harmony (beginning-to-end). For ''regressive'' harmony, the term ''umlaut'' is used. In this sense, ''metaphony'' is the general term while ''vowel harmony'' and ''umlaut'' are both sub-types of metaphony. The term ''umlaut'' is also used in a different sense to refer to a type of [[vowel gradation]]. This article will use &quot;vowel harmony&quot; for both progressive and regressive harmony.

==&quot;Long-distance&quot;==

Harmony processes are &quot;long-distance&quot; in the sense that the assimilation involves sounds that are separated by intervening [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s (usually consonant segments). In other words, ''harmony'' refers to the assimilation of sounds that are ''not'' adjacent to each other. For example, a vowel at the beginning of a word can trigger assimilation in a vowel at the end of a word. The assimilation occurs across the entire word in many languages. This is represented schematically in the following diagram:

:{| cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 110%;&quot;
! &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;before&lt;br&gt;assimilation&lt;/span&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
! &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;after&lt;br&gt;assimilation&lt;/span&gt;
|
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C
| '''→'''
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; = type-a vowel, &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; = type-b vowel, C = consonant)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In the diagram above, the &lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (type-a vowel) causes the following &lt;span style=&quot;color:#008000&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (type-b vowel) to assimilate and become the same type of vowel (and thus they become, metaphorically, &quot;in harmony&quot;).

The vowel that causes the vowel assimilation is frequently termed the ''trigger'' while the vowels that assimilate (or ''harmonize'') are termed ''targets''. When the vowel triggers lie within the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or [[word stem|stem]] of a word and the [[affix]]es contain the targets, this is called ''stem-controlled'' vowel harmony (the opposite situation is called ''dominant'').&lt;ref name=&quot;van der Hulst1995&quot;&gt;van der Hulst, H., &amp; van de Weijer, J.

| {{lang|hu|város'''-nak'''}}
| 'city'
|-
| {{lang|hu|öröm}}
| {{lang|hu|öröm'''-nek'''}}
| 'joy'
|}

The dative suffix has two different forms {{lang|hu|-nak/-nek}}. The {{lang|hu|-nak}} form appears after the root with back vowels ({{lang|hu|o}} and {{lang|hu|a}} are back vowels). The {{lang|hu|-nek}} form appears after the root with front vowels ({{lang|hu|ö}} and {{lang|hu|e}} are front vowels).

* [[Nasalization]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. oral or nasal) ''(in this case, a [[nasal consonant]] is usually the trigger)'' {{Citation needed |date=February 2019}}

In many languages, vowels can be said to belong to particular sets or classes, such as back vowels or rounded vowels. Some languages have more than one system of harmony. For instance, [[Altaic languages]] are proposed to have a rounding harmony superimposed over a backness harmony.

Even among languages with vowel harmony, not all vowels need to participate in the vowel conversions; these vowels are termed ''neutral''. Neutral vowels may be ''opaque'' and block harmonic processes or they may be ''transparent'' and not affect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;van der Hulst1995&quot; /&gt; Intervening consonants are also often transparent.

Finally, languages that do have vowel harmony often allow for lexical ''disharmony'', or words with mixed sets of vowels even when an opaque neutral vowel is not involved. Van der Hulst &amp; van de Weijer (1995) point to two such situations: polysyllabic trigger morphemes may contain non-neutral vowels from opposite harmonic sets and certain target morphemes simply fail to harmonize.&lt;ref name=&quot;van der Hulst1995&quot; /&gt; Many [[loanword]]s exhibit disharmony. For example, Turkish {{lang|tr|vakit}}, ('time' [from Arabic {{transl|ar|waqt}}]); *{{lang|tr|vak'''ı'''t}} would have been expected.

There are three classes of vowels in [[Korean language|Korean]]: positive, negative, and neutral. These categories loosely follow the front (positive) and mid (negative) vowels. [[Middle Korean]] had strong vowel harmony; however, this rule is no longer observed strictly in modern Korean. In modern Korean, it is only applied in certain cases such as [[onomatopoeia]], [[adjectives]], [[adverbs]], [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and [[interjection]]s. The vowel {{lang|ko|ㅡ}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}) is considered a partially neutral and a partially negative vowel. There are other traces of vowel harmony in modern Korean: many native Korean words tend to follow vowel harmony such as {{lang|ko|사람}} ({{transl|ko|saram}}, 'person'), and {{lang|ko|부엌}} ({{transl|ko|bu-eok}}, 'kitchen').

[[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] exhibits both a [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue root harmony]] and a rounding harmony. In particular, the tongue root harmony involves the vowels: {{IPA|/a, ʊ, ɔ/}} (+RTR) and {{IPA|/i, u, e, o/}} (-RTR). The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is phonetically similar to the -RTR vowels, however, it is largely transparent to vowel harmony. Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, {{IPA|/e, o, a, ɔ/}}. Some sources refer to the primary harmonization dimension as pharyngealization or patalalness (among others), but neither of these is technically correct. Likewise, referring to ±RTR as the sole defining feature of vowel categories in Mongolian is not fully accurate either. In any case, the two vowel categories differ primarily with regards to tongue root position, and ±RTR is a convenient and fairly accurate descriptor for the articulatory parameters involved.&lt;ref&gt;Svantesson, J.-O., Tsendina, A., Karlsson, A., &amp; Franzén, V.

|}

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has a 2-dimensional vowel harmony system, where vowels are characterised by two features: [±front] and [±rounded]. There are two sets of vocal harmony systems: a simple one and a complex one. The simple one is concerned with the '''low vowels e, a''' and has only the [±front] feature (''e'' front vs ''a'' back). The complex one is concerned with the '''high vowels i, ü, ı, u''' and has both [±front] and [±rounded] features (''i'' front unrounded vs ''ü'' front rounded and ''ı'' back unrounded vs ''u'' back rounded). The close-mid vowels ''ö, o'' are not involved in vowel harmony processes.

=====Front/back harmony=====
[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has two classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'' and ''back''. Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. ''Türkiye''''de''''' &quot;in Turkey&quot; but ''Almanya''''da''''' &quot;in Germany&quot;.

=====Rounding harmony=====
In addition, there is a secondary rule that ''i'' and ''ı'' in suffixes tend to become ''ü'' and ''u'' respectively after rounded vowels, so certain suffixes have additional forms. This gives constructions such as ''Türkiye''''dir''''' &quot;it is Turkey&quot;, ''kapı'''dır''''' &quot;it is the door&quot;, but ''gün'''dür''''' &quot;it is day&quot;, ''palto'''dur''''' &quot;it is the coat&quot;.

=====Exceptions=====
Not all suffixes obey vowel harmony perfectly.

In the suffix ''-(i)yor'', the ''o'' is invariant, while the ''i'' changes according to the preceding vowel; for example ''sön'''ü'''y'''o'''r'' – &quot;he/she/it fades&quot;. Likewise, in the suffix ''-(y)ken'', the ''e'' is invariant: ''Roma'dayk'''e'''n'' – &quot;When in Rome&quot;; and so is the ''i'' in the suffix ''-(y)ebil'': ''inanıl'''a'''b'''i'''lir'' – &quot;credible&quot;. The suffix ''-ki'' exhibits partial harmony, never taking a back vowel but allowing only the front-voweled variant ''-kü'': ''dünk'''ü''''' – &quot;belonging to yesterday&quot;; ''yarınk'''i''''' – &quot;belonging to tomorrow&quot;.

Most Turkish words do not only have vowel harmony for suffixes, but also internally. However, there are many exceptions.

Compound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (thus forms like {{italics correction|''bu''}}|''gün'' &quot;this|day&quot; = &quot;today&quot; are permissible). Vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s, as in ''otobüs'' – from French &quot;autobus&quot;. There are also a few native modern Turkish words that do not follow the rule (such as ''anne'' &quot;mother&quot; or ''kardeş'' &quot;sibling&quot; which used to obey vowel harmony in their older forms, ''ana'' and ''karındaş'', respectively). However, in such words, suffixes nevertheless harmonize with the final vowel; thus ''annes'''i''''' – &quot;his/her mother&quot;, and ''voleybolc'''u''''' – &quot;volleyball player&quot;.

In some loanwords the final vowel is an ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' and thus looks like a back vowel, but is phonetically actually a front vowel, and governs vowel harmony accordingly. An example is the word ''saat'', meaning &quot;hour&quot; or &quot;clock&quot;, a loanword from Arabic. Its plural is ''sa'''a'''tl'''e'''r''. This is not truly an exception to vowel harmony itself; rather, it is an exception to the rule that ''a'' denotes a front vowel.

Disharmony tends to disappear through analogy, especially within loanwords; e.g. ''Hüsnü'' (a man's name) &lt; earlier ''Hüsni'', from Arabic ''husnî''; ''Müslüman'' &quot;Moslem, Muslim (adj. and n.)&quot; &lt; Ottoman Turkish ''müslimân'', from Persian ''mosalmân'').

===Uralic languages===
Many, though not all, Uralic languages show vowel harmony between front and back vowels. Vowel harmony is often hypothesized to have existed in [[Proto-Uralic]], though its original scope remains a matter of discussion.

====Samoyedic====
Vowel harmony is found in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]] and is reconstructed also for [[Proto-Samoyedic]].

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], like its distant relative Finnish, has the same system of ''front'', ''back'', and ''intermediate'' (neutral) vowels but is more complex than the one in Finnish, and some vowel harmony processes. The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (''kar'''ba''''' – in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (''kéz'''be''''' – in(to) the hand). Single-vowel words which have only the neutral vowels (''i'', ''í'' or ''é'') are unpredictable, but ''e'' takes a front-vowel suffix.

One essential difference in classification between Hungarian and Finnish is that standard Hungarian (along with 3 out of 10 local dialects) does not observe the difference between Finnish 'ä' {{IPA|[æ]}} and 'e' {{IPA|[e]}}{{spaced ndash}}the Hungarian front vowel 'e' {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is closely pronounced as the Finnish front vowel 'ä' {{IPA|[æ]}}. 7 out of the 10 local dialects have the vowel ë {{IPA|[e]}} which has never been part of the Hungarian alphabet, and thus is not used in practice.

=====Behaviour of neutral vowels=====

''Unrounded front vowels'' (or ''Intermediate'' or ''neutral'' vowels) can occur together with either ''back vowels'' (e.g. ''r'''é'''p'''a''''' carrot, ''k'''o'''cs'''i''''' car) or ''rounded front vowels'' (e.g. ''tető'', ''tündér''), but ''rounded front vowels'' and ''back vowels'' can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. ''sofőr'' = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. ''répá|ban'' in a carrot, ''kocsi|ban'' in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels ''i'' or ''í'', for which there is no general rule, e.g. ''liszt|et'', ''hid|at'').

Some other rules and guidelines to consider:
* Compound words get suffix according to the last word, e.g.: ''ártér'' (floodplain) compound of ''ár'' + ''tér'' gets front vowel suffix just as the word ''tér'' when stands alone (''tér|en'', ''ártér|en'')
* In case of words of obvious foreign origins: only the last vowel counts (if it is not ''i'' or ''í''): ''sof'''ő'''r|h'''ö'''z, nü'''a'''nsz|sz'''a'''l, gener'''á'''l|'''á'''s, októb'''e'''r|b'''e'''n, parlam'''e'''nt|b'''e'''n, szoftv'''e'''r|r'''e'''l''
** If the last vowel of the foreign word is ''i'' or ''í'', then the last but one vowel will be taken into consideration, e.g. ''p'''a'''pír|h'''o'''z'', ''R'''a'''shid|d'''a'''l''. If the foreign word includes only the vowels ''i'' or ''í'' then it gets front vowel suffix, e.g.: ''Mitch-nek'' ( = ''for Mitch'')
** There are some non-Hungarian geographical names that have no vowels at all (e.g. the Croatian island of ''Krk''), in which case as the word does not include back vowel, it gets front vowel suffix (e.g. ''Krk-re'' = to Krk)
* For acronyms: the last vowel counts (just as in case of foreign words), e.g.: ''HR'' (pronounced: ''há-er'') gets front vowel suffix as the last pronounced vowel is front vowel (''HR-rel'' = with HR)
* Some 1-syllable Hungarian words with '''i''', '''í''' or '''é''' are strictly using front suffixes (''g'''é'''p|r'''e''', m'''é'''ly|r'''ő'''l, v'''í'''z'' &gt; ''v'''i'''z|'''e'''t'', ''h'''í'''r|'''e'''k''), while some others can take back suffixes only (''h'''é'''j|'''a'''k, sz'''í'''j|r'''ó'''l'', ''ny'''í'''l'' &gt; ''ny'''i'''l|'''a'''t'', ''zs'''í'''r|b'''a'''n'', '''''í'''r|'''á'''s'')
* Some foreign words that have fit to the Hungarian language and start with back vowel and end with front vowel can take either front or back suffixes (so can be optionally considered foreign word or Hungarian word): ''f'''a'''rmer|b'''a'''n'' or ''farm'''e'''r|b'''e'''n''

=====Suffixes with multiple forms=====
Grammatical suffixes in Hungarian can have one, two, three, or four forms:
* ''one form'': every word gets the same suffix regardless of the included vowels (e.g. ''-kor'')
* ''two forms'' (most common): words get either back vowel or front vowel suffix (as mentioned above) (e.g. ''-ban/-ben'')
* ''three forms'': there is one back vowel form and two front vowel forms; one for words of which last vowel is rounded front vowel and one for words of which last vowel is not rounded front vowel (e.g. ''-hoz/-hez/-höz'')
* ''four forms'': there are two back vowel forms and two front vowel forms (e.g. -''ot/-at/-et/-öt'' or simply ''-t'', if the last sound is a vowel)
An example on basic numerals:

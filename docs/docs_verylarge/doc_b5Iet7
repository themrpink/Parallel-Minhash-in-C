# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process
# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]
# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C (2500&amp;nbsp;°F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900&amp;nbsp;°C (1600&amp;nbsp;°F) since the rutile silk is still intact.
# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C (1600&amp;nbsp;°F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Hughes (1997), ''Ruby &amp; Sapphire'', Boulder, CO, RWH Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-9645097-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a color needs to be added, the glass powder can be &quot;enhanced&quot; with copper or other metal oxides as well as elements such as sodium, calcium, potassium etc.

The second heating process can be repeated three to four times, even applying different mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Milisenda| first=C C| title=Rubine mit bleihaltigen Glasern gefullt| journal=Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft| volume=54 |issue=1| pages=35–41|publisher=Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft|year=2005|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jewelry containing rubies is heated (for repairs) it should not be coated with boracic acid or any other substance, as this can etch the surface; it does not have to be &quot;protected&quot; like a diamond.

In 1837, Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing [[potash alum]] at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877, [[Edmond Frémy]] and industrial glass-maker Charles Feil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. In 1887, Fremy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF{{sub|2}} and Al{{sub|2}}O{{sub|3}} with a little chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this flame fusion process, later also known as the [[Verneuil process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020704/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|archivedate = September 27, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-3}} in 1907.

Other processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through [[Czochralski process|Czochralski's pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.

Synthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;maiman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493–494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M|s2cid=4224209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear-exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].

[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165714/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|archivedate = August 19, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).

==Records and famous rubies==
[[Image:NMNH-Rubies-CroppedRotated.png|thumb|Rubies at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington, D.C.]], USA]]
* The Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, D.C. has some of the world's largest and finest ruby gemstones. The {{convert|23.1|carat|g|adj=on}} Burmese ruby, set in a platinum ring with diamonds, was donated by businessman and philanthropist [[Peter Buck (restaurateur)|Peter Buck]] in memory of his late wife Carmen Lúcia. This gemstone displays a richly saturated red color combined with an exceptional transparency. The finely proportioned cut provides vivid red reflections. The stone was mined from the [[Mogok]] region of [[Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]) in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/ruby/index.htm |title=The Carmen Lúcia Ruby |accessdate=2008-02-28 |work=Exhibitions |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309050010/http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/ruby/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiman's prototype laser is still in working order.

==Historical and cultural references==
* An early recorded  transport and trading of rubies arises in the literature on the [[North Silk Road]] of China, wherein about 200 [[Before Christ|BC]] rubies were carried along this ancient [[trackway]] moving westward from China.&lt;ref&gt;C.

* Rubies have always been held in high esteem in Asian countries. They were used to ornament armor, scabbards, and harnesses of noblemen in India and China. Rubies were laid beneath the foundation of buildings to secure good fortune to the structure.
*A traditional Hindu astrological belief holds rubies as the &quot;gemstone of the [[Sun]] and also the heavenly deity [[Surya]], the leader of the nine heavenly bodies ([[Navagraha]]).&quot; The belief is that worshiping and wearing rubies causes the Sun to be favorable to the wearer. &lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Smith|first = Henry G.|title = Gems and Precious Stones|publisher = Charles Potter Government Printer, Australia|year = 1896|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/smith-gems-prec-stones/page_028|chapter = Chapter 2, Sapphires, Rubies|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090904/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/smith-gems-prec-stones/page_028|archivedate = September 29, 2007|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Character placed aside a Chinese character to give pronunciation}}
{{Contains special characters|Ruby}}
'''Ruby characters''' ({{CJKV|j=ルビ|r=rubi|k=루비|rr=rubi}}) are small, annotative [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] that are usually placed above or to the right of [[logogram|logographic]] characters such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] to show the pronunciation. Typically called just '''ruby''' or '''rubi''', such annotations are most commonly used as pronunciation guides for characters that are likely to be unfamiliar to the reader.

== Examples ==

Most {{lang|ja-Latn|furigana}} are written with the ''hiragana'' syllabary, but ''[[katakana]]'' and ''[[romaji]]'' are also occasionally used. Alternatively, sometimes foreign words (usually English) are printed with furigana implying the meaning, and vice versa. Textbooks usually write [[Kanji#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|on-readings]] with katakana and [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (native reading)|kun-readings]] with hiragana.

In Taiwan, the syllabary used for Chinese ruby characters is ''[[Bopomofo|Zhuyin fuhao]]'' (also known as ''Bopomofo''); in mainland China ''[[pinyin]]'' is used. Typically, unlike the example shown above&lt;!--TODO: Edit example when support for CSS (ruby-position: side;) is implemented in browsers or a better kludge than was used.--&gt;, zhuyin is used with a vertical traditional writing and zhuyin is written on the right side of the characters. In mainland China, horizontal script is used and ruby characters (pinyin) are written above the Chinese characters.

Books with phonetic guides (especially pinyin) are popular with children and foreigners learning Chinese.

Here is an example of the Korean ruby characters for [[Korea]] (&quot;{{lang|ko|韓國}}&quot;):

Romaja is normally used in foreign textbooks until Hangul is introduced. Ruby characters can be quite common on signs in certain parts of South Korea.

== Uses ==
Ruby may be used for different reasons:

* because the character is rare and the pronunciation unknown to many—personal name characters often fall into this category;
* because the character has more than one pronunciation, and the context is insufficient to determine which to use;
* because the intended readers of the text are still learning the language and are not expected to always know the pronunciation or meaning of a term;
* because the author is using a nonstandard pronunciation for a character or a term

Also, ruby may be used to show the meaning, rather than pronunciation, of a possibly-unfamiliar (usually foreign) or slang word. This is generally used with spoken dialogue and applies only to Japanese publications. The most common form of ruby is called ''furigana'' or ''yomigana'' and is found in Japanese instructional books, newspapers, comics and books for children.

In Japanese, certain characters, such as the [[sokuon]] ({{lang|ja|促音}}) (little ''tsu'', {{lang|ja|っ}}) that indicates a pause before the consonant it precedes, are normally written at about half the size of normal characters. When written as ruby, such characters are usually the same size as other ruby characters. Advancements in technology now allow certain characters to render accurately.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name=&quot;w3c-spec&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In Chinese, the practice of providing phonetic cues via ruby is rare, but does occur systematically in grade-school level text books or dictionaries. The Chinese have no special name for this practice, as it is not as widespread as in Japan. In Taiwan, it is known as &quot;[[Bopomofo|zhuyin]]&quot;, from the name of the phonetic system employed for this purpose there. It is virtually always used vertically, because publications are normally in a vertical format, and zhuyin is not as easy to read when presented horizontally{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Where zhuyin is not used, other Chinese phonetic systems like [[pinyin]] are employed.

[[File:委班復活漢喃越南.png|thumb|right|An example of Vietnamese ruby text]]

In academic settings, Vietnamese text written in {{lang|vi|[[chữ Hán]]}} or {{lang|vi|[[chữ Nôm]]}} may be glossed with {{lang|vi|[[quốc ngữ]]}} ruby for modern readers.{{sfn|Lunde|2009|p=529}}

Sometimes [[interlinear glosses]] are visually similar to ruby, appearing above or below the main text in smaller type. However, this is a distinct practice used for helping students of a foreign language by giving glosses for the words in a text, as opposed to the pronunciation of lesser-known characters.

Ruby annotation can also be used in handwriting.

== History ==
{{see also|Agate (typography)}}
[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]] Eonhae'' uses [[hanja]] and small [[hangul]] for ruby on right below]]

In British typography, ''ruby'' was originally the [[Point (typography)#Traditional point-size names|name for type]] with a height of 5.5 [[point (typography)|points]], which printers used for interlinear annotations in printed documents. In Japanese, rather than referring to a font size, the word became the name for typeset ''furigana''.  When transliterated back into English, some texts rendered the word as ''rubi'', (a typical [[romanisation]] of the Japanese word {{lang|ja|ルビ}}, instead of {{lang|ja|ルビー}} (''rubī''), the expected transliteration of ''ruby''). However, the spelling &quot;ruby&quot; has become more common since the [[W3C]] published a recommendation for ''ruby [[markup language|markup]]''. In the US, the font size had been called &quot;[[Agate (typography)|agate]]&quot;, a term in use since 1831 according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=April 2011}}

In 2001, the W3C published the Ruby Annotation specification&lt;ref name=&quot;w3c-spec&quot; /&gt; for supplementing [[XHTML]] with ruby markup. Ruby markup is not a standard part of HTML 4.01 or any of the XHTML 1.0 specifications (XHTML-1.0-Strict, XHTML-1.0-Transitional, and XHTML-1.0-Frameset), but was incorporated into the XHTML 1.1 specification, and is expected to be a core part of HTML5 once the specification becomes finalised by the W3C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HTML5|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-ruby-element.html#the-ruby-element|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for ruby markup in web browsers is limited, as XHTML 1.1 is not yet widely implemented. Ruby markup is partially supported by [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] (5.0+) for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], supported by Chrome, but is not supported by [[Konqueror]] or [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;opera_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|      title = Web Specifications supported in Opera
|        url = http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/
|      quote = Opera supports XHTML 1.1 with these exceptions: (…) Ruby annotations are not supported
| accessdate = 2007-11-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WebKit nightly builds added support for Ruby HTML markup in January 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;webkit_ruby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webkit.org/blog/948/ruby-rendering-in-webkit/ |title=Ruby Rendering in WebKit |author=Roland Steiner |date=2010-01-20 |work=[http://webkit.org/blog/ Surfin’ Safari] |publisher=[[WebKit]] project |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] has included support in version 5.0.6&lt;!-- may have been introduced in one of the other 5.0.x updates --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html5doctor.com/ruby-rt-rp-element/ The ruby element] – HTML5 Doctor&lt;/ref&gt; It is also supported in Mozilla Firefox as of version 38.&lt;ref name=&quot;fx38&quot; /&gt;

For those browsers that don't support Ruby natively, Ruby support is most easily added by using [[CSS]] rules that are easily found on the web.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruby_stylesheet_hack&quot;&gt;[http://web.nickshanks.com/stylesheets/ruby.css CSS Ruby Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228150240/http://web.nickshanks.com/stylesheets/ruby.css |date=2007-02-28 }}—Works in all modern browsers&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby markup support can also be added to some browsers that support custom extensions.

Ruby markup is structured such that a fallback rendering, consisting of the ruby characters in parentheses immediately after the main text, appears if the browser does not support ruby.

The W3C is also working on a specific ruby module for [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] level 2, which additionally allows the grouping of ruby and automatic omission of furigana matching their annotated part.&lt;ref name=&quot;css2_ruby&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== Markup examples ===
Below are a few examples of ruby markup. The markup is shown first, and the rendered markup is shown next, followed by the unmarked version. Web browsers either render it with the correct size and positioning as shown in the table-based examples above, or use the fallback rendering with the ruby characters in parentheses:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | XHTML || CSS level 2&lt;ref name=&quot;css2_ruby&quot; /&gt;
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Markup
| &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;東京&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;rt&gt;とうきょう&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
| &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;北&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ㄅㄟˇ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;京&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ㄐ丨ㄥ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
| &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby&gt;
&lt;rbc&gt;&lt;rb&gt;振&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;り&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;仮&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rb&gt;名&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/rbc&gt;
&lt;rtc&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ふ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rt&gt;り&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rt&gt;が&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rt&gt;な&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/rtc&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
|- style=&quot;height:70px&quot;
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Rendered
| &lt;ruby style=&quot;font-size:2em;&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;東京&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;rt&gt;とうきょう&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;
| &lt;ruby style=&quot;font-size:2em;&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Hant&quot;&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;北&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ㄅㄟˇ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;京&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ㄐ丨ㄥ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;
| &lt;ruby style=&quot;font-size:2em;&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;
&lt;rb&gt;振&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ふ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;り&lt;/ruby&gt;&lt;ruby style=&quot;font-size:2em;&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;仮&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;が&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rb&gt;名&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;な&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;
&lt;/ruby&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;By default, the code above will come to the effect below. To achieve this effect, we need further CSS styling.&lt;/small&gt;
|- style=&quot;height:70px&quot;
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Unmarked
| style=&quot;font-size:1.2em&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;      | 東京(とうきょう)
| style=&quot;font-size:1.2em&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Hant&quot; | 北(ㄅㄟˇ)京(ㄐ丨ㄥ)
| style=&quot;font-size:1.2em&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;      | 振り仮名(ふりがな)
|}

Note that Chinese ruby text would normally be displayed in vertical columns to the right of each character. This approach is not typically supported in browsers at present.

This is a table-based example of vertical columns:
{|
|style=&quot;line-height:1em; font-size:2em; vertical-align:middle&quot; |{{lang|zh-Hant|瓶}} || style=&quot;line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; vertical-align:middle&quot; | {{lang|zh-tw|ㄆ&lt;br /&gt;ㄧ&lt;br /&gt;ㄥˊ}}
|-
|style=&quot;line-height:1em; font-size:2em; vertical-align:middle&quot; | {{lang|zh-Hant|子}} || style=&quot;line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; vertical-align:middle&quot; | {{lang|zh-tw|˙&lt;br /&gt;ㄗ}}
|}

=== Complex ruby markup ===
Complex ruby markup makes it possible to associate more than one ruby text with a base text, or parts of ruby text with parts of base text.&lt;ref name=&quot;complex_ruby&quot;&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/#complex Complex ruby markup]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently only supported in Firefox 38.&lt;ref name=&quot;fx38&quot; /&gt;

== Unicode ==
[[Unicode]] and its companion standard, the [[Universal Character Set]], support ruby via these ''interlinear annotation'' characters:
* Code point &lt;code&gt;FFF9&lt;/code&gt; ([[hexadecimal|hex]])—Interlinear annotation anchor—marks start of annotated text
* Code point &lt;code&gt;FFFA&lt;/code&gt; (hex)—Interlinear annotation separator—marks start of annotating character(s)
* Code point &lt;code&gt;FFFB&lt;/code&gt; (hex)—Interlinear annotation terminator—marks end of annotated text

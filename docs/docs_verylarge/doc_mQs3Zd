Rebecca Bloomer's novel ''Unearthed'' (2011), the first in a series, describes a futuristic human colony on Mars amidst the populations of native Martians.

''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]'' (2015) is a science fiction film directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Matt Damon]]. The film, based on ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'', a novel by [[Andy Weir]], depicts an American astronaut stranded alone on Mars in the year 2035. He improvises a farm in order to survive and later quotes an email he receives from his alma mater, &quot;They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially 'colonized' it.&quot;

===Martians as invaders of Earth===

Many listeners believed the broadcast to be a news report.]]

H. G. Wells' novel ''The War of the Worlds'' (1898) and its various adaptations have been an extraordinary influence on science fiction writers for more than 100 years. Wells' [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] are a technologically advanced species with an ancient civilization. They somewhat resemble [[cephalopod]]s, with large, bulky brown bodies and sixteen snake-like tentacles, in two groups of eight, around a quivering V-shaped mouth; they move around in 100 feet tall tripod fighting-machines they assemble upon landing, killing everything in their path. They invade Earth because Mars is dying, and they need a warmer planet to live. They attack cities in southern [[England]], including [[London]], with a deadly [[heat-ray]] they fire from a camera-like device on an articulated arm attached to their tripods; they also employ chemical warfare, using a poisonous &quot;black smoke&quot; launched from gun-like tubes. Mankind is saved by Earth bacteria, which kill the Martians within three weeks of their landing on Earth.

In ''[[Last and First Men]]'' (1930) [[Olaf Stapledon]] revisited Wells' theme of Martian invasion. ''Last and First Men'' summarizes tens of thousands of years of invasions and war between Martians and humans. Eventually, humans destroy the Martians' empire.

[[William Cameron Menzies]]' film ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1953) fuses the tentacles of Wells' Martians with the idea of [[little green men]] to conceive a Martian Mastermind who enslaves tall, green, humanoid mutants. [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of the film was released in 1986,

In his 1955 [[comic novel]] ''[[Martians, Go Home]]'', [[Fredric Brown]] spoofs the Wellsian invasion, and reinterprets the Martian invader as a rude house guest with ulterior motives. Brown, too, employs the &quot;little green men&quot; [[Trope (literature)|trope]] to describe his annoying Martians.

Little green men recur in the 2009 video game ''[[Stalin vs. Martians]]'', a spoof of earlier [[strategy video game]]s. As the president of the [[Soviet Union]], the player defends Earth from Martian invasion. This time the caricature of the Martians appears to be influenced by [[H. R. Giger]].

In ''[[Spaced Invaders]]'' (1990), a group of Martians invade a town in the [[Midwestern United States]] during a re-broadcast of the Orson Welles' [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|1938 radio dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'']].

In 1948, [[Warner Bros.]] introduced a new villain to their animated films: [[Marvin the Martian]], a short, slender figure with comically oversized eyes, hands, and feet, but with no visible mouth. His big, spherical head is either completely black or overshadowed by his crested helmet. His clothing is patterned on that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[god of war]] in [[Roman mythology]]. In Marvin's film debut, ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'' (1948), he attempts to blow up Earth because it &quot;obscures [his] view of [[Venus]]&quot;, but is thwarted by [[Bugs Bunny]].

Another film that imagines Martians as ineffectual invaders is ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996), a [[black comedy]] based on a [[Topps]] [[trading card]] series. Here, the Martian invaders are loud, irritating, and dim-witted, despite having oversized heads with extremely large, protruding brains. The film was written by [[Jonathan Gems]], and directed by [[Tim Burton]].

In the ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' story &quot;Black Magic on Mars&quot; (1950),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |story=Black Magic on Mars |title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] |volume= |issue=62 |date=January 1950 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conception of Martians is more grave: The Martian invaders Superman faces are led by a dictator called Martler, who is an admirer of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In &quot;[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]&quot;, a 1961 episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', Martians attempt to colonize Earth, but are thwarted by [[Venusians]]. Here, the Martians are disguised as humans, but towards the end of the episode we see that they have three arms.

In ''Mars Needs Moms'' (2007), a [[picture book]] by [[Berkeley Breathed]], Martians are squat, humanoid beings with antennae and skin color that varies by individual. When they travel to Earth, they wear transparent helmets and a bulbous, ribbed outer garment. In the story, a five-year-old boy learns to appreciate his mother after three Martians kidnap her while he sleeps. Writer-director [[Simon Wells]] and his wife Wendy adapted the picture book into the film ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' (2011).

===Martians as civilized humanoids===
{{See also|Anthropocentrism|Eurocentrism}}

In April 1911, about a year before ''The All-Story'' published the first installment of Burroughs' ''Under the Moons of Mars'', ''[[Modern Electrics]]'' began publishing [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s own romance, ''[[Ralph 124C 41+]]'', which takes place on Earth. Gernsback's Martians live among the humans on Earth; they are taller and physically stronger than humans, with green skin and large eyes. The serial wasn't republished as a book until 1925.

1923 saw the publication of ''[[Aelita (novel)|Aelita, or The Decline of Mars]]'', a novel that is equally science fiction and [[political fiction]]. Its author, Soviet Russian writer [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]], tells a story of a Soviet engineer who builds a rocket and invites an acquaintance to accompany him in it to Mars. There they find a humanoid race of Martians who are the offspring of both an elder Martian species and of humans from [[Atlantis]]. The Martians live in a [[class society]]; the workers rise up against the [[ruling class]], but the revolution fails. All the while, Mars is entering a phase of [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] that threatens disaster for the population.

''Red Planet'' (1932), a play cowritten by [[John L. Balderston]] and John Hoare, also deals with radical environmental change on Mars, except in this case it occurs through [[terraforming]]. Balderston was one of the few playwrights of the 20th century to adopt Mars or Martians as a subject for the stage. He was, however, also a screenwriter who specialized in [[fantasy film]] and [[horror film]]. Many years later, [[United Artists]] bought a screen adaptation that Balderston and fellow screenwriter [[Anthony Veiller]] wrote. [[Harry Horner]] directed the film, called ''[[Red Planet Mars]]'', and it was released to cinemas in 1952. In the film, a scientist communicates with Martians by radio, and they tell him that Mars is a utopia. When the news circulates, it causes widespread unrest among the people of Western nations. The US government tries to silence further messages, then later announces that the Martians have informed them that they must all worship [[God]] in order to save themselves. After millions of people revolt against their governments, it seems the Martian communiques may have been a hoax.

[[Ray Bradbury]]'s novel ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950) depicts Martians as a refined and artistic race of golden-skinned beings who closely resemble humans. The Martians are almost completely wiped out by the diseases brought to Mars by human invaders. At the end of the book, the human inhabitants of Mars realize that they are the new Martians. The novel's themes and its portrayal of Martians resemble Bradbury's 1949 short story &quot;[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]&quot;.

Brothers [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim Thomas]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] teamed with [[Graham Yost]] to write ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' (2000), a film that depicts Martians as tall, feminine, peaceful humanoids who left Mars to escape the havoc caused by a massive [[meteorite]] impact.

Edmond Hamilton's &quot;A Conquest of Two Worlds&quot; describes Martians as humanoid creatures with stilt-like limbs and large, bulging chests and heads. They live in tribal groups centered on oases and occasionally fight among themselves. After an accidental confrontation sparks war, they are all killed or enslaved by the invading human population.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edmond. &quot;A Conquest of Two Worlds&quot; in ''Wonder Stories'', February 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martians as anthropomorphic animals===
{{See also|Anthropomorphism}}

[[C. S. Lewis]] wrote, in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938), about three humans who visit Mars and meet three different kinds of intelligent native creatures: The hrossa (bipedal &quot;otter&quot; men), the sorns/séroni (lean white giants), and the pfifltriggi (dwarves). They are dying out, but are resigned to their fate. The books also describe a prey animal called hnakra, which is hunted. The planet is ruled by the Oyarsa, an &quot;eldil&quot; (supernatural beings/spirits) whose job is to be the guardian of the planet and ruler of its peoples.

In four stories by [[Eric Frank Russell]] published between the early 1940s and mid-1950s—and collected in ''[[Men, Martians and Machines]]'' (1955)—a crew of humans and octopoid Martians are shipmates and compatriots on an interstellar voyage. During their travels, they encounter hostile aliens. Russell's Martians can survive in Earth-normal air pressures, but are more comfortable wearing low-pressure helmets and tease their shipmates about the soupy conditions on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Eric Frank|title=Men, Martians and Machines|date=1958|publisher=Berkeley Medallion|location=New York, NY, USA|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a writer for ''[[Doctor Who]]'', [[Brian Hayles]] created a Martian species of [[reptilian humanoid]]s called the [[Ice Warrior]]s, who move stiffly and speak in a husky whisper. Most of the Ice Warriors that the Doctor encounters are brutish and belligerent. As Mars' climate becomes less favorable to sustaining them, the Ice Warriors seek a new planet.  These reptilians debuted in ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'' (1967), a ''Doctor Who'' television serial about an impending [[ice age]] in Earth's future. As British scientists try to slow or avert a glacier encroaching on Great Britain, they find an Ice Warrior near their base, frozen in the glacier, and apparently in [[suspended animation]]. No one knows the being's identity, but they understand that it is probably from another planet. When the Ice Warrior revives, he attacks [[Jamie McCrimmon]] and kidnaps [[Victoria Waterfield]]. Other stories set in the future show the Martians eventually become more peaceful and are members of the Galactic Federation, though some want to return to their warlike ways.

===Martians as an extinct race===
[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|200px|thumb|A photograph of Mars captured by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] on 26 June 2001]]

For his [[Known Space]] series of novels, [[Larry Niven]] conceived humanoid Martians with a primitive [[material culture]] who inhabit an environment of red dust and [[nitric acid]], and for whom water is lethal. In the 1973 novel ''[[Protector (novel)|Protector]]'', a man named Jack Brennan allies himself with a ruthless, xenophobic humanoid species called the [[Pak Protector|Pak]]. To preclude the possibility future competition for Pak offspring, Brennan engineers a Martian [[genocide]] by sending an ice-covered asteroid to collide with Mars.

In [[Dennis Feltham Jones]]' 1977 novel ''[[Colossus and the Crab]]'', Martian life predated life on Earth, but faced a process of devolution as conditions on the planet worsened.

''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958–59) is a British television serial in which a crashed spacecraft is discovered in London. The wreck evidences that the human population of Earth resulted from the experiments of a Martian civilisation, now long dead. A film remake was released in 1967.

''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' (2001) human invaders war with Martians in an attempt to conquer Mars.

In the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' episode &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; (2001), Zim discovers that a Martian race died off after converting Mars into a giant spacecraft.

In ''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004), the entire Martian race sacrificed itself many millennia ago in order to prevent a [[Demon|demonic]] invasion of our universe. By the year 2145, humanity has [[Colonization of Mars|colonized Mars]] and begun excavating the ruins of their civilization, recovering several important artifacts. One of these artifacts—known as the Soul Cube—is [[Doomguy|the player's]] most valuable tool in combating a second demonic invasion, as it is the only weapon capable of killing the [[Cyberdemon]].

===Martians as superbeings===
[[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[David Starr, Space Ranger]]'', the first novel in the Lucky Starr series, features a race of Martians who have retreated into vast artificial caverns half a million years ago. These Martians are incorporeal, telepathic beings, peaceful yet curious about humanity. They have access to advanced technologies completely incomprehensible to human beings, like personal energy shield generators the size of a fabric mask.

In Robert Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961), a man raised by native Martians emigrates to Earth, where he must reacclimate. In the novel he functions as a [[Christ figure]]. Soon he demonstrates psychic powers, superhuman intelligence, and an ability to manipulate higher dimensions. He founds a church on Earth based on Martian philosophy, and starts a cultural shift. At the novel's climax, he is murdered by a mob from a rival religious group.

In 1963, American television network [[CBS]] premiered a [[sitcom]] called ''[[My Favorite Martian]]''. The series proved popular in the US, especially during the first season, and CBS broadcast more than one hundred episodes before canceling it when the third season ended in 1966. In this comedy, a Martian anthropologist (who passes for human in most respects) crashes on Earth, where he is harbored by an American man who keeps the Martian's identity secret. Also secret are the Martian's extraordinary abilities, not the least of which are invisibility and [[telepathy]]. CBS's rival networks, [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], did not fail to notice the success of ''My Favorite Martian'', or the comic potential of a character with secret powers. In 1964, ABC introduced ''[[Bewitched]]'' (a sitcom about a married, suburban witch), and NBC countered the following year with ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', a sitcom about an [[astronaut]] who discovers and marries a [[Genie in popular culture|genie]].

In ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967–68), the [[Mysteron]]s are a race of invisible superbeings from Mars who are at war with humans from Earth. The conflict begins when [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], a human officer investigating radio signals from Mars, mistakes a [[surveillance camera]] for a weapon. In violation of his orders, he attacks, but the Mysterons immediately repair the damage he caused. The conflict escalates, and the Mysterons attempt to assassinate the president of Earth.

[[DC Comics]] introduced the first Martian [[superhero]] to the [[DC Universe]] in 1955. [[Martian Manhunter]] (J'onn J'onzz), a green humanoid who is believed to be the last of the peaceful Green Martians, joins the [[Justice League]]. Meanwhile, the warlike, shapeshifting [[White Martians]] regard the Green Martians as enemies. The White Martians adopt a humanoid form which, they say, expresses their distinctive philosophy. DC introduced a White Martian superhero, [[Miss Martian]], in 2006. A third race, the [[List of DC Comics races#Y|Yellow Martians]], may or may not have survived as long as the Green and White Martians.

The long antenna that extends out from the spacecraft and magnetometer boom can be seen. The planets shown include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Only Jupiter and Saturn have been visited by spacecraft other than ''[[Voyager 2]]''.]]
The '''Voyager program''' is an American scientific program that employs two [[robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[Spaceprobe|spaceprobes]], ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and '' [[Voyager 2]]'', launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]''. ''Although their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, ''Voyager 2'' continued on to Uranus and Neptune''. ''The Voyagers now explore the outer boundary of the [[heliosphere]] in [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]]; their mission has been extended three times and they continue to transmit useful scientific data. Neither Uranus nor Neptune has had a close-up picture taken by a probe other than'' Voyager 2.''

On 25 August 2012, data from ''Voyager 1'' indicated that it had become the first man-made object to enter interstellar space, traveling &quot;further than anyone, or anything, in history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; {{as of|2013}}, ''Voyager 1'' was moving with a velocity of {{convert|17|km/s|sp=us}} relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/ |title=Voyager Mission Operations Status Report # 2013-05-31, Week Ending May 31, 2013 |publisher=JPL |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- before updating check carefully using multiple sources and delta distance calculations --&gt;

On 5 November 2019, data from ''Voyager 2'' indicated that it also had entered interstellar space.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20181210&quot;/&gt; On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that, on 5 November 2018, the ''Voyager 2'' probe had officially reached the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM), a region of [[outer space]] beyond the influence of the [[Solar System]], and has now joined the ''Voyager 1'' probe which had reached the ISM earlier in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA-20191104&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=University of Iowa |title=Voyager 2 reaches interstellar space - Iowa-led instrument detects plasma density jump, confirming spacecraft has entered the realm of the stars |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uoi-v2r103119.php |date=4 November 2019 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=4 November 2019 |author-link=University of Iowa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20191104&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Voyager 2's Discoveries From Interstellar Space - In its journey beyond the boundary of the solar wind's bubble, the probe observed some notable differences from its twin, Voyager 1. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/science/voyager-2-interstellar-solar-wind.html |date=4 November 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and photographs collected by the Voyagers' cameras, [[magnetometers]] and other instruments revealed unknown details about each of the four [[giant planet]]s and their [[moons]]. Close-up images from the spacecraft charted Jupiter's complex cloud forms, winds and storm systems and discovered volcanic activity on its moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Saturn's rings were found to have enigmatic braids, kinks and spokes and to be accompanied by myriad &quot;ringlets&quot;. At Uranus, ''Voyager 2'' discovered a substantial magnetic field around the planet and ten more moons. Its flyby of Neptune uncovered three rings and six hitherto unknown moons, a planetary [[magnetic field]] and complex, widely distributed [[auroras]]. ''Voyager 2'' is the only spacecraft to have visited the two [[ice giant]]s. In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft, of a &quot;[[Heliosphere#Hydrogen wall|hydrogen wall]]&quot; at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRL-20180807&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gladstone, G.

&quot;Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors,&quot; wrote author Stephen J. Pyne.  &quot;Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fantastic Voyage of Voyager|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2020/1/9/the-astonishing-voyage-of-voyager |website=The Attic|accessdate=3 March  2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voyager spacecraft were built at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Southern California]] and funded by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), which also financed their launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], their tracking and everything else concerning the probes.

The cost of the original program was $865 million, with the later-added Voyager Interstellar Mission costing an extra $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/frequently-asked-questions/fact-sheet/|title=Voyager - Fact Sheet|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2019, a new plan to better manage the two Voyager space probes was implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20190712&quot; /&gt;

The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the [[Mariner program]], and they were thus initially named [[Mariner 11]] and [[Mariner 12]]. They were then moved into a separate program named &quot;Mariner Jupiter-Saturn&quot;, later renamed the Voyager Program because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html '' Chapter 11 &quot;Voyager: The Grand Tour of Big Science&quot;''] (sec. 268.), by Andrew,J. Butrica, found in ''From Engineering Science To Big Science'' {{ISBN|978-0-16-049640-0}} edited by Pamela E. Mack, NASA, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Voyager Probe.stl|thumb|left|304x304px|Interactive 3D model of the Voyager spaceprobe.]]
The Voyager Program was similar to the [[Planetary Grand Tour]] planned during the late 1960s and early 70s. The Grand Tour would take advantage of an alignment of the outer planets discovered by [[Gary Flandro]], an [[aerospace engineer]] at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This alignment, which occurs once every 175 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127192310/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html|archive-date=27 November 2013|url-status=dead|title=Planetary Voyage|date=30 October 2013|publisher=USA.gov|access-date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; would occur in the late 1970s and make it possible to use [[gravitational assist]]s to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and [[Pluto]]. The Planetary Grand Tour was to send several pairs of probes to fly by all the outer planets (including Pluto, then still considered a planet) along various trajectories, including Jupiter-Saturn-Pluto and Jupiter-Uranus-Neptune. Limited funding ended the Grand Tour program, but elements were incorporated into the Voyager Program, which fulfilled many of the flyby objectives of the Grand Tour except a visit to Pluto.

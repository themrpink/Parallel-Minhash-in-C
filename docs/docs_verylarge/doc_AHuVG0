{{Main|Nok culture}}
The [[Nok culture]] appeared in Nigeria around 1000 BC and mysteriously vanished around 200 AD. The civilization's social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta which have been discovered by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;archaeology&quot;&gt;''Shaw, Thurstan, Nigeria: Its Archaeology and early history. Retrieved February 22, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; A Nok sculpture resident at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, portrays a sitting dignitary wearing a &quot;Shepherds Crook&quot; on the right arm, and a &quot;hinged flail&quot; on the left. These are symbols of authority associated with ancient Egyptian pharaohs, and the god Osiris, which suggests that an ancient Egyptian style of social structure, and perhaps religion, existed in the area of modern Nigeria during the late Pharonic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsmia.org/viewer/detail.php?id=5368&amp;i=20&amp;v=12&amp;dept=8&amp;op=1449 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406020937/http://www.artsmia.org/viewer/detail.php?id=5368&amp;i=20&amp;v=12&amp;dept=8&amp;op=1449 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-06 |title=artsmia.org : viewer |publisher=Artsmia.org |access-date=2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Informational excerpt copied from [[Nigeria]] and [[Nok culture]] articles)

'' Guide to Archaeology''&lt;/ref&gt; Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC.

Minor scattered sites have been found as far away as [[Turkmenistan]]. Another name for this civilization is the Harappan Civilization, after the first of its cities to be excavated, [[Harappa]] in the Pakistani province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The IVC were known to the [[Sumer]]ians as the [[Meluhha]], and other trade contacts may have included Egypt, Africa, however, the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a result of archaeological excavations and rail-road building.

The births of [[Mahavira]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in the 6th century BC mark the beginning of well-recorded history in the region. Around the 5th century BC, the ancient region of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] in 522 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/persian.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021212234/http://geocities.com/pak_history/persian.html |archive-date=2009-10-21 |title=Part of Persian Empire |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the easternmost satraps of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. The provinces of Sindh and Panjab were said to be the richest ''satraps'' of the Persian Empire and contributed many soldiers to various Persian expeditions. It is known that an ''Indian'' contingent fought in Xerxes' army on his expedition to Greece. Herodotus mentions that the Indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to the Persian army. He also mentions that the Indus people were clad in armaments made of cotton, carried bows and arrows of cane covered with iron. Herodotus states that in 517 BC Darius sent an expedition under Scylax to explore the Indus. Under Persian rule, much irrigation and commerce flourished within the vast territory of the empire. The Persian empire was followed by the invasion of the Greeks under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s army. Since Alexander was determined to reach the easternmost limits of the Persian Empire he could not resist the temptation to conquer India (i.e. the Punjab region), which at this time was parcelled out into small chieftain-ships, who were feudatories of the Persian Empire. Alexander amalgamated the region into the expanding Hellenic empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The ''[[Rigveda]]'', in [[Sanskrit]], goes back to about 1500 BC. The Indian literary tradition has an oral history reaching down into the [[Vedic period]] of the later 2nd millennium BC.[[File:TNMStandingBuddha.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Standing [[Greco-Buddhism|Greek-Buddha]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.]]''[[History of India|Ancient India]]'' is usually taken to refer to the &quot;golden age&quot; of classical [[Indian culture]], as reflected in [[Sanskrit]] literature, beginning around 500 BC with the sixteen monarchies and 'republics' known as the [[Mahajanapadas]], stretched across the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]] from modern-day Afghanistan to [[Bangladesh]]. The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.

Amongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]] one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Ashoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]). These kingdoms, while not part of Ashoka's empire, were in friendly terms with the [[Maurya Empire]]. There was a strong alliance existed between [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (250–210 BC) and [[Ashoka]] of India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendis|first=Ranjan Chinthaka|title=The Story of Anuradhapura|publisher=Lakshmi Mendis|year=1999|isbn=978-955-96704-0-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sent [[Arahat]] [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wijesooriya|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They encountered Devanampiya Tissa at [[Mihintale]]. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks was established in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wijesooriya|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.

The period between AD 320–550 is known as the Classical Age, when most of [[North India]] was reunited under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. AD 320–550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606–47), North India was reunited briefly.

The educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. The South Indian [[Malabar Coast]] and the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age traded with the [[Graeco-Roman]] world. They were in contact with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Jew]]s, and the [[China|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blandstrom&quot;&gt;(Bjorn Landstrom, 1964; Miller, J.

The regions of South Asia, primarily present-day India and Pakistan, were estimated to have had the largest [[Economic history of India|economy]] of the world between the 1st and 15th centuries AD, controlling between one third and one quarter of the world's wealth up to the time of the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]], from whence it rapidly declined during British rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison]] (2001).

[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Oracle bone script]] from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]].]]
Chinese Civilization that emerged within the [[Yellow River|Yellow River Valley]] is one of five original civilizations in the world. Prior to the formation of civilization neolithic cultures such as the [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] and [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] dating to 5,000 BC lived in wall cities and likely had social organizations of complex chiefdoms. The practice of rice cultivation was vital to settled life in China.

Chinese history records such as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'' claim of the existence of the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]]. However, as the Xia left behind no written record themselves, the time and location of their civilization has been in doubt. Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture (1900–1600 BC) is the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt.

The early part of the [[Shang dynasty]] described in traditional histories (c. 1600–1300 BC) is commonly identified with archaeological finds at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Yanshi]], south of the [[Yellow River]] in modern-day [[Henan]] province.
The last capital of the Shang (c. 1300–1046 BC) at [[Anyang]] (also in Henan) has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts, inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals&amp;nbsp;– the so-called &quot;[[oracle bones]]&quot;.

Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Shang were overrun by the [[Zhou dynasty]] from the [[Wei River]] valley to the west. The death of [[King Wu of Zhou]] soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wu's brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], acting as regent. The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.
[[File:01 terracottawarriorsgroup.jpg|left|thumb|[[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Warriors]] from the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]]]]
In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Quanrong]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).[[File:Han foreign relations CE 2.jpg|alt=Han Dynasty Map. 1 AD |center|thumb|500x500px|The Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] dominated the East Asia region at the beginning of the first millennium AD ]]

Qin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commandries' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited. In his reign unified China created the first continuous [[Great Wall]] with the use of forced labor. [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Invasions]] were launched southward to annex Vietnam.  After the emperor's death rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign in new civil wars. Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]].  The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] – though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han Dynasty broke up into [[Three Kingdoms period|rival kingdoms]]. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui Dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.

The East Asian nations adjacent to China were all profoundly influenced by their interactions with [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese civilization]]. Mongolia, Korea and Vietnam often were at war with, [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|paid tribute]] to, or annexed by Imperial Chinese states. [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] Japan, though not occupied, had interactions with Imperial China that shaped its cultural development.

Mongolia in ancient times was nomadic. The ethnicities, cultures and languages in modern Mongolian territory were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and migrate started during the Iron Age. These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoral kingdoms that had close contact with the sedentary agrarian Chinese. To appease the aggressive nomads, local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages. In 208 BC the Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who split into the new tribes [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]]. The [[Xiongnu]] were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting [[Han–Xiongnu War|wars]] for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The titles of Khangan and Khan come from the [[Xianbei]].

According to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], [[Wiman Joseon]] of Korea was founded by General [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China who originally served but usurped the throne of [[Gojoseon]] (the name of ancient Korea) in 194 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea 史記 朝鮮列伝第五十五 &quot;朝鮮王満者、故燕人也&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] of China destroyed Wiman Joseon and established four commanderies on the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies were shortly lost but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained on the northwestern Korean peninsula for about 400 years. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] of [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]] emerged after the fall of Gojoseon and eventually expelled the Chinese. The Three Kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; Goguryeo and Baekje were the main players for much of the Three Kingdoms era and controlled most of the Korean peninsula. At times more powerful than neighboring Chinese dynasties, Goguryeo (where the name &quot;Korea&quot; comes from) was a regional power that defeated [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|massive invasions]] by the [[Sui dynasty]] multiple times.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson|title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)|publisher=Asianinfo.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|archive-date=28 January 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goguryeo and Baekje were eventually destroyed by a [[Tang dynasty]] and Silla alliance. Silla then drove out the Tang dynasty in 676 to control most of the Korean peninsula undisputed.

In Vietnam, archaeologists have pointed to the [[Phùng Nguyên culture]] as the beginning of the Vietnamese identity from around 2000 BC which engaged in early bronze smelting.
Eight hundred years later the [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] culture arose a prehistoric [[Bronze Age]] culture that was centered at the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] Valley of northern [[Vietnam]]. Large scale rice cultivation began around 1200 BC, onward. Pottery and Bamboo working became common in this time period as well as widespread trade and navigation on inland rivers. During this time Vietnam was allegedly ruled by the semi-mythical [[Hong Bang Dynasty]], the last Hong King was deposed by a Chinese Qin Invasion, in turn however a Chinese General declared independence and founded the [[Nanyue]] combining Chinese and Vietnamese traditions.
[[File:Bronze Mirror in Ancient Japan.jpg|alt=Ancient Japanese Bronze Mirror|left|thumb|175x175px|Bronze Mirror, from the [[Yayoi period]] of Japan]]
[[Nanyue|Nan Yue]], after a century of political maneuvers the country was annexed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] in 111 B.C Originally the Han were lenient governors and attempted to integrate the Vietnamese upper class into Chinese Patriarchy. However Chinese abuse of certain vassals led to the famous but futile revolt of the [[Trưng Sisters|Trung Sisters]]. Afterwards Chinese authorities ruled Vietnam directly and attempted to push Chinese culture upon the populace though peasants continued to speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Vietnam would be under Chinese domination for a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/4.htm|title=Vietnam – The Chinese Millennium|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, South Vietnam held a completely different identity, populated mainly by [[Chams|Cham]] People. While Northern Vietnam came under Chinese Domination, the [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] became closer to Indian kingdoms through trade and embraced [[Hinduism in Vietnam|Hinduism]].

[[History of Japan|Japan]] first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':&lt;ref&gt;後漢書, 會稽海外有東鯷人 分爲二十餘國&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. Formed from more than one hundred tribes, they come and pay tribute frequently. The ''[[Book of Wei]]'', written in the 3rd century, noted the country was the unification of some 30 small tribes or states and ruled by a [[shaman]] queen named [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]]. During the [[Han dynasty]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], Chinese travelers to [[Kyūshū]] recorded its inhabitants and claimed that they were the descendants of the Grand Count (Tàibó) of the [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. The inhabitants also show traits of the pre-sinicized Wu people with tattooing, teeth-pulling and baby-carrying. The ''Book of Wei'' records the physical descriptions which are similar to ones on ''[[Haniwa]]'' statues, such men with braided hair, tattooing and women wearing large, single-piece clothing. Power was often decentralized until the creation of its first constitution in AD 600.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times, several large, centralized ancient civilizations developed in the [[Western Hemisphere]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C The Encyclopedia of world history] By Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]. &quot;Ancient and Classical Periods; 3500 BCE – 500 BCE.&quot;{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[Mesoamerica]] and western [[South America]]. Beyond these areas, the use of agriculture expanded East of the Andes Mountains in South America particularly with the [[Marajoara culture]], and in the continental United States with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell culture]].

====Andean civilizations====
The Central [[Andes]] in [[South America]] was one of the original areas of civilization, spanning 4,500 years from the [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte chico]] otherwise known as Caral-Supe in 3500 BC to the final the [[Inca Empire]] after which the entire continent was transformed by the 16th century [[Columbian Exchange]]. Until the late 20th century, details about Norte Chico were unclear and often confused with later cultures such as the [[Chavín culture|Chavin]].

Ancient Andean Civilization began with the rise or organized fishing communities from 3,500 BC onwards. Along with a sophisticated maritime society came the construction of large monuments, which likely existed as community centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/cultural-heritage/cultural-heritage-surveys/proyecto-arqueologico-norte|title=Proyecto Arqueológico Norte Chico|last=jseagard|date=2011-02-02|website=Field Museum|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200310032308/https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/cultural-heritage/cultural-heritage-surveys/proyecto-arqueologico-norte|archive-date=2020-03-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large ceremonial structures predated the Measoamerican Olmecs by 2,000 years making Norte Chico the first civilization in the western hemisphere.

====Mesoamerica====

Mesoamerican ancient civilizations included the [[Olmec]]s and [[Maya civilization|Mayans]]. Between 2000 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form and many matured into advanced [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations such as the: Olmec, [[Izapa]], [[Teotihuacan]], Maya, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], Which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans. These civilizations' progress included pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology.

The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BC. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]]. Their writing system had been thought to have influenced the Olmecs but, with recent evidence, the Olmec may have been the first civilization in the area to develop a true writing system independently. At the present time, there is some debate as to whether or not Olmec symbols, dated to 650 BC, are actually a form of writing preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20021207/fob1.asp Script Delivery: New World writing takes disputed turn] ''Science News'' December 7th, 2002; Vol.162 #23&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Northern America ====

Organized societies, in the ancient United States or Canada, were often mound builder civilizations. One of the most significant of these was the [[Poverty Point culture|Poverty Point Culture]] that existed in the U.S state of Louisiana, and was responsible for the creation of over 100 mound sites. The Mississippi River was a core area in the development of long-distance trade and culture. Following Poverty Point, successive complex cultures such as the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] emerged in the Southeastern United States in the [[Woodland period|Early Woodland period]].  Before 500 AD many mound builder societies, retained a hunter gatherer form of subsistence.

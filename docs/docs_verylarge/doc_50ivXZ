[[Speed reading]] continues where basic education stops. Reading speed generally increases significantly after constant practice. There are various speed reading techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/speed-reading_b_5317784.html|title=How I Learned to Read 300 Percent Faster in 20 Minutes|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|date=2014-05-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, speed reading does not guarantee comprehension or retention of what was read.

[[File:Micro-climate on rock at Sunrise-on- Sea.jpg|thumb|Microclimate on rock located in [[intertidal zone]] in [[Sunrise-on-Sea]], [[South Africa]]]]
A '''microclimate''' (or '''micro-climate''') is a local set of [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas, often with a slight difference but sometimes with a substantial one. The term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or square feet (for example a garden bed or a cave) or as large as many square kilometers or square miles. Because [[climate]] is [[statistics|statistical]], which implies spatial and temporal variation of the mean values of the describing [[parameter]]s, within a region there can occur and persist over time sets of statistically distinct conditions, that is, microclimates. Microclimates can be found in most places.

Microclimates exist, for example, near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere, or in heavy urban areas where [[brick]], [[concrete]], and [[asphalt]] absorb the sun's energy, heat up, and re-radiate that heat to the ambient air: the resulting [[urban heat island]] is a kind of microclimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sotoga.com/en/urban-microclimate|title=6 Examples of an Urban Microclimate|publisher=Sotoga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contributing factor of microclimate is the slope or [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] of an area. South-facing slopes in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north-facing slopes in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] are exposed to [[effect of Sun angle on climate|more direct sunlight]] than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer periods of time, giving the slope a warmer microclimate than the areas around the slope. The lowest area of a [[glen]] may sometimes [[frost]] sooner or harder than a nearby spot uphill, because cold air sinks, a drying breeze may not reach the lowest bottom, and [[dew point|humidity lingers and precipitates]], then [[freezing|freezes]].

==Background==
[[File:TheLostGardensOfHeligan-Jungle.jpg|thumb|[[Tree fern]]s thrive in a protected [[dell (landform)|dell]] area in the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]], in [[Cornwall]], England, latitude 50° 15'N.]]
The terminology &quot;micro-climate&quot; first appeared in the 1950s in publications such as ''Climates in Miniature: A Study of Micro-Climate Environment'' (Thomas Bedford Franklin, 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CLIMATES IN MINIATURE: A STUDY OF MICRO-CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT|author=Thomas Bedford Franklin|year=2013|publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC|asin=B00T3N7MTW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of microclimates==
The area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby, as natural [[flora]] in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot just radiates back into the air. Advocates of [[solar energy]] argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pisello|first1=Anna Laura|last2=Saliari|first2=Maria|last3=Vasilakopoulou|first3=Konstantina|last4=Hadad|first4=Shamila|last5=Santamouris|first5=Mattheos|date=2018|title=Facing the urban overheating: Recent developments. Mitigation potential and sensitivity of the main technologies|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=e294|doi=10.1002/wene.294|issn=2041-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small [[growing region]] for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area; this concept is often used in [[permaculture]] practiced in northern temperate climates. Microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants. Cities often raise the average temperature by [[zoning]], and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter. [[Roof garden]]ing, however, exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter.

In an urban area, tall buildings create their own microclimate, both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level. [[Wind Engineering|Wind effects]] around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study. ([[urban microclimate]])

Microclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments, such as those in a room or other enclosure. Microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments. This can be done using passive methods, such as [[silica gel]], or with active microclimate control devices.

Usually, if the inland areas have a [[humid continental climate]], the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months, in contrast to the hotter summers. This is the case further north on the American west coast, such as in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where [[Vancouver]] has an [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] wet winter with rare frosts, but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters.

===Soil types===
The type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates. For example, soils heavy in clay can act like pavement, moderating the near ground temperature. On the other hand, if soil has many air pockets, then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil, resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/weather/microcli.html|title=Gardening Resources, Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and influences on microclimate==
Two main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and [[humidity]]. A source of a drop in temperature and/or humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences.
Often microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of [[microscale meteorology]].

===Cold air pool===
The well known examples of cold air pool (CAP) effect are
Gstettneralm Sinkhole in Austria (lowest recorded temperature {{convert|-53|C|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetter-freizeit.com/mikroklima.html|title=Mikroklima – Definition – Wissenswertes|website=www.wetter-freizeit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sinks]] in the US.
The main criterion on the wind speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in order to create a warm air flow penetration into a CAP is the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{v}{Nh} \geq \mathrm{Fr}_c,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Froude number]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; — the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency]], &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; — depth of the valley, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr}_c&lt;/math&gt; — Froude number at the threshold wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Racovec et al. Turbulent dissipation of the cold-air pool in a basin: comparison of observed and simulated development. Meteorol. Atmos. Phys. 79, 195–213 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craters===
The presence of [[permafrost]] close to the surface in a [[volcanic crater|crater]] creates a unique microclimate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/reports/annual-reports/2010/uh/permafrost-in-hawaii/|title=Permafrost in Hawaii, NASA Astrobiology Institute, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217143746/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/reports/annual-reports/2010/uh/permafrost-in-hawaii/|archive-date=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caves and lava tubes===
As similar as [[lava tube]]s can be to [[cave]]s which are not formed due to volcanic activity the microclimate within the former is different due to dominant presence of [[basalt]].
Lava tubes and basaltic caves are important [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] targets on Earth and [[Mars]] (see also [[Martian lava tube]]).

===Plant microclimate===
As pointed out by [[Rudolf Geiger]] in his book&lt;ref&gt;R. Geiger. The climate near the ground. Harvard University Press, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; not only climate influences the living plant but the opposite effect of the interaction of plants on their environment can also take place, and is known as ''plant climate''. This effect has important consequences for forests in the midst of a continent; indeed, if forests were not creating their own clouds and [[Water cycle management|water cycle]] with their efficient [[Evapotranspiration|evapo-transpiration]] activity, there would be no forest far away from coasts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sheil|first1=Douglas|last2=Murdiyarso|first2=Daniel|date=2009-04-01|title=How Forests Attract Rain: An Examination of a New Hypothesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/4/341/346941|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=341–347|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12|s2cid=85905766|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as statistically, without any other influence, rainfall occurrence would decrease from the coast towards inland. Planting trees to fight drought has also been proposed in the context of [[afforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/10316/make-it-rain-planting-forests-to-help-drought-stricken-regions?fnl=en|title=Make it rain: Planting forests could help drought-stricken regions|date=2012-07-23|website=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2020-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dams===
{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
Artificial reservoirs as well as natural ones create microclimates and often influence the macroscopic climate as well.

==Cities and regions known for microclimates==

===Americas===
* [[Northern California]] above the Bay Area is also well known for microclimates with significant differences of temperatures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The coastline typically averages between {{convert|17|and|19|C|F}} during summer months along that coastline, but inland towns not far from the ocean such as [[Lakeport, California|Lakeport]], average as much as {{convert|34|C|F|abbr=on}} in spite of being just around {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} inland. Even as far north as the [[Klamath River]] valley around the [[41st parallel north]] between [[Willow Creek, California|Willow Creek]] and [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] averages such temperatures, which is extremely hot for such northerly areas. At this parallel, the temperature at the coast is so cool that Willow Creek beats [[Eureka, California|Eureka]]'s all-time record temperature on average 79 times per year. This is in spite of the areas being less than 50 miles from each other. In oceanic stable terms it is like traveling from the summers in the north of [[England]] to the south of [[Spain]] in a fraction of the distance.
** [[San Francisco]] is a city with microclimates and submicroclimates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Due to the city's varied topography and influence from the prevailing summer marine layer, weather conditions can vary by as much as 9&amp;nbsp;°F (5&amp;nbsp;°C) from block to block. The [[Noe Valley]] district for example, is typically warmer and sunnier than adjacent areas because the surrounding hills block some of the cool fog from the Pacific.
** The region as a whole, known as the [[San Francisco Bay area]] can have a wide range of extremes in temperature. In the basins and valleys adjoining the coast, climate is subject to wide variations within short distances as a result of the influence of topography on the circulation of marine air. The San Francisco Bay Area offers many varieties of climate within a few miles. In the Bay area, for example, the average maximum temperature in July is about {{convert|64|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] on the coast, {{convert|87|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]] only {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and {{convert|95|F|C|abbr=on}} at [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], just {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/CALIFORNIA.htm |title=Climate Of California |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] areas are also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The temperatures can vary as much as {{convert|18|F-change|abbr=on}}) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast inland. Hills and mountains can also block coastal air masses. The [[San Fernando Valley]] is usually much warmer in summer than most of Los Angeles, because the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] usually block the cool ocean breezes and fog. Southern California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot;[[June Gloom]]&quot; or &quot;May Grey&quot;, which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.
* The [[Big Island of Hawaii]] is also an area known for microclimates,{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} as [[Kailua-Kona]] and [[Hilo, Hawaii]] experience rainfall of {{convert|18|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|127|in|mm|abbr=on}} per year, respectively, despite being just {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} from each other.
* [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] is also known for its microclimates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Especially notable are the differences between the downtown and river valley/flood plain regions and the areas to the west and north. This is largely due to an elevation difference within the city's boundaries of over {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but can also be attributed somewhat, to the effects of the seasonal [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarboro.ca/articles/Calgary%20Gardening%20Climate.htm |title=Calgary's Gardening Climate |publisher=Scarboro.ca |date=2008-05-05 |access-date=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] also has numerous microclimates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Coastal temperatures and weather conditions can differ considerably from areas located just {{convert|5|–|15|km|abbr=on}} inland. This is true in all seasons. Varying elevations are common throughout the city, and it is even possible to experience several microclimates while traveling on a single highway due to these changing elevations.
* [[Vancouver]] and its [[Metro Vancouver|metro area]] also has many microclimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/environment-canada-metro-vancouver-forecast-weather-map|title=Environment Canada splits Metro Vancouver into 5 weather forecast sub-areas|publisher=DH News Vancouver|author=Kenneth Chan|access-date=March 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] and other regions situated on the mountain slopes get over {{convert|2000|mm|in}} of precipitation a year on average, while other regions to the south get around {{convert|1000|mm|in}}, although they are less than {{convert|40|km|mi}} away. Temperatures in the [[Fraser Valley]] inland may be up to {{convert|10|C|F|0}} warmer than the coast, while in winter they are several degrees colder.
* [[Chesapeake Bay]] is also known for its subtropical microclimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It is most notable for its mild climatic effects on the area east and west of the lowlands of Maryland and Delmarva. Having over 64,000 square miles of water; (most of which is a mix of fresh and salt water) creates higher levels of humidity and heat in the spring and summer months. An example of this effect is the survival of tropical palm trees and plants such as water hyacinths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.umd.edu/learn/august-ornamental-plant-tips|title=Learn – University of Maryland Extension|website=extension.umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/more-than-just-the-bay|title=More than Just the Bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/iss_pub/46/|title=Estimating Watershed Biodiversity: An Empirical Study of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, USA|first1=Morimoto|last1=Junko|first2=Voinov|last2=Helena|first3=Wilson, Matthew|last3=A.|first4=Costanza|last4=Robert|date=14 July 2017|journal=Journal of Geographic Information and Decision Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chile Chico]] and [[Los Antiguos]] on the southern shores of [[General Carrera Lake]] have favourable conditions for [[agriculture in Chile|agriculture]] despite being in inner [[Patagonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Rebolledo, M. (2011). Paisajes del agua y trayectorias del arraigo en la Patagonia chilena. CA. ''Ciudad y arquitectura'', (147), 44-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
* Known for its wines, the [[Ticino]] region in [[Switzerland]] benefits from a microclimate in which palm trees and banana trees grow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}
* [[Gran Canaria]] is called &quot;Miniature Continent&quot; for its rich variety of microclimates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}
* [[Tenerife]] is known for its wide variety of microclimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tenerife climate: average weather, temperature, precipitation, best time|url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/canary-islands/tenerife|access-date=2020-06-09|website=www.climatestotravel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biddulph Grange]] is very rich with microclimates as a result of the large dips and variety of very large trees alongside a large amount of water.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}
* [[Leeds]], located in Yorkshire, England is known to have a number of microclimates because of the number of valleys surrounding the city centre.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}
* The coastal areas in the [[Andalusia]] region of [[Spain]] has a microclimate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} It typically averages around at {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} in summer, but [[Tarifa]] only averages {{convert|24|C|F}}. Further north along the coast [[Cádiz]] has a summer average of {{convert|27|C|F|abbr=on}} withco warm nights, whereas nearby [[Jerez de la Frontera]] has summer highs of {{convert|33|C|F|abbr=on}} with inland areas further north such as [[Seville]] being even hotter.
* [[Sorana (Pescia)|Sorana]], a commune in Italy's Pescia Valley with a microclimate considered ideal for growing the [[Sorana bean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The importance of place : geographical indications as a tool for local and regional development|last1=van Caenegem|first1=William|last2=Cleary|first2=Jen|isbn=978-3-319-53073-4|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=266|oclc=980874944|date = 2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Barcola]] near Trieste has been highly valued for its microclimate since ancient times. The shielded location by the sea means that the advantages of the Bora wind, such as liveliness, enterprising spirit and joyous mood, come into play, while at the same time protecting Mediterranean weather.&lt;ref&gt;Zeno Saracino: “Pompei in miniatura”: la storia di “Vallicula” o Barcola.

'''Edmund Charles Blunden''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|MC}} (1 November 1896 – 20 January 1974) was an English poet, author and [[literary critic|critic]]. Like his friend [[Siegfried Sassoon]], he wrote of his experiences in [[World War I]] in  both verse and prose. For most of his career, Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications and an academic in Tokyo and later Hong Kong. He ended his career as [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1092|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born in London, Blunden was the eldest of the nine children of Charles Edmund Blunden (1871–1951) and his wife, Georgina Margaret ''née'' Tyler, who were joint-headteachers of [[Yalding]] school.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Bergonzi, Bernard, &quot;Blunden, Edmund Charles (1896–1974)&quot;, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30828, accessed 28 Nov 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Blunden was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;&quot;Blunden, Edmund Charles&quot;, Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, 1920–2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U152421, accessed 28 Nov 2008]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
In September 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29290|page=8993|date=10 September 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War I]], Blunden was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Sussex Regiment]]. He was posted to the 11th (Service) Battalion (1st South Down), Royal Sussex Regiment, a [[Kitchener's Army]] unit that formed part of the [[116th Brigade (United Kingdom)|116th Brigade]] of the [[39th Division (United Kingdom)|39th Division]] in May 1916, two months after the battalion's arrival in France. He served with the battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to the end of the war, taking part in the actions at [[Ypres]] and the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], followed in 1917 by the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. In January 1917, he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for &quot;conspicuous gallantry in action&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29921 |supp=y|page=1016|date=26 January 1917}} &quot;For conspicuous gallantry in action. He displayed great courage and determination when in charge of a carrying party under heavy fire. He has previously done fine work.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blunden survived nearly two years in the front line without physical injury (despite being [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gassed]] in October 1917&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmundblunden.org/productservice.php?productserviceid=294&lt;/ref&gt;) but, for the rest of his life, he bore mental scars from his experiences.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt; With characteristic self-deprecation he attributed his survival to his diminutive size, which made &quot;an inconspicuous target&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt; His own account of his  experiences was published in 1928, as ''Undertones of War''.

Word classes considered as syntactic categories may be called ''lexical categories'', as distinct from phrasal categories. The terminology here is by no means consistent, however. Many grammars also draw a distinction between ''lexical categories'' (which tend to consist of [[content word]]s, or phrases [[head (linguistics)|headed]] by them) and ''functional categories'' (which tend to consist of [[function word]]s or abstract functional elements, or phrases headed by them). The term ''lexical category'' therefore has two distinct meanings. Moreover, syntactic categories should not be confused with [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] (also known as grammatical [[feature (linguistics)|feature]]s), which are properties such as [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], etc.

==Defining criteria==
At least three criteria are used in defining syntactic categories:

::#The type of meaning it expresses
::#The type of [[affix]]es it takes
::#The structure in which it occurs

For instance, many nouns in English denote concrete entities, they are pluralized with the suffix ''-s'', and they occur as subjects and objects in clauses. Many verbs denote actions or states, they are conjugated with agreement suffixes (e.g. ''-s'' of the third person singular in English), and in English they tend to show up in medial positions of the clauses in which they appear.

The third criterion is also known as ''distribution''. The distribution of a given syntactic unit determines the syntactic category to which it belongs. The distributional behavior of syntactic units is identified by substitution.&lt;ref&gt;See Culicover (1982:8ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Like syntactic units can be substituted for each other.

Additionally, there are also informal criteria one can use in order to determine syntactic categories. For example, one informal means of determining if an item is lexical, as opposed to functional, is to see if it is left behind in &quot;telegraphic speech&quot; (that is, the way a telegram would be written; e.g., ''Pants fire. Bring water, need help.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax A Generative Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=MA, USA|page=52|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Syntax/MFZ1UV3YGtgC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22syntactic%20categories%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexical categories vs. phrasal categories==
The traditional [[parts of speech]] are lexical categories, in one meaning of that term.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Emonds (1976:14), Culicover (1982:12),  Brown and Miller (1991:24, 105), Cowper (1992:20, 173), Napoli (1993:169, 52), Haegeman (1994:38), Culicover (1997:19), Brinton (2000:169).&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional grammars tend to acknowledge approximately eight to twelve lexical categories, e.g.

::&lt;u&gt;Lexical categories&lt;/u&gt;
::[[adjective]] (A), [[adposition]] (preposition, postposition, circumposition) (P), [[adverb]] (Adv), coordinate [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] (C), [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] (D), [[interjection]] (I), [[noun]] (N), [[Grammatical particle|particle]] (Par), [[pronoun]] (Pr), subordinate [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] (Sub), [[verb]] (V), etc.

The lexical categories that a given grammar assumes will likely vary from this list. Certainly numerous subcategories can be acknowledged. For instance, one can view pronouns as a subtype of noun, and verbs can be divided into [[finite verb]]s and [[non-finite verb]]s (e.g. gerund, infinitive, participle, etc.). The central lexical categories give rise to corresponding phrasal categories:&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Emonds (1976:12), Culicover (1982:13), Brown and Miller (1991:107), Cowper (1992:20), Napoli(1993:165), Haegeman (1994:38).&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;u&gt;Phrasal categories&lt;/u&gt;
::[[Adjective phrase]] (AP), [[adverb phrase]] (AdvP), [[Prepositional phrase|adposition phrase]] (PP), [[noun phrase]] (NP), [[verb phrase]] (VP), etc.

In terms of [[phrase structure rules]], phrasal categories can occur to the left of the arrow while lexical categories cannot, e.g. NP → D N. Traditionally, a phrasal category should consist of two or more words, although conventions vary in this area. [[X-bar theory]], for instance, often sees individual words corresponding to phrasal categories. Phrasal categories are illustrated with the following trees:

::[[File:Syntactic category1.jpg|Syntactic categories PSG]]

The lexical and phrasal categories are identified according to the node labels, phrasal categories receiving the &quot;P&quot; designation.

==Lexical categories only==
[[Dependency grammar]]s do not acknowledge phrasal categories in the way that [[phrase structure grammar]]s do. What this means is that the distinction between lexical and phrasal categories disappears, the result being that only lexical categories are acknowledged. The tree representations are simpler because the number of nodes and categories is reduced, e.g.

::[[File:Syntactic category 2.jpg|Syntactic categories DG]]

The distinction between lexical and phrasal categories is absent here. The number of nodes is reduced by removing all nodes marked with &quot;P&quot;. Note, however, that phrases can still be acknowledged insofar as any subtree that contains two or more words will qualify as a phrase.

==Lexical categories vs. functional categories==
Many grammars draw a distinction between ''lexical categories'' and ''functional categories''.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of grammars that draw a distinction between lexical and functional categories, see for instance Fowler (1971:36, 40), Emonds (1976:13), Cowper (1992:173ff.), Culicover (1997:142), Haegeman and Guéron (1999:58), Falk (2001:34ff.), Carnie (2007:45f.).&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is orthogonal to the distinction between lexical categories and phrasal categories. In this context, the term ''lexical category'' applies only to those parts of speech and their phrasal counterparts that form open classes and have full semantic content. The parts of speech that form closed classes and have mainly just functional content are called ''functional categories'':

::&lt;u&gt;Lexical categories&lt;/u&gt;
::Adjective (A) and adjective phrase (AP), adverb (Adv) and adverb phrase (AdvP), noun (N) and noun phrase (NP), verb and verb phrase (VP), preposition and prepositional phrase (PP)

::&lt;u&gt;Functional categories&lt;/u&gt;
::Coordinate conjunction (C), determiner (D), negation (Neg), particle (Par), preposition (P) and prepositional phrase (PP), subordinate conjunction (Sub), etc.

There is disagreement in certain areas, for instance concerning the status of prepositions. The distinction between lexical and functional categories plays a big role in Chomskyan grammars (Transformational Grammar, Government and Binding Theory, Minimalist Program), where the role of the functional categories is large. Many phrasal categories are assumed that do not correspond directly to a specific part of speech, e.g. [[inflection phrase]] (IP), tense phrase (TP), agreement phrase (AgrP), [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] phrase (FP), etc. (see also [[Phrase#Functional categories|Phrase → Functional categories]]). In order to acknowledge such functional categories, one has to assume that the constellation is a primitive of the theory and that it exists separately from the words that appear. As a consequence, many grammar frameworks do not acknowledge such functional categories, e.g. Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, etc.

:''Note: The abbreviations for these categories vary across systems; see {{section link|Part-of-speech tagging|Tag sets}}.''

'''Corleone''' ({{IPA-it|korleˈoːne|lang}}; {{lang-scn|Cunigghiuni}} {{IPA-scn|kʊnɪɟˈɟuːnɪ|}} or {{lang|scn|Curliuni}} {{IPA-scn|kʊɾlɪˈuːnɪ|}}) is an [[Italy|Italian]] town and ''[[comune]]'' of roughly 11,158 inhabitants in the [[Metropolitan City of Palermo]], in [[Sicily]].

Several [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] bosses have come from Corleone, including [[Tommy Gagliano]], [[Gaetano Reina]], [[Jack Dragna]], [[Giuseppe Morello]], [[Michele Navarra]], [[Luciano Leggio]], [[Leoluca Bagarella]], [[Salvatore Riina]] and [[Bernardo Provenzano]]. It is also the birthplace of several fictional characters in [[Mario Puzo]]'s 1969 novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', including the eponymous [[Vito Corleone|Vito (Andolini) Corleone]].

The local mafia clan, the [[Corleonesi]], led the Mafia in the 1980s and 1990s, and were the most violent and ruthless group ever to take control of the organization.

The Corleone municipality has an area of {{convert|22912|ha|acre}} with a population density of 49 inhabitants per square kilometer. It is located in an inland area of the mountain, in the valley between the Rocca di Maschi, the Castello Soprano and the Castello Sottano. Corleone is located at {{convert|542|m|ft}} above sea level.

==History==
===Etymology===
The etymology of the name is uncertain, undergoing various modifications from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''Kouroullounè'' to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Kurulliùn'' \ ''Qurlayun'' of the [[Emirate of Sicily]], from [[Latin]] ''Curilionum'' to the [[Norman language|Norman]] ''Coraigliòn'', from the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] ''Conillon'', ''Coniglione'' from which the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ''Cunigghiuni'' originated. The modern name originates from 1556.

Another belief is that the name derives from an Arab fighter named Kurliyun (cf. Coeur Leon, Lionheart), who conquered it for the Aghlabids in 840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Follain|title=The Last Godfathers|date=8 Jun 2009|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=9781848942493|quote=Corleone, whose name is believed to derive from Kurliyun (Lionheart), an Arab fighter who conquered it in AD 840, has a proud tradition of standing up for its rights, and violently so...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
The territory of Corleone has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Recent research has identified several settlements distributed around two main areas: [[Pietralunga]] and The Old One (''La Vecchia''). This name refers to a mountain that rises to about {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, and is about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from today's town. The site of Pietralunga was occupied from the final [[Neolithic Period]] to the [[Bronze Age]] (the presence of a glass bell decorated in pointillé) while the site of The Old One has been inhabited since the [[Middle Ages]] (the presence of an imposing castle with towers has recently been identified). However, the biggest part of the settlement was built in the archaic and classical period. &quot;A few materials relating to the [[Hellenistic]] period found at the site have supported the identification of the ancient town situated on the Old One with the ancient town of Schera, cited by [[Cicero]], [[Cluverio]] and [[Ptolemy]], although the archaeological remains on which this theory is based are still too unstable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} (D'Angelo - Spatafora).

===Middle Ages===
In 840, Corleone was conquered by the North African [[Aghlabids]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexander Mikaberidze|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=22 Jul 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598843378|page=831}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Muslim occupation that it gained economic, military and strategic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Follain|title=The Last Godfathers|date=8 Jun 2009|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=9781848942493|quote=A Saracen lookout tower is perched on another rocky outcrop, a relic from the time when the town was an important strategic point dominating the road from the Sicilian capital Palermo to the island's southern coast.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dana Facaros|author2=Michael Pauls|title=Sicily|date=2008|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781860113970|page=242|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Touring Club of Italy|title=Authentic Sicily|date=2005|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=9788836534036|page=63|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1080 the city was conquered by the Normans, and in 1095 it was annexed to the Diocese of [[Palermo]].

Corleone was built between two rocks on which two Saracen fortifications were built.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century later, in 1180, it was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] (deeded) to the new diocese of [[Monreale]]. In this period, Corleone was largely repopulated by [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] from [[Alessandria]] (modern Piedmont), Brescia and elsewhere—[[Lombards of Sicily|&quot;Lombards&quot;]] led by Oddone de Camerana. The migrations were encouraged by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Sicily]], to strengthen his position against the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]]. In 1249, however, he revoked the privilege and gave the city to the royal property, though the migration of the inhabitants from the Po Valley continued until the beginning of the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in 1282. Another Camerana, named Boniface, distinguished himself in the revolution of the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. He led the insurrection against the Angevins with three thousand people from Corleone, in alliance with the city of [[Palermo]]. In recognition, the Senate of [[Palermo]] called Corleone ''soror mea'' (my sister).

During the reign of Frederick IV of Sicily, called The Simple, the city successfully rebelled against the crown but was recaptured in 1355. Corleone was besieged from [[Ventimiglia]] in 1358. During the reign of the four vicars, Corleone became the property of the powerful [[Chiaramonte]] family, but in 1391 was donated by Mary Queen of [[Sicily]] to Berardo Queralt, canon of Lerida, but he never took possession. Instead, it was occupied by Nicholas Peralta, vicar William's son, but King Martin the Younger returned it to the royal property, confirming its privileges in 1397 and giving it some tax relief.

===Medieval history===
In March 1434, King Alfonso the Magnanimous went to Corleone and conceded some tolls to the city with the aim of restoring the walls and to meet other needs, promising also the inalienability of the city to which he gave the title of ''Animosa Civitas'' (brave city). However, in 1440 Corleone was sold to Federico [[Ventimiglia]] for 19,000 florins. This concession was revoked in May 1447 by King Alfonso, to be resold in the same year to a certain John of [[Bologna]]. In 1452 the city was finally granted to attorney James Pilaya. In 1516, Corleone joined the revolutionary movements of [[Palermo]] against the Viceroy Moncada. The revolt of Corleone, led by Fabio La Porta, received popular support as its purpose was the request for tax relief. However, the revolt was violently repressed by the viceroy's troops led by the Vicar General Gerardo Bonanno. [[Cardinal Anthony 'Bognor' Iannazzo (1480-1516?)]], a native of Corleone, and a political ally of the [[Borgia family]], otherwise known for a history of frequently terminating local clergy under his employ, tried unsuccessfully to quell the violence. His ship was lost at sea off the coast of North Africa in 1516. Towards the end of the same century, social conditions in the city worsened further because of the plague of 1575&amp;ndash;77 and the famine of 1592. On June 3, 1625, Corleone was sold, with other cities, to some Genoese merchants from whom Corleone redeemed itself upon payment of 15,200 florins. The terms of sale were, however, very serious. In 1648, the city was sold to the jurist Joseph Sgarlata, who then accepted the redemption upon payment.

Remarkable demographic growth was reported in the 15th and 16th centuries, following the arrival of several religious orders.

===Contemporary history===
Corleone contributed to the events of the Italian [[Risorgimento]] through [[Francesco Bentivegna]] who, after participating in the riots of 1848, captained an insurrection against the Bourbons in the surrounding cities until he was arrested and then shot in Mezzojuso on December 20, 1856.  On May 27, 1860, the city was the scene of a fierce battle between followers of [[Garibaldi]], led by Colonel [[Vincenzo Giordano Orsini]], and the bulk of the Bourbon army led by General Von Meckel, which had been diverted from Palermo via a ploy hatched by the same Garibaldi. On that occasion, a team of volunteers (''Picciotti'', [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] for &quot;boys&quot;), led by [[Ferdinando Firmaturi]], joined the march of Garibaldi in Palermo.

The nineteenth century ended with the social action by [[Bernardino Verro]], a leader of the social movement ''Fasci Siciliani''. After founding the Fascio of Corleone on April 3, 1893, he founded the new Farm Lease that was entered into between farmers and agricultural Sicilian ''gabelloti'' in Congress on July 30, 1893, held in Corleone—so much so that the city began to assume the title of &quot;peasant capital&quot;. Corleone contributed to the [[Great War]] with 105 deaths and numerous injuries on the field. After [[World War II]], a peasant movement occupied vacant lands, led by trade unionist [[Placido Rizzotto]], who was killed by the Mafia.

In 1943, the [[Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]] created the title of Count of Corleone, awarded to Arturo Faini for his valour during the [[Italy|Italian]] occupation of [[Ethiopia]].

Since [[World War II]], Corleone has become notorious for being home to several dangerous bandits and mobsters (including: Michael Navarra, Luciano Leggio, Bernardo Provenzano, [[Salvatore Riina]] and his brothers-in-law Calogero and Leoluca Bagarella) who became the protagonists of a violent and bloody mafia power struggle. Linked to the Corleone clan was also the mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, born in Corleone.

==Geography==
Located in the southwestern area of its province, the municipality of Corleone has an area of 229.46 square kilometers (88.60 sq mi) and is located in a basin in a mountainous inland area, approximately {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level, {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} south of the prominent [[Rocca Busambra]]. It borders the municipalities of  [[Bisacquino]], [[Campofelice di Fitalia]], [[Campofiorito]], [[Contessa Entellina]], [[Chiusa Sclafani]], [[Godrano]], [[Mezzojuso]], [[Monreale]], [[Palazzo Adriano]], [[Prizzi]] and [[Roccamena]]. Its only hamlet (''[[Frazione]]'') is the village of [[Ficuzza]], an [[enclave]] in the municipal territory of Monreale.&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|39340|Corleone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|113941372|Ficuzza}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|n|605499160|Ficuzza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
===Mother Church===
Work on the ''Chiesa Madre'' (&quot;Mother Church&quot;), dedicated to the 4th-century French bishop Saint [[Martin of Tours]], started in the late 14th century. Its appearance today has been influenced by numerous changes and renovations. The interior has a nave and aisles divided into various chapels containing artwork, including a wooden statue representing San Filippo d'Agira from the 17th century, a 16th-century statue representing San Biagio ([[Saint Blaise]]) and a fine marble panel depicting the ''Baptism of Christ'' (also from this period).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Addolorata Church===
The ''Chiesa dell'Addolorata'' is from the 18th century, dedicated to the Basilian abbot and patron saint [[Leoluca|San Leoluca]]

==== Other Churches ====

The ''Chiesa di Santa Rosalia'', and the small ''Sant'Andrea'' (the latter two from the 17th century), all with important frescoes and paintings, are notable landmarks. The ''Santuario della Madonna del Rosario di Tagliavia'', a religious building from the 19th century, is now a destination for pilgrims on [[Ascension Day]].

The CIDMA museum (''Centro Internazionale di Documentazione sulla Mafia e del Movimento Antimafia'') was inaugurated on 12 December 2000, in the presence of the highest authorities of the Republic, including the President of the Republic [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] and the deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Pino Arlacchi]], on behalf of Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]. The CIDMA intends to pursue &quot;Culture, Progress and Legality&quot; as its objectives.

CIDMA has several rooms for visitors: Room of the Folders of the [[Maxi Trial]] ({{lang-it|Maxiprocesso di Palermo}}), the Room of the Messages, the Room of Pain and the final room dedicated to [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]], an Italian general who campaigned against terrorism and was assassinated by the Mafia. The first room contains Maxi-Trial documents which marked a milestone in the fight against [[Cosa Nostra]].

The documents, given to Corleone by the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Palermo, are a testimony to the work of magistrates like [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]] who paid with their lives for their commitment to the fight against the Mafia. Among the folders there are the confessions of the famous ''[[pentito]]'' (&quot;repentant&quot;) [[Tommaso Buscetta]] to Judge Falcone.

In the Room of the Messages, visitors may see the photos of the well-known, Sicilian photographer [[Letizia Battaglia]] who had the courage to go on site to capture tragic photographs of Mafia murders. She was able to capture significant details that made her shots documents detailing the murder methods used by the Mafia in the 1970s–1980s. The different positions of the bodies allow visitors to reconstruct the Mafia's strategy.

The Room of Pain houses a permanent exhibition of Shobha, Letizia Battaglia’s daughter, who followed in her mother's footsteps, taking photos of the dismay, helplessness, and despair felt by those who have lost someone at the hands of the Mafia. In the room there are also photos of Letizia Battaglia documenting Mafia crimes. This approach allows visitors to understand the cause-effect relationships that exist between the crimes and the consequences they produce in the lives of affected families and the entire community.

In the 2000 film ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', Sarah Goldfarb receives &quot;unmodified&quot; electroconvulsive therapy after experiencing severe [[amphetamine psychosis]] following prolonged stimulant abuse. Unlike typical ECT treatment, she is given no anesthetic or medication before.

In the 2014 TV series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', the protagonist John Constantine is institutionalized and specifically requests electroconvulsive therapy as an attempt to alleviate or resolve his mental problems.

The musical ''[[Next to Normal]]'' revolves around the family of a woman who undergoes the procedure.

In the HBO series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' season 5, George undergoes an ECT treatment to deal with his increasing paranoia. The depiction is shown realistically, with an actual ECT machine.

In the WB/CW TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', Lionel Luthor condemns his son Lex Luthor to electroshock therapy to remove Lex's short-term memory of a murder he discovered Lionel committed.

In the Netflix series ''[[Stranger Things]]'', Eleven's mother is given electroshock therapy to silence her.

Electroshock therapy is used on various characters throughout [[American Horror Story: Asylum|season 2]] of [[American Horror Story: Asylum|American Horror Story]].

==Special populations==
=== Sex difference ===
Throughout the history of ECT, women have received it two to three times as often as men.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Report of the Electro-convulsive Therapy Review Committee.&quot; Toronto: Electro-convulsive Therapy Review Committee, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, about 70 percent of ECT patients are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudorfer&quot;/&gt; This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudorfer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid&quot;/&gt; A 1974 study of ECT in Massachusetts reported that women made up 69 percent of those given ECT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grosser G | year = 1975 | title = The Regulation of Electroshock Treatment in Massachusetts | journal = Massachusetts Journal of Mental Health | volume = 5 | pages = 12–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health in Canada reported that from 1999 until 2000 in the province of Ontario, women were 71 percent of those given ECT in provincial psychiatric institutions, and 75 percent of the total ECT given was given to women.&lt;ref&gt;Weitz, D. &quot;Ontario Electroshock Statistics.&quot; Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. Toronto: Ontario. Ministry of Health, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
In the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] structure &quot;[[genus (biology)|genus]] → [[species (biology)|species]]&quot;, a species is described as ''sui generis'' if its genus was created to classify it (i.e. its uniqueness at the time of classification merited the creation of a new genus, the sole member of which was initially the ''sui generis'' species). A species that is the sole ''extant'' member of its genus (e.g. the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'') is not necessarily ''sui generis''; extinctions have eliminated other congeneric species.

==Creative arts==
A book, movie, television series, or other artistic creation is called ''sui generis'' when it does not fit into standard genre boundaries. Movie critic Richard Schickel identifies'' [[Joe Versus the Volcano]]'' as a ''sui generis'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Joe Versus the Volcano'', 1990, John Patrick Shanley, U.S. |url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953151_1954835,00.html |work= Guilty Pleasures| publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Richard |last= Schickel| authorlink= Richard Schickel|date= February 12, 2005 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Michael Brooke used the term to describe ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'', a 1973 Franco-Czech sci-fi animated film directed by [[René Laloux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Fantastic Planet'': Gambous Amalga|last=Brooke|first=Michael|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4112-fantastic-planet-gambous-amalga|website=criterion.com|publisher=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
In [[law]], it is a [[term of art]] used to identify a legal classification that exists independently of other categorizations, either because of its singularity or due to the specific creation of an entitlement or obligation.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Dunway v. New York'',442 U.S. 200 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a court's contempt powers arise'' sui generis'' and not from statute or rule.&lt;ref&gt;See ''In re Marriage of Betts'', 558 N.E.2d 404, 200 Ill.App.3d 26 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Court of Appeals]] has used the term in describing cooperative apartment corporations, mostly because this form of housing is considered [[real property]] for some purposes and [[personal property]] for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Matter of State Tax Commn. v. Shor'', 43 NY2d 151, 400 N.Y.S.2d 805, 371 N.E.2d 523 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

When citing cases and other authorities, lawyers and judges may refer to &quot;a ''sui generis'' case&quot;, or &quot;a ''sui generis'' authority&quot;, meaning it is a special one confined to ''its own'' facts, and therefore may not be of broader application.

===Aboriginal law and education===
The motto &quot;Sui Generis&quot; has been adopted by the [[Akitsiraq Law School]] because it is a ''sui generis'' [[Aboriginal land title in Canada|(aboriginal) title]] in all of [[Canadian aboriginal law]] institutes by dint of its title being Inuktitut, the Aboriginal language of the Inuit in the far north of Canada. More importantly, in aboriginal professional legal education, the work of Aboriginal people to define and create contemporary aboriginal education is a ''thing of its own kind'' having ''sui generis'' admissions and ''sui generis'' curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;(Hampton, E. (p.&amp;nbsp;10–11) in Battiste &amp; Barman (Eds.). ''First Nations Education in Canada: The Circle Unfolds''. UBC Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property law===
Generally speaking, protection for [[intellectual property]] extends to intellectual creations in order to incentivize innovation, and depends upon the nature of the work and its ''characteristics''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The main types of intellectual property law are: [[copyright]], which protects creative works; [[patent]], which protects invention; [[trade secret]], which protects information not generally known or readily ascertainable that is valuable to the secret holder; and [[trademark]], which protects branding and other exclusive properties of products and services. Any matter that meets these criteria can be protected.

However, ''sui generis'' statutes exist in many countries that extend intellectual property protection to matter that does not meet characteristic definitions: [[Integrated circuit layout design protection|integrated circuit layouts]], [[Hull (ship)|ship hull designs]], [[fashion design]]s in France, [[database right|databases]], or [[Plant variety (law)|plant varieties]] require ''sui generis'' statutes because of their unique characteristics. The United States, Japan, Australia and many EU countries protect the topography of semiconductor chips and [[integrated circuits]] under ''sui generis'' laws, which borrow some aspects from patent or copyright law. In the U.S. this ''sui generis'' law is known as the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]].

===Statutory law===
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
In [[statutory interpretation]], it refers to the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear.

For example, in road traffic law, a statute may require consideration of large vehicles separately from other vehicles.  The word ''large'' is ambiguous per se, but may be considered ''heavy''.  Thus the relevant legislation (in Australian law) contains a section called ''Terms used'' or ''Definitions'' that itemises all words considered ambiguous, and confers specific interpretations consistent with natural language.  So, this list tells us that ''heavy vehicle'' means a vehicle with a ''GVM'' over 4.5 tons, and ''GVM'' means ''gross vehicle mass'', the maximum loaded mass of the vehicle. Further explanations cover various contingencies. Thus, ''large'' is equivalent to ''heavy'' and is (for this unique case) clearly defined ''sui generis''.

===Town planning law===
In United Kingdom [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]] law, in particular relating to the [[Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987]], many common types of land use are categorised into specific &quot;use classes&quot;. Change of use of land ''within'' a use class does not require planning permission; however, changing ''between'' use classes might require planning permission, and permission is always required if the new use is ''sui generis''.

Examples of ''sui generis'' uses include [[embassy|embassies]], [[theatre]]s, [[amusement arcade]]s, [[laundrette]]s, [[Taxicab|taxi]] or [[vehicle hire]] businesses, [[gas station|petrol filling stations]], [[scrapyard]]s, [[nightclub]]s, [[car dealership|motor car showrooms]], retail warehouses, clubs and [[hostel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/commonprojects/changeofuse/ Planningportal.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The grant of private hire vehicle (taxicab) operators licences by local authorities frequently has a condition attached that the appropriate ''sui generis'' change of use planning permission is granted to those premises to ensure those businesses cannot trade lawfully without the appropriate planning consents.

==Philosophy==
[[Analytic philosophy]] often uses the expression to indicate an idea, an [[Non-physical entity|entity]], or a reality that cannot be reduced to a lower [[concept]] or included in a higher concept.&lt;ref name=uslegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Sui Generis Law and Legal Definition|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sui-generis/ |accessdate=2 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and society==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
In [[political philosophy]], the unparalleled development of the [[European Union]] as compared with other [[international organizations]] has led to its designation as a ''sui generis'' [[geopolitical]] entity. The legal nature of the EU is widely debated because its mixture of [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] elements causes it to share characteristics with both [[confederal]] and [[Federalism|federal]] entities. It is generally considered more than a confederation but less than a federation,&lt;ref&gt;For example, David Marquand says it is ‘less than a federation but more than a confederation’; Brigid Laffan and Kimmo Kiljunen both see it residing ‘between a confederation and a federation’; Thomas Hueglin and Alan Fenna locate it ‘somewhere between federation and confederation’; and Kalypso Nicolaidis argues ‘it is more than a confederation of sovereign states; ... (however, it) should not become a federal state’. Marquand, David (2006) ‘Federalism and the British: Anatomy of a Neurosis’, in Political Quarterly, Vol. 77, No. 2, p. 175. Laffan, Brigid (2002) The Future of Europe Debate, Institute of European Affairs, Dublin, p. 10. Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004) The European Constitution in the Making, Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels, p. 22. Hueglin, Thomas and Fenna, Alan (2006) Comparative Federalism: A Systematic Inquiry, Broadview, Peterborough, p. 13. Nicolaidis, Kalypso (2004) ‘We, the Peoples of Europe ...’, in Foreign Affairs, Vol. 83, No. 6, pp. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being appropriately classified as an instance of neither political form. Compared to other international organizations, the EU is often considered &quot;sui generis&quot; because its legal system comprehensively rejects any use of retaliatory sanctions by one member state against another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelan|first1=William|title=What Is ''Sui Generis'' About the European Union? Costly International Cooperation in a Self-Contained Regime|journal=International Studies Review|date=2012|volume=14|issue=3|pages=367–385|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2012.01136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case that led to the use of the label ''sui generis'' is the relationship of [[New Caledonia]] relative to France, because the legal status of New Caledonia can aptly be said to lie somewhere between a French [[overseas collectivity]] and a [[sovereign nation]]. Although other examples of such status for other [[List of dependent territories|dependent]] or [[List of disputed or occupied territories|disputed]] territories may exist, this arrangement is unique within the French realm.

The [[legal status of the Holy See]] has also been described as a ''sui generis'' entity possessing an international personality.

In local government, a ''sui generis'' entity is one that does not fit with the general scheme of local governance of a country. For example in England, the [[City of London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]] are the two ''sui generis'' localities, as their forms of local government are both (for historical or geographical reasons) very different from those of elsewhere in the country. 
In a press conference during which reporters were trying to analyse his political personality,  [[Huey Long]] said, &quot;...say that I am ''sui generus'', and let it go at that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 1999, page 473, quoted from T. Harry Williams' ''Huey Long'' ( 1969 )&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Joint Council of Municipalities]] in [[Croatia]] is a ''sui generis'' council of municipalities in the east of the country that formed after an international agreement to protect the rights of the ethnic Serb community in the region and is, as such, unique in Croatia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZVO1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snv.hr/institucije/zajednicko-vece-opstina|title=Zajedničko veće opština|publisher=[[Serb National Council]]|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZVO2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio-borovo.hr/2017/07/29/konstituisan-6-saziv-zajednickog-veca-opstina-novi-predsednik-srdan-jeremic-iz-borova/|title=Konstituisan 6.saziv Zajedničkog veća opština – novi predsednik Srđan Jeremić iz Borova|publisher=[[Radio Borovo]]|accessdate=19 February 2018|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZVO3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portalnovosti.com/dragana-jeckov-vraticemo-ukradeni-mandat|title=Дрaгaнa Jeцкoв: Врaтићeмo укрaдeни мандат|publisher=[[Novosti (Croatia)]]|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
In sociology, the ''sui generis'' is what has been externalized, then internalized in the overall public and becomes a part of society that simply exists in its construct. It is not something that is not thought to have been created, because it is embedded in everyone's way of thinking and being. Instances include the idea of love, or going to school, or clothing belonging to a specific gender. These examples are ''sui generis'' for they simply exist in society and are widely accepted without thoughts of where they come from or how they were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;berger&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Construction Of Reality|last1 = Berger|first1 = Peter|publisher = Random House|year = 1966|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Luckman|first2 = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3355" xml:space="preserve">'''Hans von Bodeck''' (1582 – 23 June 1658) was a [[Prussian]] [[diplomat]] and chancellor of the [[Hohenzollern]] [[Prince-elector]]s of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].

==Biography==
Bodeck came from a prominent patrician family of [[Elbląg|Elbing]] (Elbląg) in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] province of [[Royal Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change'', Routledge, 1998, p. 124, {{ISBN|0-415-16112-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=IuW7T8wfNGAC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22Royal+prussia%22+Poland+1466+Elbl%C4%85g&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was the [[burgomaster]], while his father was a city councilman. His ancestor Johann III von Bodeck (1542–1595) received imperial status from Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and was allowed to improve the family's [[coat of arms]]. The family also held offices in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk).

In order to find a trading partner Bodeck was sent on a diplomatic mission from Elbing throughout Europe. During that time he wrote ''liber amicorum'', which is now studied by [[musicologist]]s. During his diplomatic tour Bodeck visited the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[England]], where he attended the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. He attended the funeral ceremony for Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] and the coronation of the new English king, [[James I of England|James I]]. The council of Elbing had sent two delegates with dual missions:  firstly, to pay its respects to the new king and secondly to oppose the transfer of English trade from Elbing to nearby Danzig.

In 1604 Bodeck left for [[London]] and met [[John Dowland]], [[Philip Rosseter]], and [[Thomas Campion]]. All three composers of [[lute]] songs lived in the same district of London. Bodeck befriended them, and Campion wrote a song dedicated to Bodeck. Many people from England and Scotland came to live in Elbling.

Later that year Bodeck left for [[Paris]] and met Count [[Christopher von Dohna]], a nobleman of Prussia, who lived 15&amp;nbsp;km from Elbing. Bodeck then became the chancellor to Elector [[Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim Frederick]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. He died in 1658 in [[Hamburg]].

A collection of pieces for lute was purchased by Dohna and kept at the Elbing library. In 1929 Hans Bauer wrote a full description of the register of Bodeck. During the capture of Elbing by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in 1945 during [[World War II]] and the subsequent [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of the city's German populace]], the library was destroyed. Many Prussian documents and original manuscripts have since been discovered in [[Kraków]], leading music researchers to hope that some of Bodeck's works might resurface.

A '''satellite state''' is a [[country]] that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy [[political]], [[economic]] and [[military]] influence or control from another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Betts |first1=R. R. |title=The European Satellite States: Their War Contribution and Present Position |journal=International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944-) |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=January 1945 |page=15-29 |jstor=3018989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects [[satellite|orbiting]] a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/1.htm|title=Source: NATO website 2nd Footnote at bottom|website=nato.int|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194558/http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/1.htm|archivedate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Warsaw Pact]] during the [[Cold War]] or to [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] or [[Tannu Tuva]] between 1924 and 1990,&lt;ref name=Sik&gt;{{cite book|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1ecjepq80QC&amp;pg=PA39|title=Nationality and International Law in Asian Perspective|isbn=978-0-7923-0876-8|author1=Sik|first1=Ko Swan|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. As used for Central and Eastern European countries it implies that the countries in question were &quot;satellites&quot; under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In some contexts it also refers to other countries in the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] during the [[Cold War]]—such as [[North Korea]] (especially in the years surrounding the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953) and [[Cuba]] (particularly after it joined the [[Comecon]] in 1972), and to some countries in the American sphere of influence—such as [[South Vietnam]] (particularly during the [[Vietnam war]]). In Western usage, the term has seldom been applied to states other than those in the Soviet orbit. In Soviet usage, the term applied to the states in the orbit of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], and [[Imperial Japan]]. 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the use of the phrase ''satellite state'' in English back at least as far as 1916.

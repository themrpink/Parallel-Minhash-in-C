The &quot;Batavian island&quot; in the [[Rhine river]] was mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in his commentary ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. The island's easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the other the [[Nederrijn|Lower Rhine]]/[[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (hence the Latin name ''Insula Batavorum'', &quot;Island of the Batavi&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&amp;highlight=batavi|title=C. Julius Caesar, ''Gallic War'', Book 4, chapter 10|work=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later [[Tacitus]] wrote that the people living there had originally been a tribe of the [[Chatti]], a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar, who were forced by internal dissension to move to their new home.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Tacitus, ''Germany and its Tribes'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0083%3Achapter%3D29 1.29]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus also reports that before their arrival the area had been &quot;an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Historiae'' iv.12&lt;/ref&gt; In a more detailed description he writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The island of the Batavi was the appointed rendezvous because of its easy landing-places, and its convenience for receiving the army and carrying the war across the river. For the Rhine after flowing continuously in a single channel or encircling merely insignificant islands, divides itself, so to say, where the Batavian territory begins, into two rivers, retaining its name and the rapidity of its course in the stream which washes Germany, till it mingles with the ocean. On the Gallic bank, its flow is broader and gentler; it is called by an altered name, the [[Waal river|Vahal]], by the inhabitants of its shore. Soon that name too is changed for the [[Meuse|Mosa]] river, through whose vast mouth it empties itself into the same ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Annals'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0078:book=2:chapter=6 II.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern archaeologists disagree with Tacitus, noting that that island had a pre-Roman and pre-Germanic population, apparently already called the Batavians. Caesar indeed had not only implied the existence of pre-Roman Batavians, but also mentioned that the Belgic [[Menapii]] of the Flemish coast had settlements stretching as far as the beginning of the delta, near the modern border with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;N. Roymans, &quot;The Lower Rhine ''Triquetrum'' Coinages and the Ethnogenesis of the Batavians&quot;, in: T. Grünewald &amp; H.-J. Schalles (eds.), ''Germania Inferior: Besiedlung, Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft an der Grenze der römisch-germanischen Welt'' (2000), 93–145, esp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman era==
{{Main|Batavi (Germanic tribe)}}
During the [[Roman Empire]] there was a ''[[civitas]]'' of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavians]], a Germanic tribe. It was described as a large island between rivers in the [[Rhine-Meuse delta]], the modern equivalent of [[Betuwe]].&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Miert (ed.), ''The Kaleidoscopic Scholarship of Hadrianus Junius (1511–1575): Northern Humanism at the Dawn of the Dutch Golden Age'', essay by Nico de Glas, pp. 69&amp;ndash;71, {{ISBN|900420914X}}, accessed at Google Books 2014-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; The Batavians shared the island with the [[Canninefates]], to their west near the coast. Their Roman city was [[Nijmegen]].

The name was also mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]], and it played a role in the account by Tacitus of the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Germanic uprising of 68]]. He said that &quot;In the Rhine itself, nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|disp=sqbr|abbr=off}} in length, Batavia is the most famous island of the Batavi and the Canninefates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=4:chapter=29 IV.29].&lt;/ref&gt;

Its later Roman history is attested by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] who mentions the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Salians]] as a people living there. [[Zosimus]] is the only classical author who claims that they had first crossed the Rhine during the Roman upheavals and subsequent Germanic breakthrough in 260 AD. Both authors agree that from Batavia they were pushed south, into [[Toxandria]].

==Medieval==
In the [[Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian]] periods in the early [[Middle Ages]], Batavia, called ''Batua'' by the Franks, was an example of a [[Franks|Frankish]] ''[[gau (territory)|gau]]'' that was based on much older Roman ''[[pagus|pagi]]''. Several counts are recorded as having their counties there, and it is mentioned in the treaties such as the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], that divided up Europe among the different Frankish kingdoms.

Later, it was mainly absorbed into the newer county of [[Guelders]] which had become established to the southeast.

==Renaissance==
In the [[Renaissance]], the Dutch wanted to rediscover their pre-medieval Batavi culture and history. This common history raised Batavi to the status of ''cultural ancestors'' to all Dutch people (see [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)#The Batavian Revival|''The Batavian Revival'']]). They occasionally called themselves, or their things (''[[Batavia (1628 ship)|Batavia]]''), Batavians, resulting even in a short-lived [[Batavian Republic]]. The name ''Batavia'' was also taken to the colonies such as the [[Dutch East Indies]], where they renamed the city of Jayakarta to become Batavia from 1619 until about 1942, when its name was changed to Djakarta (short for the former name Jayakarta, later respelt [[Jakarta]]; see: [[History of Jakarta]]). The name was also used in Suriname, where they founded [[Batavia, Suriname]], and in the United States where the [[Holland Land Company]] founded the city and the town of [[Batavia, New York]]. This name spread further west in the United States to such places as [[Batavia, Illinois]], near [[Chicago]], and [[Batavia, Ohio]].

==20th century==
In the last months of [[World War II]] (October 1944 - June 1945) it became known as &quot;Men's Island&quot; or ''&quot;Manneneiland&quot;'' due to the evacuation of its entire civilian population during [[Operation Market Garden]], leaving only soldiers behind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Deelen|first=Hent|title=Een ommegang door Angeren|year=1983|publisher=De Gelderse Bloem|isbn=90-70888-01-7|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Pannerdens Kanaal]] was dug between 1701 and 1709, the easternmost tip of the Betuwe (including the towns of [[Pannerden]] and [[Lobith]]) was cut off from the rest of the region.

In 1995, a large part of this area had to be evacuated because the rivers threatened to overflow. This did not happen, but it raised the debate again about whether to reinforce the [[dike (construction)|dikes]].

The '''oat''' (''Avena sativa''), sometimes called the '''common oat''', is a [[species]] of [[Cereal|cereal grain]] grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and [[pseudocereals]]). While oats are suitable for human consumption as [[oatmeal]] and [[oat milk]], one of the most common uses is as [[livestock]] feed. Oats are associated with lower blood [[cholesterol]] when consumed regularly.&lt;ref name=ajcn/&gt;

==Origin==
The wild ancestor of ''Avena sativa'' and the closely related minor crop, ''A. byzantina'', is the [[Polyploidy|hexaploid]] [[#wild oat|wild oat]], ''[[Avena sterilis|A. sterilis]]''. [[Heredity|Genetic evidence]] shows the ancestral forms of ''A. sterilis'' grew in the [[Fertile Crescent]] of the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zhou&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = X. | last2 = Jellen | first2 = E.N. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = J.P. | year = 1999 | title = Progenitor germplasm of domesticated hexaploid oat | url = | journal = Crop Science | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 1208–1214 | doi=10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183x003900040042x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oats are usually considered a [[secondary crop]], i.e., derived from a weed of the primary [[cereal]] domesticates, then spreading westward into cooler, wetter areas favorable for oats, eventually leading to their domestication in regions of the [[Middle East]] and Europe.&lt;ref name=zhou/&gt;

==Cultivation==

Oats are best grown in [[temperate]] regions. They have a lower summer heat requirement and greater tolerance of rain than other cereals, such as wheat, [[rye]] or barley, so they are particularly important in areas with cool, wet summers, such as Northwest Europe and even Iceland. Oats are an [[annual plant]], and can be planted either in autumn (for late summer harvest) or in the spring (for early autumn harvest).

In 2018, global production of oats was 23 million [[tonne]]s, an 11% decrease from 2017.&lt;ref name=fao18/&gt; Production was led by [[Russia]] with 20% of the world total and [[Canada]] with 15% (table). Other substantial producers were [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[Poland]], and [[China]], each with over one million tonnes.&lt;ref name=fao18/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Семечко овса.jpg|thumb|Oat seed under a microscope.]]

Oats have numerous uses in foods; most commonly, they are [[rolled oats|rolled]] or crushed into [[oatmeal]], or ground into fine oat [[flour]]. Oatmeal is chiefly eaten as [[porridge]], but may also be used in a variety of baked goods, such as [[oatcake]]s, [[oatmeal cookie]]s and oat bread. Oats are also an ingredient in many cold cereals, in particular [[muesli]] and [[granola]]. Oats are also used for production of [[milk substitute]]s (&quot;[[oat milk]]&quot;).

In Scotland, a dish was made by soaking the husks from oats for a week, so the fine, floury part of the meal remained as sediment to be strained off, boiled and eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauldie1981&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gauldie|first=Enid|title=The Scottish country miller, 1700–1900: a history of water-powered meal milling in Scotland|year=1981|publisher=J. Donald|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-85976-067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oats are also widely used there as a thickener in soups, as barley or rice might be used in other countries.
[[File:Avena-sativa.jpg|thumb|left|Closeup of oat florets (small flowers)]]
Oats are also commonly used as feed for horses when extra carbohydrates and the subsequent boost in energy are required. The oat hull may be crushed (&quot;rolled&quot; or &quot;crimped&quot;) for the horse to more easily digest the grain,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} or may be fed whole. They may be given alone or as part of a blended food pellet. Cattle are also fed oats, either whole or ground into a coarse flour using a [[roller mill]], [[burr mill]], or [[hammermill]]. Oat forage is commonly used to feed all kinds of ruminants, as pasture, straw, hay or silage.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Boudon A., Lebas F., 2016. [https://www.feedipedia.org/node/500 &quot;Oat forage&quot;]. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. April 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter oats may be grown as an off-season [[groundcover]] and ploughed under in the spring as a [[green fertilizer]], or harvested in early summer. They also can be used for pasture; they can be grazed a while, then allowed to head out for grain production, or grazed continuously until other pastures are ready.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.org/pages/13262/grazing-of-oat-pastures |title=Grazing of Oat Pastures |publisher=eXtension |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819160743/http://www.extension.org/pages/13262/grazing-of-oat-pastures |archive-date=2015-08-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oat [[straw]] is prized by cattle and horse producers as bedding, due to its soft, relatively dust-free, and absorbent nature. The straw can also be used for making [[corn dolly|corn dollies]]. Tied in a muslin bag, oat straw was used to soften bath water.

Oats are also occasionally used in several different drinks. In Britain, they are sometimes used for brewing [[beer]]. [[Oatmeal stout]] is one variety brewed using a percentage of oats for the [[wort (brewing)|wort]]. The more rarely used oat malt is produced by the Thomas Fawcett &amp; Sons Maltings and was used in the Maclay Oat Malt Stout before [[Maclays Brewery]] ceased independent brewing operations. [[Atholl Brose]] is a traditional Scottish beverage made by steeping oats in whisky and then blending the resulting &quot;brose&quot; with honey and, sometimes, cream. A cold, sweet drink called [[Avena (drink)|''avena'']] made of ground oats and milk is a popular refreshment throughout Latin America. Oatmeal [[caudle]], made of ale and oatmeal with spices, was a traditional British drink and a favourite of [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Compleat Housewife]]'', p. 169, Eliza Smith, 1739&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Food in Early Modern Europe'', Ken Albala, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, {{ISBN|0-313-31962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oat extracts can also be used to soothe skin conditions, and are popular for their emollient properties in cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Nozière P., Renaudeau D., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2016. Oats. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/231 Last updated on April 15, 2016, 11:21&lt;/ref&gt;

Oat grass has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes, including to help balance the [[menstrual cycle]], treat [[dysmenorrhea|dysmenorrhoea]] and for [[osteoporosis]] and [[urinary tract infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AJkBmPDRUUC|title=James A.

Oats contain diverse [[essential nutrient]]s (see table). In a {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=off|adj=on|frac=2}} serving, oats provide {{convert|389|kcal|kJ|abbr=off|order=flip}} of [[food energy]] and are a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] (34% DV), [[dietary fiber]] (44% DV), several [[B vitamins]] and numerous [[dietary mineral]]s, especially [[manganese]] (233% DV) (table). Oats are 66% [[carbohydrate]]s, including 11% dietary fiber and 4% [[beta-glucan]]s, 7% [[fat]] and 17% protein (table).

===Soluble fiber===
[[File:Haverkorrels Avena sativa.jpg|left|thumb|Oat grains in their [[husk]]s]]
Oat bran is the outer casing of the oat. Its daily consumption over weeks lowers [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and total [[cholesterol]], possibly reducing the risk of [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ajcn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/features/the-new-cholesterol-diet-oatmeal-oat-bran|title=LDL Cholesterol and Oatmeal|website=WebMD|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of soluble fiber contained in oats, [[Oat beta-glucan|beta-glucans]], has been proven to lower cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajcn&quot;/&gt;

After reports of research finding that dietary oats can help lower cholesterol, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a final rule&lt;ref name=&quot;fda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.81|title=Title 21--Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part 101 - Food labeling - Specific Requirements for Health Claims, Section 101.81: Health claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (revision 2015)|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows food companies to make [[health claims on food labels]] of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0&amp;nbsp;grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods may reduce the risk of [[heart disease]]. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75&amp;nbsp;grams of soluble fiber per serving.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;

Beta-D-glucans, usually referred to as beta-glucans, comprise a class of indigestible [[polysaccharide]]s widely found in nature in sources such as grains, [[yeast]], [[bacteria]], [[algae]] and [[mushroom]]s. In oats,  [[barley]] and other cereal grains, they are located primarily in the [[endosperm]] [[cell wall]]. The oat beta-glucan health claim applies to [[oat bran]], [[rolled oats]], whole oat [[flour]] and oatrim, a soluble fraction of [[alpha-amylase]] [[hydrolyzed]] oat bran or whole oat flour.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;

Oat beta-glucan is a [[viscous]] polysaccharide made up of units of the monosaccharide D-[[glucose]]. Oat beta-glucan is composed of mixed-linkage polysaccharides. This means the [[chemical bond|bonds]] between the D-glucose or D-glucopyranosyl units are either beta-1, 3 linkages or beta-1, 4 linkages. This type of beta-glucan is also referred to as a mixed-linkage (1→3), (1→4)-beta-D-glucan. The (1→3)-linkages break up the uniform structure of the beta-D-glucan molecule and make it soluble and flexible. In comparison, the indigestible polysaccharide [[cellulose]] is also a beta-glucan, but is not soluble because of its (1→4)-beta-D-linkages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The percentages of beta-glucan in the various whole oat products are: oat bran, having from 5.5% to 23.0%; rolled oats, about 4%; and whole oat flour about 4%.

===Protein===

Oats are the only cereal containing a [[globulin]] or [[legume]]-like protein, avenalin, as the major (80%) storage protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/reprint/7/7/945.pdf |title=Seed Storage Proteins: Structures 'and Biosynthesis |publisher=Plantcell.org |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globulins are characterised by solubility in dilute saline as opposed to the more typical cereal proteins, such as [[gluten]] and [[zein]], the [[prolamin]]es (prolamins). The minor protein of oat is a prolamine, avenin.

Oat protein is nearly equivalent in quality to [[soy protein]], which [[World Health Organization]] research has shown to be equal to meat, milk and egg protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasztity|first=Radomir|year=1999|title=The Chemistry of Cereal Proteins|publisher=Akademiai Kiado |isbn=978-0-8493-2763-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein content of the hull-less oat kernel ([[groats|groat]]) ranges from 12 to 24%, the highest among cereals.

===Celiac disease===
{{main|Oat sensitivity|Gluten-related disorders}}

[[Avenin]]s present in oats (proteins similar to [[gliadin]] from [[wheat]]) can trigger [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] in a small proportion of people.&lt;ref name=Biesiekierski2017&gt;{{cite journal| author=Biesiekierski JR| title=What is gluten? | journal=J Gastroenterol Hepatol | year= 2017 | volume= 32 Suppl 1 | pages= 78–81 | pmid=28244676 | doi=10.1111/jgh.13703 | type=Review | quote= Similar proteins to the gliadin found in wheat exist as secalin in rye, hordein in barley, and avenins in oats and are collectively referred to as “gluten.” Derivatives of these grains such as triticale and malt and other ancient wheat varieties such as spelt and kamut also contain gluten.

==Agronomy==
[[File:2013 07 13 Avoine noire d'Epinal.JPG|thumb|''Noire d'Epinal'', an ancient oat variety.]]
Oats are sown in the spring or early summer in colder areas, as soon as the soil can be worked. An early start is crucial to good yields, as oats go dormant in summer heat. In warmer areas, oats are sown in late summer or early fall. Oats are cold-tolerant and are unaffected by late frosts or snow.

===Seeding rates===
Typically, about 125 to 175&amp;nbsp;kg/ha (between 2.75 and 3.25 [[bushels]] per acre) are sown, either [[Broadcast spreader|broadcast]] or [[seed drill|drilled]]. Lower rates are used when [[interseeding]] with a legume. Somewhat higher rates can be used on the best soils, or where there are problems with weeds. Excessive sowing rates lead to problems with lodging, and may reduce yields.

===Fertilizer requirements===
Oats remove substantial amounts of [[nitrogen]] from the soil. They also remove phosphorus in the form of P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; at the rate of 0.25 pound per bushel (1 bushel = 38 pounds at 12% moisture).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Phosphate is thus applied at a rate of 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;kg/ha, or 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;lb/acre. Oats remove potash (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) at a rate of 0.19 pound per bushel, which causes it to use 15–30&amp;nbsp;kg/ha, or 13–27&amp;nbsp;lb/acre. Usually, 50–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha (45–90&amp;nbsp;lb/ac) of nitrogen in the form of [[urea]] or [[ammonia|anhydrous ammonia]] is sufficient, as oats use about one pound per bushel. A sufficient amount of nitrogen is particularly important for plant height and hence, straw quality and yield. When the prior-year crop was a legume, or where ample manure is applied, nitrogen rates can be reduced somewhat.

===Harvesting===
[[File:Havreskjering Fossheim Lindahl.jpeg|thumb|Harvesting of oats in [[Jølster]], Norway ''c.'' 1890 &lt;br /&gt; ''(Photo: [[Axel Lindahl]]/Norwegian Museum of Cultural History)'']]
Harvest techniques are a matter of available equipment, local tradition, and priorities. Farmers seeking the highest yield from their crops time their harvest so the kernels have reached 35% moisture, or when the greenest kernels are just turning cream-colour. They then harvest by [[swather|swathing]], cutting the plants at about {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above ground, and putting the swathed plants into [[windrows]] with the grain all oriented the same way. They leave the windrows to dry in the sun for several days before combining them using a [[pickup header]]. Finally, they bale the straw.

Oats can also be left standing until completely ripe and then [[combine harvester|combined]] with a grain head. This causes greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads, and to harvesting losses, as the grain is threshed out by the reel. Without a [[draper head]], there is also more damage to the straw, since it is not properly oriented as it enters the combine's throat. Overall yield loss is 10–15% compared to proper swathing.

Historical harvest methods involved cutting with a scythe or sickle, and [[threshing]] under the feet of cattle. Late 19th- and early 20th-century harvesting was performed using a [[Reaper-binder|binder]]. Oats were gathered into shocks, and then collected and run through a stationary [[threshing machine]].

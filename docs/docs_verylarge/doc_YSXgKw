{{ external media|align=center|width=270px|audio1=You may hear Ronald Binge's ''[[Elizabethan Serenade]]'' as performed by [[Annunzio Mantovani]] and the Mantovani Orchestra in 1971  [https://archive.org/details/Mantovani_Orchestra_Greatest_01/08-elizabethanSerenade.wav '''Here on archive.org''']}}

==Biography==
Binge was born in a [[working-class]] neighbourhood in [[Derby]], [[Derbyshire]], in the [[Midlands (England)|English Midlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; In his childhood he was a chorister at [[St Andrew's Church, Derby|Saint Andrews Church]] ([[Church of England]]), London Road, Derby – 'the railwaymen's church' (demolished 1970). Binge was educated at the [[Derby School of Music]], where he studied the organ. Early in his career he was a cinema organist&lt;ref name=carey&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Mike|title=Ronald Binge|url=http://www.rfsoc.org.uk/rbinge.shtml|publisher=Robert Farnon Society|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226224814/http://www.rfsoc.org.uk/rbinge.shtml|archivedate=26 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and later started working in summer [[orchestra]]s in British seaside resorts (including [[Blackpool]] and [[Great Yarmouth]]), for which he learned to play the [[piano accordion]]. Binge's skill as a [[Theatre organ|cinema organist]] was put to good use, and he played the organ in [[Mantovani]]'s first band, the Tipica Orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he served in the [[Royal Air Force]], during which time he was much in demand organising in-camp entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt;

After the war, Mantovani offered Binge the job of arranging and composing for his new orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; In 1951, his arrangement of &quot;[[Charmaine (song)|Charmaine]]&quot; gave him and Mantovani worldwide success and recognition.&lt;ref name=carey/&gt; However, he later tired of writing [[musical arrangement|arrangements]] and turned to composing original works and [[film score]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; He died in [[Ringwood]], [[Hampshire]], of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in 1979 aged 69.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt;

In early 2013, [[Derby City Council]] and Derby Civic Society announced they would put a [[blue plaque]] on one of his two early homes in Derby (83 Darby Street, [[Normanton, Derby|Normanton]], or 29 Wiltshire Road, [[Chaddesden]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/LIST-DERBEIANS-HONOURED/story-18125437-detail/story.html#axzz2KjCUpLKV]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositions==
Binge was interested in the technicalities of composition and was most famous as the inventor of the &quot;[[cascading strings]]&quot; effect that is the signature sound of the Mantovani orchestra, much used in their arrangements of popular music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; It was originally created to capture the essence of the echo properties of a building such as a cathedral, although it later became particularly associated with [[easy-listening]] music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt;

Binge's best-known composition is probably ''[[Elizabethan Serenade]]'' (1951),&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; which was used by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as the theme for the popular 1950s series, &quot;Music Tapestry,&quot; and as the play-out for the [[British Forces Network]] radio station, and for which in 1957 he won an [[Ivor Novello Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; It was later turned into a vocal version called &quot;Where the Gentle Avon Flows&quot;, with lyrics by the poet [[Christopher Hassall]]. A [[reggae]] version of the tune, &quot;Elizabethan Reggae&quot;, was performed by [[Boris Gardiner]] in 1970. Binge is also known for ''[[Sailing By]]'' (1963), which introduces the late-night [[Shipping Forecast]] on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; Other well-known pieces include ''Miss Melanie'', ''Like Old Times'', ''[[The Watermill]]'' (1958) for oboe and strings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; and his Concerto for Alto Saxophone in E-flat major (1956). His largest, longest, and most ambitious work is the four-movement [[Symphony]] in C (&quot;Saturday Symphony&quot;), which was written during his retirement between 1966 and 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin50&quot;/&gt; and performed in Britain and Germany.

Less well known is a [[piano]] piece known as &quot;Vice Versa&quot;, a [[palindrome#In Music|musical palindrome]] which was not only a front-to-back [[palindrome]], but also exploited the two [[musical stave|staves]] used for writing for piano. The music reads the same whichever way it is turned. He later extended this theme, composing a piece known as &quot;Upside/Downside&quot; for his son, who was learning to play the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] at [[Downside School]]. This musical palindrome was for piano, recorder and [[cello]] and again was universally reversible – two players could play from the same sheet of music reading from opposite ends.

'''Formentera''' ({{IPA-ca|furmənˈteɾə}}, {{IPA-es|foɾmenˈteɾa|lang}}) is the smallest and more southerly [[island]] of the [[Pityusic Islands]] group (comprising [[Ibiza]] and Formentera, as well as various small islets), which belongs to the [[Balearic Islands]] [[autonomous community]] ([[Spain]]). It covers an area of {{convert|83.22|km2}} (including offshore islets) and had a population of 10,582 at the Census of 1 November 2011; the latest official estimate (as at 1 January 2019) was 12,111.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Madrid, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The island's name is usually said to derive from the [[Latin]] word ''frumentarium'', meaning &quot;granary&quot;. The island was occupied in prehistoric times, going back to 2,000–1,600 BC. Archaeological sites from that period remain in Ca na Costa,&lt;ref&gt;Ca na Costa, L’Enciclopèdia d’Eivissa i Formentera, http://www.eeif.es/veus/Costa-ca-na/, accessed 16/04/2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Cap de Barbaria (multiple sites)&lt;ref&gt;Cap de Barbaria, L’Enciclopèdia d’Eivissa i Formentera, http://www.eeif.es/veus/Barbaria-cap-de/, accessed 16/04/2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cova des Fum.&lt;ref&gt;Cova des Fum, L’Enciclopèdia d’Eivissa i Formentera, http://www.eeif.es/veus/Fum-cova-des/, accessed 16/04/2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The island had been occupied by the [[Carthaginians]] before passing to the [[ancient Romans]].  In succeeding centuries, it passed to the [[Visigoths]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Vandals]], and the [[Arabs]]. In 1109 it was the target of a devastating attack by the [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] king [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd I]] at the head of the &quot;[[Norwegian Crusade#In the Baleares (1109)|Norwegian Crusade]]&quot;. The island was conquered by the [[Catalan people|Catalans]], added to the [[Crown of Aragon]] and later became part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Majorca]].

From 1403 to the early 18th century, the threat of [[Barbary pirates|Barbary pirate]] attacks rendered the island uninhabitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbxkcaKFVMC&amp;q=Formentera+uninhabited&amp;pg=PA12|title=Ibiza and Formentera|last=Bryant|first=Sue|date=June 2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781845378141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eACqCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Battle+of+A%C3%AFn-el-Turk&amp;pg=PA453|title=Concise History of Islam|last1=Syed|first1=Muzaffar Husain|last2=Akhtar|first2=Syed Saud|last3=Usmani|first3=B. D.|date=2011-09-14|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=9789382573470|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 1651, during the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659)]], a squadron of Spanish [[galley]]s under [[John of Austria the Younger]] [[Capture of the galleon Lion Couronné|captured the French galleon ''Lion Couronné'']] off this island.

The island (along with its surrounding islets) became a separate insular council (with the same territory as the municipality of the same name) after 1977. Before that, it was administered in the former insular council of Ibiza and Formentera (covering the whole group of the Pityusic Islands), but in a separate [[comarca]] (which already covered the current municipality of Formentera). This reform allowed Ibiza to unify its comarca (of five municipalities) with its new insular council (no longer administrating Formentera).

== Geography ==
[[File:Véndes de Formentera.svg|thumb|left|Map of Formentera's ''véndes'']]

The main island of Formentera is {{convert|19|km}} long and is located about {{convert|6|km|0}} south of Ibiza in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. More specifically Formentera is part of the delimitation of the [[Balearic Sea]] which is a northwestern element of the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Balearic_Sea?topic=49523 ''Balearic Sea''. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P.Saundry &amp; C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; Its major villages are [[Sant Francesc Xavier]], [[Sant Ferran de ses Roques]], [[El Pilar de la Mola]] and [[La Savina]].

Formentera comprises one [[municipality]], also called Formentera, and has a population of 9,962 (as at 1 January 2010). Its land area is {{convert|83.24|km2|1}}. It is subdivided into several civil parishes (''parròquies''), themselves subdivided into ''vendas'' (''véndes'' in Catalan).

North of Formentera is the island of [[Espalmador]] (''Illa de s'Empalmador'' in Catalan), which is the second largest island of the municipality, and is itself surrounded by a few minor islets. Espalmador is a [[tombolo]], separated from the main island of Formentera by a shallow [[sandbar]], and during [[low tide]], it is possible for one to wade between the two islands.  This area is a popular stopping point for those in yachts heading between Ibiza and Formentera.

Since the 1960s, Formentera has been a popular destination for [[hippie]]s.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=James|title=Formentera: where the party's still chilled|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jun/19/formentera-balearics-party-island|accessdate=15 June 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formentera is renowned across Europe for many pristine white beaches and the fact that [[Nude beach|nude sunbathing]] is allowed on most of its [[beach]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;MischkeSchwarz2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mischke|first1=Roland |last2=Schwarz|first2=Berthold |title=Ibiza, Formentera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsTzAaa582cC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2001|publisher=Nelles Verlag|isbn=978-3-88618-768-3|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian writer [[Patrick Roscoe]] was born in Formentera.&lt;ref name=&quot;death458&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Peter|title=Death Comes Easy: The Gay Times Book of Murder Stories|date=2003|publisher=Gay Men's Press|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9781902852461|oclc=58997265|page=[https://archive.org/details/deathcomeseasy00pete/page/458 458]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/deathcomeseasy00pete/page/458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Joni Mitchell]] wrote her 1971 album ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'' on the island while [[Bob Dylan]] once lived in the Cap de Barbaria lighthouse on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;haig231&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haig|first1=Matt|title=Reasons to Stay Alive|date=2015|publisher=Cannongate Books|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9781782116820|page=231|quote=Bob Dylan spent some time living in the lighthouse at Cap de Barbaria, on the island's southern tip. Formentera was also where Joni Mitchell wrote the album ''Blue''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Matt Haig]] also writes about visiting the island often in his twenties in ''[[Reasons to Stay Alive]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;haig231&quot;/&gt;  The opening track of the [[King Crimson]] album ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'', &quot;Formentera Lady&quot;, is named after the island.

Although [[Road surface#Gravel surface|paved roads]] allow access to all parts of the island and cars are easily hired in the port, many people choose to rent mopeds or even bicycles due to the flat nature of most of the island and the availability of dedicated cycle tracks in many locations.

The island also has four [[Martello tower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clements |first1=Bill |last2=Clements |first2=William H. |title=Martello Towers Worldwide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLX7kXj-lrsC&amp;pg=PA56 |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |year=2011 |publisher=Casemate Publishers |location= |isbn=9781848845350 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
With no airports, the island was formerly reachable only by boat from Ibiza, making it the quieter of the two islands, but in recent years regular passenger service from the Spanish mainland has increased tourism.

Ferry tickets from [[Ibiza]] are available in advance, as are transfers from Ibiza airport or port directly to accommodation in Formentera.

Ferries to Formentera operate from their own terminal in Ibiza port, with departures every half hour in high season on large (200+ passenger) fast [[catamaran]]s. The journey takes approximately 30 minutes with 10 minutes each leaving Ibiza, crossing the sea, and arriving in Formentera past the [[isthmus]] to [[S'Espalmador|Espalmador]].

Some of the anchorages may not be ideal for sailboats under less than ideal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.noudiari.es/2019/04/el-temporal-empuja-contra-las-rocas-a-un-velero-con-la-tripulacion-dentro-en-formentera-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
A local Ibizan (''eivissenc'') variant of the [[Balearic dialect]] of the [[Catalan language]] is spoken in Formentera. While the official languages are Catalan and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other major languages like English, Italian, German, French and Dutch can also be heard extensively in the summer due to mass tourism.

== Sports ==
From 1 September to 7 September, Formentera hosted the 2007 Techno 293 OD World Championships in [[windsurfing#Youth windsurfing|windsurfing]] for juniors under 15 and youths under 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techno293.org/ Techno 293 OD World Championships]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tapiola''' ({{IPA-fi|tɑpiolɑ|-}}; {{lang-sv|{{audio|sv-Hagalund.ogg|Hagalund|help=no}}}}) is a district of the municipality of [[Espoo]] on the south coast of [[Finland]], and is one of the major urban centres of Espoo. It is located in the western part of [[Greater Helsinki]]. The name ''Tapiola'' is derived from ''[[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]]'', who is the forest god of [[Finnish mythology]], especially as expressed in ''[[the Kalevala]]''.&lt;ref name=Tuomi&gt;{{cite book|title=Tapiola: A history and architectural guide|author=Timo Tuomi|year=1992|publisher=[[Espoo City Museum]]|ISBN=9518572046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whiston]], a 17/18th-century translator of the ''Antiquities'', stated in a footnote that he believed Josephus mistook Seth for [[Sesostris]], king of [[Egypt]], the erector of the pillar in Siriad (being a contemporary name for the territories in which [[Sirius]] was venerated, i.e. [[Egypt]]). He stated that there was no way for any pillars of Seth to survive the [[flood myth|deluge]], because the deluge buried all such pillars and edifices far underground in the sediment of its waters. The [[perennialist]] writer Nigel Jackson identifies the land of Siriad in Josephus' account with [[Ancient Syria|Syria]], citing related [[Mandaean]] legends regarding the &quot;Oriental Land of Shyr&quot; in connection with the visionary mytho-geography of the prophetic traditions surrounding Seth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the Prophethood of Seth in the Abrahamic Traditions&quot;, ''Sacred Web'' volume 25, Summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd-century BC [[Book of Jubilees]], regarded as noncanonical except in the [[Alexandrian Rite|Alexandrian Churches]], also dates his birth to 130 [[Anno Mundi|AM]].&lt;ref name=Jubilee&gt;''The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament'', R.H.

Seth is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], along with Adam, Abel, and others, with a [[feast day]] on July 26.

The [[Sethians]] were a Christian [[Gnostic]] sect who may date their existence to before Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Turner [http://jdt.unl.edu/lithist.html Sethian Gnosticism:] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121211123653/http://jdt.unl.edu/lithist.html |date=2012-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their influence spread throughout the Mediterranean into the later systems of the [[Basilideans]] and the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Their thinking, although it is predominantly [[Judaism|Judaic]] in foundation, is arguably strongly influenced by [[Platonism]]. Sethians are so called for their [[veneration]] of the biblical Seth, who is depicted in their [[creation myth]]s as a divine [[incarnation]]; consequently, the offspring or 'posterity' of Seth are held to comprise a superior elect within human society.

[[File:Prophet Seth Name.svg|thumb|Shayth's name in [[Arabic calligraphy]]]]

Although the [[Quran]] makes no mention of '''Seth ibn [[Adam in Islam|Adam]]''', he is revered within [[Islamic]] [[tradition]] as the third and righteous son of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of [[Abel]]. The Sunni scholar and historian [[ibn Kathir]] in his ''[[tarikh]]'' (book of history), ''Al-Bidāya wa-n-nihāya'' ({{lang|ar|البداية والنهاية}}),&lt;ref&gt;URL: http://www.australianislamiclibrary.org/al-bidaya-wan-nahaya.html&lt;/ref&gt; records that Seth, a [[prophet]] like his father Adam, transfers God's Law to mankind after the death of [[Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', [[Ibn Kathir]], ''Story of Adam and Seth''&lt;/ref&gt; and places him among the exalted [[antediluvian]] [[patriarch]]s of the [[Generations of Adam]]. Some sources say that Seth was the receiver of [[scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Shith'', Online Web.&lt;/ref&gt; These scriptures are said to be the &quot;first scriptures&quot; mentioned in Q 87:18. Medieval historian and exegete [[al-Tabari]] and other scholars say that Seth buried Adam and the secret texts in the tomb of Adam, i.e., the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;.

The [[Islamic literature]] holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The 11th-century Syrian historian and translator [[Al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik]] recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book ''Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waqfeya.com/book.php?bid=6216|title=مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم – المكتبة الوقفية للكتب المصورة PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included a chapter on Seth.  Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future [[Great Flood]], and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain's heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the [[Great Flood]].&lt;ref&gt;Tabari, ''History of the Prophets and Kings'', Vol. I: ''Creation to the Flood''&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditional Islamic [[craft]]s&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Art in the East and West'', [[Titus Burckhardt]], Suhail Academy Publishing, 1967, pg. 151: &quot;Thus it is that the craft traditions, such as persisted in Islamic countries to the very threshold of our times, are generally said to have come down from certain pre-Islamic prophets, particularly from Seth, the third son of Adam.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; are traced back to Seth, such as the making of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] [[comb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and The Destiny of Man'', [[Gai Eaton]], [[Islamic Texts Society]], 1994, pgs. 211–212: (on the traditional making of horn combs) “This craft can be traced back from apprentice to master until one reaches... Seth... It was he who first taught men and what a prophet brings – and Seth was a prophet – must clearly have a special purpose, both outwardly and inwardly.”&lt;/ref&gt; Seth also plays a role in [[Sufism]], and [[Ibn Arabi]] includes a chapter in his ''Bezels of Wisdom'' on Seth, entitled “The Wisdom of Expiration in the Word of Seth”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/102546816/the-bezels-of-wisdom|title=The Bezels of Wisdom – 1980, p. 60 by Ibn al-Arabi. – Online Research Library: Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditions locate Seth's tomb in the [[village]] of [[Al-Nabi Shayth]] ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} &quot;The Prophet Seth&quot;) in the mountains above the [[Beqaa Valley]] in Lebanon, where there is a [[mosque]] named after him. This tomb was described by the 12th-century geographer [[Ibn Jubayr]].  A rival tradition, mentioned by later [[medieval Arab geographers]] from the 13th century on, placed the tomb of ''Nabi Shith'' (“Prophet Seth”) in the Palestinian village of [[Bashshit]], southwest of [[Ramla]] village. According to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], Bashshit means ''Beit Shith'', i.e. “House of Seth”.&lt;ref name=PEFp84&gt;[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (PEF), 1838, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H6A_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt; The village was [[1948 Palestinian exodus|depopulated]] with the establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948, but the three-domed structure said to be Seth's tomb survives in the Israeli [[moshav]] [[Aseret]] built on the site.

A twelve feet long grave located in Hazrat Shees Jinnati Mosque, in [[Ayodhya]], in the State of [[Uttar Pradesh]] of India is believed to be of Hazrat Shees or the Prophet Seth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslim Ayodhya: city of mosques, mazars and graves {{!}} TwoCircles.net |url=http://twocircles.net/2009feb06/muslim_ayodhya_city_mosques_mazars_and_graves.html |website=twocircles.net |publisher=Mumtaz Alam Falahi {Paragraph:5: Grave of Hazrat Shees pbuh}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mandaeanism==
According to the [[Mandaean]] scriptures including the [[Qolusta|Qolastā]], the [[Draša D-Iahia|Book of John]] and [[Ginza Rba|Genzā Rabbā]], Seth is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure [[Shithil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ISBN=1931956499|title=The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran|date=1932 |author=Drower, E.S. |publisher=Gorgias Press.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a son of Adam Kadmaya who taught John the Baptist with his brothers [[Anush uthra]] and [[Hibil Ziwa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogueleaf.com/book-of-john/2012/07/09/76-anush-uthra-and-christ/# The Mandaic Book of John]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
On July 26, 2014, forces of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) blew up Nabi Shiyt (Prophet Seth) shrine in [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]. Sami al-Massoudi, the deputy head of the [[Shiite Endowment Office]] overseeing holy sites, confirmed that destruction. He added, ISIL took some of the artifacts to an unknown location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ISIS destroys Prophet Sheth shrine in Mosul |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/26/ISIS-destroy-Prophet-Sheth-shrine-in-Mosul-.html |publisher=[[Al Arabiya News]] |date=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gateway Arch National Park''', formerly known as the '''Jefferson National Expansion Memorial''' until 2018, is an American [[national park]] located in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], near the starting point of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. The [[Gateway Arch]] and its immediate surroundings were initially designated as a [[List of National Memorials of the United States|national memorial]] by [[executive order]] on December 21, 1935, and redesignated as a national park in 2018. The park is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).

The memorial was established to commemorate:
*the [[Louisiana Purchase]], and the subsequent westward movement of American explorers and pioneers;
*the first civil government west of the [[Mississippi River]]; and
*the debate over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] raised by the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' case]].

The national park consists of the Gateway Arch, a steel [[catenary arch]] that has become the definitive icon of St. Louis; a {{convert|91|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of the city; the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis)|Old Courthouse]], a former state and federal courthouse where the ''Dred Scott'' case originated; and the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[#Museum at the Gateway Arch|museum at the Gateway Arch]].

==Components==

===The Gateway Arch===
{{main|Gateway Arch}}
[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gateway Arch]]]]

The '''Gateway Arch''', known as the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;, is the tallest structure in Missouri. It was designed by [[Finnish American|Finnish-American]] architect [[Eero Saarinen]] and structural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]] in 1947 and built between 1963 and October 1965.   It stands {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|630|ft|m|0|sp=us}} wide at its base.  The legs are {{convert|54|ft|m|1|sp=us}} wide at the base, narrowing to {{convert|17|ft|m|1|sp=us}} at the arch.  There is a unique tram system to carry passengers to the observation room at the top of the arch.

===Old Courthouse===
{{main|Old Courthouse (St. Louis)}}
The '''Old Courthouse''' is built on land originally deeded by St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]]. It marks the location over which the arch reaches. Its dome was built during the [[American Civil War]] and is similar to the dome on the [[United States Capitol]] which was also built during the Civil War.  It was the site of the local trials in the [[Dred Scott]] case.

The courthouse is the only portion of the memorial west of [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]. To the west of the Old Courthouse is a [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]] between Market and Chestnut Streets which is only interrupted by the [[Civil Courts Building]] which features a pyramid model of the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]] (which was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) on its roof. When the Civil Courts building was built in the 1920s, the Chouteau family sued to regain the property belonging to the Old Courthouse because it had been deeded in perpetuity to be a courthouse.

===Museum at the Gateway Arch===
Underneath the arch is a visitor center, entered from a circular entryway facing the Old Courthouse. Within the center, a project to rebuild the Museum at the Gateway Arch was completed in July 2018. The new museum features exhibits on a variety of topics including westward expansion and the construction of the arch, all told through a St. Louis lens. Tucker Theater, finished in 1968 and renovated 30 years later, has about 285 seats and shows a documentary (''[[Monument to the Dream]]'') on the arch's construction. A second theater was added in 1993 but removed in 2018 as part of the CityArchRiver renovation project. Also located in the visitor center are a gift shop and cafe.

==History==
[[Image:STL Old courthouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]] from the observation area at the top of the arch]]

===1930s===
The memorial was developed largely through the efforts of St. Louis civic booster [[Luther Ely Smith]] who first pitched the idea in 1933, was the long-term chairman of the committee that selected the area and persuaded [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1935 to make it a national park service unit after St. Louis passed a bond issue to begin building it, and who partially financed the 1947 architectural contest that selected the arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/upload/luther_ely_smith.pdf |format= PDF |title= Luther Ely Smith: Founder of a Memorial |work= The Museum Gazette |publisher= National Park Service |accessdate= January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s the United States began looking for a suitable memorial for [[Thomas Jefferson]] (the [[Washington Monument]] and the newly built [[Lincoln Memorial]] were the only large Presidential memorials at the time).

Shortly after [[Thanksgiving]] in 1933 Smith who had been on the commission to build the [[George Rogers Clark National Historical Park]] in Indiana, was returning via train when he noticed the poor condition of the original [[plat]]ted location of St. Louis along the Mississippi. He thought that the memorial to Jefferson should be on the actual location that was symbolic of one of Jefferson's greatest triumphs—the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

The originally platted area of St. Louis was the site of:
*The [[Battle of Saint Louis]], the only battle west of the Mississippi River in the [[American Revolutionary War]].
*The first capital of Upper Louisiana for the United States, the [[Louisiana Purchase]] north of the [[33rd parallel north|33rd parallel]] that was the original [[Louisiana Territory]] in 1803.
*The [[Three Flags Day]] ceremony in 1804 in which Spain formally turned over Louisiana to France, less than 24 hours before France then officially turned it over to the United States. This technically completed the Louisiana Purchase, and also cleared the way for [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] to legally begin their [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|exploration]] of the continental west, which Spain had prohibited.

Almost all of the historic buildings associated with this period had been replaced by newer buildings.  His idea was to raze all of the buildings in the original St. Louis platted area and replace it with a park with &quot;a central feature, a shaft, a building, an arch, or something which would symbolize American culture and civilization.&quot;

Smith pitched the idea to [[Bernard Dickmann]] who quickly assembled a meeting of St. Louis civic leaders on December 15, 1933 at the Jefferson Hotel and they endorsed the plan and Smith became chairman of what would become the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (a position he would hold until 1949 with a one-year exception).

The Commission then defined the area, got cost estimates of $30 million to buy the land, clear the buildings and erect a park and monument.  With promises from the federal government (via the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission) to join if the City of St. Louis could raise money.

The area to be included in the park was bounded by the [[Eads Bridge]]/Washington Avenue on the north and Poplar Street on the south, the Mississippi River on the east and Third Street (now [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|Interstate 44]]) on the west.  The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], just west of Third Street, was added in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O’Neil|first1=Tim|title=With cornice repairs complete, scaffold around St. Louis' Old Courthouse coming down|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/with-cornice-repairs-complete-scaffold-around-st-louis-old-courthouse/article_2930a6da-79a0-5f39-9f80-102cacb5d64e.html|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only building in this area not included was the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France|Old Cathedral]], which is on the site of St. Louis first church and was opposite the home of St. Louis founder [[Auguste Chouteau]].  The founders of the city were buried in its graveyard (but were moved in 1849 to [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] during a [[cholera]] outbreak).

Taking away 40 blocks in the center of St. Louis was bitterly fought by some sources—particularly the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Editorial |work= Jefferson City Daily Capital News |date= June 24, 1939}}{{full citation needed|date= February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 1935, the voters of St. Louis approved a $7.5 million bond issue to buy the property. Local architect Louis La Beaume provided a preliminary design proposal for the site that included multiple museums, fountains, and obelisks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H39FAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MscMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2575%2C5685821 |title=St. Louis River Front Memorial Approved by Voters |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 September 1935 |newspaper=The Southeast Missourian |accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings were bought for $7 million by the federal government via [[Eminent domain]] and was subject to considerable litigation but were ultimately bought at 131.99 percent of assessed valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= St. Louis Site Obtained for Jefferson Memorial |agency= United Press |work= Hammond Times |date= June 22, 1939}} (available on newspaperarchive.com){{full citation needed|date= February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt inspected the memorial area on October 14, 1936 during the dedication of the St. Louis Soldiers Memorial. Included in the party was then Senator [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 225,00 See Roosevelt in St. Louis |agency= Associated Press |work= Moberly Monitor-Index |date= October 14, 1936}}{{full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
The land was to be cleared by 1942.  Among the buildings razed was the &quot;Old Rock House&quot; 1818 home of fur trader [[Manuel Lisa]] (now occupied by the stairs on the north side of the arch) and the 1819 home of original St. Louis pioneer [[Jean Pierre Chouteau]] at First and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogyinstlouis.accessgenealogy.com/landmarks.htm |title=St. Louis Landmarks |publisher=genealogyinstlouis.accessgenealogy.com |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407233919/http://genealogyinstlouis.accessgenealogy.com/landmarks.htm |archive-date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural competition for a monument was delayed by [[World War II]].  Interest in the monument was fed after the war as it was to be the first big monument in the post-World War II era.

The estimated cost of the competition was $225,000 and Smith personally donated $40,000.  Civic leaders held the nationwide competition in 1947 to select a design for the main portion of the Memorial space.

Architect [[Eero Saarinen]] won this competition with plans for a {{convert|590|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[catenary]] arch to be placed on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. However, these plans were modified over the next 15 years, placing the arch on higher ground and adding {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} in height and width.

The central architectural feature at the base of the arch is the [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old Courthouse]], which was once the tallest building in Missouri and has a dome similar to the [[United States Capitol]] and was placed on the building during the [[American Civil War]] at the same time as that on the U.S. Capitol.

Saarinen developed the shape with the help of architectural engineer [[Hannskarl Bandel]]. It is not a pure inverted [[catenary]]. Saarinen preferred a shape that was slightly elongated and thinner towards the top, a shape that produces a subtle soaring effect, and transfers more of the structure's weight downward rather than outward at the base.

When Saarinen won the competition, the official notification was sent to &quot;E. Saarinen&quot;, thinking it to be the architect's father [[Eliel Saarinen]], who had also submitted an entry. The family celebrated with a bottle of champagne, and two hours later an embarrassed official called to say the winner was, in fact, the younger Saarinen. The elder Saarinen then broke out a second bottle of champagne to celebrate his son's success.

Among the five finalists was local St. Louis architect [[Harris Armstrong]].

===1950s===
Land for the memorial was formally dedicated on June 10, 1950 by [[Harry S. Truman]].  However the [[Korean War]] began and the project was put on hold.

On June 23, 1959, work begins on covering railroad tracks that cut across the memorial grounds.

There are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original [[nebula]]r material from which Saturn was formed.

Beyond the main rings, at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring.

== History of observation and exploration ==
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Galileo Galilei]] first observed the rings of Saturn in 1610]]

The observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases. The first phase is ancient observations (such as with the [[naked eye]]), before the invention of modern [[telescope]]s.  The second phase began in the 17th century, with telescopic observations from Earth, which improved over time.  The third phase is visitation by [[space probe]]s, in orbit or on [[planetary flyby|flyby]]. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including [[Earth orbit|Earth-orbiting]] [[space telescope|observatories]] like the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) and, until [[Cassini retirement|its 2017 retirement]], from the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' orbiter around Saturn.

=== European observations (17th–19th centuries) ===
[[File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Hooke]] noted the shadows ({{Var|a}} and {{Var|b}}) cast by both the globe and the rings on each other in this drawing of Saturn in 1666.]]

Saturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter [[telescope]]&lt;ref name=binoculars/&gt; to resolve and thus were not known to exist until [[Christiaan Huygens]] saw them in 1659.  [[Galileo]], with his primitive telescope in 1610,&lt;ref name=chan2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=cain2008_15390/&gt; incorrectly thought of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides.&lt;ref name=cain2008_15418/&gt;&lt;ref name=cain2008_46237/&gt; It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn's moon Titan; [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] later discovered four other moons: [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] and [[Dione (moon)|Dione]]. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the [[Cassini Division]].&lt;ref name=micek2007/&gt;

No further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when [[William Herschel]] discovered two further moons, [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus]]. The irregularly shaped satellite [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]], which has a [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.&lt;ref name=pa54_122/&gt;

In 1899 [[William Henry Pickering]] discovered Phoebe, a highly [[irregular satellite]] that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do.&lt;ref name=pa54_122/&gt; Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit Saturn in a [[retrograde orbit]]. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.&lt;ref name=apj100_378/&gt;

=== Modern NASA and ESA probes ===
{{main|Exploration of Saturn}}

==== ''Pioneer 11'' flyby ====
[[File:P11saturnb.jpg|thumb|''Pioneer 11'' image of Saturn]]

''[[Pioneer 11]]'' made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000&amp;nbsp;km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, ''Pioneer 11'' measured the temperature of Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&amp;11.html |title=The Pioneer 10 &amp; 11 Spacecraft |access-date=5 July 2007 |publisher=Mission Descriptions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130100401/http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10%2611.html |archive-date=30 January 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voyager flybys ====
In November 1980, the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. ''Voyager 1'' performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in [[Visible wavelength|visible wavelengths]]; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voyager&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/missions.html |title=Missions to Saturn |publisher=The Planetary Society |date=2007 |access-date=24 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044450/http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/saturn/missions.html |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a year later, in August 1981, ''[[Voyager 2]]'' continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voyager&quot; /&gt;

The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small [[Maxwell Gap]] (a gap within the [[Rings of Saturn#C Ring|C Ring]]) and [[Keeler gap]] (a 42&amp;nbsp;km-wide gap in the [[A Ring]]).

==== ''Cassini–Huygens'' spacecraft ====
{{main|Cassini–Huygens}}
The ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' [[space probe]] entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], sending back high-resolution images and data. ''Cassini''{{'s}} flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the [[Huygens probe|''Huygens'' probe]] on 25 December 2004. ''Huygens'' descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.&lt;ref name=nature438_7069_758/&gt;

Starting in early 2005, scientists used ''Cassini'' to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000&amp;nbsp;times that of lightning on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060215090726.htm |title=Astronomers Find Giant Lightning Storm At Saturn |date=2007 |access-date=27 July 2007 |publisher=ScienceDaily LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828092204/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060215090726.htm |archive-date=28 August 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing [[New Frontiers program]] of missions.

== Observation ==
[[File:Saturn-27-03-04.jpeg|thumb|Amateur telescopic view of Saturn]]

Saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally [[4 Vesta]], are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean [[apparent magnitude]] of Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mallama_and_Hilton&quot;/&gt; Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest magnitude, −0.55, occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least inclined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mallama_and_Hilton&quot;/&gt; It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the [[ecliptic]] against the background constellations of the [[zodiac]]. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings in which clear resolution is present.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM Saturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=binoculars/&gt; When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a &quot;disappearance&quot; will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classicalastronomy.com/news/anmviewer.asp?a=313&amp;z=28 |title=Saturn's Rings Edge-On |date=2013 |publisher=Classical Astronomy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105231722/http://www.classicalastronomy.com/news/anmviewer.asp?a=313&amp;z=28 |archive-date=5 November 2013 |access-date=4 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|thumb|Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen from ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]''. The rings are visible, including the F Ring.]]

Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], the configuration of a planet when it is at an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] of 180°, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year—approximately every 378 days—and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next.  Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible.  For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable [[:File:Saturnoppositions.jpg|orientation of its rings]] relative to the Earth,&lt;ref name=&quot;opp2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Saturn in 2002–03 |last=Schmude Jr. |first=Richard W. |date=Winter 2003 |journal=Georgia Journal of Science |issn=0147-9369 |volume=61 |issue=4 |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/Georgia-Journal-Science/113429393.html |access-date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;opp2002&quot; /&gt;

From time to time, Saturn is [[Occultation|occulted]] by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in &quot;seasons&quot;. Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon's orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn's, so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the length of Saturn's year and the 18.6-Earth year [[Lunar precession#Nodal precession|nodal precession]] period of the Moon's orbit influence the periodicity).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bright Saturn will blink out across Australia – for an hour, anyway |url=http://theconversation.com/bright-saturn-will-blink-out-across-australia-for-an-hour-anyway-26217 |access-date=11 May 2014 |newspaper=The Conversation |date=9 May 2014 |display-authors=1 |author=Tanya Hill |author2=Jonti Horner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

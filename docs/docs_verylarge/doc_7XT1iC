==Influences==
[[File:Augusto Boal  nyc5.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Augusto Boal''' presenting his workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed''. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
Most of Augusto Boal's techniques were created after he realized the limitations of didactic, politically motivated theatre in the poor areas where he worked. He found that his attempts to inspire the people living in poor or &quot;slum&quot; areas to rise up against racial and class inequality were inhibited by his own racial and class background, since he was white and comparatively financially comfortable, as well as his and his colleagues' inhibitions to perform violence themselves. His new techniques allowed the idea of rebellion and the impetus for change to come from within the target group. Much of his early work and teaching was inspired by [[Marxist]] philosophy, although through his career he had not been restricted by this and much of his work now falls within the boundaries of a centre-left ideology.

[[Paulo Freire]] was a major influence on Boal's teachings. He and Freire became close in later years. When Freire died, Boal said: &quot;I am very sad. I have lost my last father. Now all I have are brothers and sisters&quot;.&lt;ref name=PTO/&gt;

Boal was also known to quote [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which Hamlet argues that theatre is like a mirror that reflects our virtues and defects equally. Although Boal found this quote beautiful, he liked to think of theatre as a mirror in which one can reach in to change reality and to transform it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josekuller.wordpress.com/38-entrevista-com-augusto-boal/ 38- Entrevista com Augusto Boal | Arquivo68].

==Published works==

===''Theatre of the Oppressed'' (London: Pluto Press, 1979)===
Arguably Augusto Boal's most academically influential work&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaharris.iweb.bsu.edu/BoalEssay.htm The Theatre of the Oppressed: The Philosophy of Augusto Boal, by Kevin A. Harris] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020058/http://kaharris.iweb.bsu.edu/BoalEssay.htm |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120709193214/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1997_Nov/ai_20099663/ The theatre of the oppressed, by Augusto Boal.

Boal contends that the [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethic]] means oppressing the masses, the people, the workers and the spectators in favour of stability and the continued dominance of a privileged few. He argues that the ''[[Tragedy#Greek tragedy|Tragi-drama]]'', a formulaic drama style that today could be considered similar to that of [[soap opera]]s, helps the State promote its continued existence. He sees the Brazilian government as an example of an oppressive state using theatre to propagate its oppressive system. He then outlines his early theories and practices for attempting to reverse the paradigm. It also talks about Newspaper Theatre, attempting to talk about local problems and present it to the audiences, Forum Theatre, currently used in over 70 countries, Invisible Theatre, used to discuss political activity and Image Theatre. Theatre of the Oppressed has been translated to more than 25 languages over the years. 
Boal also talks about Invisible theatre in which an event is planned and scripted but does not allow the spectators to know that the event is happening. Actors perform out of the ordinary roles which invite spectators to join in or sit back and watch. One example was in a restaurant at the Chiclayo hotel, actors sat at separate tables and informed the waiters in loud voices that they could not eat the food. The actor stated that the food was not good. The waiter says the diner could pick something else to eat. So the actor chose a rather expensive item off the menu and says he will be able to pay for it. The actor mentions he has no money and he would be willing to work for it. This display made other diners start discussing the price and treatment of workers at this hotel. This act allowed spectators to think about issues that were going on but was brushed over because the issue did not directly involve them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah 2003&quot;&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort (2003). &quot;From Theatre of the Oppressed.&quot; ''[[The New Media Reader]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003. pp. 339–52. &lt;/ref&gt;
Analytical theatre is when a participant tells a story and the actors improvise it. Each character is broken down into all the social roles they could follow and the participants choose an object to symbolize the role. This aspect of theatre allows the participants to see how there are multiple roles a person could follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah 2003&quot;/&gt;

===''Games For Actors and Non-Actors'' (London: Routledge, 1992; Second Edition 2002)===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
This is probably Augusto Boal's most practically influential book, in which he sets down a brief explanation of his theories, mostly through stories and examples of his work in Europe, and then explains every drama exercise that he has found useful in his practice. In contrast to ''Theatre of the Oppressed'', it contains little academic theory and many practical examples for drama practitioners to use even if not practising theatre that is related to Boal's academic or political ideas. Boal refers to many of these as &quot;gamesercises&quot;, as they combine the training and &quot;introversion&quot; of exercises with the fun and &quot;extroversion&quot; of games. It has been influential in the development of Community Theatre and Theatre in Education (T.I.E.) practices worldwide, especially in Europe and South America. These games include ''Carnival in Rio'' and ''Your Friend is Dead''.

===''The Rainbow of Desire: The Boal Method of Theatre and Therapy''. (London: Routledge, 1995)===
This book re-evaluates the practices commonly associated with the Theatre of the Oppressed for a new purpose. It has been argued that Boal contradicts himself with this take on his work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boal, Augusto 1995&quot;&gt;Boal, Augusto (1995). ''The Rainbow of Desire: the Boal Method of Theatre and Therapy''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as it mostly concerns itself with creating harmony within society, whereas his early work was concerned with rebellion and upheaval. Boal states that, &quot;Theatre is the passionate combat of two human beings on a platform.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boal, Augusto 1995&quot;/&gt; However, Boal's works can be seen as a progression and exploration of a [[Left Wing]] world view rather than a unified theory. In the context of those under-represented in a society, his methodology can be used as a weapon against oppressors. In the context of those in a society who are in need of [[catharsis]] for the sake of their own integration into it, it can be switched round to empower that individual to break down internal oppressions that separate that individual from society.
Through his work at French institutions for the mentally ill and elsewhere in Europe, where he discovered concepts such as the &quot;Cop in the Head&quot;, the theories presented in this book have been useful in the pioneering field of drama therapy and have been applied by drama practitioners.
Boal states in his work that there are three properties of the aesthetic space. First, is plasticity. He says that one can be without being. Objects can acquire different meaning such as an old chair representing a king's throne. He states that only duration counts and location can be changed. Second, is that the aesthetic space is dichotomic and it creates dichotomy. This idea suggests that there is a space within a space. The stage is in front of the audience and the actor is creating his own space. Third, is telemicroscopic. This idea creates the idea that it is impossible to hide on stage. Every aspect of the space is seen and it makes the far away close-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boal, Augusto 1995&quot;/&gt;

==Recognition==
[[File:Augusto Boal.jpg|thumb|'''Augusto Boal''' receives the ''Crossborder Award for Peace and Democracy''. [[Abbey Theatre]], April 3rd 2008.]]
In 1994, Boal won the UNESCO Pablo Picasso Medal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.unesco.org/WS_acces.aspx?langRecherche=EN&amp;idEvent=000000001A447390AA6611CD9BC800AA002FC45A09007B4BDA8D71164646B11CF38FABFBB67500000098060B00007B4BDA8D71164646B11CF38FABFBB675000002FDE7800000 UNESCO.

Retrieved on 2019-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 1997, he was awarded the &quot;Career Achievement Award&quot; by the Association of Theatre in Higher Education at their national conference in Chicago, Illinois. Boal is also seen as the inspiration behind 21st-century forms of performance-activism, such as the &quot;Optative Theatrical Laboratories&quot;.

Boal received The Cross Border Award for Peace and Democracy by [[Dundalk Institute of Technology]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.dkit.ie/about_dkit/institute_news/denis_cummins_to_make_presentation_to_augusto_boal Denis Cummins to make presentation to Augusto Boal].

In [[mathematics]], the '''closure''' of a subset ''S'' of points in a [[topological space]] consists of all [[Topology glossary#P|point]]s in ''S'' together with all [[limit points]] of ''S''. The closure of ''S'' may equivalently be defined as the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of ''S'' and its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]], and also as the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all [[closed set]]s containing ''S''. Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in ''S'' or &quot;near&quot; ''S''. A point which is in the closure of ''S'' is a [[adherent point|point of closure]] of ''S''. The notion of closure is in many ways [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the notion of [[interior (topology)|interior]].

==Definitions==

=== Point of closure ===
{{Main|Adherent point}}

For ''S'' a subset of a [[Euclidean space]], ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if every [[open ball]] centered at ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' (this point may be ''x'' itself).

This definition generalizes to any subset ''S'' of a [[metric space]] ''X''. 
Fully expressed, for ''X'' a metric space with metric ''d'', ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if for every ''r'' &gt; 0, there is a ''y'' in ''S'' such that the distance ''d''(''x'', ''y'') &lt; ''r''. (Again, we may have ''x'' = ''y''.) 
Another way to express this is to say that ''x'' is a point of closure of ''S'' if the distance ''d''(''x'', ''S'') := [[infimum|inf]]{''d''(''x'', ''s'') : ''s'' in ''S''} = 0.

This definition generalizes to [[topological space]]s by replacing &quot;open ball&quot; or &quot;ball&quot; with &quot;[[Topology glossary#N|neighbourhood]]&quot;. 
Let ''S'' be a subset of a topological space ''X''. 
Then ''x'' is a '''[[Adherent point|point of closure]]''' (or '''adherent point''') of ''S'' if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schubert|1968|loc=p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Note that this definition does not depend upon whether neighbourhoods are required to be open.

=== Limit point ===
{{Main|Limit point}}

The definition of a point of closure is closely related to the definition of a [[limit point]]. 
The difference between the two definitions is subtle but important &amp;mdash; namely, in the definition of limit point, every neighbourhood of the point {{mvar|x}} in question must contain a point of the set ''other than {{mvar|x}} itself''. 
The set of all limit points of a set {{mvar|S}} is called the '''[[Derived set (mathematics)|derived set]]''' of {{mvar|S}}. 

Thus, every limit point is a point of closure, but not every point of closure is a limit point. 
A point of closure which is not a limit point is an [[isolated point]]. 
In other words, a point {{mvar|x}} is an isolated point of {{mvar|S}} if it is an element of {{mvar|S}} and if there is a neighbourhood of {{mvar|x}} which contains no other points of {{mvar|S}} other than {{mvar|x}} itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1966|loc=p. 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a given set {{mvar|S}} and point {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|x}} is a point of closure of {{mvar|S}} if and only if {{mvar|x}} is an element of {{mvar|S}} or {{mvar|x}} is a limit point of {{mvar|S}} (or both).

===Closure of a set===
{{See also|Closure (mathematics)}}

The '''closure''' of a subset {{mvar|S}} of a topological space {{math|(''X'', τ)}}, denoted by {{math|cl(''S'')}}, {{math|Cl(''S'')}}, {{math|{{overline|''S''}}}}, or {{math|''S'' {{overline|{{space|2}}}}}}, can be defined using any of the following equivalent definitions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the set of all [[Adherent point|points of closure]] of {{mvar|S}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the set {{mvar|S}} together with [[Derived set (mathematics)|all of its limit points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|1988|loc=p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the intersection of all [[closed set]]s containing {{mvar|S}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the smallest closed set containing {{mvar|S}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the union of {{mvar|S}} and its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] {{math|∂(''S'')}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|cl(''S'')}} is the set of all {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} for which there exists a [[net (mathematics)|net]] (valued) in {{mvar|S}} that converges to {{mvar|x}} in {{math|(''X'', τ)}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The closure of a set has the following properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croom|1989|loc=p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{math|cl(''S'')}} is a [[closed set|closed]] superset of {{mvar|S}}
* The set {{mvar|S}} is closed [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''S'' = cl(''S'')}}.
* If {{mvar|S}} is a subset of {{mvar|T}}, then {{math|cl(''S'')}} is a subset of {{math|cl(''T'')}}.
* If {{mvar|A}} is a closed set, then {{mvar|A}} contains {{mvar|S}} if and only if {{mvar|A}} contains {{math|cl(''S'')}}.

Sometimes the second or third property above is taken as the ''definition'' of the topological closure, which still make sense when applied to other types of closures (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gemignani|1990|loc=p. 55}}, {{harvnb|Pervin|1965|loc=p. 40}} and {{harvnb|Baker|1991|loc=p. 38}} use the second property as the definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[first-countable space]] (such as a [[metric space]]), {{math|cl(''S'')}} is the set of all [[limit of a sequence|limits]] of all convergent [[sequence]]s of points in {{mvar|S}}. 
For a general topological space, this statement remains true if one replaces &quot;sequence&quot; by &quot;[[net (mathematics)|net]]&quot; or &quot;[[filter (mathematics)|filter]]&quot;.

Note that these properties are also satisfied if &quot;closure&quot;, &quot;superset&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, &quot;contains/containing&quot;, &quot;smallest&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are replaced by &quot;interior&quot;, &quot;subset&quot;, &quot;union&quot;, &quot;contained in&quot;, &quot;largest&quot;, and &quot;open&quot;. 
For more on this matter, see [[Closure (topology)#Closure operator|closure operator]] below.

==Examples==
Consider a sphere in 3 dimensions. Implicitly there are two regions of interest created by this sphere; the sphere itself and its interior (which is called an open 3-ball). It is useful to be able to distinguish between the interior of 3-ball and the surface, so we distinguish between the open 3-ball, and the closed 3-ball - the closure of the 3-ball. The closure of the open 3-ball is the open 3-ball plus the surface.

In [[topological space]]:
*In any space, &lt;math&gt;\varnothing=\mathrm{cl}(\varnothing)&lt;/math&gt;.
*In any space ''X'', ''X'' = cl(''X'').

Giving '''R''' and '''C''' the [[Standard topology|standard (metric) topology]]:
*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space '''R''' of [[real number]]s, then cl((0, 1)) = [0, 1].
*If ''X'' is the Euclidean space '''R''', then the closure of the set '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s is the whole space '''R'''. We say that '''Q''' is [[dense (topology)|dense]] in '''R'''.
*If ''X'' is the [[complex number|complex plane]] '''C''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then cl({''z'' in '''C''' : |''z''| &gt; 1}) = {''z'' in '''C''' : |''z''| ≥ 1}.
*If ''S'' is a [[finite set|finite]] subset of a Euclidean space, then cl(''S'') = ''S''. (For a general topological space, this property is equivalent to the [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; axiom]].)

On the set of real numbers one can put other topologies rather than the standard one.
*If ''X'' = '''R''', where '''R''' has the [[lower limit topology]], then cl((0, 1)) = &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0, 1).
*If one considers on '''R''' the [[discrete topology]] in which every set is closed (open), then cl((0, 1)) = (0, 1).
*If one considers on '''R''' the [[trivial topology]] in which the only closed (open) sets are the empty set and '''R''' itself, then cl((0, 1)) = '''R'''.

These examples show that the closure of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space. The last two examples are special cases of the following.

*In any [[discrete space]], since every set is closed (and also open), every set is equal to its closure.
*In any [[indiscrete space]] ''X'', since the only closed sets are the empty set and ''X'' itself, we have that the closure of the empty set is the empty set, and for every non-empty subset ''A'' of ''X'', cl(''A'') = ''X''. In other words, every non-empty subset of an indiscrete space is [[Dense set|dense]].

The closure of a set also depends upon in which space we are taking the closure. For example, if ''X'' is the set of rational numbers, with the usual [[subspace topology|relative topology]] induced by the Euclidean space '''R''', and if ''S'' = {''q'' in '''Q''' : ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2, ''q'' &gt; 0}, then ''S'' is closed in '''Q''', and the closure of ''S'' in '''Q''' is ''S''; however, the closure of ''S'' in the Euclidean space '''R''' is the set of all ''real numbers'' greater than ''or equal to'' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt2.&lt;/math&gt;

== Closure operator ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure (topology)]] --&gt;
{{See also|Closure operator|Kuratowski closure axioms}}

A '''closure operator''' on a set ''X'' is a [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] of the [[power set]] of ''X'', &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, into itself which satisfies the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]].

Given a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt;, the mapping &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; : ''S'' → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; for all {{nowrap|1=''S'' ⊆ ''X''}} is a closure operator on ''X''. Conversely, if '''c''' is a closure operator on a set ''X'', a topological space is obtained by defining the sets ''S'' with '''c'''(''S'') = ''S'' as [[closed set]]s (so their complements are the [[open set]]s of the topology).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pervin|1965|loc=p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The closure operator &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the  [[Interior (topology)|interior]] operator &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense that

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'' \ (''X'' \ ''S'')&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

and also

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'' \ (''X'' \ ''S'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

where ''X'' denotes the underlying set of the topological space containing ''S'', and the backslash refers to the [[Complement (set theory)|set-theoretic difference]].

Therefore, the abstract theory of closure operators and the Kuratowski closure axioms can be easily translated into the language of interior operators, by replacing sets with their [[Complement (set theory)|complements]].

In general, the closure operator does not commute with intersections. However, in a [[complete metric space]] the following result does hold:

{{Math theorem|name=Theorem&lt;ref name=&quot;Zalinescu 2002 p. 33&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Zalinescu | first=C | title=Convex analysis in general vector spaces | publisher=World Scientific | publication-place=River Edge, N.J.

==Facts about closures==
A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is [[closed set|closed]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;Cl(S)=S&lt;/math&gt;. In particular:
* The closure of the [[empty set]] is the empty set;
* The closure of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; itself is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. 
* The closure of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of sets is always a [[subset]] of (but need not be equal to) the intersection of the closures of the sets. 
* In a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets, the closure of the union and the union of the closures are equal; the union of zero sets is the empty set, and so this statement contains the earlier statement about the closure of the empty set as a special case. 
* The closure of the union of infinitely many sets need not equal the union of the closures, but it is always a [[superset]] of the union of the closures.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological subspace|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then the closure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; computed in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the intersection of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the closure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; computed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Cl_A(S) = A\cap Cl_X(S)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;Cl_X(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

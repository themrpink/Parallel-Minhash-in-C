==Housing==
Tlingit tribes historically built plank houses made from cedar and today call them clanhouses; these houses were built with a foundation such that they could store their belongings under the floors. It is said that these plank houses had no adhesive, nails, or any other sort of fastening devices. Clan houses were usually square or rectangular in shape and had front facing designs and totem poles to represent which clan and moiety the makers belonged.

== Economy ==
Many Tlingit men work in the fishing industry while women are employed at canneries or in the local handicraft industry. These handicrafts include items like wooden carvings and woven baskets which are sold for practical or tourist consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human: The Definitive Visual Guide|last=|first=|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7566-0520-2|editor-last=Winston|editor-first=Robert|location=New York|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Tlingit}}
[[File:Two Tlingit girls, Tsacotna and Natsanitna, wearing noserings, near Copper River, Alaska, 1903 - NARA - 524404.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Two Tlingit girls, near [[Copper River (Alaska)]], 1903. Photograph taken by the [[Miles Brothers]]]]
Various cultures of indigenous people have continuously occupied the Alaska territory for thousands of years, leading to the Tlingit. Human culture with elements related to the Tlingit originated around 10,000 years ago near the mouths of the [[Skeena River|Skeena]] and [[Nass River]]s. The historic Tlingit's first contact with Europeans came in 1741 with Russian explorers. Spanish explorers followed in 1775. Tlingits maintained their independence but suffered from epidemics of [[smallpox]] and other [[infectious disease]]s brought by the Europeans. The Native Americans had no immunity to such endemic Eurasian diseases, which had entered Europe centuries before.&lt;ref name=p209&gt;Pritzker, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==

{{Main|Food of the Tlingit}}
Food is a central part of Tlingit culture, and the land is an abundant provider. Most of the richness of intertidal life found on the beaches of Southeast Alaska can be harvested for food. Though eating off the beach could provide a fairly healthy and varied diet, eating nothing but &quot;beach food&quot; is considered contemptible among the Tlingit and a sign of poverty. Indeed, shamans and their families were required to abstain from all food gathered from the beach, and men might avoid eating beach food before battles or strenuous activities in the belief that it would weaken them spiritually and perhaps physically as well. Thus for both spiritual reasons as well as to add some variety to the diet, the Tlingit harvest many other resources for food besides those they easily find outside their front doors. No other food resource receives as much emphasis as [[salmon]]; however, [[Pinniped|seal]] and game are both close seconds.

[[Halibut]], [[shellfish]], and [[seaweed]] traditionally provided food in the spring, while late spring and summer bring [[Pinniped|seal]] and [[salmon]]. Summer is a time for gathering wild and tame berries, such as [[salmonberry]], [[Shepherdia canadensis|soap berry]], and [[Ribes|currant]]s.&lt;ref name=sea&gt;[http://www.sealaskaheritage.org/programs/language_and_culture_curriculum_tlingit.htm &quot;Sealaska – Programs – Language – Culture – Curriculum – Tlingit.&quot;] ''Sealaska Heritage Institute.'' (retrieved 3 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In fall, [[sea otter]]s are hunted.&lt;ref name=p210/&gt; [[Herring]] and [[eulachon]] are also important staples, that can be eaten fresh or dried and stored for later use. Fish provide meat, oil, and eggs.&lt;ref name=sea/&gt; Sea mammals, such as sea lions and sea otters, are used for food and clothing materials. In the forests near their homes, Tlingit hunted deer, bear, mountain goats and other small mammals.

== Genetics ==
Genetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the [[Ainu people]] of Japan to some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], especially to populations on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Pacific Northwest Coast]] such as Tlingit. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of the Tlingit can be traced back to [[Paleolithic]] groups in [[Southern Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11802426_Genetic_link_between_Asians_and_Native_Americans_Evidence_from_HLA_genes_and_haplotypes|title=Genetic link between Asians and Native Americans: Evidence from HLA genes and haplotypes|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=17 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oahu''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|ɑː|h|uː}}) ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: '''''Oʻahu''''' ({{IPA-haw|oˈʔɐhu|pron}})), also known as [[Gathering place#Island of Oʻahu as The Gathering Place|&quot;The Gathering Place&quot;]], is the third-largest of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. It is home to roughly one million people—about two-thirds of the population of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]]. The island lies within [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu County]] and the state capital, [[Honolulu]], is on Oahu's southeast coast. 

Including small associated islands such as [[Ford Island]] plus those in [[Kāneʻohe Bay]] and off the eastern ([[windward and leeward|windward]]) coast, its area is {{convert|596.7|sqmi|km2|1}}, making it the [[List of islands of the United States by area|20th-largest island in the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SizeRef&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf | title=Table 5.08 – Land Area of Islands: 2000|publisher=State of Hawaii | year=2004 | access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oahu is {{convert|44|mi|km|0|}} long and {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} across. Its shoreline is {{convert|227|mi|km|0|}} long. The island is composed of two separate [[shield volcano]]es: the [[Waianae Range|Waiʻanae]] and [[Koʻolau Range]]s, with a broad valley or saddle (the central Oahu Plain) between them. The highest point is [[Kaʻala]] in the Waiʻanae Range, rising to {{convert|4003|ft|m|0|}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElevationRef&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf | title=Table 5.11 – Elevations of Major Summits|publisher=State of Hawaii | year=2004 | access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The island was home to 953,207 people in 2010 (approximately 72% of the population of the state, with approximately 81% of those living in or near the Honolulu urban area). Oahu has for a long time been known as [[Gathering place#Island of O.7B.7Bokina.7D.7Dahu as The Gathering Place|the &quot;Gathering Place&quot;]]. The term {{lang|haw|Oʻahu}} has no confirmed meaning in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiʻian]], other than that of the place itself.&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, et al., 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Hawaiian tradition attributes the name's origin in the legend of {{lang|haw|[[Hawaiiloa|Hawaiʻiloa]]|italic=no}}, the [[Polynesia]]n navigator credited with discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. The story relates that he named the island after his daughter.

Residents of Oahu refer to themselves as &quot;locals&quot; (as done throughout Hawaii), no matter their ancestry.

The city of [[Honolulu]]—largest city, state capital, and main deepwater marine [[port]] for the State of {{lang|haw|Hawaiʻi|italic=no}}—is located here. As a jurisdictional unit, the entire island of Oahu is in the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu County]], although as a place name, Honolulu occupies only a portion of the southeast end of the island.

Well-known features found on Oahu include [[Waikiki]], [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]], [[Hanauma Bay|{{lang|haw|Hanauma|italic=no|nocat=yes}}]], [[Kāneʻohe Bay]], [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua Bay]], [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]].

While the entire island is officially the City and County of Honolulu, locals identify settlements using town names (generally those of the [[census-designated place]]s), and consider the island to be divided into various areas, which may overlap. The most commonly accepted areas are the &quot;City&quot;, &quot;Town&quot; or &quot;Town side&quot;, which is the urbanized area from {{lang|haw|Halawa|italic=no}} to the area below Diamond Head (residents of the island north of the [[Koʻolau Range|{{lang|haw|Koʻolau|italic=no|nocat=yes}} Mountains]] consider the Town Side to be the entire southern half), &quot;West Oahu&quot;, which goes from Pearl Harbor to [[Kapolei, Hawaii|Kapolei]], {{lang|haw|[[Ewa Villages, Hawaii|ʻEwa]]|italic=no}} and may include the {{lang|haw|[[Mākaha, Hawaii|Mākaha]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|haw|[[Waianae, Hawaii|Waiʻanae]]|italic=no}} areas; the &quot;[[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]]&quot; (northwestern coast); the &quot;[[windward and leeward|Windward Side]]&quot; (northeastern coast from {{lang|haw|Kahuku|italic=no}} to {{lang|haw|Kāneʻohe|italic=no}}); the &quot;East Side&quot; or &quot;East Coast&quot; (the eastern portion of the island, from {{lang|haw|Kāneʻohe|italic=no}} on the northeast, around the tip of the island to include much of the area east of Diamond Head); and &quot;The Valley&quot; or &quot;Central Oahu&quot; which runs northwest from Pearl Harbor toward {{lang|haw|Haleʻiwa|italic=no}}. These terms are somewhat flexible, depending on the area in which the user lives, and are used in a mostly general way, but residents of each area identify strongly with their part of the island, especially those outside of widely-known towns. For instance, if locals are asked where they live, they would usually reply &quot;Windward Oahu&quot; rather than &quot;[[Laie, Hawaii|Laie]]&quot;.

Being roughly diamond-shaped, surrounded by ocean and divided by mountain ranges, directions on Oahu are not generally described with the compass directions found throughout the world. Locals instead use directions originally using Honolulu as the central point. To go {{lang|haw|ʻewa}} means traveling toward the western tip of the island, ''&quot;Diamond Head&quot;'' is toward the eastern tip, {{lang|haw|mauka}} is inland (toward the central {{lang|haw|Koʻolau|italic=no}} Mountain range, north of Honolulu) and {{lang|haw|makai}} toward the sea. When these directions became common, Diamond Head was the eastern edge of the primary populated area. Today, with a much larger populace and extensive development, the mountain itself is often not actually to the east when directions are given, and is not to be used as a literal point of reference—to go &quot;Diamond Head&quot; is to go to the east from anywhere on the island.

Oahu is also known for having the longest rain shower in history, which lasted for 200 consecutive days. Kāneʻohe Ranch reported 247 straight days with rain from August 27, 1993 to April 30, 1994. The island has many nicknames one of them being &quot;rainbow state.&quot; This is because rainbows are a common sight in {{lang|haw|Hawaiʻi|italic=no}} due to the frequent rain showers. The average temperature in Oahu is around {{convert|70-85|F}} and the island is the warmest in June through October. The weather during the winter is cooler, but still warm with an average temperature of {{convert|68-78|F}}.

The windward side is known for some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. [[Lanikai Beach|{{lang|haw|Lanikai|italic=no|nocat=yes}} Beach]] on the windward coast of Oahu has been consistently ranked among the best beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Conners |first1=Valerie |title=Top 10 Beaches of Hawaii |url=http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/beaches/articles/top-10-hawaiian-beaches |publisher=[[Travel Channel]] |access-date=December 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial view of Pearl Harbor on 1 June 1986 (6422248).jpg|thumb|right|[[Pearl Harbor]] is the home of the largest [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] fleet in the Pacific. The harbor was attacked on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7, 1941]], by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Empire]], bringing the [[United States]] into [[World War II]].]]

[[File:Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.JPG|thumb|right|[[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]] (right); [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] (left) in [[Pearl Harbor]]]]

The island has been inhabited since at least 3rd century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Van, James (2010). ''Ancient Sites of Oahu: A Guide to Archaeological Places of Interest''. Bishop Museum Pr. Page 5. {{ISBN|978-1581780956}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 304-year-old Kingdom of Oʻahu was once ruled by the most ancient [[aliʻi]] in all of the Hawaiian Islands. The first great king of Oʻahu was [[Maʻilikūkahi]], the lawmaker, who was followed by many generation of monarchs. Kualiʻi was the first of the warlike kings and so were his sons. In 1773, the throne fell upon Kahahana, the son of Elani of Ewa. In 1783, [[Kahekili II]], King of Maui, conquered Oʻahu and deposed the reigning family and then made his son, [[Kalanikūpule]], king of O'ahu, turning O'ahu into a [[puppet state]]. [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha the Great]] would conquer in the mountain Kalanikūpule's force in the [[Battle of Nuuanu|Battle of Nuʻuanu]]. Kamehameha founded the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] with the conquest of Oʻahu in 1795. Hawaiʻi would not be unified until the islands of [[Kauai|Kauaʻi]] and [[Niihau|Niʻihau]] surrendered under King [[Kaumualii|Kaumualiʻi]] in 1810. [[Kamehameha III]] moved his capital from [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lāhainā]], [[Maui]] to [[Honolulu]], Oʻahu in 1845. [[Iolani Palace|ʻIolani Palace]], built later by other members of the royal family, is still standing, and is the only royal palace on American soil.

Oahu was apparently the first of the Hawaiian Islands sighted by the crew of [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] on January 19, 1778, during Captain [[James Cook]]'s third Pacific expedition. Escorted by [[HMS Discovery (1774)|HMS ''Discovery'']], the expedition was surprised to find high islands this far north in the central Pacific. Oahu was not actually visited by Europeans until February 28, 1779, when Captain [[Charles Clerke]] aboard HMS ''Resolution'' stepped ashore at [[Waimea Bay, Hawaii|Waimea Bay]]. Clerke had taken command of the ship after [[James Cook#Third voyage (1776–79) and death|James Cook was killed]] at [[Kealakekua Bay]] ([[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaiʻi]]) on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific. With the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands came the introduction of disease, mosquitoes, and aggressive foreign animals. Although indirect, the simple exposure to these foreign species caused permanent damage to the Native Hawaiian people and environment.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Oahu on the morning of December 7, 1941 brought the United States into [[World War II]]. The surprise attack was aimed at destroying the American will to fight and make them sue for peace immediately by attacking the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] of the [[United States Navy]] and its defending [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] and [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|Marine Air Forces]]. The attack damaged or destroyed twelve American warships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and resulted in the deaths of 2,335 American servicemen and 68 civilians (of those, 1,177 were the result of the destruction of the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] alone).

Today, Oahu has become a tourism and shopping haven. Over five million visitors (mainly from the [[contiguous United States]] and [[Japan]]) flock there every year to enjoy the island.

===Law enforcement===
Oahu boasts of having had the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Gold Medal]] winner [[Duke Kahanamoku]] serve as Sheriff, perhaps the only such athlete to serve as a law enforcement professional.  He held that office for 13 consecutive terms, from 1932 until 1961.

Visitors should be aware that some of the police vehicles on Oahu (and on the &quot;Big Island&quot; of Hawaiʻi) are unmarked except for the blue lights mounted on their roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brannan |first1=Johnny |title=Use of personal cars saves police time and money {{!}} The Honolulu Advertiser {{!}} Hawaii's Newspaper |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Jun/16/ln/ln08a.html |access-date=16 July 2020 |work=the.honoluluadvertiser.com |date=June 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stored energy printer''' is a [[computer printer]] that uses the energy stored in a spring or [[magnetic field]] to push a hammer through a ribbon to print a dot. As compared to [[dot matrix printers]] that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time. Therefore, it is also known as a '''[[line matrix printer]]'''. This technology produces premium impact printers that print for millions to billions of dots per hammer. The advantage of this technology is that it has the lowest known cost of ownership: ink is transferred by conventional typewriter-style ribbons.

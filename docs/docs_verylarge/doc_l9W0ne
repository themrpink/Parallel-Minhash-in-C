As is clear from the above table, the adjective and noun endings differ only in the masculine plural. Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in ''-um'' in the singular and the resulting forms serve as [[adverbial]]s. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the ''um''-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition ''ina''.

In the later stages of Akkadian the [[mimation]] (word-final ''-m'') - along with [[nunation]] (dual final &quot;-n&quot;) - that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to ''-u'' and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings (although often sporadically and incorrectly). As the most important [[Language contact|contact language]] throughout this period was [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomenon.

As is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of &quot;states&quot; depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the ''status rectus'' (the governed state), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the ''status absolutus'' (the [[absolute state]]) and the ''status constructus'' ([[Construct state]]). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.

The status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. ''awīl'' &lt; ''awīlum'', ''šar'' &lt; ''šarrum''). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.

(1) ''Awīl-um šū šarrāq''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''Awīl-um'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; Colspan='3' | ''šū'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''šarrāq.''

|}

'''Translation:''' This man is a thief

(2) ''šarrum lā šanān''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''šarr-um'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; Colspan='3' | ''lā'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''šanān.''
|-
| King &lt;small&gt;(Status rectus, nominative)&lt;/small&gt; || Align=&quot;center&quot; Colspan='3' | not &lt;small&gt;(negative particle)&lt;/small&gt; || Align=&quot;right&quot; | oppose &lt;small&gt;(verbal infinitive, status absolutus)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

'''Translation:''' The king who cannot be rivaled

The status constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the ''shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible''. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:

(3) ''māri-šu''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''māri-šu''
|-
| Son (status constructus) + his &lt;small&gt;(3rd person singular possessive pronoun) &lt;/small&gt;
|}

'''Translation:''' His son, its (masculine) son

but

(4) ''mār šarr-im''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''mār'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''šarr-im''
|-
| Son (Status constructus) || king (genitive singular)
|}

'''Translation:''' The king's son

There are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like ''kalbum'' (dog) and ''maḫrum'' (front) would have illegal construct state forms ''*kalb'' and ''*maḫr'' unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. ''kalab'', ''maḫar''). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ''šaknum'' &lt; ''*šakinum'' &quot;governor&quot;). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so ''šaknum'' yields ''šakin'').

(5) ''kalab belim''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''kalab'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''bel-im''
|-
| dog (Status constructus) || master (genitive singular)
|}

'''Translation:''' The master's dog

(6) ''šakin ālim''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''šakin'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''āl-im''
|-
| Governor (Status constructus) || city (genitive singular)
|}

A genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ''ša'', and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.

(7) salīmātum ša awīl Ešnunna

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''salīmātum'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; Colspan='3' | ''ša'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''awīl''|| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''Ešnunna''

|}

'''Translation:''' The alliances of the Ruler of Ešnunna (literally &quot;Alliances which man of Ešnunna (has)&quot;)

The same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.

(7) ''awīl-um ša māt-am i-kšud-Ø-u''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''Awīl-um'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; Colspan='3' | ''ša'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''māt-am'' || Align=&quot;center&quot; | ''i-kšud-Ø-u''

'''Translation:''' The man who conquered the land.

====Verbal morphology====

=====Verb aspects=====
The Akkadian verb has six [[Finite verb|finite]] [[Grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] ([[preterite]],  [[Perfective|perfect]], [[present tense|present]], [[imperative (grammar)|imperative]], [[Irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] and vetitive) and three [[Non-finite verb|infinite]] forms ([[infinitive]], [[participle]] and [[Non-finite verb|verbal adjective]]). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]] where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Imperative mood#Indicative and prohibitive mood|prohibitive]], formed by the present form of the verb and the negative [[adverb]] lā, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a [[verbal noun]], and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in [[grammatical case|case]]. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the [[semantics]] of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the [[English gerund]].

The following table shows the conjugation of the [[Derived stem|G-stem]] verbs derived from the root PRS (&quot;to decide&quot;) in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:

=====Verb moods=====
Akkadian verbs have 3 moods:
#[[Indicative]], used in independent clauses, is unmarked.
#[[Subjunctive]], used in dependent clauses. The subjunctive is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix -u (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives), but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost
#[[Ventive|Venitive]] or [[allative]]. The venitive is not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the 1st person dative pronominal suffix -am/-m/-nim. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion towards an object or person (e.g. ''illik'', &quot;he went&quot; vs. ''illikam'', &quot;he came&quot;). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.

The following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (&quot;to decide&quot;,&quot;to separate&quot;):

=====Verb patterns=====
Akkadian verbs have thirteen separate [[derived stem]]s formed on each [[Triliteral|root]]. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning &quot;basic stem&quot;). [[Causative]] or [[intensive]] forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The Š-stem is formed by adding a prefix ''š-'', and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a ''n-'' prefix. However the ''n-'' element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.

Furthermore, [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[iterative]] verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix ''-ta'', and the [[derived stems]] are therefore called Gt, Dt, Št and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix ''-tan-'', giving the Gtn, Dtn, Štn and Ntn. Because of the [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of ''n'', the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt [[Dynamic verb|durative]].

The final stem is the ŠD-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the Š-stem or the D-stem of the same verb.  It is formed with the Š prefix (like the Š-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).

An alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using [[Roman numeral]]s so that G, D, Š and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the [[infix]]es are numbered using [[Arabic numeral]]s; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the Štn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.

There is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and Š-stems.

The stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular [[Akkadian language#Stative|stative]] of the verb ''parāsum'' (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:

===Stative===
A very often appearing form which can be formed by [[noun]]s, [[adjectives]] as well as by [[predicative verb|verbal adjectives]] is the [[stative]]. [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Nominal predicatives]] occur in the [[status absolutus]] and correspond to the verb &quot;to be&quot; in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ''šarrum'' (king), the adjective ''rapšum'' (wide) and the verbal adjective ''parsum'' (decided).

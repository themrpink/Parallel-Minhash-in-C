In 1893, he signed on to the [[Seal hunting|sealing]] [[schooner]] ''Sophie Sutherland'', bound for the coast of Japan. When he returned, the country was in the grip of the [[panic of 1893|panic of '93]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] was swept by labor unrest. After grueling jobs in a [[jute mill]] and a street-railway power plant, London joined [[Coxey's Army]] and began his career as a tramp. In 1894, he spent 30&amp;nbsp;days for vagrancy in the [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] Penitentiary at [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York. In ''[[The Road (London book)|The Road]]'', he wrote:

{{quote |text=Man-handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable horrors of the Erie County Pen. I say 'unprintable'; and in justice I must also say undescribable. They were unthinkable to me until I saw them, and I was no spring chicken in the ways of the world and the awful abysses of human degradation. It would take a deep plummet to reach bottom in the Erie County Pen, and I do but skim lightly and facetiously the surface of things as I there saw them. |sign=Jack London |source=''The Road'' }}

After many experiences as a hobo and a sailor, he returned to Oakland and attended [[Oakland High School (California)|Oakland High School]]. He contributed a number of articles to the high school's magazine, ''The Aegis''.

[[File:Jack London Studying.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jack London studying at Heinold's First and Last Chance in 1886]]
As a schoolboy, London often studied at [[Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon]], a port-side bar in Oakland. At 17, he confessed to the bar's owner, John Heinold, his desire to attend university and pursue a career as a writer. Heinold lent London tuition money to attend college.

London desperately wanted to attend the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], located in Berkeley. In 1896, after a summer of intense studying to pass certification exams, he was admitted. Financial circumstances forced him to leave in 1897, and he never graduated. No evidence has surfaced that he ever wrote for student publications while studying at Berkeley.{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=67}}

While at Berkeley, London continued to study and spend time at Heinold's saloon, where he was introduced to the sailors and adventurers who would influence his writing. In his autobiographical novel, ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]],'' London mentioned the pub's likeness seventeen times. Heinold's was the place where London met Alexander McLean, a captain known for his cruelty at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacGillivray |first=Don |url=http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/MACCAP.html |title=Captain Alex MacLean |publisher=University of Washington Press |date=April 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7748-1471-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; London based his protagonist Wolf Larsen, in the novel ''[[The Sea-Wolf]],'' on McLean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacGillivray |first=Don |url=http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/CaptainAlexMacLean.pdf |title=Captain Alex MacLean |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7748-1471-3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515042050/http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/2008/CaptainAlexMacLean.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gold rush and first success ==
[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors ascend the Chilkoot Trail during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]

On July 12, 1897, London (age 21) and his sister's husband Captain Shepard sailed to join the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. This was the setting for some of his first successful stories. London's time in the harsh [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], however, was detrimental to his health. Like so many other men who were malnourished in the goldfields, London developed [[scurvy]]. His gums became swollen, leading to the loss of his four front teeth. A constant gnawing pain affected his hip and leg muscles, and his face was stricken with marks that always reminded him of the struggles he faced in the Klondike. [[Father William Judge]], &quot;The Saint of [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson]]&quot;, had a facility in Dawson that provided shelter, food and any available medicine to London and others. His struggles there inspired London's short story, &quot;[[To Build a Fire]]&quot; (1902, revised in 1908),{{efn-ua|name=&quot;To Build a Fire&quot;| The 1908 version of &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; is available on [[Wikisource]] in two places: &quot;[[s:Century Magazine/Volume 76/Issue 4/To Build a Fire|To Build a Fire]]&quot; (Century Magazine) and &quot;[[s:Lost Face/To Build a Fire|To Build a Fire]]&quot; (in ''[[Lost Face]]'' – 1910).  The 1902 version may be found at the following external link: To Build a Fire ([[Sonoma State University#Recent and future expansion|The Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center, Sonoma State University]]).}} which many critics assess as his best.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

His landlords in Dawson were mining engineers [[Marshall Latham Bond]] and Louis Whitford Bond, educated at the Bachelor's level at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] at [[Yale]] and at the Master's level at [[Stanford]], respectively. The brothers' father, [[Judge Hiram Bond]], was a wealthy mining investor. While the Bond brothers were at Stanford Hiram at the suggestion of his brother bought the New Park Estate at Santa Clara as well as a local bank. The Bonds, especially Hiram, were active [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Marshall Bond's diary mentions friendly sparring with London on political issues as a camp pastime.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

London left Oakland with a [[social conscience]] and socialist leanings; he returned to become an activist for [[socialism]]. He concluded that his only hope of escaping the work &quot;trap&quot; was to get an education and &quot;sell his brains&quot;. He saw his writing as a business, his ticket out of poverty, and, he hoped, a means of beating the wealthy at their own game. On returning to California in 1898, London began working to get published, a struggle described in his novel, ''[[Martin Eden]]'' (serialized in 1908, published in 1909). His first published story since high school was &quot;To the Man On Trail&quot;, which has frequently been collected in anthologies.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} When ''[[The Overland Monthly]]'' offered him only five dollars for it—and was slow paying—London came close to abandoning his writing career. In his words, &quot;literally and literarily I was saved&quot; when ''The Black Cat'' accepted his story &quot;A Thousand Deaths&quot;, and paid him $40—the &quot;first money I ever received for a story&quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

London began his writing career just as new printing technologies enabled lower-cost production of magazines. This resulted in a boom in popular magazines aimed at a wide public audience and a strong market for short fiction.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1900, he made $2,500 in writing, about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1900|r=-3}}}} in today's currency.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
Among the works he sold to magazines was a short story known as either &quot;Diable&quot; (1902) or &quot;Bâtard&quot; (1904), two editions of the same basic story; London received $141.25 for this story on May 27, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jacklondons.net/Fiction_of_jack_london/page8.html |website=JackLondons.net |accessdate=August 29, 2013 |title=Footnote 55 to &quot;Bâtard&quot; |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612221236/http://www.jacklondons.net/Fiction_of_jack_london/page8.html |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }} First published as &quot;Diable – A Dog&quot;.

The same story, with minor changes, was also called &quot;Bâtard&quot; when it appeared in the ''Sunday Illustrated Magazine'' of the ''Commercial Appeal'' (Memphis, Tenn.), September 28, 1913, pp. 7–11. London received $141.25 for this story on May 27, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; In the text, a cruel [[French Canadian]] brutalizes his dog, and the dog retaliates and kills the man. London told some of his critics that man's actions are the main cause of the behavior of their animals, and he would show this in another story, ''[[The Call of the Wild]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/100-best-novels-call-of-the-wild-jack-london &quot;The 100 best novels: No 35 – The Call of the Wild by Jack London (1903)&quot;] Retrieved July 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1903, London sold ''The Call of the Wild'' to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' for $750, and the book rights to [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] for $2,000.  Macmillan's promotional campaign propelled it to swift success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/call.html &quot;Best Dog Story Ever Written: Call of the Wild&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421154451/http://www.jacklondons.net/call.html |date=April 21, 2008 }}, excerpted from {{harvnb|Kingman|1979|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living at his rented villa on [[Lake Merritt]] in Oakland, California, London met poet [[George Sterling]]; in time they became best friends. In 1902, Sterling helped London find a home closer to his own in nearby [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]]. In his letters London addressed Sterling as &quot;Greek&quot;, owing to Sterling's [[aquiline nose]] and classical profile, and he signed them as &quot;Wolf&quot;. London was later to depict Sterling as Russ Brissenden in his autobiographical novel ''Martin Eden'' (1910) and as Mark Hall in ''[[The Valley of the Moon (novel)|The Valley of the Moon]]'' (1913).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In later life London indulged his wide-ranging interests by accumulating a personal library of 15,000 volumes. He referred to his books as &quot;the tools of my trade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1986) (as cited by other sources)&lt;/ref&gt;

== First marriage (1900–1904) ==
[[File:Jack London with daughters Bess (left) and Joan (right).jpg|thumb|left|Jack with daughters Becky (left) and Joan (right)]]
[[File:Bessie Maddern London and daughters.jpg|thumb|left|Bessie Maddern London and daughters, Joan and Becky]]

London married Elizabeth Mae (or May) &quot;Bessie&quot; Maddern on April 7, 1900, the same day ''The Son of the Wolf'' was published. Bess had been part of his circle of friends for a number of years. She was related to stage actresses [[Minnie Maddern Fiske]] and [[Emily Stevens (actress)|Emily Stevens]]. Stasz says, &quot;Both acknowledged publicly that they were not marrying out of love, but from friendship and a belief that they would produce sturdy children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stasz|2001|p=61}}: &quot;Both acknowledged... that they were not marrying out of love&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Kingman says, &quot;they were comfortable together... Jack had made it clear to Bessie that he did not love her, but that he liked her enough to make a successful marriage.&quot;{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=98}} 

London met Bessie through his friend at Oakland High School, Fred Jacobs; she was Fred's fiancée.  Bessie, who tutored at Anderson's University Academy in Alameda California, tutored Jack in preparation for his entrance exams for the University of California at Berkeley in 1896.  Jacobs was killed aboard the [[USS Warren (1898)|USAT Scandia]] in 1897, but Jack and Bessie continued their friendship, which included taking photos and developing the film together.&lt;ref&gt;Reesman 2010, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of Jack's passion for photography. 

During the marriage, London continued his friendship with [[Anna Strunsky]], co-authoring ''[[The Kempton-Wace Letters]]'', an [[epistolary novel]] contrasting two philosophies of love. Anna, writing &quot;Dane Kempton's&quot; letters, arguing for a romantic view of marriage, while London, writing &quot;Herbert Wace's&quot; letters, argued for a scientific view, based on [[Darwinism]] and [[eugenics]]. In the novel, his fictional character contrasted two women he had known.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

London's pet name for Bess was &quot;Mother-Girl&quot; and Bess's for London was &quot;Daddy-Boy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stasz|2001|p=66}}: &quot;Mommy Girl and Daddy Boy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, [[Joan London (American writer)|Joan]], was born on January 15, 1901, and their second, Bessie &quot;Becky&quot; (also reported as Bess), on October 20, 1902. Both children were born in [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], California. Here London wrote one of his most celebrated works, ''[[The Call of the Wild]].'' 

While London had pride in his children, the marriage was strained. Kingman says that by 1903 the couple were close to separation as they were &quot;extremely incompatible&quot;. &quot;Jack was still so kind and gentle with Bessie that when Cloudsley Johns was a house guest in February 1903 he didn't suspect a breakup of their marriage.&quot;{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=121}}

London reportedly complained to friends Joseph Noel and George Sterling:

{{Quote |text=[Bessie] is devoted to purity. When I tell her morality is only evidence of low blood pressure, she hates me. She'd sell me and the children out for her damned purity. It's terrible. Every time I come back after being away from home for a night she won't let me be in the same room with her if she can help it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noel|1940|p=150}}, &quot;She's devoted to purity...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stasz writes that these were &quot;code words for [Bess's] fear that [Jack] was consorting with prostitutes and might bring home [[venereal disease]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stasz|2001|p=80}} (&quot;devoted to purity... code words...&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1903, London told Bessie he was leaving and moved out. During 1904, London and Bess negotiated the terms of a divorce, and the decree was granted on November 11, 1904.{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=139}}

== War correspondent (1904) ==
London accepted an assignment of the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' to cover the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in early 1904, arriving in [[Yokohama]] on January 25, 1904. He was arrested by Japanese authorities in [[Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi|Shimonoseki]], but released through the intervention of American ambassador [[Lloyd Griscom]].  After travelling to [[Korea]], he was again arrested by Japanese authorities for straying too close to the border with [[Manchuria]] without official permission, and was sent back to [[Seoul]].  Released again, London was permitted to travel with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] to the border, and to observe the [[Battle of Yalu River (1904)|Battle of the Yalu]].

London asked [[William Randolph Hearst]], the owner of the ''San Francisco Examiner'', to be allowed to transfer to the [[Imperial Russian Army]], where he felt that restrictions on his reporting and his movements would be less severe. However, before this could be arranged, he was arrested for a third time in four months, this time for assaulting his Japanese assistants, whom he accused of stealing the fodder for his horse. Released through the personal intervention of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], London departed the front in June 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kowner |first=Rotem |authorlink=Rotem Kowner |year=2006 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War |url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio00libg_334 |url-access=limited |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-4927-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldictio00libg_334/page/n256 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1904, London went with his close friend, the poet [[George Sterling]], to &quot;Summer High Jinks&quot; at the [[Bohemian Grove]]. London was elected to honorary membership in the [[Bohemian Club]] and took part in many activities. Other noted members of the Bohemian Club during this time included [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Gelett Burgess]], [[J. Allan Dunn|Allan Dunn]], [[John Muir]], [[Frank Norris]],{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and [[Herman George Scheffauer]].

Beginning in December 1914, London worked on ''The Acorn Planter, A California Forest Play'', to be performed as one of the [[List of Grove Plays|annual Grove Plays]], but it was never selected. It was described as too difficult to set to music.{{sfn|London|Taylor|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AFfqbTjG7OkC&amp;pg=PA394 394]}} London published ''The Acorn Planter'' in 1916.{{sfn|Wichlan|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=utnD3Wf2cV0C&amp;pg=PA131 131]}}

== Second marriage ==
[[File:Londons surfing in hawaii.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jack and Charmian London (c. 1915) at [[Waikiki]]]]

After divorcing Maddern, London married [[Charmian London|Charmian Kittredge]] in 1905. London had been introduced to Kittredge in 1900 by her aunt [[Netta Eames]], who was an editor at ''Overland Monthly'' magazine in San Francisco.  The two met prior to his first marriage but became lovers years later after Jack and Bessie London visited Wake Robin, Netta Eames' Sonoma County resort, in 1903.  London was injured when he fell from a buggy, and Netta arranged for Charmian to care for him.  The two developed a friendship, as Charmian, Netta, her husband Roscoe, and London were politically aligned with socialist causes.  At some point the relationship became romantic, and Jack divorced his wife to marry Charmian, who was five years his senior.&lt;ref&gt;Labor 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Russ Kingman called Charmian &quot;Jack's soul-mate, always at his side, and a perfect match.&quot;&lt;!--http://www.jacklondons.net/charmianpage.html for now, better reference later--&gt; Their time together included numerous trips, including a 1907 cruise on the yacht ''[[The Cruise of the Snark|Snark]]'' to Hawaii and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Sailing of the Snark&quot;, by [[J. Allan Dunn|Allan Dunn]], ''Sunset'', May 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of London's stories are based on his visits to Hawaii, the last one for 10&amp;nbsp;months beginning in December 1915.{{sfn|Day|1996|pp=113–19}}

The couple also visited [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]], Nevada, in 1907, where they were guests of the Bond brothers, London's Dawson City landlords. The Bond brothers were working in Nevada as mining engineers.

London had contrasted the concepts of the &quot;Mother Girl&quot; and the &quot;Mate Woman&quot; in ''The Kempton-Wace Letters.'' His pet name for Bess had been &quot;Mother-Girl;&quot; his pet name for Charmian was &quot;Mate-Woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|London|2003|p=59}}: copy of &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; inscribed &quot;Dear Mate-Woman: You know. You have helped me bury the Long Sickness and the White Logic.&quot; Numerous other examples in same source.&lt;/ref&gt; Charmian's aunt and foster mother, a disciple of [[Victoria Woodhull]], had raised her without prudishness.{{sfn|Kingman|1979|p=124}} Every biographer alludes to Charmian's uninhibited sexuality.{{sfn|Stasz|1999|p=112}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=133}}

[[File:StateLibQld 1 165259 Snark (ship).jpg|thumb|The ''Snark'' in Australia, 1921]]

Joseph Noel calls the events from 1903 to 1905 &quot;a domestic drama that would have intrigued the pen of an [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]].... London's had comedy relief in it and a sort of easy-going romance.&quot;{{sfn|Noel|1940|p=146}} In broad outline, London was restless in his first marriage, sought extramarital sexual affairs, and found, in Charmian Kittredge, not only a sexually active and adventurous partner, but his future life-companion. They attempted to have children; one child died at birth, and another pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Dale|editor-last1=Walker |last=|editor-first2=Jeanne|editor-last2=Reesman |title=No Mentor But Myself: Jack London on Writers and Writing|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU7CjupoZGsC&amp;pg=PA213 |chapter=A Selection of Letters to Charmain Kittredge |date=1999 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0804736367 |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beauty Ranch (1905–1916) ==
In 1905, London purchased a {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} ranch in [[Glen Ellen, California|Glen Ellen]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], California, on the eastern slope of [[Sonoma Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uuMtEHq3Nu8C&amp;pg=PA102 |last=Stasz |first=Clarice |title=Jack London's Women |page=102 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |isbn=978-1625340658 |year=2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: &quot;Next to my wife, the ranch is the dearest thing in the world to me.&quot; He desperately wanted the ranch to become a successful business enterprise. Writing, always a commercial enterprise with London, now became even more a means to an end: &quot;I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. I write a book for no other reason than to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate.&quot;

[[File:Portrait photograph of Jack London.jpg|right|thumb|London in 1914]]

Stasz writes that London &quot;had taken fully to heart the vision, expressed in his [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] fiction, of the land as the closest earthly version of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] ... he educated himself through the study of agricultural manuals and scientific tomes. He conceived of a system of ranching that today would be praised for its [[ecological wisdom]].&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} He was proud to own the first concrete [[silo]] in California, a circular [[piggery]] that he designed. He hoped to adapt the wisdom of Asian [[sustainable agriculture]] to the United States. He hired both Italian and Chinese stonemasons, whose distinctly different styles are obvious.

The ranch was an economic failure. Sympathetic observers such as Stasz treat his projects as potentially feasible, and ascribe their failure to bad luck or to being ahead of their time. Unsympathetic historians such as [[Kevin Starr]] suggest that he was a bad manager, distracted by other concerns and impaired by his alcoholism. Starr notes that London was absent from his ranch about six months a year between 1910 and 1916 and says, &quot;He liked the show of managerial power, but not grinding attention to detail .... London's workers laughed at his efforts to play big-time rancher [and considered] the operation a rich man's hobby.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kevin.

London spent $80,000 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|80000|1905|r=-4}}}} in current value) to build a {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} stone mansion called [[Wolf House]] on the property.

====Vowels====
{{Sinhala Śuddha set vowels}}

Vowels come in two shapes: independent and [[diacritic]]. The independent shape is used when a vowel does not follow a consonant, e.g. at the beginning of a word. The diacritic shape is used when a vowel follows a consonant. Depending on the vowel, the diacritic can attach at several places (see diacritics section above)

While most diacritics are regular, the diacritic for {{angle bracket|u}} takes a different shape according to the consonant it attaches to. The most common one is the one used for the consonant ප (p): පු (pu) and පූ (pū). Some consonants ending at the lower right corner (ක (k),ග (g), ත(t), but not න(n) or හ(h)) use this diacritic: කු (ku) and කූ (kuu). Combinations of ර(r) or  ළ(ḷ) with {{angle bracket|u}} have idiosyncratic shapes, viz රු (ru) රූ (rū) ළු (ḷu) ළූ (ḷū).&lt;ref name=&quot;JM11&quot;&gt;Jayawardena-Moser (2004) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the diacritic used for රු (ru) and රූ (rū) is what is normally used for the {{angle bracket|æ}}, and therefore there are idiosyncratic forms for ræ and rǣ, viz රැ and රෑ [difference may not be visible depending on how unicode is rendered in your browser]

====Consonants====
{{Sinhala Śuddha set consonants}}

The ''śuddha'' alphabet comprises 8 [[plosive]]s, 2 [[fricative]]s, 2 [[affricate]]s, 2 [[nasal stop|nasals]], 2 [[liquid consonant|liquids]] and 2 [[semivowel|glides]]. Additionally, there are the two graphemes for the retroflex sounds {{IPA|/ɭ/}} and {{IPA|/ɳ/}}, which are not phonemic in modern Sinhala, but which still form part of the set. These are shaded in the table.

The voiceless affricate (ච {{IPA|[t͡ʃa]}}) is not included in the ''śuddha'' set by purists since it does not occur in the main text of the Sidatsan̆garā. The Sidatsan̆garā does use it in examples though, so this sound did exist in Eḷu. In any case, it is needed for the representation of modern Sinhala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gair1997&quot; /&gt;

The basic shapes of these consonants carry an inherent {{IPA|/a/}} unless this is replaced by another vowel or removed by the ''hal kirīma''.
{{clear}}

====Prenasalized consonants====
{{Sinhala Śuddha set prenasalized consonants}}

The [[prenasalized consonant]]s resemble their plain counterparts. {{angle bracket|m̆b}} is made up  by the left half of {{angle bracket|m}} and the right half of {{angle bracket|b}}, while the other three are just like the grapheme for the plosive with a little stroke attached to their left.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fairbanks126&quot;&gt;Fairbanks et al. (1968), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Vowel diacritics attach in the same way as they would to the corresponding plain plosive.
{{clear}}

===Miśra set===
The ''miśra'' alphabet is a [[superset]] of ''śuddha''. It adds letters for [[aspirated consonant|aspirates]], [[retroflex]]es and [[sibilant]]s, which are not phonemic in today's Sinhala, but which are necessary to represent non-native words, like [[loanword]]s from [[Tatsama|Sanskrit]], Pali or [[Sinhalese words of English Origin|English]]. The use of the extra letters is mainly a question of prestige. From a purely phonemic point of view, there is no benefit in using them, and they can be replaced by a (sequence of) ''śuddha'' letters as follows: For the ''miśra'' aspirates, the replacement is the [[Tenuis consonant|plain]] ''śuddha'' counterpart, for the ''miśra'' [[retroflex]] [[liquid consonant|liquids]] the corresponding ''śuddha'' [[coronal consonant|coronal]] liquid,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karunatillakexxxi&quot;&gt;Karunatillake (2004), p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[sibilant]]s, {{angle bracket|s}}.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1996), p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;  ඤ (ñ) and  ඥ (gn) cannot be represented by ''śuddha'' graphemes but are found only in fewer than 10 words each. ෆ fa can be represented by ප pa with a Latin {{angle bracket|f}} inscribed in the cup.

{{Sinhala Miśra set vowels}}

There are six additional vocalic diacritics in the ''miśra'' alphabet. The two [[diphthong]]s are quite common, while the &quot;syllabic&quot; ṛ is much rarer, and the &quot;syllabic&quot; ḷ is all but obsolete. The latter are almost exclusively found in loanwords from Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matzel8&quot;&gt;Matzel (1983), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''miśra'' {{angle bracket|ṛ}} can also be written with ''śuddha'' {{angle bracket|r}}+{{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|u}}+{{angle bracket|r}}, which corresponds to the actual [[pronunciation]]. The ''miśra'' syllabic {{angle bracket|ḷ}} is obsolete, but can be rendered by ''śuddha'' {{angle bracket|l}}+{{angle bracket|i}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matzel14&quot;&gt;Matzel (1983), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Miśra {{angle bracket|au}} is rendered as  ''śuddha'' {{angle bracket|awu}}, ''miśra'' {{angle bracket|ai}}  as ''śuddha'' {{angle bracket|ayi}}.

Note that the transliteration of both ළ් and ෟ is {{angle bracket|ḷ}}. This is not very problematic as the second one is extremely scarce.

==Consonant conjuncts==
[[Image:ශ්‍රී (Śrī) in Sinhala with components marked.svg|thumb|right|Śrī]]

Certain combinations of graphemes trigger special [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]]. Special signs exist for an ර (r) following a consonant (inverted arch underneath), a ර (r) preceding a consonant (loop above) and a  ය (y) following a consonant (half a ය on the right).
&lt;ref name=&quot;Karunatillakexxxi&quot; /&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbanks109&quot;&gt;Fairbanks et al. (1968), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;JM12&quot;&gt;Jayawardena-Moser  (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, very frequent combinations are often written in one stroke, like ''ddh'', ''kv'' or ''kś''. If this is the case, the first consonant is not marked with a ''hal kirīma''.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Karunatillakexxxi&quot; /&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Matzel8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;JM12&quot; /&gt;
The image on the right shows the [[glyph]] for ''[[shri|śrī]]'', which is composed of the letter ''ś'' with a ligature indicating the ''r'' below and the vowel  ''ī'' marked above. Most other conjunct consonants are made with an explicit virama, called ''al-lakuna'' or ''hal kirīma'', and the [[zero-width joiner]] as shown in the following table, some of which may not display correctly due to limitations of your system. Some of the more common are displayed in the following table. Note that although modern Sinhala sounds are not aspirated, aspiration is marked in the sound where it was historically present to highlight the differences in modern spelling. Also note that all of the combinations are encoded with the ''al-lakuna'' (Unicode U+0DCA) first, followed by the zero-width joiner (Unicode U+200D) except for touching letters which have the zero-width joiner (Unicode U+200D) first followed by the ''al-lakuna'' (Unicode U+0DCA). Touching letters were used in ancient scriptures but are not used in modern Sinhala. Vowels may be attached to any of the ligatures formed, attaching to the rightmost part of the glyph except for vowels that use the ''kombuva'', where the ''kombuva'' is written before the ligature or cluster and the remainder of the vowel, if any, is attached to the rightmost part. In the table below, appending &quot;o&quot; (''kombuva saha ælepilla'' – ''kombuva'' with ''ælepilla'') to the cluster &quot;ky&quot; {{IPA|/kja/}} only adds a single code point, but adds two vowel strokes, one each to the left and right of the consonant cluster.

==Letter names==
The Sinhala ''śuddha'' graphemes are named in a uniform way adding ''-yanna'' to the sound produced by the letter, including vocalic diacritics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karunatillakexxxii&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbanks366&quot;&gt;Fairbanks et al. (1968), p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; The name for the letter අ is thus ''ayanna'', for the letter ආ ''āyanna'', for the letter ක ''kayanna'', for the letter කා ''kāyanna'', for the letter කෙ ''keyanna'' and so forth. For letters with ''hal kirīma'', an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''a'' is added for easier pronunciation: the name for the letter  ක් is ''akyanna''. Another naming convention is to use ''al-'' before a letter with suppressed vowel, thus ''alkayanna''.

Since the extra ''miśra'' letters are phonetically not distinguishable from the ''śuddha'' letters, proceeding in the same way would lead to confusion. Names of ''miśra'' letters are normally made up of the names of two ''śuddha'' letters pronounced as one word. The first one indicates the sound, the second one the shape. For example, the aspirated  ඛ  (kh) is called ''bayanu kayanna''. ''kayanna'' indicates the sound, while ''bayanu'' indicates the shape: ඛ  (kh) is similar in shape to  බ (b) (''bayunu = like bayanna''). Another method is to qualify the ''miśra'' aspirates by ''mahāprāna'' (ඛ: ''mahāprāna kayanna'') and the ''miśra'' retroflexes by ''mūrdhaja'' (ළ: ''mūrdhaja layanna'').

==Numerals==
{{Main|Sinhala numerals}}

Sinhala had special symbols to represent numerals, which were in use until the beginning of the 19th century.
This system is now superseded by [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/09/19/fea29.html |title=Online edition of Sunday Observer – Business |publisher=[http://www.sundayobserver.lk Sunday Observer] |accessdate=21 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207073829/http://sundayobserver.lk/2004/09/19/fea29.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2006-m12/0127.html |title=Unicode Mail List Archive: Re: Sinhala numerals |publisher=[http://unicode.org Unicode Consortium] |accessdate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sinhala Illakkam ([[Sinhala Archaic Numbers]])
Sinhala Illakkam were used for writing numbers prior to the fall of [[Kandyan Kingdom]] in 1815. These digits did not have a zero instead the numbers had signs for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000. These digits and numbers can be seen primarily in Royal documents and artefacts.

;Sinhala Lith Illakkam  ([[Sinhala Astrological Numbers]])
Prior to the fall of Kandyan Kingdom all calculations were carried out using Lith digits. After the fall of the [[Kandyan Kingdom]], Sinhala Lith Illakkam were primarily used for writing horoscopes. However, there is evidence that they were used for other purposes such as writing page numbers etc. The tradition of writing degrees and minutes of zodiac signs in horoscopes continued into the 20th century using different versions of Lith Digits. Unlike the Sinhala Illakkam, Sinhala Lith Illakkam included a 0.

Neither the [[Sinhala numerals]] nor U+0DF4 ෴  Sinhala punctuation [https://si.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%B7%B4 kunddaliya] is in general use today.

==Transliteration==
Sinhala [[transliteration]] (Sinhala: රෝම අකුරින් ලිවීම ''rōma akurin livīma'', literally &quot;Roman letter writing&quot;) can be done in analogy to [[Devanagari transliteration|Devanāgarī transliteration]].

Layman's transliterations in Sri Lanka normally follow neither of these. Vowels are transliterated according to English spelling equivalences, which can yield a variety of spellings for a number of phonemes. {{IPA|/iː/}} for instance can be {{angle bracket|ee}}, {{angle bracket|e}}, {{angle bracket|ea}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, etc.
A transliteration pattern peculiar to Sinhala, and facilitated by the absence of phonemic aspirates, is the use of {{angle bracket|th}} for the [[voiceless dental plosive]], and the use of {{angle bracket|t}} for the [[voiceless retroflex plosive]].
This is presumably because the retroflex plosive {{IPA|/ʈ/}} is perceived the same as the English [[voiceless alveolar plosive|alveolar plosive]] {{IPA|/t/}}, and the Sinhala dental plosive {{IPA|/t̪/}} is equated with the English  [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/θ/}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matzel16&quot;&gt;Matzel (1983), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Dental and retroflex voiced plosives are always rendered as {{angle bracket|d}}, though, presumably because {{angle bracket|dh}} is not found as a representation of {{IPAslink|ð}} in English orthography.

==Use for the Pali language==
Many of the oldest manuscripts in the Pali language are written in the Sinhala script. ''Miśra'' consonants are used to represent Pali phonemes that have no Sinhala counterpart. The following table lays out the Sinhala representations of Pali consonants with their standard academic Romanizations:

The {{IAST|niggahīta}} is represented with the sign ං. Consonant sequences may be combined in ligatures in a manner identical to that described above for Sinhala.

As an example, below is the first verse from the [[Dhammapada]] in Pali in Sinhala script, followed by Romanization:

{{Quote

==Relation to other scripts==
;Similarities
Sinhala is one of the [[Brahmic family|Brahmic scripts]], and thus shares many similarities with other members of the family, such as the [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil script]] and [[Devanāgarī]]. As a general example, {{IPA|/a/}} is the inherent vowel in all these scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;World 408&quot; /&gt; Other similarities include the diacritic for {{angle bracket|ai}}, which resembles a doubled {{angle bracket|e}} in all scripts and the diacritic for {{angle bracket|au}} which is composed of preceding {{angle bracket|e}} and following {{angle bracket|ḷ}}.

Likewise, the combination of the diacritics for {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|ā}} yields {{angle bracket|o}} in all these scripts.

;Differences
Sinhala alphabet differs from other Indo-Aryan alphabets in that it contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it. These are the two vowel sounds that are similar to the two vowel sounds that occur at the beginning of the English words ''at'' (ඇ) and ''ant'' (ඈ).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.isoc.org/inet97/proceedings/E1/E1_3.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature that distinguishes Sinhala from its sister Indo-Aryan languages is the presence of a set of five nasal sounds known as half-nasal or prenasalized stops.

==Computer encoding==
[[File:Sinhala language support in Linux.png|thumb|Sinhala language support in [[Linux]]. [[Firefox]] is shown in the background, with [[mlterm]] in the foreground with text having been entered into it by [[Intelligent Input Bus#ibus-m17n|ibus-m17n]].]]
Generally speaking, Sinhala support is less developed than support for Devanāgarī, for instance. A recurring problem is the rendering of diacritics which precede the consonant and diacritic signs which come in different shapes, like the one for {{angle bracket|u}}.

Sinhala does not come built in with [[Windows XP]], unlike [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Hindi]]. However, all versions of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 10]] come with Sinhala support by default, and do not require external [[font]]s to be installed to read Sinhala script. ''Nirmala UI'' is the default Sinhala font in windows 10. The newest version of Windows 10 has added support for [[Sinhala Archaic Numbers]] that were not supported by default in the previous version.

For [[Mac OS X]], Sinhala font and keyboard support can be found at [http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/ ''web.nickshanks.com/typography/''] and at [http://www.xenotypetech.com/osxSinhala.html ''www.xenotypetech.com/osxSinhala.html''].

All other dates in this article are in [[Gregorian calendar]] (see [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ruled the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and later the [[Russian Empire]] from {{OldStyleDate|7 May|1682|27 April}} until his death in 1725, [[coregency|jointly ruling]] before 1696 with his elder half-brother, [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]].

Through a number of successful wars, he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger [[empire]] that became a major European power and also laid the groundwork for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] after capturing ports at [[Azov]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, [[Westernised]] and based on [[the Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Cracraft|2003}} Peter's reforms had a lasting impact on Russia, and many institutions of the Russian government trace their origins to his reign. He is also known for founding and developing the city of [[Saint Petersburg]], which remained the capital of Russia until 1917.

==Title==
The imperial title of Peter the Great was the following:&lt;ref&gt;Лакиер А. Б. §66. Надписи вокруг печати. Соответствие их с государевым титулом. // Русская геральдика. – СПб., 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[By the grace of God]], the most excellent and great sovereign emperor Pyotr Alekseevich the ruler of all the Russias: of [[Moscow]], of [[Kiev]], of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], of [[Novgorod]], Tsar of [[Kazan]], Tsar of [[Astrakhan]] and Tsar of [[Siberia]], sovereign of [[Pskov]], great prince of [[Smolensk]], of [[Tver]], of [[Yugorsk]], of [[Perm]], of [[Vyatka River|Vyatka]], of [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and others, sovereign and great prince of the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Novgorod]] Lower lands, of [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], of [[Ryazan]], of [[Rostov]], of [[Yaroslavl]], of [[Belozersk]], of [[Udorsky District|Udora]], of [[Kondia]] and the sovereign of all the northern lands, and the sovereign of the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iverian lands]], of the [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484–1762)|Kartlian]] and [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|Georgian Kings]], of the [[Kabardia|Kabardin lands]], of the [[Circassia]]n and [[Greater Caucasus|Mountain]] princes and many other states and lands western and eastern here and there and the successor and sovereign and ruler.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Named after [[Saint Peter|the apostle]], and described as a newborn as &quot;with good health, [[Natalya Naryshkina|his mother]]'s black, vaguely [[Tatar]] eyes, and a tuft of auburn hair&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Massie]], ''Peter the Great: His Life and World'' (1980), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; from an early age Peter's education (commissioned by his father, [[Tsar]] [[Alexis of Russia]]) was put in the hands of several tutors, most notably [[Nikita Zotov]], [[Patrick Gordon]], and [[Paul Menesius]]. On 29 January 1676, Tsar Alexis died, leaving the sovereignty to Peter's elder half-brother, the weak and sickly [[Feodor III of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt; Massie, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, the government was largely run by [[Artamon Matveev]], an enlightened friend of Alexis, the political head of the [[Naryshkin family]] and one of Peter's greatest childhood benefactors.

This position changed when Feodor died in 1682. As Feodor did not leave any children, a dispute arose between the Miloslavsky family ([[Maria Miloslavskaya]] was the first wife of Alexis I) and Naryshkin family ([[Natalya Naryshkina]] was the second wife) over who should inherit the throne. Peter's other half-brother, [[Ivan V of Russia]], was next in line for the throne, but he was chronically ill and of infirm mind. Consequently, the [[Boyar|Boyar Duma]] (a council of Russian nobles) chose the 10-year-old Peter to become Tsar with his mother as [[regent]].

[[File:Young Peter the Great parsuna.jpg|thumb|left|Peter the Great as a child]]
This arrangement was brought before the people of Moscow, as ancient tradition demanded, and was ratified. [[Sophia Alekseyevna|Sophia]], one of Alexis' daughters from his first marriage, led a [[Moscow Uprising of 1682|rebellion]] of the [[Streltsy]] (Russia's elite military corps) in April–May 1682. In the subsequent conflict, some of Peter's relatives and friends were murdered, including Matveev, and Peter witnessed some of these acts of political violence.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=214}}

The Streltsy made it possible for Sophia, the Miloslavskys (the clan of [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan]]) and their allies to insist that Peter and Ivan be proclaimed joint Tsars, with Ivan being acclaimed as the senior. [[Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Sophia]] acted as regent during the minority of the sovereigns and exercised all power. For seven years, she ruled as an autocrat. A large hole was cut in the back of the dual-seated throne used by Ivan and Peter. Sophia would sit behind the throne and listen as Peter conversed with nobles, while feeding him information and giving him responses to questions and problems. This throne can be seen in the [[Kremlin Armoury]] in Moscow.

Peter was not particularly concerned that others ruled in his name. He engaged in such pastimes as shipbuilding and sailing, as well as mock battles with his [[Toy army of Peter I|toy army]]. Peter's mother sought to force him to adopt a more conventional approach and arranged his marriage to [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]] in 1689.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=218}} The marriage was a failure, and ten years later Peter forced his wife to become a nun and thus freed himself from the union.

By the summer of 1689, Peter, then age 17, planned to take power from his half-sister [[Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Sophia]], whose position had been weakened by two unsuccessful [[Russo-Crimean Wars|Crimean campaigns]] against the [[Crimean Khanate]] in an attempt to stop devastating [[Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands|Crimean Tatar raids]] into Russia's southern lands. When she learned of his designs, Sophia conspired with some leaders of the Streltsy, who continually aroused disorder and dissent. Peter, warned by others from the Streltsy, escaped in the middle of the night to the impenetrable monastery of [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]]; there he slowly gathered adherents who perceived he would win the power struggle. Sophia was eventually overthrown, with Peter I and Ivan V continuing to act as co-tsars. Peter forced Sophia to enter a convent, where she gave up her name and her position as a member of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, (1980) pp 96–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RussianEmpire1700.png|thumb|The Tsardom of Russia, {{circa|1700}}]]
Still, Peter could not acquire actual control over Russian affairs. Power was instead exercised by his mother, Natalya Naryshkina. It was only when Natalya died in 1694 that Peter, now aged 22, became an independent sovereign.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=216}} Formally, Ivan V was a co-ruler with Peter, though being ineffective. Peter became the sole ruler when Ivan died in 1696, while Peter was 24 years old.

Peter grew to be extremely tall as an adult, especially for the time period. Standing at 6&amp;nbsp;ft 8 (203&amp;nbsp;cm) in height, the Russian tsar was literally head and shoulders above his contemporaries both in Russia and throughout Europe.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=216}} Peter, however, lacked the overall proportional heft and bulk generally found in a man that size. Both his hands and feet were small,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brewminate.com/peter-the-great-tsar-and-emperor/ |title=Peter the Great and the Territorial Expansion of Russia |last=Merriman |first=John |date=15 September 2008 |access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; other sources mention Peter's great strength and ability to break coins and bend silver plates with his bare hands.|date=February 2017}} and his shoulders were narrow for his height; likewise, his head was small for his tall body. Added to this were Peter's noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from ''[[absence seizure|petit mal]]'', a form of epilepsy.{{sfn|Hughes|2007|pp=179–82}}

During his youth, Peter befriended [[Patrick Gordon]], [[Franz Lefort]] and several other foreigners in Russian service and was a frequent guest in Moscow's [[German Quarter]], where he met his Dutch mistress [[Anna Mons]].

==Reign==
[[File:Capture of Azov 1696.png|thumb|''[[Azov campaigns|Capture of Azov]]'', 1696, by [[Robert Ker Porter]]]]

Peter implemented sweeping [[Economic reforms under Peter the Great|reforms]] aimed at [[Modernization|modernizing]] Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Evgenii V. Anisimov, ''The Reforms of Peter the Great: Progress Through Violence in Russia'' (Routledge, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by his advisors from Western Europe, Peter reorganized the Russian army along modern lines and dreamed of making Russia a [[maritime power]]. He faced much opposition to these policies at home but brutally suppressed rebellions against his authority, including by the [[Streltsy]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Astrakhan]], and the greatest civil uprising of his reign, the [[Bulavin Rebellion]].

Peter implemented social modernization in an absolute manner by introducing French and [[Western dress codes|western dress]] to his court and requiring courtiers, state officials, and the military to shave their beards and adopt modern clothing styles.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=221}} One means of achieving this end was the introduction of [[Beard tax#Russia|taxes for long beards]] and robes in September 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21889/21889-h/21889-h.htm|last=Abbott|first=Peter|title=Peter the Great|year=1902|publisher=Project Gutenberg online edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his process to westernize Russia, he wanted members of his family to marry other European royalty. In the past, his ancestors had been snubbed at the idea, but now, it was proving fruitful. He negotiated with [[Frederick William, Duke of Courland]] to marry his niece, [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna]]. He used the wedding in order to launch his new capital, [[St Petersburg]], where he had already ordered building projects of westernized palaces and buildings. Peter hired Italian and German architects to design it.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his reforms, Peter started an industrialization effort that was slow but eventually successful. Russian manufacturing and main exports were based on the mining and lumber industries. For example, by the end of the century Russia came to export more iron than any other country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Penguin history of the world|last=Roberts, J. M. (John Morris), 1928-2003|others=Westad, Odd Arne|isbn=978-1-84614-443-1|edition=Sixth revised|location=London|oclc=862761245|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve his nation's position on the seas, Peter sought to gain more maritime outlets. His only outlet at the time was the [[White Sea]] at [[Arkhangelsk]]. The [[Baltic Sea]] was at the time controlled by [[Sweden]] in the north, while the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] were controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Empire]] respectively in the south.

Peter attempted to acquire control of the Black Sea, which would require expelling the [[Tatars]] from the surrounding areas. As part of an agreement with [[Poland]] that ceded [[Kiev]] to Russia, Peter was forced to wage war against the [[Crimea]]n [[Crimean Khanate|Khan]] and against the Khan's overlord, the Ottoman Sultan. Peter's primary objective became the capture of the Ottoman fortress of [[Azov]], near the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. In the summer of 1695 Peter organized the [[Azov campaigns]] to take the fortress, but his attempts ended in failure.

Peter returned to Moscow in November 1695 and began building a large navy. He launched about thirty ships against the Ottomans in 1696, capturing Azov in July of that year. On 12 September 1698, Peter officially founded the first [[Russian Navy]] base, [[Taganrog]].

===Grand Embassy===
{{main|Grand Embassy of Peter the Great}}

[[File:Peter I by Kneller.jpg|thumb|180px|Portrait of Peter I by [[Godfrey Kneller]], 1698. This portrait was Peter's gift to the King of England.]]
Peter knew that Russia could not face the Ottoman Empire alone. In 1697, he traveled &quot;incognito&quot; to Western Europe on an 18-month journey with a large Russian delegation–the so-called [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|&quot;Grand Embassy&quot;]]. He used a fake name, allowing him to escape social and diplomatic events, but since he was far taller than most others, he did not fool anyone of importance. One goal was to seek the aid of European monarchs, but Peter's hopes were dashed. France was a traditional ally of the Ottoman Sultan, and [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] was eager to maintain peace in the east while conducting its own wars in the west. Peter, furthermore, had chosen an inopportune moment: the Europeans at the time were more concerned about the [[War of Spanish Succession]] over who would succeed the childless King [[Charles II of Spain]] than about fighting the Ottoman Sultan.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=218}}

The &quot;Grand Embassy&quot; continued nevertheless. While visiting the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], Peter learned much about life in Western Europe. He studied shipbuilding &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/peter-the-great-part-1-of-3-the-carpenter-czar/ Peter the Great: Part 1 of 3 (The Carpenter Czar)]. Radio Netherlands Archives. 8 June 1996. Retrieved 8 May 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zaandam]] (the house he lived in is now a museum, the [[Czar Peter House (Netherlands)|Czar Peter House]]) and [[Amsterdam]], where he visited, among others, the upper-class de Wilde family. [[Jacob de Wilde]], a collector-general with the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]], had a well-known collection of art and coins, and de Wilde's daughter [[Maria de Wilde]] made an engraving of the meeting between Peter and her father, providing visual evidence of &quot;the beginning of the West European classical tradition in Russia&quot;.{{sfn|Wes|1992|p=14}} According to Roger Tavernier, Peter the Great later acquired de Wilde's collection.{{sfn|Tavernier|2006|p=349}}

Thanks to the mediation of [[Nicolaes Witsen]], mayor of Amsterdam and expert on Russia, the Tsar was given the opportunity to gain practical experience in the largest shipyard in the world, belonging to the [[Dutch East India Company]], for a period of four months. The Tsar helped with the construction of an [[East Indiaman]] ship especially laid down for him: ''Peter and Paul''. During his stay the Tsar engaged many skilled workers such as builders of locks, fortresses, shipwrights, and seamen—including [[Cornelis Cruys]], a vice-admiral who became, under [[Franz Lefort]], the Tsar's advisor in maritime affairs. Peter later put his knowledge of shipbuilding to use in helping build Russia's navy.{{sfn|Massie|1980|pp=183–188}}  Peter paid a visit to surgeon [[Frederik Ruysch]], who taught him how to draw teeth and catch butterflies, and to [[Ludolf Bakhuysen]], a painter of seascapes. [[Jan van der Heyden]], the inventor of the fire hose, received Peter, who was keen to learn and pass on his knowledge to his countrymen. On 16 January 1698 Peter organized a farewell party and invited [[Joan Huydecoper II|Johan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen]], who had to sit between Lefort and the Tsar and drink.&lt;ref&gt;Petros Mirilas, et al. &quot;The monarch and the master: Peter the Great and Frederik Ruysch.&quot; ''Archives of Surgery'' 141.6 (2006): 602-606.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Peter met with King [[William III of England|William III]], visited [[Greenwich]] and [[Oxford]], posed for Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], and saw a [[Royal Navy]] [[Fleet Review]] at [[Deptford, London|Deptford]]. He studied the English techniques of city-building he would later use to great effect at [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Massie|1980|p=191}} When he left he gave the singer, and his mistress, [[Letitia Cross]] £500 to thank her for her hospitality.

He spoke with [[Augustus II the Strong]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Massie|1980|p=191}}

Peter's visit was cut short in 1698, when he was forced to rush home by a [[Streltsy Uprising|rebellion of the Streltsy]]. The rebellion was easily crushed before Peter returned home from England; of the Tsar's troops, only one was killed. Peter nevertheless acted ruthlessly towards the mutineers. Over one thousand two hundred of the rebels were tortured and executed, and Peter ordered that their bodies be publicly exhibited as a warning to future conspirators.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=220}} The Streltsy were disbanded, some of the rebels were deported to [[Siberia]], and the individual they sought to put on the Throne —
Peter's half-sister Sophia — was forced to become a nun.

In 1698, Peter sent a delegation to [[Malta]], under boyar [[Boris Sheremetev]], to observe the training and abilities of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] and their [[Navy of the Order of Saint John|fleet]]. Sheremetev investigated the possibility of future joint ventures with the Knights, including action against the Turks and the possibility of a future Russian naval base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.prestel.co.uk/church/oosj/timeline.htm|title=Russian Grand Priory&amp;nbsp;– Timeline|year=2004|accessdate=9 February 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208091353/http://www2.prestel.co.uk/church/oosj/timeline.htm|archivedate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's visits to the West impressed upon him the notion that European customs were in several respects superior to Russian traditions. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to wear European clothing and cut off their long beards, causing his Boyars, who were very fond of their beards, great upset.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyar beard article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.mn.ru/english/issue.php?2002-46-3 |title=Russia as an Empire |accessdate=21 March 2008 |author=O.L.

Peter also sought to end arranged marriages, which were the norm among the Russian nobility, because he thought such a practice was barbaric and led to domestic violence, since the partners usually resented each other.{{sfn|Dmytryshyn|1974|p=21}}

In 1699, Peter changed the date of the celebration of the new year from 1 September to 1 January. Traditionally, the years were reckoned from the purported [[Anno Mundi|creation of the World]], but after Peter's reforms, they were to be counted from the [[Anno Domini|birth of Christ]]. Thus, in the year 7207 of the old Russian calendar, Peter proclaimed that the [[Julian Calendar]] was in effect and the year was 1700.{{sfn|Oudard|1929|p=197}}

===Great Northern War===
{{Main|Great Northern War}}
Peter made a temporary peace with the Ottoman Empire that allowed him to keep the captured fort of Azov, and turned his attention to Russian maritime supremacy. He sought to acquire control of the Baltic Sea, which had been taken by the [[Swedish Empire]] a half-century earlier. Peter declared war on Sweden, which was at the time led by the young King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]. Sweden was also opposed by [[Denmark–Norway]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Russia was ill-prepared to fight the Swedes, and their first attempt at seizing the Baltic coast ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700. In the conflict, the forces of Charles XII, rather than employ a slow methodical siege, attacked immediately using a blinding snowstorm to their advantage. After the battle, Charles XII decided to concentrate his forces against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave Peter time to reorganize the Russian army.

While the Poles fought the Swedes, Peter founded the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1703, in [[Ingria|Ingermanland]] (a province of the [[Swedish Empire]] that he had captured). It was named after his patron saint [[Saint Peter]]. He forbade the building of stone edifices outside Saint Petersburg, which he intended to become Russia's capital, so that all stonemasons could participate in the construction of the new city. Between 1713 and 1728, and from 1732 to 1918, Saint Petersburg was the capital of imperial Russia.

Following several defeats, Polish King [[Augustus II the Strong]] abdicated in 1706. Swedish king Charles XII turned his attention to Russia, invading it in 1708. After crossing into Russia, Charles defeated Peter at [[Battle of Holowczyn|Golovchin]] in July. In the [[Battle of Lesnaya]], Charles suffered his first loss after Peter crushed a group of Swedish reinforcements marching from [[Riga]]. Deprived of this aid, Charles was forced to abandon his proposed march on Moscow.{{sfn|Massie|1980|p=453}}

Charles XII refused to retreat to Poland or back to Sweden and instead invaded [[Ukraine]]. Peter withdrew his army southward, employing [[scorched earth]], destroying along the way anything that could assist the Swedes. Deprived of local supplies, the Swedish army was forced to halt its advance in the winter of 1708–1709. In the summer of 1709, they resumed their efforts to capture [[Left-bank Ukraine|Russian-ruled Ukraine]], culminating in the [[Battle of Poltava]] on 27 June. The battle was a decisive defeat for the Swedish forces, ending Charles' campaign in Ukraine and forcing him south to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire. Russia had defeated what was considered to be one of the world's best militaries, and the victory overturned the view that Russia was militarily incompetent. In Poland, Augustus II was restored as King.

Peter, overestimating the support he would receive from his Balkan allies, attacked the Ottoman Empire, initiating the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)|Russo-Turkish War of 1710]].{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=224}}  Peter's campaign in the Ottoman Empire was disastrous, and in the ensuing [[Treaty of the Pruth]], Peter was forced to return the Black Sea ports he had seized in 1697.{{sfn|Riasanovsky|2000|p=224}} In return, the Sultan expelled Charles XII.

Normally, the Boyar Duma would have exercised power during his absence. Peter, however, mistrusted the boyars; he instead abolished the Duma and created a Senate of ten members. The Senate was founded as the highest state institution to supervise all judicial, financial and administrative affairs. Originally established only for the time of the monarch's absence, the Senate became a permanent body after his return. A special high official, the Ober-Procurator, served as the link between the ruler and the senate and acted, in Peter own words, as &quot;the sovereign's eye&quot;. Without his signature no Senate decision could go into effect; the Senate became one of the most important institutions of Imperial Russia.{{sfn|Palmer|Colton|1992|pp=242–43}}

Peter's northern armies took the Swedish province of [[Duchy of Livonia (1629–1721)|Livonia]] (the northern half of modern [[Latvia]], and the southern half of modern [[Estonia]]), driving the Swedes into [[Swedish Finland|Finland]]. In 1714 the Russian fleet won the [[Battle of Gangut]]. Most of Finland was [[Greater Wrath|occupied by the Russians]].

In 1716 and 1717, the Tsar revisited the Netherlands and went to see [[Herman Boerhaave]]. He continued his travel to the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and France. Peter obtained the assistance of the [[Electorate of Hanover]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The Tsar's navy was powerful enough that the Russians could penetrate Sweden. Still, Charles XII refused to yield, and not until his death in battle in 1718 did peace become feasible. After the battle near [[Åland]], Sweden made peace with all powers but Russia by 1720. In 1721, the [[Treaty of Nystad]] ended the Great Northern War. Russia acquired [[Ingria]], [[Reval Governorate|Estonia]], [[Riga Governorate|Livonia]], and a substantial portion of [[Old Finland|Karelia]]. In turn, Russia paid two million [[Riksdaler]] and surrendered most of Finland. The Tsar retained some Finnish lands close to Saint Petersburg, which he had made his capital in 1712.{{sfn|Cracraft|2003|p=37}}

All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the &quot;price&quot; and the &quot;value&quot; of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The &quot;value&quot; of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.

Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the &quot;quantity of labour&quot; to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the &quot;socially necessary labour time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 39 and &quot;Capital&quot; as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the &quot;exchange value&quot; of a given commodity.

'''Torquato Tasso''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|s|oʊ}} {{respell|TASS|oh}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|ɑː|s|oʊ}} {{respell|TAH|soh}}, {{IPA-it|torˈkwaːto ˈtasso|lang}}; 11 March 1544 – 25 April 1595) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, best known for his poem ''Gerusalemme liberata'' (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', 1581), in which he depicts a highly imaginative version of the combats between Christians and [[Muslims]] at the end of the [[First Crusade]], during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]]. Tasso suffered from mental illness and died a few days before he was due to be [[Poet laureate|crowned]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]] as the king of poets by [[Clement VIII|the Pope]]. His work was widely translated and adapted, and until the beginning of the 20th century, he remained one of the most widely read poets in Europe.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[Sorrento]], Torquato was the son of [[Bernardo Tasso]], a nobleman of [[Bergamo]] and an epic and lyric poet of considerable fame in his day, and his wife Porzia de Rossi, a noblewoman born in [[Naples]] of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] origins. His father had for many years been secretary in the service of [[Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno]], and his mother was closely connected with the most illustrious [[Naples|Neapolitan]] families. When, during the boy's childhood, the prince of Salerno came into collision with the Spanish government of Naples, being subsequently outlawed and deprived of his hereditary fiefs, Tasso's father shared his patron's fate. He was proclaimed a rebel to the state, along with his son Torquato, and his patrimony was sequestered. In 1552 Torquato was living with his mother and his only sister Cornelia at Naples, pursuing his education under the [[Jesuits]], who had recently opened a school there. The precocity of intellect and the religious fervour of the boy attracted general admiration. At the age of eight he was already famous.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after this date he was allowed to join his father, who then lived in great poverty and unemployment in exile in Rome. News reached them in 1556 that Porzia Tasso had died suddenly and mysteriously at Naples. Her husband was firmly convinced that she had been poisoned by her brother with the object of getting control over her property.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

As it subsequently happened, Porzia's estate never descended to her son; and the daughter Cornelia married below her birth, at the instigation of her maternal relatives. Tasso's father was a poet by predilection and a professional courtier. Therefore, when an opening at the court of [[Urbino]] was offered in 1557, Bernardo Tasso gladly accepted it.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The young Torquato, a handsome and brilliant lad, became the companion in sports and studies of [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere|Francesco Maria della Rovere]], heir to the duke of Urbino. At Urbino a society of cultivated men pursued the aesthetic and literary studies which were then in vogue. Bernardo Tasso read [[canto]]s of his poem ''[[L'Amadigi]]'' to the duchess and her ladies, or discussed the merits of [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], [[Gian Giorgio Trissino|Trissino]] and [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], with the duke's librarians and secretaries. Torquato grew up in an atmosphere of refined luxury and somewhat pedantic criticism, both of which gave a permanent tone to his character.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

At [[Venice]], where his father went to superintend the printing of his own epic, ''Amadigi'' (1560), these influences continued. He found himself the pet and prodigy of a distinguished literary circle but Bernardo had suffered in his own career so seriously from dependence on his writings and the nobility, that he now determined on a lucrative profession for his son. Torquato was sent to study law at [[Padua]]. Instead of applying himself to law, the young man bestowed all his attention upon philosophy and poetry. Before the end of 1562, he had produced a twelve-canto epic poem called ''Rinaldo'', which was meant to combine the regularity of the Virgilian with the attractions of the romantic [[Epic poetry|epic]]. In the attainment of this object, and in all the minor qualities of style and handling, ''Rinaldo'' showed marked originality, although other parts seem unfinished and betray the haste in which the poem was composed. Nevertheless, its author was recognized as the most promising young poet of his time. The flattered father allowed the work to be printed; and, after a short period of study at [[Bologna]], he consented to his son's entering the service of Cardinal [[Luigi d'Este]]. Even before that date, the young Tasso had been a frequent visitor at the Este court in [[Ferrara]], where in 1561 he had encountered Lucrezia Bendidio, one of Eleanora d'Este's ladies-in-waiting, and fallen in love with her. She became the addressee of his first series of love sonnets, to be followed in 1563 by Laura Peperara, the next object of Tasso's affections. (Both Lucrezia and Laura had in the meantime become well known singers, and for a while Tasso seems to have courted them both.)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

[[File:Castello ferrara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Castello degli Estensi, Ferrara.]]

===France and Ferrara===
From 1565, Tasso's life was centered on the castle at Ferrara, the scene of many later glories and cruel sufferings. After the publication of ''Rinaldo'' he had expressed his views upon the epic in some ''Discourses on the Art of Poetry'', which committed him to a distinct theory and gained for him the additional celebrity of a philosophical critic. The next five years seem to have been the happiest of Tasso's life, although his father's death in 1569 caused his affectionate nature profound pain. Young, handsome, accomplished in all the exercises of a well-bred gentleman, accustomed to the society of the great and learned, illustrious by his published works in [[Poetry|verse]] and prose, he became the idol of the most brilliant court in Italy. The first two books of his five-hundred-odd love poems were addressed to [[Lucrezia Bendidio]] and [[Laura Peverara]]. The princesses [[Lucrezia d'Este (1535-1598)|Lucrezia]] and [[Eleonora d'Este (1537–1581)|Eleonora d'Este]], both unmarried, both his seniors by about ten years, took him under their protection. He was admitted to their familiarity. He owed much to the constant kindness of both sisters. In 1570 he traveled to Paris with the cardinal.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Frankness of speech and a certain habitual want of tact caused a disagreement with his worldly patron. He left France next year, and took service under [[Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke Alfonso II of Ferrara]], the Cardinal's brother. The most important events in Tasso's biography during the following four years are the completion of ''[[Aminta]]'' in 1573 and ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Gerusalemme Liberata]]'' in 1574. ''Aminta'' is a [[pastoral]] drama of very simple plot, but of exquisite lyrical charm. It appeared at the moment when music, under the influence of composers like [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Luca Marenzio|Marenzio]] and others, was becoming the dominant art of Italy. The honeyed melodies and sensuous melancholy of ''Aminta'' exactly suited and interpreted the spirit of its age. Its influence, in opera and [[cantata]], was felt through two successive centuries. ''Aminta'', played by courtiers in an island of [[River Po|Po river]] where the duke had his ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Giardino di delizie]]'', was first printed by Aldo Manuzio in Venice in January 1581. A [[Croat language|Croatian]] translation of ''Aminta'' by the poet [[Dominko Zlatarić]], ''Ljubmir, pripovijest pastijerska'', was printed one year before the original, also in Venice.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===The ''Gerusalemme Liberata''===
The ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Gerusalemme Liberata]]'' or ''Jerusalem Delivered'' occupies a larger space in the history of European literature, and is a more considerable work. Yet the commanding qualities of this epic poem, those which revealed Tasso's individuality, and which made it immediately pass into the rank of classics, beloved by the people no less than by persons of culture, are akin to the lyrical graces of ''[[Aminta]]''.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In the ''Gerusalemme Liberata'', as in the ''Rinaldo'', Tasso aimed at ennobling the Italian epic style by preserving strict unity of plot and heightening poetic diction. He chose Virgil for his model, took the [[first crusade]] for subject, infused the fervor of religion into his conception of the hero, Godfrey. But his natural bent was for romance.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

As he had done in ''Rinaldo,'' Tasso adorned ''Gerusalemme Liberata'' with a number of romantic episodes, which have proved more popular and influential than the grand sweep of the main theme. Thus, while the nominal hero of ''Gerusalemme Liberata'' is [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (&quot;Goffredo&quot;), the leader of the First Crusade and the climax of the epic is the capture of the holy city. But Tasso's Goffredo, who is a mixture of Virgil's pious [[Aeneas]] and [[Counter-Reformation|Tridentine]] Catholicism, is not the real hero of the epic. Instead, the reader is attracted to the stories of Ruggiero, fiery and passionate Rinaldo, melancholy and impulsive Tancredi, and also by the chivalrous [[Saracens]] with whom they clash in love and war.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The action of the epic turns on three stories of interaction between noble beautiful pagan women and these Crusaders. ''[[Armida]]'', a beautiful witch, is sent forth by the infernal senate to sow discord in the Christian camp. Instead, she is converted to the true faith by her adoration for a crusading knight, and quits the scene with a phrase of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] on her lips. Clorinda, a brave female warrior, dons armor like Ariosto's [[Marfisa]], fights a duel with her devoted lover, and receives baptism at his hands as she lies dying. Finally, Erminia, hopelessly in love with Tancredi, seeks refuge in the shepherds' hut.

These stories rivet the reader's attention, while the battles, religious ceremonies, conclaves and stratagems of the campaign are less engaging. Tasso's great invention as an artist was the poetry of sentiment. Sentiment, not sentimentality, gives value to what is immortal in the ''Gerusalemme''. It was a new thing in the 16th century, something concordant with a growing feeling for woman and with the ascendant art of music. This sentiment, refined, noble, natural, steeped in melancholy, exquisitely graceful, pathetically touching, breathes throughout the episodes of the ''Gerusalemme'', finds [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] expression in the languishing cadence of its mellifluous verse, and sustains the ideal life of those seductive heroines whose names were familiar as household words to all Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The epic was finished in Tasso's thirty-first year; when the manuscripts lay before him the best part of his life was over, his best work had been already accomplished.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Troubles immediately began to gather round him. Instead of having the courage to obey his own instinct, and to publish the ''Gerusalemme'' as he had conceived it, he yielded to the excessive scrupulosity which formed a feature of his [[paranoia|paranoid]] character. The poem was sent in manuscript to a large committee of eminent literary men, Tasso expressing his willingness to hear their strictures and to adopt their suggestions unless he could convert them to his own views. The result was that each of these candid friends, while expressing in general high admiration for the epic, took some exception to its plot, its title, its moral tone, its episodes or its diction, in detail. One wished it to be more regularly classical; another wanted more romance. One hinted that the [[Inquisition]] would not tolerate its supernatural machinery; another demanded the excision of its most charming passages, the loves of ''Armida'', ''Clorinda'' and ''Erminia''. Tasso had to defend himself against all these ineptitudes and pedantries, and to accommodate his practice to the theories he had rashly expressed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Tasso's self-chosen critics were not men to admit what the public has since accepted as incontrovertible. They vaguely felt that a great and beautiful romantic poem was imbedded in a dull and not very correct epic. In their uneasiness they suggested every course but the right one, which was to publish the ''Gerusalemme'' without further dispute.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Tasso, already overworked by his precocious studies, by exciting court-life and exhausting literary industry, now grew almost mad with worry. His health began to fail him. He complained of headache, suffered from [[malaria|malarious]] fevers, and wished to leave Ferrara. The ''Gerusalemme'' was laid in manuscript upon a shelf. He opened negotiations with the court of [[Florence]] for an exchange of service. This irritated the duke of Ferrara. Alfonso hated nothing more than to see courtiers (especially famous ones) leave him for a rival duchy. Moreover, Alfonso was married to a [[Huguenots|French Calvinist]] princess and thus justly worried about antagonizing the more orthodox powers in Italy, concentrated in Florence and Rome.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Difficult relationships in the Court of Ferrara===
[[File:Girolamo da Carpi 002.jpg|right|thumb|176px|Alfonso II d'Este, portrait by [[Girolamo da Carpi]] ]]
Alfonso thought, moreover, that, if Tasso were allowed to go, the [[Medici]] would get the coveted dedication of that already famous epic. Therefore, he bore with the poet's humors, and so contrived that the latter should have no excuse for quitting Ferrara. Meanwhile, through the years 1575, 1576 and 1577, Tasso's health grew worse.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Jealousy inspired the courtiers to malign and insult him. His irritable and suspicious temper, vain and sensitive to slights, rendered him only too easy a prey to their malevolence.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In the course of the 1570s Tasso developed a persecution mania which led to legends about the restless, half-mad, and misunderstood author.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

He became consumed by thoughts that his servants betrayed his confidence, fancied he had been denounced to the [[Inquisition]], and expected daily to be poisoned. Literary and political events surrounding him contributed to upsets and the mental state, with troubles, stress and social troubles escalating.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In the autumn of 1576 Tasso quarrelled with a Ferrarese gentleman, Maddalo, who had talked too freely about some same-sex love affair; the same year he wrote a letter to his homosexual friend Luca Scalabrino dealing with his own love for a 21-year-old young man Orazio Ariosto;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon. ''Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|&quot;I love him, and I'm ready to love him for several months, because the impression of this love into my soul is too much strong, and is impossible to erase it in a few days... I call my feeling 'love' and not just affection, because after all love it is. I wasn't aware of that before, because I didn't yet feel inside me none of those sexual appetites that love generally awakes, not even when we were in bed together. But now I clearly perceive that I have been and is not a friend, but a quite honest lover, because I feel a terrible pain, not only because he doesn't respond to my love, but also because I can't talk with him with that freedom I was used to, and being far from him pains me very much.&quot; Giovannai Dall'Orto: Torquato Tasso}}&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Solerti. ''Vita di Torquato Tasso'', Loescher, Torino-Roma 1895, vol. 1, pp. 247–250&lt;/ref&gt; in the summer of 1577 he drew his knife upon a servant in the presence of Lucrezia d'Este, duchess of [[Urbino]]. For this excess he was arrested; but the duke released him, and took him for a change of air to his country seat of [[Villa Belriguardo]]. What happened there is not known. Some biographers have surmised that a compromising liaison with Leonora d'Este came to light, and that Tasso agreed to feign madness in order to cover her honor, but of this there is no proof. It is only certain that from Belriguardo he returned to a Franciscan convent at Ferrara, for the express purpose of attending to his health. There the dread of being murdered by the duke took firm hold on his mind. He escaped at the end of July, disguised himself as a peasant, and went on foot to his sister at Sorrento.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The conclusions were that Tasso, after the beginning of 1575, became the victim of a mental malady, which, without amounting to actual insanity, rendered him fantastical and insupportable, a cause of anxiety to his patrons.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

There is no evidence whatsoever for the later romantic myth that this state of things was due to an overwhelming passion for Leonora. The duke, contrary to his image as a tyrant, showed considerable forbearance. Though a rigid and unsympathetic man, as egotistical as any princeling of his era, to Tasso he was never cruel; unintelligent perhaps, but far from being that monster of ferocity as which was later portrayed. The subsequent history of his connection with the poet corroborates this view.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

While with his sister at Sorrento, Tasso yearned for Ferrara. The court-made man could not breathe freely outside its charmed circle. He wrote humbly requesting to be taken back. Alfonso consented, provided Tasso would agree to undergo a medical course of treatment for his melancholy. When he returned, which he did with alacrity under those conditions, he was well received by the ducal family.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

All might have gone well if his old maladies had not revived. Scene followed scene of irritability, moodiness, suspicion, wounded vanity and violent outbursts.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===In the madhouse of St. Anna===
In the summer of 1578 he ran away again; traveled through [[Mantua]], Padua, Venice, Urbino, [[Lombardy]]. In September he reached the gates of [[Turin]] on foot, and was courteously entertained by [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]]. Wherever he went, wandering like the world's rejected guest, he met with the honor due to his illustrious name. Great folk opened their houses to him gladly, partly in compassion, partly in admiration of his genius. But he soon wearied of their society, and wore their kindness thin by his querulous peevishness. It seemed, moreover, that life was intolerable to him outside Ferrara. Accordingly, he once more opened negotiations with the duke; and in February 1579 he again set foot in the castle.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Alfonso was about to contract his third marriage, this time with a princess of the house of [[Mantua]]. He had no children, and unless he got an heir, there was a probability that his state would fall, as in fact it eventually did, to the [[Holy See]]. The nuptial festivals, on the eve of which Tasso arrived, were not therefore an occasion of great rejoicing for the elderly bridegroom. As a forlorn hope he had to wed a third wife; but his heart was not engaged and his expectations were far from sanguine.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Tasso, preoccupied as always with his own sorrows and his own sense of dignity, made no allowance for the troubles of his master. Rooms below his rank, he thought, had been assigned him; the Duke was engaged. Without exercising common patience, or giving his old friends the benefit of a doubt, he broke into terms of open abuse, behaved like a lunatic, and was sent off without ceremony to the madhouse of St. Anna. This happened in March 1579; and there he remained until July 1586. Duke Alfonso's long-sufferance at last had given way. He firmly believed that Tasso was insane, and he felt that if he were so St. Anna was the safest place for him.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

After the first few months of his incarceration he obtained spacious apartments, received the visits of friends, went abroad attended by responsible persons of his acquaintance, and was allowed to correspond freely with others. The letters written from St. Anna to the princes and cities of Italy, to warm well-wishers, and to men of the highest reputation in the world of art and learning, form the most valuable source of information, not only on his then condition, but also on his temperament at large. It is singular that he spoke always respectfully, even affectionately, of the Duke.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Some critics have attempted to make it appear that he was hypocritically kissing the hand which had chastised him, with the view of being released from prison, but no one who has impartially considered the whole tone and tenor of his epistles will adopt this opinion. What emerges clearly from them is that he labored under a serious mental disease, and that he was conscious of it.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

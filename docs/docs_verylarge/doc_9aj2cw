[[File:Aurora x-plane 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|An artist's conception of the Aurora aircraft]]

'''Aurora''' was a rumored mid-1980s American [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a [[myth]].&lt;ref name= asw&gt;[http://aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/recon/aurora &quot;Aurora, Strategic Reconnaissance.&quot;]  ''AerospaceWeb.org.'' Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aurora Myth.&quot; ''Aerospace Daily'', 9 October 1990, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site ''Aerospaceweb.org'' concluded, &quot;The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government's position.&quot;&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

Former [[Skunk Works]] director [[Ben Rich]] confirmed that &quot;Aurora&quot; was simply a myth in ''Skunk Works'' (1994), a book detailing his days as the director. Rich wrote that a colonel working in [[the Pentagon]] arbitrarily assigned the name &quot;Aurora&quot; to the funding for the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Skunk Works&quot; p. 309 Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Others come to different conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evidence Points to Stealth Spy Plane.&quot; ''High Technology Business'', April 1988, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, veteran [[black project]] watcher and aviation writer [[Bill Sweetman]] said, &quot;Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;&gt;Sweetman, Bill. [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviationspace/95e16f096bd8d010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html &quot;Secret Warplanes of Area 51.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706051254/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/aviationspace/95e16f096bd8d010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |date= 6 July 2007 }} ''Popular Science'', 4 June 2006. Retrieved: 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Aurora legend started in March 1990, when ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' magazine broke the news that the term &quot;Aurora&quot; had been inadvertently included in the 1985 U.S. budget, as an allocation of $455 million for &quot;black aircraft production&quot; in [[Fiscal year|FY]] 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060823172040/http://www.aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/aircraft/black/aurora/aurora5.htm &quot;Aurora Timeline.&quot;] ''aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk,'' 29 September 2006 via ''webarchive''. Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Aviation Week'', ''Project Aurora'' referred to a group of exotic aircraft, and not to one particular [[airframe]]. Funding of the project allegedly reached $2.3 billion in fiscal 1987, according to a 1986 procurement document obtained by ''Aviation Week''. In the 1994 book ''Skunk Works'', [[Ben Rich]], the former head of Lockheed's [[Skunk Works]] division, wrote that the Aurora was the budgetary code name for the stealth bomber fly-off that resulted in the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skunk works&quot;&gt;Rich and Janos 1996, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
By the late 1980s many aerospace industry observers believed that the U.S. had the technological capability to build a [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 ([[hypersonic speed]]) replacement for the aging [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]]. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into [[black project]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Skunk Works Revenues Point to Active Aurora Program, Kemper Says.&quot; ''Aerospace Daily'', 17 July 1992, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped contrails, sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these as a way of explaining the observations.&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

===British sighting claims===
In late August 1989, while working as an engineer on the jack-up barge ''GSF Galveston Key'' in the [[North Sea]], Chris Gibson and another witness saw an unfamiliar [[isosceles triangle]]-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] and accompanied by a pair of [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] fighter-bombers. Gibson and his girlfriend watched the aircraft for several minutes, until they went out of sight. He subsequently drew a sketch of the formation.

When the sighting was made public in 1992, the British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]] was told, &quot;There is no knowledge in the MoD of a 'black' programme of this nature, although it would not surprise the relevant desk officers in the Air Staff and Defence Intelligence Staff if it did exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randerson, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jun/24/freedomofinformation.usnews &quot;Is it a bird? Is it a spaceship? No, it's a secret US spy plane.&quot;] ''The Guardian,'' 24 June 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crash at [[MoD Boscombe Down|RAF Boscombe Down]] in [[Wiltshire]] on 26 September 1994 appeared closely linked to &quot;black&quot; missions, according to a report in ''AirForces Monthly''. Further investigation was hampered by USAF aircraft flooding into the base. [[Special Air Service]] personnel arrived in plainclothes and an [[Agusta 109]]. The crash site was protected from view by fire engines and tarpaulins and the base was closed to all flights soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind19970314&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bellamy |first=Christopher |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/secret-us-spyplane-crash-may-be-kept-under-wraps-1272714.html |title=Secret US spyplane crash may be kept under wraps |date=1997-03-14 |work=The Independent |access-date=2020-03-09 |last2=Walker |first2=Timothy |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamlandresort.com/black_projects/boscombe.htm &quot;RAF Boscombe Down's Black Day.&quot;] ''dreamlandresort.com.''

An unsubstantiated claim on the Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was heard over the village in July 2002. In 2005 the information was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horstedkeynes.com/aurora.html|title=Spy Plane Over Horsted Keynes|work=horstedkeynes.com|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. sighting claims===
A series of unusual [[sonic boom]]s was detected in [[Southern California]] beginning in mid-to-late 1991 and recorded by [[United States Geological Survey]] [[seismometer|sensor]]s across Southern California used to pinpoint [[earthquake]] [[epicenter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Edmund. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-17/local/me-607_1_spy-plane &quot;Secret Is Out on 'Quakes': It's a Spy Plane&quot;], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 17 April 1992. Retrieved: 29 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The sonic booms were characteristic of a smaller vehicle, rather than of the 37-meter long [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]. Furthermore, neither the Shuttle nor [[NASA]]'s single SR-71B was operating on the days the booms had been registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.area51zone.com/aircraft/aurora.shtml &quot;Aurora.&quot;] ''area51zone.com,'' 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, ''&quot;In Plane Sight?&quot;'' which appeared in the ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' on 3 July 1992 (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13), one of the seismologists, Jim Mori, noted: &quot;We can't tell anything about the vehicle. They seem stronger than other sonic booms that we record once in a while. They've all come on Thursday mornings about the same time, between 4 and 7.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aemann.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Former NASA [[sonic boom]] expert Dom Maglieri studied the 15-year-old sonic boom data from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and has deemed that the data showed &quot;something at 90,000&amp;nbsp;ft (c. 27&amp;nbsp;km), Mach 4 to Mach 5.2&quot;. He also said the booms did not look like those from aircraft that had traveled through the atmosphere many miles away at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], rather, they appeared to be booms from a high-altitude aircraft directly above the ground moving at high speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, Bill. [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A3b8e5ffb-467d-4030-9b63-d3f52cea5a4e &quot;Boom, Why Does O.C.

Retrieved: 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The boom signatures of the two different aircraft patterns are wildly different.&lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot; /&gt; There was nothing particular to tie these events to any aircraft, but they served to increase the number of stories about the Aurora.

On 23 March 1992, near [[Amarillo, Texas]], Steven Douglass photographed the &quot;donuts on a rope&quot; [[contrail]] and linked this sighting to distinctive sounds. He described the engine noise as: &quot;strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the house and made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses.&quot; In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive contrail previously reported by many, the significance of this sighting was enhanced by Douglass' reports of intercepts of radio transmissions: &quot;Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign &quot;Dragnet 51&quot; from [[Tinker Air Force Base|Tinker AFB]], [[Oklahoma]], and two unknown aircraft using the call signs &quot;Darkstar November&quot; and &quot;Darkstar Mike&quot;. Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the &quot;pulser&quot; that had just flown over Amarillo.&quot; (&quot;Darkstar&quot; is also a call sign of [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft from a different squadron at Tinker AFB)&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 11 May 1992, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, radio enthusiasts in California monitoring [[Edwards Air Force Base|Edwards AFB]] Radar (callsign &quot;Joshua Control&quot;) heard early morning radio transmissions between Joshua and a high flying aircraft using the callsign &quot;Gaspipe&quot;. &quot;You're at 67,000 feet, 81 miles out&quot; was heard, followed by &quot;70 miles out now, 36,000 ft, above glideslope.&quot; As in the past, nothing linked these observations to any particular aircraft or program, but the attribution to the Aurora helped expand the legend.

In February 1994, a former resident of Rachel, Nevada, and Area 51 enthusiast, Chuck Clark, claimed to have filmed the Aurora taking off from the [[Area 51|Groom Lake facility]]. In the David Darlington book ''[[Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles]]'', he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I even saw the Aurora take off one night – or an aircraft that matched the Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off and that was the last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base.&quot; I asked when this had taken place. &quot;February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero – probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV.&quot; The author then asked, &quot;Where's the tape?&quot; &quot;Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Darlington, David.

By 1996, reports associated with the Aurora name dropped off in frequency, suggesting to people who believed that the aircraft existed that it had only ever been a prototype or that it had had a short service life.&lt;ref name= asw /&gt;

In 2000, ''[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|Aberdeen Press and Journal]]'' writer Nic Outterside wrote a piece on US stealth technology in Scotland. Citing confidential &quot;sources&quot;, he alleged [[RAF Machrihanish|RAF/USAF Machrihanish]] in Kintyre, Argyll to be a base for Aurora aircraft. Machrihanish's almost {{convert |2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} long runway makes it suitable for high-altitude and experimental aircraft with the fenced-off coastal approach making it ideal for takeoffs and landings to be made well away from eyes or cameras of press and public.  &quot;Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick,&quot; Outterside says, &quot;also tracked fast-moving radar blips. It was claimed by staff that a 'hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion' for the readings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2002/04/27889.html |title=Latest U.S. Stealth Technology Moves to Western Scotland|publisher= Indy media |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, aviation writer Bill Sweetman put together 20 years of examining budget &quot;holes&quot;, unexplained sonic booms, as well as the Gibson sighting and concluded:

{{Quote |This evidence helps establish the program's initial existence. My investigations continue to turn up evidence that suggests current activity. For example, having spent years sifting through military budgets, tracking untraceable dollars and code names, I learned how to sort out where money was going. This year, when I looked at the Air Force operations budget in detail, I found a $9-billion black hole that seems a perfect fit for a project like Aurora.&lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot; /&gt;}}

In June 2017, ''Aviation Week'' reported that Rob Weiss, the General Manager of the Skunk Works, provided some confirmation of a research project and stated that [[hypersonic flight]] technology was now mature, and efforts were underway to fly an aircraft with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/skunk-works-hints-sr-72-demonstrator-progress |title= Skunk Works Hints at SR-72 Demonstrator Progress |work = Aviation Week|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead and silver were discovered in the southern part of the Groom Range in 1864,&lt;ref name=&quot;nevada-bureau&quot;&gt;[http://www.nbmg.unr.edu/dox/r44.pdf Mineral resources of the Pahranagat Range 30' by 60' quadrangle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415145449/http://www.nbmg.unr.edu/dox/r44.pdf |date=April 15, 2012 }}, Joseph V. Tingley, Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, [[University of Nevada, Reno]], 1989, retrieved June 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[England|English]] Groome Lead Mines Limited company financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s, giving the district its name (nearby mines included Maria, Willow and White Lake). The mining claims in Groom were acquired by J. B. Osborne and partners and patented in 1876, and Osborne's son acquired the interests in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;unr-guide-groom-mining&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dewey.library.unr.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/99-19-ead.xml|title=A Guide to the Records of The Groom Mining District Collection No. 99-19|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were proved in 1916 when two companies began working their mines; that work continued until 1918, and resuming after [[World War II]] until the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;unr-guide-groom-mining&quot;/&gt;

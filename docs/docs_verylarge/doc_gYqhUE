Due to the numbers of large freshwater lakes and length of shoreline in Canada, various provinces and territories have ferry services.

[[BC Ferries]] operates the third largest ferry service in the world which carries travellers between [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[British Columbia]] mainland on the country's west coast. This ferry service operates to other islands including the [[Gulf Islands]] and [[Haida Gwaii]]. In 2015, BC Ferries carried more than 8 million vehicles and 20 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcferries.com/files/AboutBCF/AR/BCFS_AnnualReport_2015-2016.pdf|title=Annual Report 2015–2016 : British Columbia Ferry Service Inc. &amp; B. C. Ferry Authority|website=Bcferries.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's east coast has been home to numerous inter- and intra-provincial ferry and coastal services, including a large network operated by the federal government under [[CN Marine]] and later [[Marine Atlantic]].  Private and publicly owned ferry operations in eastern Canada include Marine Atlantic, serving the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], as well as [[Bay Ferries|Bay]], [[Northumberland Ferries Limited|NFL]], [[Coopérative de transport maritime et aérien|CTMA]], [[Coastal Transport Limited|Coastal Transport]], and [[Société des traversiers du Québec|STQ]].  Canadian waters in the [[Great Lakes]] once hosted numerous ferry services, but these have been reduced to those offered by [[Owen Sound Transportation Company Limited|Owen Sound Transportation]] and several smaller operations.  There are also several commuter passenger ferry services operated in major cities, such as [[Metro Transit (Halifax)|Metro Transit]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Toronto Island ferries]] in Toronto and [[SeaBus]] in Vancouver.

[[File:Washington State Ferry 6415.JPG|thumb|The ''[[MV Spokane]]'' sailing from [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]] to [[Kingston, Washington|Kingston]], one of ten routes served by [[Washington State Ferries]].]]
[[Washington State Ferries]] operates the most extensive ferry system in the continental United States and the second largest in the world by vehicles carried, with ten routes on [[Puget Sound]] and the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] serving [[Ferry terminal|terminals]] in Washington and Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/61B38EF5-0E39-420D-84F8-582A6A6CF476/0/WSFFactSheet2016_FINAL.pdf|title=WSDOT Ferries Division : Nation's Largest Ferry System|date=December 2016|website=Wsdot.wa.gov|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221120608/https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/61B38EF5-0E39-420D-84F8-582A6A6CF476/0/WSFFactSheet2016_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=21 February 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Washington State Ferries carried 10.5 million vehicles and 24.2 million riders in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/traffic_stats/annualpdf/2016.pdf|title=Washington State Ferries : Traffic Statistics Rider Segment report|date=2016|website=Wsdot.wa.gov|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Marine Highway|Alaska Marine Highway System]] provides service between Bellingham, Washington and various towns and villages throughout Southeast and Southwest Alaska, including crossings of the [[Gulf of Alaska]].  AMHS provides affordable access to many small communities with no road connection or airport.

The [[Staten Island Ferry]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York City]], sailing between the boroughs of [[Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island]], is the nation's single busiest ferry route by passenger volume. Unlike riders on many other ferry services, Staten Island Ferry passengers do not pay any fare to ride it. New York City also has a network of smaller ferries, or ''water taxis'', that shuttle commuters along the [[Hudson River]] from locations in [[New Jersey]] and Northern [[Manhattan]] down to the midtown, downtown and Wall Street business centers. Several ferry companies also offer service linking midtown and lower Manhattan with locations in the boroughs of [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]], crossing the city's [[East River]]. New York City Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] announced in February 2015 that city would begin an expanded Citywide Ferry Service some time in 2017 linking heretofore relatively isolated communities such as [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]] in [[The Bronx]], [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] and [[Rockaway, Queens|the Rockaways]] in [[Queens]] and such [[Brooklyn]] neighborhoods as [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], and [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] with existing ferry landings in [[Lower Manhattan]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]]. This service was finally launched as [[NYC Ferry]] in May, 2017.

The [[New Orleans]] area also has many ferries in operation that carry both vehicles and pedestrians. Most notable is the Algiers Ferry. This service has been in continuous operation since 1827 and is one of the oldest operating ferries in North America.

In New England, vehicle-carrying ferry services between mainland [[Cape Cod]] and the islands of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket]] are operated by [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]], which sails year-round between [[Woods Hole]] and [[Vineyard Haven]] as well as [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]] and [[Nantucket]]. Seasonal service is also operated from Woods Hole to [[Oak Bluffs]] from Memorial Day to Labor Day. As there are no bridges or tunnels connecting the islands to the mainland, The Steamship Authority ferries in addition to being the only method for transporting private cars to or from the islands, also serves as the only link by which heavy freight and supplies such as food and gasoline can be trucked to the islands. Additionally, [[Hy-Line Cruises]] operates high speed catamaran service from Hyannis to both islands, as well as traditional ferries, and several smaller operations run seasonal passenger only service primarily geared towards tourist [[day-tripper]]s from other mainland ports, including [[New Bedford, MA|New Bedford]], (New Bedford Fast Ferry) [[Falmouth, MA|Falmouth]], (Island Queen ferry and Falmouth Ferry) and [[Harwich, MA|Harwich]] (Freedom Cruise Line). Ferries also bring riders and vehicles across [[Long Island Sound]] to such [[Connecticut]] cities as [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], and to [[Block Island]] in [[Rhode Island]] from points on [[Long Island]].

Transbay commuting in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was primarily ferry based until the advent of automobiles in the 1940s and most bridges in the area were built to supplant ferry services. By the 1970s, ferries were primarily used by tourists with [[Golden Gate Ferry]], an organization under the ownership as the same governing body as the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], left as the sole commute operator. The [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] prompted restoration of service to the [[East Bay]]. The modern ferry network is primarily under the authority of [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]], connecting with cities as far as [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Tourist excursions are also offered by [[Blue &amp; Gold Fleet]] and [[Red &amp; White Fleet]]. A ferry serves [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] (which also accepts private craft). [[Alcatraz]] is served exclusively by ferry service administered by the [[National Park Service]].
{{main|Ferries of San Francisco Bay}}

Until the completion of the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in the 1950s, ferries were used for vehicle transportation between the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsulas]] of [[Michigan]], across the [[Straits of Mackinac]] in the United States.  Ferry service for [[bicycles]] and passengers continues across the straits for transport to [[Mackinac Island]], where motorized vehicles are almost completely prohibited. This crossing is made possible by three ferry lines, [[Arnold Transit Company]], [[Shepler's Ferry]], and [[Star Line Ferry]].

A ferry service runs between [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and [[Muskegon, Michigan]] operated by [[Lake Express]]. Another ferry [[SS Badger]] operates between [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] and [[Ludington, Michigan]]. Both cross [[Lake Michigan]].

Mexico has ferry services run by [[Baja Ferries]] that connect [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] located on the Baja California Peninsula with [[Mazatlán]] and [[Topolobampo]]. Passenger ferries also run from [[Playa del Carmen]] to the island of [[Cozumel]].

North Carolina is home to the second-largest ferry system in the United States.

In Australia, two [[Spirit of Tasmania]] ferries carry passengers and vehicles {{convert|450|km}} across [[Bass Strait]], the body of water that separates [[Tasmania]] from the Australian mainland, often under turbulent sea conditions.  These run overnight but also include day crossings in peak time.  Both ferries are based in the northern Tasmanian port city of [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]] and sail to [[Melbourne]]

In [[Hong Kong]], [[Star Ferry]] carry passengers across [[Victoria Harbour]]. Other carriers ferry travellers between Hong Kong Island and outlying islands like [[Cheung Chau]], [[Lantau Island]] and [[Lamma Island]].

The [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Penang]] is home to the oldest ferry service in the country. This service, now renamed [[Rapid Ferry]], connects the [[Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal]] at [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]] in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] on [[Penang Island]] with the [[Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal]] in [[Butterworth, Penang|Butterworth]] on [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. It has also become a tourist attraction among foreigners.

[[Water transport in Mumbai]] consists of ferries, hovercraft, and catamarans, operated by various government agencies as well as private entities. The [[Kerala State Water Transport Department]] (SWTD), operating under the Ministry of Transport, [[Government of Kerala]], [[India]] regulates the inland navigation systems in the Indian state of [[Kerala]] and provides inland water transport facilities. It stands for catering to the passenger and cargo traffic needs of the inhabitants of the waterlogged areas of the Districts of [[Alappuzha]], [[Kottayam]], [[Kollam]], [[Ernakulam]], [[Kannur]] and [[Kasargode]]. SWTD ferry service is also one of the most affordable modes to enjoy the beauty of the scenic [[Kerala backwaters]].

==Types==
Ferry designs depend on the length of the route, the passenger or vehicle capacity required, speed requirements and the water conditions the craft must deal with.

===Double-ended===
[[File:Ferrytobermory.jpg|thumb|Ferry in Ontario (Manitoulin Island) vehicles load via the front and back of the ferry opening hull]]
Double-ended ferries have interchangeable bows and sterns, allowing them to shuttle back and forth between two [[Ferry terminal|terminals]] without having to turn around.  Well-known double-ended ferry systems include the [[BC Ferries]], the [[Staten Island Ferry]], [[Washington State Ferries]], [[Star Ferry]], several ferries on the [[North Carolina Ferry System]], and the [[Lake Champlain Transportation Company]]. Most Norwegian fjord and coastal ferries are double-ended vessels. All [[Marine Atlantic|ferries]] from southern [[Prince Edward Island]] to the mainland of Canada were double-ended. This service was discontinued upon completion of the [[Confederation Bridge]]. Some ferries in [[Sydney Ferries|Sydney, Australia]] and [[BC Ferries|British Columbia]] are also double-ended. In 2008, BC Ferries launched three of the largest double-ended ferries in the world.

===Hydrofoil===
[[Hydrofoil]]s have the advantage of higher cruising speeds, succeeding [[hovercraft]] on some English Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the Eurotunnel and [[Eurostar]] trains that use the [[Channel Tunnel]]. Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a practical, fast and relatively economical solution in the [[Canary Islands]], but were recently replaced by faster [[catamaran]] &quot;high speed&quot; ferries that can carry cars. Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by critics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much more fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atan.org/en/costas/fast/milenium.htm|title=ATAN official web page: Fast Ferries – pointless gas-guzzlers|website=Atan.org|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170528/http://www.atan.org/en/costas/fast/milenium.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; in islands already suffering from the impact of mass tourism.

===Hovercraft===
[[File:SRN4 Hovercraft Mountbatten Class.jpg|thumb|Mark 3 [[SR.N4]] hovercraft, [[Port Dover|Dover]]]]
[[Hovercraft]] were developed in the 1960s and 1970s to carry cars. The largest was the massive [[SR.N4]] which carried cars in its centre section with ramps at the bow and stern between England and France. The hovercraft was superseded by catamarans which are nearly as fast and are less affected by sea and weather conditions. Only one service now remains, a foot passenger service between [[Portsmouth]] and the [[Isle of Wight]] run by [[Hovertravel]].

===Catamaran===
[[File:Hsc manannan.png|thumb|[[Incat]] built [[Catamaran]] [[HSC Manannan|HSC ''Manannan'']] entering [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]]]
Since 1990 high speed [[catamaran]]s have revolutionised ferry services, replacing [[hovercraft]], [[hydrofoils]] and conventional monohull ferries. In the 1990s there were a variety of builders, but the industry has consolidated to two builders of large vehicular ferries between 60 and 120 metres. [[Incat]] of [[Hobart]], Tasmania favours a [[Wave-piercing hull]] to deliver a smooth ride, while [[Austal]] of [[Perth]], Western Australia builds ships based on [[Small-waterplane-area twin hull|SWATH]] designs. Both these companies also compete in the smaller river ferry industry with a number of other ship builders.

[[Stena Line]] once operated the largest catamarans in the world, the [[High-speed Sea Service|Stena HSS]] class, between the United Kingdom and Ireland. These [[water jet (propulsion)|waterjet]]-powered vessels, displaced 19,638 tonnes, accommodating 375 passenger cars and 1,500 passengers. Other examples of these super-size catamarans are found in the [[Brittany Ferries]] fleet with the Normandie Express and the Normandie Vitesse.

===Roll-on/roll-off===
[[File:Pont-Aven Car Deck.JPG|thumb|Trucks preparing to unload from the ''[[MV Pont-Aven|Pont-Aven]]'', the [[Brittany Ferries]] flagship]]
[[Roll-on/roll-off]] ferries (RORO) are large conventional ferries named for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.

=== Cruiseferry / RoPax ===
A [[cruiseferry]] is a ship that combines the features of a [[cruise ship]] with a roll-on/roll-off ferry. They are also known as [[RoPax]] for their combined Roll on/Roll Off and passenger design.

===Fast RoPax ferry===
[[File:Superfast XI.jpg|thumb|[[MS Superfast XI|MS ''Superfast XI'']]]]
Fast [[Roll-on/roll-off#ROPAX|RoPax ferries]] are conventional ferries with a large garage intake and a relatively large passenger capacity, with conventional diesel propulsion and propellers that sail over {{convert|25|kn|km/h mph|0}}. Pioneering this class of ferries was [[Attica Group]], when it introduced Superfast I between Greece and Italy in 1995 through its subsidiary company [[Superfast Ferries]]. Cabins, if existent, are much smaller than those on cruise ships.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Turntable ferry===
[[File:Skye ferry scotland.jpg|thumb|right|Turntable ferry at Isle of Skye, Scotland]]
This type of ferry allows vehicles to load from the &quot;side&quot;. The vehicle platform can be turned. When loading, the platform is turned sideways to allow sideways loading of vehicles. Then the platform is turned back, in line with the vessel, and the journey across water is made.

===Pontoon ferry===
&lt;!--NOTE: Pontoon ferry in several articles links here--&gt;
[[File:Ferry.dartmouth.750pix.jpg|thumb|The Lower [[Kingswear]] to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] ferry, [[Devon]], England. The [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] carries eight cars and is towed across the [[River Dart]] by a small tug. Two ropes connect the tug to the pontoon.]]
[[Pontoon (boat)|Pontoon]] ferries carry vehicles across rivers and lakes and are widely used in less-developed countries with large rivers where the cost of bridge construction is prohibitive. One or more vehicles are carried on a pontoon with [[Drawbridge|ramps]] at either end for vehicles to drive on and off. [[#Cable ferry|Cable ferries]] are usually pontoon ferries, but pontoon ferries on larger rivers are motorised and able to be steered independently like a boat.

===Train ferry===
{{main|Train ferry}}
[[File:101031 Italie sud 128.jpg|thumb|Train and car ferry between Calabria and Sicily, Italy]]
A train ferry is a ship designed to carry railway vehicles. Typically, one level of the ship is fitted with railway tracks, and the vessel has a door at either or both of the front and rear to give access to the [[Wharf|wharves]].

===Foot ferry===
Foot ferries are small craft used to ferry foot passengers, and often also cyclists, over rivers. These are either self-propelled craft or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example to be found on the lower [[Schelde|River Scheldt]] in [[Belgium]] and in particular the [[Netherlands]]. Regular foot ferry service also exists in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, and across the [[Yarra River]] in Melbourne, Australia at [[Newport, Victoria|Newport]]. Restored, expanded ferry service in the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] uses boats for pedestrians only.

===Cable ferry===
{{Main article|Cable ferry|Reaction ferry}}
[[File:Small Mannum Ferry.jpg|thumb|One of several self-propelled cable ferries that cross the lower reaches of the [[Murray River]] in South Australia]]
Very short distances may be crossed by a [[cable ferry|cable or chain ferry]], which is usually a pontoon ferry (see above), where the ferry is propelled along and steered by cables connected to each shore. Sometimes the cable ferry is human powered by someone on the boat. [[Reaction ferry|Reaction ferries]] are cable ferries that use the perpendicular force of the current as a source of power. Examples of a current propelled ferry are the four Rhine ferries in [[Basel]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faehri.ch/|title=Fähri Verein Basel|website=Faehri.ch|accessdate=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706231810/http://www.faehri.ch/|archive-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable ferries may be used in fast-flowing rivers across short distances. With an ocean crossing of approximately 1900 metres, the cable ferry between Vancouver Island and Denman Island in British Columbia; is the longest one in the world.

Free ferries operate in some parts of the world, such as at [[Woolwich]] in London, England (across the [[River Thames]]); in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands (across the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] waterway); along the [[Murray River]] in [[South Australia]], and across many lakes in [[British Columbia]]. Many cable ferries operate on lakes and rivers in Canada, among them a [[Reaction ferry|cable ferry]] that charges a toll operates on the [[Laval-sur-le-Lac–Île-Bizard Ferry|Rivière des Prairies]] between [[Laval-sur-le-Lac]] and [[Île Bizard]] in [[Quebec]], Canada. In Finland there were 40 road ferries (cable ferries) in 2009, on lakes, rivers and on sea between islands.

===Air ferries===
{{main|Air ferry}}
In the 1950s and 1960s, travel on an &quot;air ferry&quot; was possible—airplanes, often ex-military, specially equipped to take a small number of cars in addition to foot passengers. These operated various routes including between the United Kingdom and [[Continental Europe]]. Companies operating such services included [[Channel Air Bridge]], [[Silver City Airways]], and [[Corsairfly|Corsair]].

The term is also applied to any &quot;ferrying&quot; by air, and is commonly used when referring to airborne military operations.
==Docking==
[[File:Ferry loading.jpg|thumb|Drawbridge of the ferry lies on the [[ferry slip]]. This double sided ferry measures {{convert|74|x|17.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and carries 2000 passengers with 60 cars]]

Ferries often dock at specialized facilities designed to position the boat for loading and unloading, called a [[ferry slip]]. If the ferry transports road vehicles or railway carriages there will usually be an adjustable [[Inclined plane|ramp]] called an [[Linkspan|apron]] that is part of the [[Ferry slip|slip]]. In other cases, the [[Linkspan|apron ramp]] will be a part of the ferry itself, acting as a wave guard when elevated and lowered to meet a [[Slipway|fixed ramp]] at the terminus – a road segment that extends partially underwater or meet the [[ferry slip]].

==Records==
===Gross tonnage===
The world's [[Largest ferries of Europe|largest ferries are typically those operated in Europe]], with different vessels holding the record depending on whether length, gross tonnage or car vehicle capacity is the metric.

===Oldest===
On 11 October 1811, inventor [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]]' ship the ''Juliana'', began operation as the first [[steam]]-powered ferry (service was between New York City, and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hobokenmuseum.org/history/the-stevens-family/steamboat-innovation|title=Hoboken Historical Museum – Steamboat Innovation|website=Hobokenmuseum.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507131104/https://www.hobokenmuseum.org/history/the-stevens-family/steamboat-innovation|archive-date=7 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contender as oldest ferry in continuous operation is the [[Mersey Ferry]] from [[Liverpool]] to [[Birkenhead]], England. In 1150, the [[Birkenhead Priory|Benedictine Priory]] at [[Birkenhead]] was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx |title=101 Interesting Facts |publisher=Mersey Ferries |accessdate=30 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904150644/http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1330, [[Edward III]] granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: &quot;the right of ferry there... for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls&quot;. However, there may have been a short break following the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] after 1536.

Another claimant as the oldest ferry service in continuous operation is the [[Rocky Hill – Glastonbury Ferry]], running between the towns of [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut|Rocky Hill]] and [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?a=1380&amp;Q=259738|title=Department of Transportation|first=Department of|last=Transportation|website=Ct.gov|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1655, the ferry has run continuously since, only ceasing operation every winter when the river freezes over.  A long running salt water ferry service is the Halifax/Dartmouth ferry, running between the cities of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], [[Nova Scotia]], which has run year-round since 1752, and is currently run by the region's transit authority, [[Metro Transit (Halifax)|Metro Transit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halifax.ca/metrotransit/ferries.html|title=Halifax Regional Municipality (Metro Transit) page – &quot;Harbour Ferries&quot;|website=Halifax.ca|accessdate=27 January 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603230803/http://www.halifax.ca/metrotransit/ferries.html|archivedate=3 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mersey Ferry predates it as the oldest salt water ferry.

===Fastest===
The gas turbine powered ''[[Luciano Federico L]]'' operated by Montevideo-based [[Buquebus]], holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest car ferry in the world, in service between [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]: its maximum speed, achieved in sea trials, was {{convert|60.2|kn|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Sustainability ==
[[File:Tallink Star in 2013.JPG|thumb|Fast [[Ro-Pax ferries]], like [[MS Star|MS ''Star'']], have notable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.]]
The contributions of ferry travel to climate change have received less scrutiny than land and air transport, and vary considerably according to factors like speed and the number of passengers carried. Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be {{convert|0.12|kg|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philippe Holthof|title='SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions once again Hot Topic at Ferry Shipping Conference' : ''Ferry Shipping Conference 08: Building Bridges in the Industry''|url=http://www.shippax.se/backˌknet/ext/file/fileredirect.asp?id=229&amp;file=bilaga_konferens_maj08.pdf|website=Shippax.se|date=10 April 2009|page=3|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|adj=mid|lk=in}} ferries between Finland and Sweden produce {{convert|0.221|kg|oz|abbr=on}} of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with total emissions equalling a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent of {{convert|0.223|kg|oz|abbr=on}}, while {{convert|24|–|27|kn|mph km/h|adj=mid}} ferries between Finland and Estonia produce {{convert|0.396|kg|oz|abbr=on}} of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with total emissions equalling a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent of {{convert|0.4|kg|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lipasto.vtt.fi/yksikkopaastot/henkiloliikennee/vesiliikennee/autolauttae.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224329/http://lipasto.vtt.fi/yksikkopaastot/henkiloliikennee/vesiliikennee/autolauttae.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative fuels===
{{See also|Electric boat}}
With the [[price of oil]] at high levels, and with increasing pressure from consumers for measures to tackle [[global warming]], a number of innovations for energy and the environment were put forward at the Interferry conference in [[Stockholm]]. According to the company [[Solar Sailor Holdings|Solar Sailor]], hybrid marine power and solar wing technology are suitable for use with ferries, private [[yacht]]s and even tankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interferry hears about green alternatives|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/-interferry-hears-green-alternatives-/2007/10/05/2993389.htm|website=Tmcnet.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative fuels are becoming more widespread on ferries.  The fastest passenger ferry in the world [[Buquebus]], runs on [[LNG]], while Sweden's [[Stena Line|Stena]] plans to operate its 1500-passenger ferries on [[methanol]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marinelog.com/coastal/ferries/stena-to-operate-1500-passenger-ferry-on-methanol/ |title=Stena to operate 1,500 passenger ferry on methanol – Marine Log |website=Marinelog.com |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both fuels reduce emissions considerably and replace costly diesel fuel.

Megawatt-class [[Battery electric vehicle|battery electric ferries]] operate in Scandinavia, with several more scheduled for operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Plugging in Finland's first electric ferry – Marine Log|url=https://www.marinelog.com/coastal/ferries/video-plugging-in-finlands-first-electric-ferry/|date=20 November 2017|website=Marinelog.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-04|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the world's biggest purely electric ferry was the {{ship|MF|Tycho Brahe}}, which operates on the [[Helsingør–Helsingborg ferry route]] across the [[Øresund]] between [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. The ferry weights 8414 tonnes, and has an electric storage capacity of more than 4 MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Two massive ferries are about to become the biggest all-electric ships in the world|url=https://electrek.co/2017/08/24/all-electric-ferries-abb/| last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=2017-08-24| website=Electrek| language=en-US| access-date=2020-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

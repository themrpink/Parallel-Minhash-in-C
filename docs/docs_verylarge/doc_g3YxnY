'''Earthlings''' (also known as '''Earthers''' or '''Gaians''', or '''Terrans''') are inhabitants of the planet [[Earth]]. The word's use in science fiction dates to 1949, in ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

==History==
Historically, the term ''earthling'' referred to a mortal inhabitant of the Earth as opposed to spiritual or divine entities.  In [[Early Modern English]], the word was used with the intention of contrasting &quot;earth&quot; with &quot;[[heaven]]&quot;, and so presenting man as an inhabitant of the [[sublunary sphere]], as opposed to heavenly creatures or [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe]], ''Christ's Tears'' (1593, 1613), p. 124: &quot;Wee (of all earthlings) are Gods vtmost subiects.&quot;;&lt;br&gt; Drummond of Hawthornden, ''Poems'' (1711), p. 31 (written ca. 1630): &quot;Nature gaz'd on with such a curious eye, That earthlings oft her deem'd a deity.&quot;&lt;br&gt; Cited after ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The derivation from the noun ''[[:wikt:earth|earth]]'' by means of the suffix ''[[:wikt:-ling|-ling]]'' is already seen in [[Old English]] ''yrþling'', in the meaning &quot;ploughman&quot;. The sense of &quot;inhabitant of earth&quot; is first attested in the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earthling |title=earthling |last1= Harper |first1=Douglas |accessdate=18 August 2018 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in science fiction dates to 1949, in ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

The word ''human'' has the same imposed meaning, since it originates from a [[Proto-Indo-European]] word ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰmṓ|*ǵʰmṓ]]'' &quot;earthling&quot; &lt; ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰéǵʰōm|*dʰéǵʰōm]]'' &quot;earth&quot;. Compare [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:homo|homo]]'' &quot;human&quot; and ''[[wikt:humus|humus]]'' &quot;earth, soil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Vaan&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Its modern use in science fiction literature contrasts Earth (the planet) with outer space or hypothetical other planets with sapient life. The term was often used in 1950s science fiction film and novels by aliens to express a disdainful or patronizing tone towards creatures from Earth. The meaning &quot;creature from planet Earth&quot; in the context of space travel may be extended to non-human species, as in &quot;Russia fetes dog [[Laika]], first earthling in space&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/11/us-russia-space-dog-idUSL1117596720080411 |title=Russia fetes dog Laika, first earthling in space |last1= Solovyov |first1=Dmitry |last2= Pearce |first2=Tim (ed.) |date=11 April 2008 |work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary effect aimed for is a [[distancing effect]], inviting the readers to contemplate their own species as it might be seen from an external point of view. There is also a belittling effect, in parallel with the use of the ''-ling'' suffix in such diminutives as ''duckling'' and ''gosling''. Especially in 1950s science fiction, use of the term is a conscious reversal of common assumptions of [[anthropocentrism]] or [[human exceptionalism]], and may be an example of an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]].{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}

In some science fiction media (such as the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise and the 2014 movie ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'') the term ''Terran'' is used as a term for humans, stemming from ''terra'', the Latin word for Earth. In the original run of the [[BBC]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the phrase ''tellurian'' is used.

Year '''218''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXVIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Severus and Adventus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 971 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 218 for this year has been used since the [[early medieval]] period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text bytes="16377" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Regional boundary to control urban sprawl}}
An '''urban growth boundary''', or '''UGB''', is a regional boundary, set in an attempt to control [[urban sprawl]] by, in its simplest form, mandating that the area inside the boundary be used for urban development and the area outside be preserved in its natural state or used for agriculture. Legislating for an &quot;urban growth boundary&quot; is one way, among many others, of managing the major challenges posed by unplanned urban growth and the encroachment of cities upon agricultural and rural land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 |author1=Paul James |author2=Meg Holden |author3=Mary Lewin |author4=Lyndsay Neilson |author5=Christine Oakley |author6=Art Truter |author7=David Wilmoth |name-list-style=amp | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development |editor1=Harald Mieg |editor2=Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An urban growth boundary circumscribes an entire urbanized area and is used by local governments as a guide to [[zoning]] and land use decisions, and by utilities and other infrastructure providers to improve efficiency through effective long term planning (e.g. optimising sewerage catchments, school districts, etc.).

If the area affected by the boundary includes multiple jurisdictions a special [[urban planning]] agency may be created by the state or regional government to manage the boundary. In a rural context, the terms town boundary, village [[curtilage]] or village envelope may be used to apply the same constraining principles. Some jurisdictions refer to the area within an urban growth boundary as an urban growth area (UGA) or urban service area, etc. While the names are different, the concept is the same.

==History==
[[File:The Metropolitan Green Belt among the green belts of England.svg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] first proposed by the [[London County Council]] in 1935.|180px]]
Opposition to unregulated [[urban sprawl|urban growth]] and [[ribbon development]] began to grow towards the end of the 19th century in England. The campaign group [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]] (CPRE) was formed in 1926 and exerted environmentalist pressure. Implementation of the notion dated from [[Herbert Morrison]]'s 1934 leadership of the [[London County Council]]. It was first formally proposed by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1935, &quot;to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space&quot;.

New provisions for compensation in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947|1947 Town and Country Planning Act]] allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first [[development plans]]. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/155499.pdf|title=Planning Policy Guidance 2: Green belts|access-date=2013-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609171722/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/155499.pdf|archive-date=2012-06-09|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the first urban growth boundary was established in 1958, around the city of [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Lexington's population was expanding, and city leaders were concerned about the survival of the surrounding horse farms closely tied to the city's cultural identity. The first statewide urban growth boundary policy was implemented in [[Oregon]], under then governor [[Tom McCall]], as part of the state's land-use planning program in the early 1970s. Tom McCall and his allies convinced the Oregon Legislature in 1973 to adopt the nation's first set of statewide land use planning laws. McCall, with the help of a unique coalition of farmers and environmentalists, persuaded the Legislature that the state's natural beauty and easy access to nature would be lost in a rising tide of urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=277|title=Urban growth boundary|publisher=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new goals and guidelines required every city and county in Oregon to have a long-range plan addressing future growth that meets both local and statewide goals.

==Places with urban growth boundaries==

===Albania===
[[Albania]] maintains the 'yellow line' system hailing from its [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|socialist regime]] — limiting urban development beyond a designated boundary for all municipalities.

===Australia===
After the release of [[Melbourne 2030]] in October 2002, the state government of Victoria legislated an urban growth boundary to limit [[urban sprawl]]. Since then, the urban growth boundary has been significantly increased a number of times.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] (the &quot;[[Greenbelt (Ottawa)|Greenbelt]]&quot;) and [[Waterloo, Ontario]] have boundaries to restrict growth and preserve greenspace. In [[Montréal]] and in the rest of the [[province of Québec]], an agricultural protection law serves a similar purpose, restricting urban development to &quot;white zones&quot; and forbidding it on &quot;green zones&quot;. They are notably absent from cities such as [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] that lie on flat plains and have expanded outwardly on former agricultural land. In British Columbia the Agricultural Land Reserve serves a similar purpose where adjacent to urban areas.

===China===
In 2017, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] delivered a speech in the [[19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|19th National Congress]], in which he mentioned the delineation of &quot;boundaries for urban development&quot; ({{Lang|zh-cn|城镇开发边界}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Xi Jinping|url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm|title=Full text of Xi Jinping's report at 19th CPC National Congress|publisher=Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2019, the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party General Office]] and the [[General Office of the State Council]] issued a guiding opinion, requiring &quot;three control lines&quot;, including boundaries of urban development, to be designated in territory spatial planning.

In the plan of some new towns, green belts are included and growth cannot sprawl into or across the green belts. In addition a majority of new towns are surrounded by country parks.

===France===
In [[France]], [[Rennes]] decided in the 1960s to maintain a green belt after its ring road. This green belt is named ''Ceinture verte''.

===New Zealand===
Over the past two decades, greater Auckland has been subject to a process of growth management facilitated through various strategic and legislative documents. An overarching objective has been to manage the growth of Auckland in a higher density, centres-based manner consistent with the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy. Effect is given to this strategy through a series of layers of control including the Local Government Amendment (Auckland) Act, the Regional Policy Statement and then via District Plans. A key outcome of this process was the establishment of a Metropolitan Urban Limit (“MUL”) or urban fence that dictated the nature and extent of urban activities that could occur within the MUL and hence also dictated the relative values of land within the MUL.

An [[Integrated Development Plan]] is required in terms of Chapter 5 of the national [[Municipal Systems Act]] No 32 of 2000 for all local authorities in South Africa. This plan would as one of its components include a [[Spatial Development Framework]] plan which would normally, certainly for the larger metropolitan areas, indicate an [[Urban Edge]] beyond which urban type development would be severely limited or restricted. The concept was introduced in the 1970s by the [[Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission]] of the Province of Natal (now known as [[KwaZulu-Natal]]) in the regional guide plans for [[Durban]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]]. The concept was at that stage termed an Urban Fence.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. Metropolitan Durban - Draft Guide Plan, Natal Town and Regional Planning Reports Volume 28, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

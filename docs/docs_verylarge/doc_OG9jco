Tyler's 1976 breakthrough with &quot;Lost in France&quot; led to her nomination for Best British Female Newcomer at the [[Brit Awards|1977 Brit Awards]]. In the 1980s, she received nominations for two more Brit Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025055333/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/bonnie-tyler |archive-date=25 October 2014 |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/bonnie-tyler |title=Bonnie Tyler BRITs Profile |work=[[Brit Awards]] |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three [[Grammy Awards]]. In 2013, she was presented with the Gold Badge award by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA).&lt;ref name=&quot;BASCA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/bonnie-tyler-wins-major-music-6086762 |title=Bonnie Tyler wins major music award |last=Turner |first=Robin |date=24 September 2013 |work=Wales Online |access-date=12 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224080218/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/bonnie-tyler-wins-major-music-6086762 |archive-date=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Tyler won the [[World Popular Song Festival|10th World Popular Song Festival]] with &quot;Sitting on the Edge of the Ocean&quot;, representing the United Kingdom. Tyler also became the first and only representative of the United Kingdom to receive a Eurovision Song Contest Radio award in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESCradioawardsresults&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Mourinho |first=Daniel |url=http://www.escradio.com/2013/06/esc-radio-awards-2013-the-winners/ |title=ESC Radio Awards 2013 – The Winners |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest Radio |access-date=20 August 2013 |date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also one of the first western artists to tour the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/13/bonnie-tyler-80s-now-interview |title=Bonnie Tyler: 'I'm not part of the 80s, I'm part of now' |last=Saner |first=Emine |date=13 May 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''mass noun''', '''uncountable noun''', or '''non-count noun''' is a [[noun]] with the syntactic property that any quantity of it is treated as an undifferentiated unit, rather than as something with discrete elements. Non-count nouns are distinguished from [[count noun]]s.

Given that different languages have different grammatical features, the actual test for which nouns are mass nouns may vary between languages. In [[English language|English]], mass nouns are characterized by the fact that they cannot be directly modified by a [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]] without specifying a unit of measurement, and that they cannot combine with an indefinite article (''a'' or ''an''). Thus, the mass noun &quot;water&quot; is quantified as &quot;20 litres of water&quot; while the count noun &quot;chair&quot; is quantified as &quot;20 chairs&quot;. However, both mass and count nouns can be quantified in relative terms without unit specification (e.g., &quot;so much water&quot;, &quot;so many chairs&quot;).

Mass nouns have no concept of singular and plural, although in English they take singular verb forms.  However, many mass nouns in English can be [[Conversion (word formation)|converted]] to count nouns, which can then be used in the plural to denote (for instance) more than one instance or variety of a certain sort of entity – for example, &quot;''Many cleaning agents today are technically not soaps, but detergents.''&quot;

Some nouns can be used indifferently as mass or count nouns, ''e.g.'', ''three cabbages'' or ''three heads of cabbage''; ''three ropes'' or ''three lengths of rope''. Some have different [[Word sense|sense]]s as mass and count nouns: ''paper'' is a mass noun as a material (''three reams of paper'', ''one sheet of paper''), but a count noun as a unit of writing (&quot;the students passed in their papers&quot;).

==Grammatical number and physical discreteness==

In English (and in many other languages), there is a tendency for nouns referring to liquids (''water'', ''juice''), powders (''sugar'', ''sand''), or substances (''metal'', ''wood'') to be used in mass syntax, and for nouns referring to objects or people to be count nouns. But there are many exceptions: the mass/count distinction is a property of the ''terms'', not their referents. For example, the same set of chairs can be referred to as &quot;seven chairs&quot; (count) and as &quot;furniture&quot; (mass); the Middle English mass noun ''pease'' has become the count noun ''pea'' by [[morphological reanalysis]]; &quot;vegetables&quot; are a plural count form, while the British English slang synonym &quot;veg&quot; is a mass noun.

In languages that have a [[partitive case]], the distinction is explicit and mandatory. For example, in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''join vettä'', &quot;I drank (some) water&quot;, the word ''vesi'', &quot;water&quot;, is in the partitive case. The related sentence ''join veden'', &quot;I drank (the) water&quot;, using the [[accusative case]] instead, assumes that there was a specific countable portion of water that was completely drunk.

The work of logicians like [[Godehard Link]] and [[Manfred Krifka]] established that the mass/count distinction can be given a precise, mathematical definition in terms of [[quantization (linguistics)|quantization]] and [[cumulativity]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Cumulativity and mass nouns==

An expression ''P'' has [[cumulativity|cumulative reference]] if and only if&lt;ref&gt;Krifka, Manfred 1989. Nominal reference, temporal constitution and quantification in event semantics. In [[Renate Bartsch]], Johan van Benthem and Peter van Emde Boas (eds.), Semantics and Contextual Expressions 75-115. Dordrecht: Foris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nicolas|first=David |date=2008 |title=Mass nouns and plural logic |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=211–244 |doi=10.1007/s10988-008-9033-2 |url=http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf |access-date=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219021719/http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for any ''X'' and ''Y'':
*If ''X'' can be described as ''P'' and ''Y'' can be described as ''P'', as well, then the sum of ''X'' and ''Y'' can also be described as ''P''.

In more formal terms (Krifka 1998):

&lt;math&gt;\forall X \subseteq U_p [\mathrm{CUM}_p (X) \Leftrightarrow \exists x,y [ X(x) \,\wedge\,  X(y) \,\wedge\, \neg (x=y)] \;\wedge\; \forall x,y [X(x) \,\wedge\, X(y) \Rightarrow X(x \,\oplus\, y)]]&lt;/math&gt;

which may be read as: ''X'' is cumulative if there exists at least one pair'' x,y'', where ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct, and both have the property ''X'', and if for all possible pairs ''x'' and ''y'' fitting that description, ''X'' is a property of the sum of ''x'' and ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;Borer, Hagit. (2005) ''Structuring Sense: In Name Only''. Volume 1. Oxford: OUP. (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider, for example ''cutlery'': If one collection of cutlery is combined with another, we still have &quot;cutlery.&quot; Similarly, if water is added to water, we still have &quot;water.&quot; But if a chair is added to another, we don't have &quot;a chair,&quot; but rather two chairs. Thus the nouns &quot;cutlery&quot; and &quot;water&quot; have cumulative reference, while the expression &quot;a chair&quot; does not. The expression &quot;chairs&quot;, however, does, suggesting that the generalization is not actually specific to the mass-count distinction. As many have noted, it is possible to provide an alternative analysis, by which mass nouns and plural count nouns are assigned a similar semantics, as distinct from that of singular count nouns.&lt;ref name=Gillon&gt;Brendan S. Gillon (1992) Towards a common semantics for English count and mass nouns. Linguistics and Philosophy 15: 597–639&lt;/ref&gt;

An expression ''P'' has [[quantization (linguistics)|quantized reference]] if and only if, for any X:
*If ''X'' can be described as ''P'', then no proper part of ''X'' can be described as ''P''.
This can be seen to hold in the case of the noun ''house'': no proper part of ''a house'', for example the bathroom, or the entrance door, is itself a house. Similarly, no proper part of ''a man'', say his index finger, or his knee, can be described as ''a man''. Hence, ''house'' and ''man'' have quantized reference.  However, collections of ''cutlery'' do have proper parts that can themselves be described as ''cutlery''. Hence ''cutlery'' does not have quantized reference. Notice again that this is probably not a fact about mass-count syntax, but about prototypical examples, since many singular count nouns have referents whose proper parts can be described by the same term. Examples include divisible count nouns like &quot;rope&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;tile&quot;, etc.&lt;ref name=Gillon/&gt;

Some expressions are neither quantized nor cumulative. Examples of this include  [[collective noun]]s like ''committee''. A committee may well contain a proper part which is itself a committee.  Hence this expression isn't quantized.  It isn't cumulative, either: the sum of two separate committees isn't necessarily a ''committee''.  In terms of the mass/count distinction, ''committee'' behaves like a count noun. By some accounts, these examples are taken to indicate that the best characterization of mass nouns is that they are ''cumulative nouns''. On such accounts, count nouns should then be characterized as ''non-cumulative'' nouns: this characterization correctly groups ''committee'' together with the count nouns. If, instead, we had chosen to characterize count nouns as ''quantized nouns'', and mass nouns as ''non-quantized'' ones, then we would (incorrectly) be led to expect ''committee'' to be a mass noun. However, as noted above, such a characterization fails to explain many central phenomena of the mass-count distinction.

==Multiple senses for one noun==

Many English [[noun]]s can be used in either mass or count syntax, and in these cases, they take on cumulative reference when used as mass nouns. For example, one may say that &quot;there's ''apple'' in this sauce,&quot; and then ''apple'' has cumulative reference, and, hence, is used as a mass noun. The names of animals, such as &quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;fox&quot; or &quot;lamb&quot; are count when referring to the animals themselves, but are mass when referring to their meat, fur, or other substances produced by them. (e.g., &quot;I'm cooking chicken tonight&quot; or &quot;This coat is made of fox.&quot;) Conversely, &quot;[[fire]]&quot; is frequently used as a  mass noun, but &quot;a fire&quot; refers to a discrete entity. Substance terms like &quot;water&quot; which are frequently used as mass nouns, can be used as count nouns to denote arbitrary units of a substance (&quot;Two ''waters'', please&quot;) or of several types/varieties (&quot;''waters'' of the world&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Tsoulas, George (2006). Plurality of mass nouns and the grammar of number. [[Generative Linguistics in the Old World]].&lt;/ref&gt; One may say that mass nouns that are used as count nouns are &quot;[[wikt:countify|countified]]&quot; and that count ones that are used as mass nouns are &quot;[[wikt:massify|massified]]&quot;. However, this may confuse syntax and semantics, by presupposing that words which denote substances are mass nouns by default. According to many accounts, nouns do not have a lexical specification for mass-count status, and instead are specified as such only when used in a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Allan. 1980. Nouns and Countability. Language, 56(3):41-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns differ in the extent to which they can be used flexibly, depending largely on their meanings and the context of use. For example, the count noun &quot;house&quot; is difficult to use as mass (though clearly possible), and the mass noun &quot;cutlery&quot; is most frequently used as mass, despite the fact that it denotes objects, and has count equivalents in other languages:

* Incorrect: *There is house on the road. (Incorrect even if a catastrophe is considered)
* Incorrect: *There is a cutlery on the table. (Incorrect even if just one fork is on the table)
* Correct: You got a lot of house for your money since the recession.
* Correct: Spanish cutlery is my favorite. (type / kind reading)

In some languages, such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it has been claimed by some that all nouns are effectively mass nouns, requiring a [[measure word]] to be quantified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Gennaro Chierchia|Chierchia]] |first=Gennaro |year=1998 |title=Reference to Kinds across Languages |journal=[[Natural Language Semantics]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=339–405 |doi=10.1023/A:1008324218506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantification==
Some [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] are specific to mass nouns (e.g., ''an amount of'') or count nouns (e.g., ''a number of'', ''every''). Others can be used with both types (e.g., ''a lot of'', ''some'').

===Words ''fewer'' and ''less''===
{{main|Fewer versus less}}
Where ''much'' and ''little'' qualify mass nouns, ''many'' and ''few'' have an analogous function for count nouns:
* How much damage? —Very little.
* How many mistakes? —Very few.

Whereas ''more'' and ''most'' are the [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] of both ''much'' and ''many'', ''few'' and ''little'' have differing comparative and superlative (''fewer'', ''fewest'' and ''less'', ''least'').  However, [[suppletion|suppletive]] use of ''less'' and ''least'' with count nouns is common in many contexts, some of which attract criticism as [[nonstandard dialect|nonstandard]] or low-[[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwdeu-less-fewer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |edition=2nd |page=592 |chapter=less, fewer|isbn=0-87779-132-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA592|author1=Merriam-Webster|author2=Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism dates back to at least 1770; the usage dates back to [[Old English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwdeu-less-fewer&quot; /&gt; In 2008, [[Tesco]] changed supermarket [[Point of sale|checkout]] signs reading &quot;Ten items or less&quot; after complaints that it was bad grammar; at the suggestion of the [[Plain English Campaign]] it switched to &quot;Up to ten items&quot; rather than to &quot;Ten items or fewer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2659948/Tesco-to-ditch-ten-items-or-less-sign-after-good-grammar-campaign.html |title=Tesco to ditch 'ten items or less' sign after good grammar campaign |access-date=16 April 2010 |first=Tom |last=Peterkin |work=Daily Telegraph |date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflation of collective noun and mass noun==

There is often confusion about the two different concepts of ''[[collective noun]]'' and ''mass noun''. Generally, collective nouns are not mass nouns, but rather are a special subset of [[count noun]]s. However, the term &quot;collective noun&quot; is often used to mean &quot;mass noun&quot; (even in some dictionaries), because users conflate two different kinds of verb number invariability: (a) that seen with mass nouns such as &quot;water&quot; or &quot;furniture&quot;, with which only singular verb forms are used because the constituent matter is ''grammatically'' nondiscrete (although it may [&quot;water&quot;] or may not [&quot;furniture&quot;] be ''[[etic]]ally'' nondiscrete); and (b) that seen with collective nouns, which is the result of the [[English collective nouns#Metonymic merging of grammatical number|metonymical shift]] between the group and its (both grammatically and etically) discrete constituents.

Some words, including &quot;[[mathematics]]&quot; and &quot;[[physics]]&quot;, have developed true mass-noun senses despite having grown from count-noun roots.

Between 1600 and 1800, European settlers began to arrive in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Soon after, war, disease, and dispersal virtually destroyed the Native American settlements. However, evidence suggests some Native Americans remained in the area as late as the mid-1800s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Originally charted on August 14, 1781, the Town of Montpelier was granted municipal powers by the &quot;Governor, Council and General Assembly of the Freemen of the State of Vermont&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montpelier-vt.org/DocumentCenter/View/1454/City-Charter-PDF|title=Charter of the City of Montpelier|website=www.montpelier-vt.org/DocumentCenter/View/1454/City-Charter-PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524222713/http://www.montpelier-vt.org/DocumentCenter/View/1454/City-Charter-PDF|archive-date=2018-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent settlement began in May 1787, when Colonel Jacob Davis and General Parley Davis arrived from [[Charlton, Massachusetts]]. General Davis surveyed the land, while Colonel Davis cleared forest and erected a large log house on the west side of the North Branch of the [[Winooski River]]. His family moved in the following winter.

Colonel Davis selected the name &quot;Montpelier&quot; after the French city of [[Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] for the State of Vermont |title=Vermont: A guide to the Green Mountain State |year=1996 |publisher=The Stephen Greene Press |pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a general enthusiasm for things French as a result of the country's aid to the American colonies during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swift, Esther Munroe |title=Vermont Place Names: Footprints of History |year=1977 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=451–454 |isbn=0-8289-0291-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement grew quickly, and by 1791 the population reached 117.

The interpretation of this rule is complex. See [[Wikipedia:Linking to external harassment]] for guidance on interpretation.

== Consequences of personal attacks ==
Although editors are encouraged to ignore or respond politely to isolated personal attacks, that should not imply that they are acceptable. A pattern of hostility reduces the likelihood of the community [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assuming good faith]], and can be considered [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]].  Users who insist on a confrontational style marked by personal attacks are likely to become involved in the [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution]] process, and may face serious consequences through [[WP:AP|arbitration]].

In extreme cases, even isolated personal attacks may lead to a [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|block]] for disruption. Death threats and issues of similar severity may result in a block ''without warning''. Lesser personal attacks often result in a warning, and a request to [[Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages|refactor]].  If a pattern of lesser personal attacks continues despite the warning, escalating blocks may follow. However, administrators are cautioned that other resolutions are preferable to blocking for less-severe situations when it is unclear if the conduct severely disrupts the project. Recurring attacks are proportionally more likely to be considered disruptive. Blocking for personal attacks should only be done for prevention, not punishment: a block may be warranted if it seems likely that the user will continue using personal attacks.

{{nutshell|Please sign your posts on talk pages, using four tildes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), or clicking the signature icon [[File:OOUI JS signature icon LTR.svg|22px]] on the edit toolbar. Keep the coding of your signature short, do not make the signature too large, do not embed files in it, and ensure that the end result is easily readable by virtually everybody.}}
{{Guideline list}}

'''Signing your posts''' on [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]] (normally using four [[tilde]]s: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), both for the article and non-article [[Wikipedia:Namespace|namespaces]], is required and facilitates discussion by identifying the author of a particular comment. Other users can then navigate to a talk page and address their comments to the specific, relevant user(s). Discussion is an important part of collaborative editing, because it helps all users to understand the progress and evolution of a work.

Comments posted on user talk pages, article talk pages and other discussion pages must be properly signed. Signature use that is intentionally and persistently disruptive may lead to [[WP:BP|blocks]].

When [[Help:Editing|editing a page]], [[Wikipedia:What is an article?|main namespace]] articles '''should not''' be signed, because the article is a shared work, based on the contributions of many people, and one editor should not be singled out above others.

== Purpose of signatures ==
Signatures on Wikipedia identify you as a user and your contributions to Wikipedia. They encourage [[WP:CIVIL|civility in discussions]] by identifying the author of a particular comment and the date and time at which it was made. Because of that, having an uncivil signature is strongly discouraged (in some cases, to the point of blocking the user until it is changed). In general, anything that is not allowed in a [[WP:UN|username]] should not be used in a signature either.

Furthermore, signatures also serve a technical purpose: various [[WP:SCRIPT|user scripts]] and [[WP:BOT|talk-page archiving bots]], including [[User:lowercase sigmabot III|lowercase sigmabot III]], rely on their time stamps to know when to archive old threads. It's because of this that it's also important to avoid overly customizing the date output of a signature, as doing so can lead to stale threads persisting long after they'd otherwise be [[WP:ARCHIVE|archived]].

== When signatures should and should not be used ==
{{shortcut|WP:SIGNHERE}}
Any posts made to the user talk pages, article talk pages and any other discussion pages ''must be'' signed (this does not include adding WikiProject boxes and other such administrative templates). Note that, as stated [[#How to sign your posts|below]], if you choose to edit those kinds of pages [[Wikipedia:IPs are human too|without logging in]], then you should still sign your posts – regardless of whether or not you have [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|an account]]. Edits to articles ''must '''not''''' be signed, as signatures on Wikipedia are not intended to indicate [[Wikipedia:Ownership of content|ownership or authorship of any article]]. Instead, the [[Help:Page history|page history]] identifies who made edits. Signatures do not translate from &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in edit summaries. In other instances when posts ''should not'' be signed, specific instructions are provided to contributors. Files used in articles, including image and sound files, should not contain any Wikipedians' signatures.

== How to sign your posts ==
{{shortcut|WP:~|WP:SIGHOW|WP:TILDE}}
=== Preferred option ===
==== Using four tildes ====
{{Shortcut|WP:4TILDES}}

There are two ways to sign your posts:

# At the end of your comments simply type four [[tilde]]s (~), like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For Chinese or Japanese language input method users (particularly relevant for [[macOS]] users), do not use fullwidth tildes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;～～～～&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). Instead, click the signature icon (explained below) or use {{tls|～～～～}}.
# If you are using the [[Help:Edit toolbar|edit toolbar]] option (by default, it appears above the edit box), click the signature icon&lt;ref group=Note&gt;If your browser is set to not show pictures, the button will be called &quot;Your signature with timestamp&quot;.  If the browser's settings don't allow JavaScript, the buttons will not appear.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:OOUI JS signature icon LTR.svg|22px]] to add two hyphens and four tildes like this: &lt;code&gt;{{nobr|&lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;.

The four tildes will be automatically replaced with your signature after you have published the changes, as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]])&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt; The actual code is slightly more complicated, turning the talk page link into a link to the top of one's talk page when used at one's talk page itself. It can be found at [[MediaWiki:Signature]].&lt;/ref&gt;
| [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]]) {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)
|}

Since typing four tildes adds the time and date to your resulting signature, this is the preferred option for signing your posts in discussions.

Note that if you choose to [[Wikipedia:IPs are human too|contribute without logging in]], regardless of whether you have [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|an account]], you should still sign your posts. In this case your [[IP address]] will take the place of your username, and will link to your contributions history. Your IP address might look something like '''192.0.2.213''' or '''2001:DB8:CEEE:21B:DB60:07FE:4277:63FF'''.

If, for some reason, you are not getting the above results when signing, see the [[User talk:SineBot|SineBot Frequently Asked Questions]] for tips.

=== Other options ===
==== Using three tildes ====
{{Shortcut|WP:3TILDES}}
Typing three tildes results in the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]])&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]])
|}

However, since this does not date-stamp your signature, you may wish to sign this way only when leaving general notices on your user page or user talk page. This is also a convenient shortcut (rather than typing out the full code) when you want to provide a link to your user page.

==== Using five tildes ====
{{Shortcut|WP:5TILDES}}
Typing five tildes will convert to a date stamp with the current date and time, without adding your signature, like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Wikimarkup !! Resulting code !! Resulting display
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;{{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)&lt;/code&gt;
| {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)
|}

In general, when communicating with others, you should use one of the previous options and not only a timestamp.  There are exceptions to this such as, when requesting assistance from the [[WP:3O|Third Opinion project]] the requested format for signing is the five tilde signature to slightly help improve neutrality from the responding volunteer, or when updating one of your submitted posts on a talk page by appending &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(updated ~~~~~)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to your already existing signature.

In some [[Help:Template|templates]], this is the preferred way to add the date.

== Customizing your signature ==
{{Shortcut|WP:CUSTOMSIG}}

Every editor's default signature (defined by [[MediaWiki:Signature]]) will display when &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is typed. This looks like:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]]) {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unregistered/not-logged-in users may choose to sign manually with a pseudonym or tag (e.g. ''anon.'') as their IP address will be stored in the page history. If you choose to sign your posts in such a way, you should still finish your signature with four tildes (such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Anonymous editing as ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to aid others in reading the thread and communicating with you.

=== Customizing how you see your signature ===
To change how your signature appears to you, e.g. to make it easier to spot, without affecting how it appears to other users, you can create a personal [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style sheet]]. For example, to display your username in bold white text on an orange background (like &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffa500; color: #ffffff;&quot;&gt;Your username&lt;/span&gt;), add the following to [[Special:MyPage/common.css]], replacing ''Your username'' with your actual username:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#bodyContent a[title=&quot;User:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Your username''&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;] { background-color: #ffa500; color: #ffffff; font-weight: bold; }&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

When you use this technique, bright colors can help you to more quickly scan long pages that contain &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Your&amp;nbsp;username''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, including [[Help:Talk pages|Talk pages]], [[Help:Page history|page histories]], your [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]], and if anyone links to you in a discussion. Colors to use for this can be researched via the [[Web colors]] article, and you can update your common.css file at any time to modify the display style.

=== Customizing how everyone sees your signature ===
{{Shortcut|WP:SIG#CustomSig}}{{Anchor|CustomSig}}
[[File:Raw signature.png|250px|thumb|Screenshot of the [[Special:Preferences]] page, containing the section '''''Raw Signature'''''.]]

Registered users can customize their signatures by going to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-personal-signature|Special:Preferences]] and changing the field &quot;Signature&quot;. This changes the signature seen by everyone. It can be used to sign your posts with a nickname, or with custom formatting, or both.

This technique only applies where you have signed a page while logged in. It doesn't affect how your username appears in your watchlist, in page histories, or where someone else has linked to your user page in a discussion. When you remove or modify your signature, the change will apply to your future posts, but the signatures on your existing posts will be unchanged.

==== Treat as wiki markup ====
If you do not check the &quot;Treat the above as wiki markup&quot; box, the exact content you enter will be used as your signature. For example, if [[User:Example]] had set their signature to read &lt;code&gt;NICKNAME&lt;/code&gt;, thereafter the signature (generated when they mark a post with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[User:Example|NICKNAME]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]]) {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note how NICKNAME still links to [[User:Example]].

If you do check the &quot;Treat the above as wiki markup&quot; box, you can describe your signature using &quot;raw&quot; wikitext (such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&gt; and wiki-markup&lt;/nowiki&gt;) which will be substituted unchanged when you sign your posts. If [[User:Example]] had set their signature to read &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:Example|Ex@''mple'']]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Example|t@lk]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the signature generated by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[User:Example|Ex@''mple'']]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Example|t@lk]]&lt;/sup&gt; {{CURRENTTIME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this case, you are responsible yourself for linking to your user page (e.g. [[User:Example]]).

To visibly include the pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) or equals (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) characters in your signature, you must escape them, or they will break templates unexpectedly when your signature is present. To escape the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; symbol, use the following special code: &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/code&gt; (including everything from the ampersand to the semi-colon). To escape the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; character, use &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#61;&lt;/code&gt;.

Putting two or more exclamation points (&lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;) in a row in your signature can break tables in which your signature appears. Use &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#33;&lt;/code&gt; as a substitute in order to avoid having two exclamation points in a row.

==== Guidelines and policies ====
{{shortcut|WP:CUSTOMSIG/P}}
Because these signatures are seen by everyone, be aware of the guidelines and policies summarized below:
* A customised signature should make it easy to identify your username
* A customised signature should provide an easily identified link to your talk page. You are encouraged to also provide a link to your user page.
* Do not impersonate other users
* Do not use images, templates or external links in your signature
* A distracting, confusing, or otherwise unsuitable signature may adversely affect other users. For example, some editors find that long formatting disrupts discourse on talk pages, or makes working in the edit window more difficult.
* It is common practice for a signature to resemble to some degree the username it represents
* Complicated signatures contain a lot of code (&quot;[[WP:MARKUP|markup]]&quot;) that is revealed in the edit window, and can take up unnecessary amounts of narrative space, which can make both reading and editing harder.
* Always keep the time/date-stamp: these are used by bots to determine when a discussion is eligible to be archived.

====Syntax guidance====
If you attempt to save a signature with certain types of errors, you will see an error message. These errors can be a little tricky to diagnose, but here are some tips:
* Each opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag. Example: each {{tag|b|o}} needs a matching {{tag|b|c}}. This applies to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup as well.
* Tags must be &quot;nested&quot; correctly. Example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;User:&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;User:&lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. 
* If an opening tag appears within a wikilink, it must be closed within a wikilink. Example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:'''Example''']]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:'''Example]]'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*Your signature must include a link to your user page, talk page or contributions.

=== Signature forgery ===
{{policy section|WP:SIGFORGE|WP:Signature forgery}}
'''Never use another editor's signature'''. Impersonating another editor by using his or her username or signature is forbidden. Altering the markup code of your signature to make it look substantially like another user's signature may also be considered a form of impersonation. Editing the code of your signature to link it to another editor's user page is not permitted. It is also ineffective, as the change log of the page records the IP address and (if applicable) username of all editors; as such, any impersonators can easily be caught if the signature in the ''diff'' view differs from the editor's default signature. While not an absolute requirement, it is common practice for a signature to resemble to some degree the username it represents.

If you encounter a user whose signature is disruptive or appears to be impersonating another account, it is appropriate to ask that user to consider changing their signature to meet the requirements of this policy. When making such a request, always be polite, and [[WP:Good faith|assume good faith]]. Do not immediately assume that the user has intentionally selected a disruptive or inappropriate signature. If ''you'' are asked to change your signature, please avoid interpreting a polite request as an attack. Since the success of Wikipedia is based on effective teamwork, both parties should work together to find a mutually acceptable solution.

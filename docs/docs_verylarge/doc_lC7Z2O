'''Ichthyology''' is the branch of [[zoology]] devoted to the study of [[fish]], including bony fish ([[Osteichthyes]]), cartilaginous fish ([[Chondrichthyes]]), and jawless fish ([[Agnatha]]). According to [[FishBase]], 33,400 species of fish had been described as of October 2016, with approximately 250 new species described each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]: [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php October 2016 Update.] Retrieved 7 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Greek words [[wikt:ἰχθύς|ἰχθύς]], ''ikhthus'', meaning &quot;fish&quot;; and [[wikt:-λογία|λογία]], ''logos'', meaning &quot;to study&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i)xqu/s|ἰχθύς|ref|mLSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lo/gos|λόγος |ref|mLSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==
[[File:Mimbres fish.jpg|thumb|Fish represent approximately 8% of all figurative depictions on [[Mimbres pottery]].|alt=Photo of square side of pottery showing fish with skewed checkered pattern on its skin. Zig-zag lines represent waves at the top and bottom.]]

The study of fish dates from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic Revolution]] (with the advent of &quot;high culture&quot;). The science of ichthyology was developed in several interconnecting epochs, each with various significant advancements.

The study of fish receives its origins from humans' desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. According to [[Michael Barton (professor)|Michael Barton]], a prominent ichthyologist and professor at [[Centre College]], &quot;the earliest ichthyologists were hunters and gatherers who had learned how to obtain the most useful fish, where to obtain them in abundance, and at what times they might be the most available&quot;. Early cultures manifested these insights in abstract and identifiable artistic expressions.

===1500 BC–40 AD===
Informal, scientific descriptions of fish are represented within the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. The Old Testament laws of [[kashrut]] forbade the consumption of fish without scales or appendages.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[Theologians]] and ichthyologists believe that the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and his contemporaries harvested the fish that are today sold in modern industry along the [[Sea of Galilee]], presently known as [[Lake Kinneret]]. These fish include [[cyprinid]]s of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Barbus]]'' and ''[[Acanthobrama terraesanctae|Mirogrex]]'', [[cichlid]]s of the genus ''[[Sarotherodon]]'', and ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mugilidae]].

=== 335 BC–80 AD ===

[[Aristotle]] incorporated ichthyology into formal scientific study. Between 333 and 322 BC, he provided the earliest [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of fish, accurately describing 117 species of [[Mediterranean]] fish.&lt;ref name=Gudger1934&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudger |first1=E. W. |title=The Five Great Naturalists of the Sixteenth Century: Belon, Rondelet, Salviani, Gesner and Aldrovandi: A Chapter in the History of Ichthyology |journal=Isis |date=1934 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=21-40 | jstor = 225322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Aristotle documented [[anatomy|anatomical]] and behavioral differences between [[fish]] and [[marine mammal]]s. After his death, some of his pupils continued his ichthyological research. [[Theophrastus]], for example, composed a [[treatise]] on amphibious fish. The Romans, although less devoted to science, wrote extensively about fish. [[Pliny the Elder]], a notable Roman [[natural history|naturalist]], compiled the ichthyological works of indigenous [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s, including verifiable and ambiguous peculiarities such as the [[sawfish]] and [[mermaid]], respectively. Pliny's documentation was the last significant contribution to ichthyology until the [[European Renaissance]].

=== European Renaissance ===

The writings of three 16th-century scholars, [[Hippolito Salviani]], [[Pierre Belon]], and [[Guillaume Rondelet]], signify the conception of modern ichthyology. The investigations of these individuals were based upon actual research in comparison to ancient recitations. This property popularized and emphasized these discoveries. Despite their prominence, Rondelet's ''De Piscibus Marinis'' is regarded as the most influential, identifying 244 species of fish.

=== 16th–17th century ===

The incremental alterations in navigation and shipbuilding throughout the Renaissance marked the commencement of a new epoch in ichthyology. The Renaissance culminated with the era of exploration and colonization, and upon the cosmopolitan interest in navigation came the specialization in naturalism. [[Georg Marcgrave]] of [[Saxony]] composed the ''Naturalis Brasilae'' in 1648. This document contained a description of 100 species of fish indigenous to the [[Brazil]]ian coastline. In 1686, [[John Ray]] and [[Francis Willughby]] collaboratively published ''[[Historia Piscium]]'', a scientific manuscript containing 420 species of fish, 178 of these newly discovered. The fish contained within this informative literature were arranged in a provisional system of classification.

[[File:Deckblatt zu einem der Hauptwerke von Peter Artedi.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' by Peter Artedi]]
The classification used within the ''Historia Piscium'' was further developed by [[Carl Linnaeus]], the &quot;father of modern taxonomy&quot;. His [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] approach became the systematic approach to the study of organisms, including fish. Linnaeus was a professor at the [[University of Uppsala]] and an eminent [[botany|botanist]]; however, one of his colleagues, [[Peter Artedi]], earned the title &quot;father of ichthyology&quot; through his indispensable advancements. Artedi contributed to Linnaeus's refinement of the principles of taxonomy. Furthermore, he recognized  five additional [[order (biology)|orders]] of fish: Malacopterygii, Acanthopterygii, Branchiostegi, Chondropterygii, and [[Plagiuri]]. Artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements of anatomical features that are modernly exploited. Another associate of Linnaeus, [[Albertus Seba]], was a prosperous [[pharmacist]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Seba assembled a cabinet, or collection, of fish. He invited Artedi to use this assortment of fish; unfortunately, in 1735, Artedi fell into an Amsterdam canal and drowned at the age of 30.

Linnaeus posthumously published Artedi's manuscripts as ''Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus'' (1738). His refinement of taxonomy culminated in the development of the [[binomial nomenclature]], which is in use by contemporary ichthyologists. Furthermore, he revised the orders introduced by Artedi, placing significance on [[pelvic fin]]s. Fish lacking this appendage were placed within the order Apodes; fish containing abdominal, thoracic, or jugular pelvic fins were termed Abdominales, Thoracici, and Jugulares, respectively. However, these alterations were not grounded within evolutionary theory. Therefore, over a century was needed for [[Charles Darwin]] to provide the intellectual foundation needed to perceive that the degree of similarity in taxonomic features was a consequence of [[phylogenetic]] relationships.

=== Modern era ===

Close to the dawn of the 19th century, [[Marcus Elieser Bloch]] of [[Berlin]] and [[Georges Cuvier]] of [[Paris]] made attempts to consolidate the knowledge of ichthyology. Cuvier summarized all of the available information in his monumental ''[[Histoire Naturelle des Poissons]]''. This manuscript was published between 1828 and 1849 in a 22-volume series. This document describes 4,514 species of fish, 2,311 of these new to science. It remains one of the most ambitious treatises of the modern world. Scientific exploration of the Americas advanced knowledge of the remarkable [[diversity of fish]]. [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur]] was a student of Cuvier. He made a cabinet of fish dwelling within the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]] regions.

Adventurous individuals such as [[John James Audubon]] and [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] figure in the faunal documentation of North America. They often traveled with one another. Rafinesque wrote ''Ichthyologic Ohiensis'' in 1820. In addition, [[Louis Agassiz]] of [[Switzerland]] established his reputation through the study of freshwater fish and the first comprehensive treatment of palaeoichthyology, ''Poisson Fossil's''. In the 1840s, Agassiz moved to the United States, where he taught at [[Harvard University]] until his death in 1873.

[[Albert Günther]] published his ''Catalogue of the Fish of the British Museum'' between 1859 and 1870, describing over 6,800 species and mentioning another 1,700. Generally considered one of the most influential ichthyologists, [[David Starr Jordan]] wrote 650 articles and books on the subject and served as president of [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] and [[Stanford University]].

'''Single non-transferable vote''' or '''SNTV''' is an [[electoral system]] used in multi-member constituency elections. It is a generalization of [[first-past-the-post]], applied to multi-member constituencies.

==Voting==
In any election, each voter casts one vote for one candidate in a multi-candidate race for multiple offices. Posts are filled by the candidates with the most votes. Thus, in a three-seat constituency, the three candidates receiving the largest numbers of votes would win office.

SNTV can be used with non-partisan ballots.&lt;ref&gt;Amy, D.J. Behind The Ballot Box: A Citizens Guide To Voting Systems. Praeger Publishers Westport, CT (2000) 128. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Three seats are to be filled among five candidates: A, B, C, D and E fielded by 3 parties X, Y and Z.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border-collapse:collapse;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Votes

|-
|819
|A

|Y
|-
|1,996
|C
|Z
|-
|1,999
|D
|Z
|-
|2,718
|E
|Y
|}
C, D and E are the winning candidates.

But counting the votes by party gives:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border-collapse:collapse;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Party
! Votes
! Percent
! Seats
|-
|Y
|4,522
|48
|1
|-
|Z
|3,995
|43
|2
|-
|X
|819
|9
|0
|}

Party Y has more votes than Party Z, but fewer seats because of an inefficient spread of votes across the candidates. If either party had risked trying to win all three seats, then Party X would have a higher chance of winning a seat, in the event of an uneven distribution of votes.

==Proportional representation==
SNTV facilitates minority representation.&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, A. Pintor, R.L. Sone, Y. “The Limited Vote and the Single Nontransferable Vote: Lessons form the Japanese and Spanish Examples.” Electoral Laws and their Political Consequences. Ed. Bernard Gromfman and Arend Lijphart.  Agathon Press, INC., New York 2003. 154-169. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

SNTV only tends to result in [[proportional representation]] when political parties have accurate information about their relative levels of electoral support, and nominate candidates in accordance with their respective levels of electoral support. Given ''n'' candidates to be elected, Candidate A can guarantee success by receiving one more than 1/(''n''+1) of the votes (the [[Droop quota]]), because ''n'' other candidates cannot all receive more than Candidate A. It can be very difficult for parties to receive representation proportional to their strength, because it is difficult to accurately judge their strength prior to deciding how many candidates to field ([[strategic nomination]]). If they field too many, supporters' votes might be [[split vote|split]] across too many candidates, spreading their vote numbers to the point where all of a party's candidates lose to a less thinly spread opposing party. If a party fields too few candidates, they might not field enough candidates to win seats proportional to their level of support, and the winning candidates would have more support than necessary and thus [[wasted vote effect|wasting]] votes.

The risks of poor strategic nomination are not equal for parties of various strengths. A large party would have much more to lose from the split vote effect than to gain from avoiding the wasted vote effect, and so would likely decide to err on the side of fielding fewer candidates (but probably not less than their existing number of seats). A small party with little representation would be more risk-tolerant and err on the side of too many candidates, hoping to gain seats greater than its proportion of the electorate, perhaps by edging out candidates from larger parties with just a few votes.

SNTV electoral systems, like STV and [[Proportional representation|proportional electoral]] systems generally, typically produce more proportional electoral outcomes as the size of the electoral districts (number of seats in each constituency) increases.

==Potential for tactical voting==
The potential for [[tactical voting]] in a single non-transferable vote system is large. Receiving only one vote, the rational voter must only vote for a candidate that has a chance of winning, but will not win by too great a margin, thus taking votes away from party colleagues. This also creates opportunities for tactical nominations, with parties nominating candidates similar to their opponents' candidates in order to split the vote. SNTV has been measured through the lens of such concepts as ''decision-theoretic analysis''. Professor [[Gary W. Cox]], an expert on SNTV, has studied this system’s use in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Cox G.W. “Strategic Voting Equilibria Under the Single Nontransferable Vote.” The American Political Science Review 88.3 (Sep., 1994) 608 Print&lt;/ref&gt; Cox has an explanation of real-world data finding the, “two systems [plurality and semi-proportional] are alike in their strategic voting equilibria.”&lt;ref&gt;Cox 608&lt;/ref&gt; His research found that voters use the information offered in campaigns (polls, reporting, fundraising totals, endorsements, etc.), to rationally decide who the most viable candidates are and then vote for them.

SNTV can result in complicated intra-party dynamics because in a SNTV system, a candidate must not only run against candidates from the other party, but must also run against candidates from their own party.

Because running on issues may lead to a situation in which a candidate becomes too popular and therefore draws votes away from other allied candidates, SNTV may encourage legislators to join factions that consist of patron-client relationships in which a powerful legislator can apportion votes to his or her supporters.

In addition, parties must ensure that their supporters evenly distribute their votes among the party's candidates. Historically, in [[Taiwan]], the [[Kuomintang]] did this by sending members a letter telling them which candidate to vote for. With the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], vote sharing is done informally, as members of a family or small group will coordinate their votes. The [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] had a surprisingly effective system by asking party supporters to vote for the candidate that corresponded to their birthdate. This led to a system of [[vote allocation]] which had been adopted by all parties for the [[2004 Republic of China legislative election|2004 ROC legislative elections]].

==Usage==
SNTV is used for elections in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Elections in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Elections in Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Elections in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Elections in Japan|Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Elections in Thailand|Thailand]] and Libya.

===Puerto Rico===
In [[Puerto Rico]], where SNTV is known as ''at-large representation'' (&quot;representación por acumulación&quot; in Spanish), political parties vary the ballot order of their candidates across electoral divisions, in order to ensure each candidate has a roughly equal chance of success. Since most voters choose the candidates placed at the top of their party lists on their ballots, at-large candidates from the same party usually obtain approximately equal vote totals.

The two major Puerto Rican political parties, the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] and the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]], usually nominate six candidates for each chamber, while the much smaller [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] runs single-candidate slates for both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The overall distribution of legislative seats is largely determined by the results for the sixteen Senate and forty House district seats, elected by [[Plurality voting system|plurality voting]].

===Japan, South Korea and Taiwan===
SNTV was once used to elect the legislatures of [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), but its use has been discontinued for the most part. It is still used in Japan for some seats in the [[House of Councillors]] (Sangi-in), prefectural assemblies and municipal assemblies.

In Taiwan it used for the six aboriginal seats in the [[Legislative Yuan]] (national legislature), as well as local assemblies. The party structure there was complicated by the fact that while members of the [[Legislative Yuan]] were elected by SNTV, executive positions were (and still are) elected by a [[first past the post]]. This created a party system in which smaller factionalized parties, which SNTV promotes, have formed two large coalitions that resembles the [[Duverger's law|two party system which first past the post rewards]]. Starting with the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|2008 legislative elections]], SNTV was discarded in favor of a mixed ''single member district'' (SMD) with proportional representation based on national party votes, similar to Japan.

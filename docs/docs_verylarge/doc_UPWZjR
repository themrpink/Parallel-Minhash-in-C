==== War of 1812 ====

During the [[War of 1812]], both the British and the American governments used privateers, and the established system was very similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Tabarrok, Alexander (Winter 2007). &quot;The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Privateers&quot;.

Overall some 200 of the ships took prizes. The cost of buying and fitting of a large privateer was about $40,000 and prizes could net $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_EXH.WR.21|title=12 AT MIDNIGHT; THE HIBERNIA ATTEMPTING TO RUN THE COMET DOWN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[Thomas Boyle]] was one of the famous and successful American privateers. He commanded the Baltimore schooner [[Comet (1810 clipper)|''Comet'']] and then later in the war the Baltimore clipper [[Chasseur (1812 clipper)|''Chasseur'']]. He captured over 50 British merchant ships during the war.

In total, the Baltimore privateer fleet of 122 ships sunk or seized 500 British ships with an estimated value of $16&amp;nbsp;million, which accounts about one-third of all the value of all prizes taken over the course of the whole war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maryland privateers, War of 1812|last=Huntsberry, Thomas Vincent|date=1983|publisher=J.

&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:JDe Wolf.jpg|thumb|[[James De Wolf]]]]On April 8, 1814, the British [[Essex, Connecticut#The Great Attack|attacked Essex, Connecticut, and burned the ships in the harbor]], due to the construction there of a number of privateers. This was the greatest financial loss of the entire War of 1812 suffered by the Americans. However, the private fleet of [[James De Wolf]], which sailed under the flag of the American government in 1812, was most likely a key factor in the naval campaign of the war. De Wolf's ship, the ''Yankee'', was possibly the most financially successful ship of the war. Privateers proved to be far more successful than their US Navy counterparts, claiming three-quarters of the 1600 British merchant ships taken during the war (although a third of these were recaptured prior to making landfall). One of the more successful of these ships was the ''[[Prince de Neufchatel]]'', which once captured nine British prizes in swift succession in the [[English Channel]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[Jean Lafitte]] and his privateers aided US General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the defeat of the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in order to receive full pardons for their previous crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay62&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay69&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay70&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay71&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay77&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson formally requested clemency for Lafitte and the men who had served under him, and the US government granted them all a full pardon on February 6, 1815.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay82&quot;&gt;Ramsay (1996), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll (1852) pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of the ships captured by the Americans were recaptured by the Royal Navy. British convoy systems honed during the Napoleonic Wars limited losses to singleton ships, and the effective blockade of American and continental ports prevented captured ships being taken in for sale. This ultimately led to orders forbidding US privateers from attempting to bring their prizes in to port, with captured ships instead having to be burnt. Over 200 American privateer ships were captured by the Royal Navy, many of which were turned on their former owners and used by the British blockading forces. Nonetheless, during the War of 1812 the privateers &quot;swept out from America’s coasts, capturing and sinking as many as 2,500 British ships and doing approximately $40 million worth of damage to the British economy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== 1856 Declaration of Paris ====
The US was not one of the initial signatories of the 1856 [[Declaration of Paris]] which outlawed privateering, and the [[Constitution of the Confederate States|Confederate Constitution]] authorized use of privateers. However, the US did offer to adopt the terms of the Declaration during the [[American Civil War]], when the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] sent several [[Confederate privateer|privateers]] to sea before putting their main effort in the more effective commissioned raiders.

Most of the supplies brought into the Confederacy were carried aboard privately owned vessels. When word came about that the Confederacy was willing to pay almost any price for military supplies, various interested parties designed and built specially designed lightweight seagoing steamers, [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] specifically designed and built to outrun Union ships on [[Union blockade|blockade]] patrol.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Cochran, ''Blockade Runners of the Confederacy'' (U of Alabama Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Warships were recruited by the insurgent governments during [[Spanish American wars of independence]] to destroy Spanish trade, and capture Spanish Merchant vessels. The private armed vessels came largely from the United States. Seamen from Britain, the United States, and France often manned these ships.

A '''people mover''' or '''automated people mover''' ('''APM''') is a type of small scale [[automated guideway transit]] system. The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks.

The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was [[Transit Expressway Revenue Line|Skybus]], an automated mass transit system [[prototype]]d by the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] beginning in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlSkybus in Pittsburgh&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/Skybus.html |title=Skybus in Pittsburgh |accessdate=2010-04-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210165740/http://www.brooklineconnection.com/history/Facts/Skybus.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/westinghouse/burnham.asp |last=Massey |first=Steve |title=Who killed Westinghouse? | newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |accessdate=2007-11-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117055951/http://www.post-gazette.com/westinghouse/burnham.asp |archivedate=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/Our_Company/history/Timeline/1940_1979.shtm |title = Westinghouse Company Timeline (1940–1979) |publisher = Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC |accessdate = 2007-11-12 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819061405/http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/Our_Company/history/Timeline/1940_1979.shtm |archivedate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, alternately called the People Mover and [[Minirail]], opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called [[PeopleMover]] or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] and that opened at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Weiss |first= Werner |url= http://www.yesterland.com/peoplemover.html |title= PeopleMover at Disneyland |website= Yesterland.com |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071107092839/http://yesterland.com/peoplemover.html |archivedate= 2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Now, however, the term &quot;people mover&quot; is generic, and may use technologies such as [[monorail]], [[rail track]]s, automated guideway transit or [[Maglev train|maglev]]. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, [[linear motor]]s or [[Cable car (railway)|cable traction]].

Generally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is &quot;automated guideway transit&quot;, which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as &quot;[[group rapid transit]]&quot; (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to [[mass transit]] systems, and there is no clear cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term &quot;[[light metro]]&quot; is also applied to describe the system worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Taplin |url=http://www.lrta.org/world/worldind.html |title=A world of trams and urban transit - A complete listing of Light Rail, Light Railway, Tramway &amp; Metro systems throughout the World |publisher=Light Rail Transit Association (LRTA) |date=March 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008201538/http://lrta.org/world/worldind.html |archive-date=2007-10-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/metros/korean-city-opens-automatic-light-metro.html?channel=542#.T_yoifVQT2k |title=Korean city opens automatic light metro |website=Rail Journal.com |accessdate=2014-11-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106102915/http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/metros/korean-city-opens-automatic-light-metro.html?channel=542#.T_yoifVQT2k |archivedate=2014-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-promises-light-metro-in-bhopal-and-indore-2037210 |title=BJP promises light metro in Bhopal and Indore |website=dnaindia.com |accessdate=2014-11-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205145459/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-bjp-promises-light-metro-in-bhopal-and-indore-2037210 |archivedate=2014-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end.

The carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 British Pathe (agency)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611090212/http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=8750 |date=2011-06-11 }} Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925), see at 01:24 for analyzing the guiding system&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulton Archive:[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/modified-tractor-running-on-the-never-stop-railway-at-the-news-photo/3314382 modified tractor running on the 'Never Stop Railway'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723122027/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/modified-tractor-running-on-the-never-stop-railway-at-the-news-photo/3314382 |date=2013-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm | title = Exhibiting the Empire | newspaper = The Tribune | location = Chandigarh | accessdate = 2006-11-06 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312051308/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm | archivedate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson ===
[[File:PHX SKY TRAIN.jpg|thumb|[[PHX Sky Train]] in Phoenix, Arizona, United States opened in 2013]]

In late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of [[conveyor belt]]s and [[conveyor system|systems]],&lt;ref name=&quot;StephensWeb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephens-adamson.com/about.htm|title=About S-A|publisher=Stephens-Adamson|accessdate=2014-01-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318200854/http://www.stephens-adamson.com/about.htm|archivedate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.]], if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear's ability to move materials in large quantities on [[conveyor belts]] they should consider moving batches of people.

Four years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor.
Goodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components.

A Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at {{convert|1.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving [[handrail]]. Customers were expected to include [[airport terminal]]s, [[ballpark]]s, [[train station]]s, etc.  Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called [[moving walkway]]s.

A Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small [[handcart]]s etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than [[escalator]]s or [[elevator]]s. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the [[Hudson and Manhattan]] Railroad Station in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] to connect the [[Erie Railroad]] to the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad|Hudson and Manhattan Tubes]]. This unit was {{convert|227|ft|m}} long with a rise of {{convert|22|ft|m}} on a 15 degree [[Grade (slope)|grade]], and only cost $75,000.

A Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point &quot;A&quot; passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] in [[New York City]] between [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]] and [[Grand Central (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Grand Central]] station.

The first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in ''There's Adventure in Civil Engineering'' by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' in the 1950s in their &quot;Career&quot; series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruzic|first=Neil|title=There's Adventure in Civil Engineering |asin=B0007E9RTY|year=1958|publisher= Popular Mechanics Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles.

Colonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the [[New York City Board of Transportation]], had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole [[New York City Subway]] system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, [[Madison Square Garden]], Times Square, Grand Central and several new [[office complex]]es together. Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed.

In November 1954 the [[New York City Transit Authority]] issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in ''Time'' magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading &quot;Subway of the Future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Subway of the Future|publisher= [[Time Inc.|Time]]|date=November 15, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties.

[[Chocolate World]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in California, and [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.

The term 'people mover' was used by [[Walt Disney]], when he and his [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineers]] were working on the new 1967 [[Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the [[PeopleMover]]. According to Imagineer [[Bob Gurr]], &quot;the name got stuck,&quot; and it was no longer a working title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Starting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used [[hovercraft]] techniques or various [[magnetic levitation]] systems.

Two major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, [[Demag|Mannesmann Demag]] and [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] developed a system known as [[Cabinentaxi]] during the 1970s. Cabinentaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were &quot;offline&quot;, allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.

In the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, [[Rohr, Inc.|Rohr]]'s [[ROMAG]], [[Ling-Temco-Vought|LTV]]'s [[Vought Airtrans|AirTrans]], [[Ford]]'s APT and [[Otis Elevator]]'s hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO'72 at [[Dulles Airport]] where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s.  One notable example was Pittsburgh's Skybus, which was proposed by the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion.  A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities.  However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system.  This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the US, the [[Metromover]] in [[Miami]], and the [[Detroit People Mover]]. The [[Jacksonville Skyway]] was built in the late 1980s.

==From development to implementation==
Although many government-funded systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world's first airport people movers, the [[Tampa International Airport People Movers]], were installed in 1971 at [[Tampa International Airport]] in the [[United States]]. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States.

Driver-less metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to &quot;mass&quot; transit (the largest operating expense is the driver's salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. [[Rennes]], [[Lausanne]], [[Brescia]], etc.) are now doing so.

On September 30, 2006, the [[Peachliner]] in [[Komaki, Aichi|Komaki]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]] became that nation's first people mover to cease operations.

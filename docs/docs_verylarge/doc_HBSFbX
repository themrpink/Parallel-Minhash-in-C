'''Pope Anicetus''' was the [[bishop of Rome]] from c. 157 to his death in April 168.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;Campbell, Thomas (1907). &quot;Pope St. Anicetus&quot; in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', the start of his papacy may have been 153. Anicetus actively opposed [[Gnosticism]] and [[Marcionism]]. He welcomed [[Polycarp|Polycarp of Smyrna]] to Rome, to discuss the controversy over the date for the celebration of Easter.

==Biography==
According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', Anicetus was a Syrian from the city of [[Emesa]] (modern-day Homs).&lt;ref name=Pontif&gt;{{Cite book
    |publisher = Liverpool University Press
    |ol = 8283722M
    |isbn = 9780853235453
    |author = Raymond Davis
    |title = Book of the Pontiffs (Liber Pontificalis) (Liverpool University Press - Translated Texts for Historians)
    |publication-date = January 1, 2001|page=5
    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Irenaeus]], it was during his pontificate that the aged Polycarp of Smyrna, a disciple of [[John the Evangelist]], visited Rome to discuss the celebration of [[Passover]] with Anicetus. Polycarp and his Church of Smyrna celebrated the crucifixion on the [[Quartodeciman|fourteenth day of Nisan]], which coincides with [[Pesach]] (or Passover) regardless of which day of the week upon this date fell, while the Roman Church celebrated the Pasch on Sunday—the weekday of [[Jesus]]'s [[resurrection]]. The two did not agree on a common date, but Anicetus conceded to Polycarp and the Church of Smyrna the ability to retain the date to which they were accustomed. The controversy was to grow heated in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Irenaeus&gt;Irenaeus, cited in Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 5.24; translated by G.A. Williamson, ''Eusebius: History of the Church'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965), pp. 232f&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian historian [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] also visited [[Rome]] during Anicetus's pontificate. This visit is often cited as a sign of the early importance of the [[Roman See]].&lt;ref name=Irenaeus/&gt;

Anicetus actively opposed the [[Gnostic]]s and [[Marcionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicsaints.info/book-of-saints-anicetus/ Monks of Ramsgate. “Anicetus”. ''Book of Saints'', 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 20 July 2012]{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Liber Pontificalis'' records that Anicetus decreed that priests are not allowed to have long hair (perhaps because the Gnostics wore long hair).&lt;ref name=Pontif/&gt;

According to church tradition, Anicetus suffered [[martyrdom]] during the reign of Emperor [[Lucius Verus]], but there are no historical grounds for this account.&lt;ref name=CR&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 16, 17 and 20 April are all cited as the date of his death, but 20 April is currently celebrated as his [[feast day]].&lt;ref name=MR&gt;Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1970, the date chosen was 17 April.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; The ''Liber Pontificalis'' states he was buried in the cemetery of Callistus.&lt;ref name=Pontif/&gt;

'''Catherine of Valois''' (27 October 1401 – 3 January 1437) was the [[queen consort]] of England from 1420 until 1422. A daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], she married [[Henry V of England]],{{sfn|Haigh|2000|p=345}} and gave birth to his heir [[Henry VI of England]]. Her liaison (and possible [[secret marriage]]) with [[Owen Tudor]] proved the springboard of that family's fortunes, eventually leading to their grandson's elevation as [[Henry VII of England]].{{sfn|Williams|Fraser|2000|p=19}} Catherine's older sister [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]] was [[List of British consorts|queen of England]] from 1396 until 1399, as the [[child marriage|child bride]] of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].

==Early life==
Catherine of Valois was the youngest daughter of King Charles VI of France and his wife [[Isabeau of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Fritze|Robison|1992|p=94}} She was born at the [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]] (a royal palace in Paris) on 27 October 1401. Early on, there had been [[arranged marriage|a discussion of marrying her]] to the [[Prince of Wales]], the son of [[Henry IV of England]], but the king died before negotiations could begin. In 1414, the prince, now [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], re-opened discussion of the match, along with a large dowry and acknowledgement of his [[English claim to the French throne|right to the throne of France]].

While some authors have maintained that Catherine was neglected as a child by her mother, a more modern examination of the evidence suggests otherwise. According to the financial accounts of her mother, toys befitting a French princess were purchased, religious texts were provided, and Catherine was sent to the convent in [[Poissy]] to receive a religious education.{{sfn|Gibbon|1996|pp=51–63}}

==Royal marriage==

Henry V went to war with France, and even after the great English victory at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], plans for the marriage continued. Catherine was said to be very attractive and when Henry finally met her at [[Meulan]], he became enamoured. In May 1420, a peace agreement was made between England and France, the [[Treaty of Troyes]], and Charles acknowledged Henry of England as his heir. Catherine and Henry were married at the Parish Church of St John or at [[Troyes Cathedral]] on 2 June 1420. Catherine went to England with her new husband and was crowned queen in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 February 1421. In June 1421, Henry returned to France to continue his military campaigns.

By this time, Catherine was several months pregnant and gave birth to a son named [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Her husband never saw their child. During the [[siege of Meaux]], he became sick and died on 31 August 1422, just before his 36th birthday.{{sfn|Allmand|1992|pp=173–174}} Catherine was not quite 21 and was left a [[queen dowager]].  Charles VI died a couple of months after Henry V, making the young [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] king of England and English-occupied northern France. Catherine doted on her son during his early childhood.

==Relationship with Owen Tudor==&lt;!-- A link in the infobox links to this heading --&gt;
Catherine was still young and marriageable, a source of concern to her brother-in-law [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], the guardian of her son. Rumours abounded that Catherine planned to marry [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Count of Mortain]], her late husband's cousin. The Duke of Gloucester was strongly against the match, however, and the Parliament of 1427–8 passed a bill which set forth the provision that if the queen dowager remarried without the king's consent, her husband would forfeit his lands and possessions, although any children of the marriage would not suffer punishment. The king's consent was contingent upon his having attained his majority. At that time, the king was only six years old.

Catherine lived in the king's household, presumably so she could care for her young son, but the arrangement also enabled the councillors to watch over the queen dowager herself. Nevertheless, Catherine entered into a sexual relationship with [[Wales|Welshman]] [[Owen Tudor|Owen ap Maredudd ap Tudor]], who, in 1421, in France, had been in the service of Henry V's steward Sir [[Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford|Walter Hungerford]]. Tudor was probably appointed keeper of Catherine's household or wardrobe. The relationship began when Catherine lived at [[Windsor Castle]], and she became pregnant with their first child there. At some point, she stopped living in the King's household and in May 1432 Parliament granted Owen the [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of an Englishman]]. This was important because of Henry IV's laws limiting the rights of Welshmen.

[[Image:Arms of Catherine of Valois.svg|thumb|right|upright|Catherine of Valois's arms as queen consort]]

There is no known date of Catherine's marriage to Owen,{{sfn|Griffiths|Thomas|2005|p=35}} and yet there is no contemporaneous evidence that the validity of the marriage and the legitimacy of her children were questioned in secular or canon law.{{sfn|Chrimes|1980|pp=320–333}} From the relationship of Owen Tudor and Queen Catherine descended the [[Tudor dynasty]] of England, starting with [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]]. Tudor historians asserted that Owen and Catherine had been married, for their lawful marriage would add respectability and stronger royal ties to the claims of the Tudor dynasty.

Owen and Catherine had at least six children. [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund]], [[Jasper Tudor|Jasper]] and Owen were all born away from court. They had one daughter, Margaret, who became a nun and died young.

==Death and aftermath==
Catherine died on 3 January 1437, shortly after childbirth, in London, and was &quot;buried in the old Lady chapel&quot; of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Harvey|2003|p=27}} While the death date is not in question the cause is, with an equal number of records stating that she did not die [[maternal mortality|as a result of childbirth]], but entered [[Bermondsey Abbey]], possibly seeking a cure for an illness that had troubled her for some time. She made her will just three days before her death. She now rests at Westminster Abbey in Henry V's [[Chantry]] Chapel. After her death, Catherine's enemies decided to proceed against Owen for violating the law of the remarriage of the queen dowager. Owen appeared before the council, was subsequently arrested, and taken to [[Newgate Prison]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=9–10}} He tried to escape from [[Newgate Prison]] in early 1438 and eventually ended up at [[Windsor Castle]] in July of that year.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=9–10}}

Meanwhile, Owen and Catherine's two older sons, Edmund and Jasper, went to live with [[Katherine de la Pole]], [[Barking Abbey|Abbess of Barking]] and sister of [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]. Sometime after 1442, the king (their half-brother) took a role in their upbringing. Owen, their father, was eventually released on £2000 bail, but was pardoned in November 1439 (and the bail cancelled in 1440). Owen was treated well afterwards and was a member of the king's household until the mid-1450s. He lived until 1461, when he was executed by the [[Yorkist]]s following the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]] in [[Herefordshire]]. Their sons were given earldoms by Catherine's son King Henry VI. Edmund married [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], a descendant of John of Gaunt who had consequently a distant claim to the throne; following the elimination by war of most other candidates, their son became [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]].

The wooden [[funeral effigy]] which was carried at Catherine's funeral still survives at Westminster Abbey, and was previously on display in the [[Westminster Abbey Museum]] in the [[Undercroft]]. It is now displayed in the new Queen's Diamond Jubilee Gallery in the abbey [[triforium]]. Her tomb originally boasted an [[alabaster]] memorial, which was deliberately destroyed during extensions to the abbey in the reign of her grandson, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. It has been suggested that Henry ordered her memorial to be removed to distance himself from his [[illegitimate]] ancestry. At this time, her coffin lid was accidentally raised, revealing her corpse, which for generations became a tourist attraction. In 1669 the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] kissed the long-deceased queen on his birthday: 
{{Quotation|On Shrove Tuesday 1669, I to the Abbey went, and by favour did see the body of Queen Catherine of Valois, and had the upper part of the body in my hands, and I did kiss her mouth, reflecting upon it I did kiss a Queen: and this my birthday and I thirty-six years old and I did kiss a Queen.|Samuel Pepys}}
Catherine's remains were not properly re-interred until the reign of [[Queen Victoria]].

'''Fishbourne Roman Palace''' is in the village of [[Fishbourne, West Sussex|Fishbourne]], [[Chichester]] in [[West Sussex]]. The [[palace]] is the largest residential Roman building discovered in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cunliffe (1998), ''Fishbourne Roman Palace''. The History Press. {{ISBN|0752414089}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an unusually early date of 75 AD, around thirty years after the [[Roman conquest of Britain]].

Much of the palace has been excavated and is preserved, along with an on-site museum. The rectangular palace surrounded formal gardens, the northern parts of which have been reconstructed.

Extensive alterations were made in the 2nd and 3rd centuries when many of the original black and white mosaics were overlaid with more sophisticated coloured work, including the perfectly preserved dolphin mosaic in the north wing. More alterations were in progress when the palace burnt down in around 270, after which it was abandoned.

==Discovery and excavation==
Although local people had known of the existence of Roman remains in the area, it was not until 1960 that the [[archaeologist]] [[Barry Cunliffe]] first systematically excavated the site, which had been accidentally uncovered by Aubrey Barrett, an engineer working for Portsmouth Water Company who was laying a new water main across a field. The [[Roman villa]] excavated by Cunliffe's team was so large that it became known as Fishbourne Roman Palace, and a museum was erected to protect and preserve some of the remains ''in situ''. This is administered by the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]].

In size, it is approximately equivalent to [[Nero]]'s [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]] in [[Rome]] or to the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near to [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]], and in plan it closely mirrors the basic organisation of the emperor [[Domitian]]'s palace, the [[Domus Flavia]], completed in AD 92 upon the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Russell, ''Roman Sussex'', Tempus (2006) pp. 113-132; Miles Russell, ''Bloodline - the Celtic Kings of Roman Britain'', Amberley (2010), pp. 172-77&lt;/ref&gt; Fishbourne is by far the largest Roman residence known north of the [[Alps]]. At about 500 feet (150 m) square, it has a larger footprint than [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britain AD, Episode I&quot;&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1674914830350674131# Britain AD, Episode I]&lt;/ref&gt;

A museum was built by the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]], incorporating most of the visible remains including one wing of the palace. The gardens were re-planted using authentic plants from the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. A team of volunteers and professional archaeologists are involved in a continuing research [[archaeological excavation]] on the site of nearby, possibly military, buildings. The last dig was in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;John Manley, ''Facing the Palace'', Sussex Archaeological Society (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace closed in March 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in England|COVID-19 pandemic]]. The Sussex Archaeological Society lost an estimated £1 million in income from visitors, and in June began a fundraising appeal so that it could continue maintaining Fishbourne Roman Palace along with other properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morton|first=Sam|date=16 June 2020|title=Fishbourne Roman Palace under threat of permanent closure - Urgent fundraising appeal launched to save historic building|work=Chichester Observer|url=https://www.chichester.co.uk/news/fishbourne-roman-palace-under-threat-permanent-closure-urgent-fundraising-appeal-launched-save-historic-building-2885304|access-date=17 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siting==
The location of Fishbourne, in proximity to [[Chichester]] (''[[Noviomagus Reginorum]]''), is often looked to when discussing the opulent wealth represented at Fishbourne as well as solidification for the claim of [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus|Cogidubnus]] as the villa owner. The city of Chichester was in the heart of the dominant [[Atrebates]] tribe, but their early introduction to Roman imperialism created a pseudo-friendly relationship between the Romans and the Atrebates. The tribal people in the area were later called the ''[[Regnenses|Regnii]]'' after being ruled by Roman client kings for so long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishbourne: A Roman Palace and Its Garden|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1971|location=London|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first buildings on the site were [[granary|granaries]], over 33m long, apparently a supply base for the [[Roman army]] constructed in the early part of the [[Roman invasion of Britain|conquest]] in 43 AD. Later, two residential timber-frame buildings were constructed, one with clay and mortar floors and plaster walls which appears to have been a house of some comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cunliffe (1998), Fishbourne Roman Palace. The History Press. {{ISBN|0752414089}} p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

These buildings were demolished in the AD 60s and replaced nearby with an elaborate and substantial stone-walled villa, or proto-palace, in about 65 AD which included a courtyard garden with colonnades and a bath suite, together with two other buildings, and using material taken from the earlier buildings. It was decorated with wall paintings, stucco mouldings and ''[[opus sectile]]'' marble polychrome panels. The life-size head of a young man carved in marble, found during excavations in 1964, and identified as a likeness of [[Nero]] aged 13 created at, or shortly after, his formal adoption by the [[emperor]] [[Claudius]] in AD 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.11141/ia.32.5|title = Finding Nero: shining a new light on Romano-British sculpture| journal=Internet Archaeology| issue=32|year = 2013|last1 = Russell|first1 = Miles| last2=Manley| first2=Harry| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably originated from the proto-palace. Foreign, probably Italian, craftsmen had to be employed at this early period. This building was not unique in this area as the villa at [[Angmering]] was similar in many respects and suggests a number of aristocrats living in the area who must have used the same workforce.

The full-size palace with four residential wings surrounding a formal courtyard garden of {{convert|250|by|320|ft|m|abbr=off|round=5}} was built in around 75–80 AD and took around 5 years to complete, incorporating the proto-palace in its south-east corner.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cunliffe, ''Excavations at Fishbourne 1961-1969'', Society of Antiquaries (1971), p.49 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Massive levelling of the vast site reached up to {{convert|5|ft|m|1|abbr=off}} in places. The gardens were surrounded by [[colonnades]] in the form of a [[peristyle]].

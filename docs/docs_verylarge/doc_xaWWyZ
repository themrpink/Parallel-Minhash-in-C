Berle's career as an entertainer spanned over 80 years, first in silent films and on stage as a child actor, then in radio, movies and television. As the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]'' (1948–1955), he was the first major American television star and was known to millions of viewers as &quot;Uncle Miltie&quot; and &quot;Mr. Television&quot; during the [[Golden Age of Television|first Golden Age of Television]]. He was honored with two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work in both [[radio]] and [[TV]].

==Early life==
Milton Berle was born into a [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Baum|title=L.A.'s Power Golf Clubs: Where the Hollywood Elite Play|date=June 23, 2011|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-power-golf-clubs-hollywood-205072|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; family in a five-story walkup at 68 [[118th Street (Manhattan)|W. 118th Street]] in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]. His given name was Mendel Berlinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milton Berle (obituary)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/29/guardianobituaries|accessdate=24 June 2014|work=The Guardian|date=29 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jewish virtual library&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Milton Berle (1908 – 2002)|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Berle.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jns org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gluck|first1=Robert|title=How Jewish television pioneer Milton Berle inspired modern comedy stars|url=http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2014/8/28/how-jewish-television-pioneer-milton-berle-inspired-modern-comedy-stars#.VHDHnIvF98E|website=JNS.org|publisher=Jewish and Israel news|accessdate=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129060327/http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2014/8/28/how-jewish-television-pioneer-milton-berle-inspired-modern-comedy-stars#.VHDHnIvF98E|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose Milton Berle as his professional name when he was 16. His father, Moses Berlinger (1873–1938), was a paint and varnish salesman. His mother, Sarah (Sadie) Glantz Berlinger (1877–1954),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2CQeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NpgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5278,3741070&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Milton Berle's Mother Dies|date=1 June 1954|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed her name to Sandra Berle when Milton became famous. He had three older brothers (from oldest to youngest): Phil, Frank and Jack Berle. For many years, the latter two worked as Berle's TV production staff members, while Phil Berle was a program executive at NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju5CCTAJMq8|title=Milton Berle Interview (1956)|date=1956|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child actor==
Berle entered show business in 1913 at the age of five when he won a children's Charlie Chaplin contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-07-14-tv-3253-story.html|title=Milton Berle - First in Comedy|date=14 July 1991|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;childwonder&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853738,00.html The Child Wonder]&quot;. ''Time'', 16 May 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a [[child actor]] in [[silent films]]. He claimed ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' as his first film appearance, playing the character of a young boy, though this has never been independently verified.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/berlemilton/berlemilton.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications – Encyclopedia of Television|work=museum.tv|access-date=2005-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910183857/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/berlemilton/berlemilton.htm|archive-date=2005-09-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Milton Berle: An Autobiography'', he explained that the director told him that he would portray a little boy who would be thrown from a moving train. He said, &quot;I was scared shitless, even when he went on to tell me that Pauline would save my life. Which is exactly what happened, except that at the crucial moment they threw a bundle of rags instead of me from the train. I bet there are a lot of comedians around today who are sorry about that.&quot;

By Berle's account, he continued to play child roles in other films: ''Bunny's Little Brother'', ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1914 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]'', ''Birthright'', ''Love's Penalty'', ''Divorce Coupons'' and ''Ruth of the Range''. Berle recalled, &quot;There were even trips out to Hollywood—the studios paid—where I got parts in ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'', with [[Mary Pickford]]; ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]], and ''[[Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914 film)|Tillie's Punctured Romance]]'', with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mabel Normand]] and [[Marie Dressler]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt; However, Berle's claim to have appeared in ''Tillie's Punctured Romance'' has been disputed by film historians, among them Glenn Mitchell, who in his book, ''The Chaplin Encyclopedia'', writes that Berle's alleged role was most likely played by child actor [[Gordon Griffith]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Glenn: ''The Chaplin Encyclopedia'' (B. T. Batsford Ltd., 1997), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Berle enrolled in the [[Professional Children's School]].&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;Newcomb, Horace. Editor, ''Encyclopedia of Television'', vol. I, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, (1997) pp. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
Around 1920, at age 12, Berle made his stage debut in a revival of the musical comedy ''[[Florodora]]'' in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], which later moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. By the time he was 16, he was working as a Master of Ceremonies in Vaudeville. In 1932, he starred in [[The_Earl_Carroll_Vanities|Earl Carrol's &quot;Vanities&quot;]], a Broadway Musical. By the early 1930s he was a successful stand-up comedian, patterning himself after one of Vaudeville's top comics, [[Ted Healy]].

===Rising star===
In 1933, he was hired by producer [[Jack White (film producer)|Jack White]] to star in the theatrical featurette ''Poppin' the Cork'', a topical musical comedy concerning the repealing of Prohibition. Berle also co-wrote the score for this film, which was released by [[Educational Pictures]]. Berle continued to dabble in songwriting. With [[Ben Oakland]] and Milton Drake, Berle wrote the title song for the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] release ''Li'l Abner'' (1940), an adaptation of [[Al Capp]]'s comic strip, featuring [[Buster Keaton]] as Lonesome Polecat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html Entertainment Magazine: Astor Pictures, ''Li'l Abner'' (1940)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228075002/http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html |date=2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle wrote a [[Spike Jones]] B-side, &quot;Leave the Dishes in the Sink, Ma.&quot;

===Radio===
From 1934 to 1936, Berle appeared regularly on ''[[Rudy Vallee|The Rudy Vallee Hour]]'', and he attracted publicity as a regular on ''The Gillette Original Community Sing'', a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of ''[[Stop Me If You've Heard This One]]'' with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioArchives2011&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1940s, he canceled well-paying nightclub appearances to expand his radio career.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioArchives2011&quot;/&gt; ''Three Ring Time'', a comedy-variety show sponsored by [[Ballantine Ale]], was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soups]]. The audience participation show ''Let Yourself Go'' (1944–1945) could best be described as &quot;[[slapstick]] radio&quot;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges—often directed at host Berle. ''Kiss and Make Up'', on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the judge. Berle also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioArchives2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioarchives.com/Milton_Berle_Show_p/ra017.htm|title=The Milton Berle Show|publisher=RadioArchives|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scripted by [[Hal Block]] and [[Martin Ragaway]], ''The Milton Berle Show'' brought Berle together with [[Arnold Stang]], later a familiar face as Berle's TV sidekick. Others in the cast were [[Pert Kelton]], Mary Schipp, [[Jack Albertson]], [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], [[Ed Begley]], Brazilian singer [[Dick Farney]], and announcer [[Frank Gallop]]. Sponsored by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947 until April 13, 1948.

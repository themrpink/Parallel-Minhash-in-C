In China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.

[[File:Faloodeh1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In Iran, the most popular ice cream-like treat is ''faludeh'' (also called ''paloodeh'', ''paludeh'' or ''fālūdhaj''), which contains [[vermicelli]] noodles, sugar syrup and [[rose water]]. It is often served with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice and sometimes ground [[pistachio]]s.]]
In 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in [[Paris]], and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafés opened in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Visser|first=Margaret|title=Much Depends on Dinner|publisher=Grove Atlantic Press|year=1999|edition=illustrated|page=297|isbn=978-0-8021-3651-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iijF4QSwPssC|access-date=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procope.com/|title=Restaurant Le Procope|publisher=procope.com|language=it|access-date=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or ''pagotó'' ({{lang-el|παγωτό}}), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.

India is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.

In [[Indonesia]], a type of traditional ice cream called ''es puter'' or &quot;stirred ice cream&quot; is made from [[coconut milk]], [[pandanus]] leaves, [[sugar]]—and flavors that include [[avocado]], [[jackfruit]], [[durian]], [[palm sugar]], [[chocolate]], [[Adzuki bean|red bean]], and [[mung bean]].

In Iran, ''[[Faloodeh|fālūde]]'' (Persian: فالوده) or ''pālūde'' (Persian: پالوده) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and [[rose water]]. The dessert is often served with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice and sometimes ground [[pistachio]]s.

Italian ice cream, or ''[[gelato]]'' as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in [[Italy]]. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in &quot;produzione propria&quot; gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.

''[[Sorbetes]]'' is a Philippine version of common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name ''sorbetes'' and ''[[sorbet]]'', sorbetes is not a type of sorbet.

In Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many cafés or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafés may also sell flavours like nata, [[crema catalana]], or [[tiramisu]].

''[[Dondurma]]'' is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, [[salep]], and [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]].

In the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/store/product.aspx?id=81857|title=Ice Cream – UK |date=September 2009|work=just-food.com|publisher=Aroq Ltd|access-date=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Philadelphia style&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/PEACH-ICE-CREAM-PHILADELPHIA-STYLE-101911 |title=Peach Ice Cream, Philadelphia Style |access-date=24 September 2008 |publisher=[[CondéNet, Inc.]], reprinted from William Morrow and Co.'s The Ultimate Ice Cream Book |author=Weinstein, Bruce |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a [[custard]] is sometimes called &quot;French ice cream&quot;. American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% [[Butterfat|milk fat]]. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year—the most in the world.

[[Agnes Marshall]] was a celebrated [[food writing|cookery writer]] of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the [[Royal Institution]].

Reliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the [[Syria]]n [[waffle]] booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert J. |last=Weir |url=http://www.historicfood.com/Ice%20Cream%20Cone.htm |title=An 1807 Ice Cream Cone: Discovery and Evidence |publisher=Historicfood.com |year=2004 |access-date=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Linda |last=Stradley |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IceCream/IceCreamCone.htm |title=Ice Cream Cone, History of Ice Cream Cone |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net |year=2004 |access-date=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.subzeroicecream.com/press/coldfacts2006.pdf|title=Mmmm...Cryogenically Frozen Ice Cream|journal=Cold Facts|year=2006|volume=22|issue=3|pages=6–7|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331031542/http://www.subzeroicecream.com/press/coldfacts2006.pdf|archive-date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation results in a column of white condensed [[water vapor|water vapour]] cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still &quot;steaming&quot; with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available [[dry ice]], and authors such as [[Heston Blumenthal]] have published recipes to produce ice cream and [[sorbet]] using a simple blender.&lt;ref&gt;Heston At Home- Heston Blumenthal&lt;/ref&gt;

Another vendor, ''Creamistry'', creates ice cream from liquid ingredients as customers watch. It has a softer texture than regular ice cream, because ice crystals have less time to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Creamistry mixes ice cream and science with delicious results |author=Katherine Whaley |date=18 May 2017 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |url=http://abc13.com/food/creamistry-mixes-ice-cream-and-science-with-tasty-results/2007414/ |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''commodity''' is an economic [[goods|good]] that has full or substantial [[fungibility]]: that is, the [[Market (economics)|market]] treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who [[Production (economics)|produced]] them.&lt;ref name=&quot;commexamples&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm |title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Commodity definition |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commodity |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=T. |first1=H. |title=What makes something a commodity? |url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/01/03/what-makes-something-a-commodity |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=The Economist |date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller [[profit margin|profit margins]] and diminishes the importance of factors (such as [[brand|brand name]]) other than price.

Most commodities are [[raw material]]s, basic resources, [[agriculture|agricultural]], or [[mining]] products, such as [[iron ore]], [[sugar]], or [[grain|grains]] like [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. Commodities can also be [[mass-produced]] unspecialized products such as [[chemical substance|chemicals]] and [[computer memory]].

==Etymology==
The word ''commodity'' came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French ''[[:wikt:commodité#French|commodité]]'', &quot;amenity, convenience&quot;. Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:commoditas#Latin|commoditas]]'', meaning &quot;suitability, convenience, advantage&quot;. The Latin word ''[[:wikt:commodus#Latin|commodus]]'' (from which English gets other words including ''commodious'' and ''accommodate'') meant variously &quot;appropriate&quot;, &quot;proper measure, time, or condition&quot;, and &quot;advantage, benefit&quot;.

== Description ==

===Characteristics=== 
In economics, the term ''commodity'' is used specifically for economic goods that have full or partial but substantial [[fungibility]]; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref name=&quot;commexamples&quot; /&gt; Karl Marx described this property as follows: &quot;From the taste of [[wheat]], it is not possible to tell who produced it, a [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serf]], a French peasant or an English [[capitalist]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]], &quot;[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum]] and [[copper]] are examples of commodity goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |author2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in action |publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

Non-commodity items such as [[stereo]] systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the [[brand]], the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets.

=== Hard and soft commodities ===
[[Soft commodity|Soft commodities]] are goods that are grown, such as [[wheat]], or [[rice]].

Hard commodities are [[mining|mined]]. Examples include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[helium]], and [[petroleum|oil]].

Energy commodities include electricity, gas, [[coal]] and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is produced.

== Commoditization ==
[[Commoditization]] occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the [[intellectual capital]] necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium [[Profit margin|margins]] for [[Market (economics)|market]] [[wikt:participation|participants]] have become commodities, such as [[Generic drug|generic pharmaceuticals]] and [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM chips]]. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites [[multivitamin]] supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50&amp;nbsp;mg tablet of [[calcium]] is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=Natasha Singer |author2=Peter Lattman |title=Workout Supplement Challenged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/business/a-soldiers-parents-take-aim-at-gnc-and-a-supplement-maker.html?hpw&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this trend, [[nanomaterials]] are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.&lt;ref&gt;C. McGovern, ″Commoditization of nanomaterials″. ''Nanotechnology Perceptions'' '''6''' (2010) 155–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of &quot;commodity versus differentiable product&quot;. Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where [[electricity market#Retail electricity market|energy choice]] lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as &quot;[[Organic food|organic]] versus not&quot; or &quot;[[Free-range eggs|cage free]] versus not&quot; count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or [[Forest Stewardship Council]] [[Certified wood|certification]] count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.

==Commodity trade==
{{Main article|Futures exchange|Commodity market}}
In the original and simplified sense, '''''commodities''''' were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.

[[Commodities exchange]]s include:&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;

[[Commodity market|Markets for trading commodities]] can be very [[economic efficiency|efficient]], particularly if the division into pools matches demand [[market segmentation|segments]]. These markets will quickly respond to changes in [[supply and demand]] to find an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[price]] and quantity. In addition, investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a [[commodity price index]].

In order to [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] their investments and mitigate the risks associated with [[inflation]]ary debasement of currencies, [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s allocate capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities and commodity-related infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;turkishweekly&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=M.

== Inventory data ==
The [[inventory]] of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a &quot;[[stockout]]&quot; (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a [[convenience yield]] by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ssrn|last=Gorton |first=GB |display-authors=etal |year=2007 |ssrn=996930 |title=The Fundamentals of Commodity Futures Returns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical political economy and especially in [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service (&quot;product&quot; or &quot;activity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;) produced by [[labour power|human labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 38 and &quot;Capital&quot; as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are external to man.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', p. 87 and &quot;Capital&quot; as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some objects attain &quot;[[use value]]&quot; to persons in this world, when they are found to be &quot;necessary, useful or pleasant in life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politica'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Use value&quot; makes an object &quot;an object of human wants&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Capital in General: The Commodity&quot; contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;a means of subsistence in the widest sense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Capital in General: The Commodity&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became &quot;commodities&quot;. According to Marx, commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are &quot;exchanged in a market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'' p. 36 and &quot;Capital&quot; as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, &quot;use value&quot; is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an &quot;exchange value&quot;—a value that could be expressed in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 131 and David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: 1971, London) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. [[Adam Smith]] maintained that exchange value was made up of [[economic rent|rent]], [[economic profit|profit]], [[labor economics|labour]] and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]], a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources (&quot;earth itself is an instrument of labour&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 179 and &quot;Capital&quot; as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the [[economic value]] of goods, using the [[labour theory of value|labor theory of value]]. This problem was extensively debated by [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books, London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow]] among others.

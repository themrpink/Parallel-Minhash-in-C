The importance of ''opera buffa'' diminished during the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]]. Here, the forms were freer and less extended than in the serious genre and the set numbers were linked by recitativo secco, the exception being [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' in 1843. With Rossini, a standard distribution of four characters is reached: a prima donna soubrette (soprano or mezzo); a light, amorous tenor; a basso cantante or baritone capable of lyrical, mostly ironical expression; and a basso buffo whose vocal skills, largely confined to clear articulation and the ability to &quot;patter&quot;, must also extend to the baritone for the purposes of comic duets.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Burton D. ''The Barber of Seville'' (Opera Classics Library Series)&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of comedy could vary, and the range was great: from [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' in 1816 which was purely comedic, to [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' in 1786 which added drama and pathos. Another example of Romantic ''opera buffa'' would be Donizetti's ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' of 1832.

==Relation to and differences from ''opera seria''==
While opera seria deals with gods and ancient heroes and only occasionally contained comic scenes, ''opera buffa'' involves the predominant use of comic scenes, characters, and plot lines in a contemporary setting. The traditional model for opera seria had three acts, dealt with serious subjects in mythical settings, as stated above, and used high voices (both [[soprano]]s and [[castrati]]) for principal characters, often even for monarchs.

In contrast, the model that generally held for ''opera buffa'' was having two acts (as, for example, ''The Barber of Seville''), presenting comic scenes and situations as earlier stated and using the lower male voices to the exclusion of the [[castrato|castrati]].&lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John; West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of the characteristic &quot;[[basso buffo]]&quot;, a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] who was the center of most of the comic action. (A well-known basso buffo role is Leporello in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.)

'''Nord-Pas-de-Calais''' ({{IPA-fr|nɔʁ.pɑ.də.ka.lɛ|lang|Fr-Paris--Nord-Pas-de-Calais.ogg}}; (Old) [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Noord Nauw van Kales) is a former [[regions of France|administrative region]] of [[France]]. Since 1 January 2016, it has been part of the new region [[Hauts-de-France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reform law&quot;&gt;{{cite French law|number or usual name=n° 2015-29|date in French=16 janvier 2015|full name=relative à la délimitation des régions, aux élections régionales et départementales et modifiant le calendrier électoral|language=French|lower case=|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=9FECBA9D9314D1D2C093CF793C886ED5.tpdila21v_1?idSectionTA=JORFSCTA000030109623&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030109622&amp;dateTexte=29990101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of the [[departments of France|departments]] of [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] and [[Pas-de-Calais]]. Nord-Pas-de-Calais borders the [[English Channel]] (west), the [[North Sea]] (northwest), [[Belgium]] (north and east) and [[Picardy]] (south). The majority of the region was once part of the historical (Southern) [[Netherlands]], but gradually became part of France between 1477 and 1678, particularly during the reign of king [[Louis XIV]]. The historical [[Provinces of France|French provinces]] that preceded Nord-Pas-de-Calais are [[Artois]], [[French Flanders]], [[French Hainaut]] and (partially) Picardy. These provincial designations are still frequently used by the inhabitants.

With its 330.8 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on just over 12,414&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is a densely populated region, having some 4.1 million inhabitants, 7% of France's total population, making it the fourth most populous region in the country, 83% of whom live in urban communities. Its administrative centre and largest city is [[Lille]]. The second largest city is [[Calais]], which serves as a major continental economic/transportation hub with [[Dover]] of Great Britain {{convert|42|km|mi}} away; this makes Nord-Pas-de-Calais the closest [[continental Europe]]an connection to the [[Great Britain]]. Other major towns include [[Valenciennes]], [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], [[Douai]], [[Béthune]], [[Dunkirk]], [[Maubeuge]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[Arras]], [[Cambrai]] and [[Saint-Omer]].  The region is featured in numerous films, including ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]''.

==Name==
&lt;!-- This section is a redirect target from [[French Netherlands]] --&gt;
''Nord-Pas-de-Calais'' combines the names of the constituent departments of [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] (literally 'North', the northernmost [[department of France]]) and [[Pas-de-Calais]] ('Strait of Calais', the [[French language|French]] name of the [[Strait of Dover]]). The regional council, however, spells the name ''Nord-Pas de Calais''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordpasdecalais.fr/institution/quEstCe/intro.asp Région Nord-Pas de Calais: ''Qu'est ce que la Région?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105051250/http://nordpasdecalais.fr/institution/quEstCe/intro.asp |date=5 January 2011 }} Retrieved 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern part of the region was historically a part of the [[County of Flanders]], with [[Douai]] as its capital.

Other alternative names are ''Région Flandre(s)-Artois'', ''Hauts-de-France'', ('Upper France') and ''Picardie-du-Nord'' ('Northern [[Picardy]]').

==History==
{{hatnote|See also:  {{Interlanguage link multi|History of Nord-Pas-de-Calais|fr|3=Histoire du Nord-Pas-de-Calais}}}}
[[File:Lianefleuve.JPG|thumb|[[Liane (river)|Liane]] in [[Pas-de-Calais]]]]
Inhabited since prehistoric times, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region has always been a strategic (and hence one of the most fought-over) region in Europe. French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who was born in Lille, called the region a &quot;fatal avenue&quot; through which invading armies repeatedly passed. Over the centuries, it was conquered in turn by the Celtic [[Belgae]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the Germanic [[Franks]], England, the [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish]] and [[Austrian Netherlands]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. After the final French annexation in the early 18th century, much of the region was again occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.

During the 4th and 5th centuries, the Roman practice of co-opting Germanic tribes to provide military and defense services along the route from Boulogne to Cologne created a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]–[[Romance languages|Romance]] linguistic border in the region that persisted until the 8th century. By the 9th century, most inhabitants north of Lille spoke a dialect of Middle Dutch, while the inhabitants to the south spoke a variety of Romance dialects. This linguistic border is still evident today in the place names of the region. Beginning in the 9th century, the linguistic border began a steady move to north and the east. By the end of the 13th century, the linguistic border had shifted to the river Lys in the south and Cap-Griz-Nez in the west.&lt;ref name=Ryckeboer&gt;{{cite journal

During the Middle Ages, the Pas-de-Calais department comprised [[Count of Boulogne|County of Boulogne]] and the [[Artois|County of Artois]], while the Nord department was mostly made up of the southern portions of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[County of Hainaut]].  Boulogne, Artois, and Flanders were fiefs of the French crown, while Hainaut and after 1493 Flanders were within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Calais]] was an English possession from 1347 to 1558, when it was recovered by the French throne.  In the 15th century, all of the territories, except Calais, were united under the rule of the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]], along with other territories in northern France and areas in what is now [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]].  With the death of the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477, the Boulonnais and Artois were seized by the French crown, while Flanders and Hainaut were inherited by Charles's daughter [[Mary of Burgundy|Marie]].  Shortly thereafter, in 1492, Artois was ceded back to Marie's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]], as part of an attempt to keep Philip's father, Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], neutral in French King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII's]] prospective invasion of Italy.
[[File:Douai - Vue à partir du Beffroi (06).JPG|thumb|[[Douai]]]]
Thus, most of the territories of what is now Nord-Pas-de-Calais were reunited to the Burgundian inheritance, which had passed through Marie's marriage to the [[House of Habsburg]].  These territories formed an integral part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the Netherlands as they were defined during the reign of Philip's son, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], and passed to Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]]. During the [[Italian Wars]] much of the conflict between France and Spain occurred in the region. When [[Eighty Years' War|the Netherlands revolted against Spanish rule]], beginning in 1566, the territories in what is now Nord-Pas-de-Calais were those most loyal to the throne, and proved the base from which the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] was able to bring the whole southern part of the Netherlands back under Spanish control. It was also a base for Spanish support of French Catholics in the [[French Wars of Religion]].
[[File:TourbièreVredGroupe3Roselière.jpg|thumb|Bog of Vred, natural reserve]]
During the wars between France and Spain in the 17th century ([[Thirty Years' War|1635]] [[Franco-Spanish War (1653–59)|–1659]], [[War of Devolution|1667–68]], [[Franco-Dutch War|1672–78]], [[Nine Years' War|1688–97]]), these territories became the principal seat of conflict between the two states and French control over the area was gradually established. Beginning with the annexation of Artois in 1659, most of the current Nord department territory had been acquired by the time of the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] in 1678.  The current borders were mostly established by the time of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697.

The area, previously divided among the French provinces of [[French Flanders|Flanders]], [[Artois]], and [[Picardy]], was divided into its two present departments following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. Under [[Napoleon]], the French boundary was extended to include all of Flanders and present-day Belgium until the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 restored the original French boundary.

During the 19th century, the region underwent major industrialisation and became one of the leading industrial regions of France, second only to [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. Nord-Pas-de-Calais was barely touched by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870; the war actually helped it to cement its leading role in French industry due to the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany. However, it suffered catastrophic damage in the two World Wars of the 20th century.
[[File:Avion-glissoires7.jpg|thumb|[[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]]]

===World War I===
When the [[First World War]] started, the region became a strategic target for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]], mostly because of the coal and mining resources. When the German troops launched their attack from Belgium, the region was one of the first to fall under German occupation. Nevertheless, when the Allies stopped Germany at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of Marne]], the front moved back to the area and stabilized near [[Arras]].
During the next four years, the region was split in two: the German holding the [[French Flanders]] and Cambrai area, the Allied controlling Arras and the Area of Lens. Nevertheless, the combat did not stop, each side wanting the total control of the area.
[[File:Vimy Memorial (September 2010) cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] near Arras]]

The Nord pas de Calais was one of the main theaters of the conflict, with many battles occurring between 1914 and 1918, including the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] assault during the [[Battle of Arras (1917)]], the [[Third Battle of Artois|Battle of Artois]], [[Battle of Loos]] and the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]]. By the time the region was finally liberated by the Canadian Expeditionary Forces, the entire country was devastated and Arras had been 90% destroyed. Currently, there are 650 military cemeteries throughout the Nord-Pas-de Calais, mostly British and Canadian, as well as large memorials such as the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] and [[Notre Dame de Lorette]], the world's largest French military cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwar.co.uk/french-flanders-artois/memorial-canadian-national-vimy-memorial.htm |title=Canadian National Vimy Memorial, France |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |website=The Great War UK |publisher=The Great War UK |access-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

During the [[occupation of France]], it was attached to the [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France]], ruled from the [[Wehrmacht]] ''kommandantur'' in Brussels. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais region was used for [[vengeance weapon]] installations, including extensive [[V-1 flying bomb (facilities)|V-1 &quot;ski sites&quot;]] that launched attacks on England and massive [[bunker]]s for the [[V-2 rocket]] and [[V-3 cannon#Mimoyecques site|V-3 cannon]]. [[Operation Crossbow]] counteroffensive bombing by the Allies devastated many of the region's towns.  Although most of the region was liberated in September 1944, Dunkirk was the last French town to be freed from German occupation (on 9 May 1945).

Since the war, the region has suffered from severe economic difficulties (see Economy below) but has benefited from the opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] and the growth in cross-Channel traffic in general.

While the region is predominantly French-speaking, it also has two significant [[minority language]] communities: the western [[Flemings]], whose presence is evident in the many Dutch place names in the area and who speak [[West Flemish]], a dialect of Dutch (perhaps 20,000 inhabitants of Nord-Pas-de-Calais use Flemish daily and an estimated 40,000 use it occasionally, both primarily in and around the arrondissement of Dunkirk&lt;ref name=Flemish&gt;{{cite journal

Although neighbouring Belgium currently recognizes and fosters both Picard and Dutch, and a few city-level governments within Nord-Pas-de-Calais have introduced initiatives to encourage both languages,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} the national French government maintains a [[Language policy in France|policy of linguistic unity]] and generally ignores both languages,&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the [[Constitution of France]] states that &quot;French is the language of the Republic&quot;; see [[language policy in France|the article on French linguistic policy]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; as it does with other regional languages in France.

The region's ethnic diversity has been affected by repeated waves of immigrant workers from abroad: Belgians and Welsh before 1910; Poles and Italians in the 1920s and 1930s; Eastern European groups and Germans since 1945; and North Africans and Portuguese since 1960;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=17070&amp;reg_id=19&amp;page=pages_de_profils/P11_89/P11_89.htm Chronologie de l'immigration en Nord-Pas-de-Calais], [[INSEE]]&lt;/ref&gt; and large cities like Lille, Calais, and Boulogne-sur-Mer are home to sizable communities of British, Dutch, Scandinavian, Greek and Balkans, Sub-Saharan African, and Latin American immigrants and their descendants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The French state has sought to boost the region's relatively neglected culture. In 2004, it was announced that a branch of the [[Louvre]] would be opened in the city of Lens. For decades, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais has been viewed as a [[conservatism|conservative]] region when compared culturally to the rest of France,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but recently the region has at times displayed [[left-wing]] tendencies. In the early 2000s, the leftist [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]] won the largest number of votes to nearly carry a majority in regional and local representation. The Greens managed to attract many conservative voters from small towns and farmers moved by the Greens' commitment to boosting agri-industry. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The region's religious profile is representative of France as a whole, with the majority being [[Roman Catholic]].  Other Christian groups are found in the region: [[Protestants]] have a few churches. North Africans have introduced Islam to the region, and small but growing communities of Buddhists have been established in recent years. In World War II, 18,000{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} of the region's French Jews were victims of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation, but a small [[History of the Jews in France|Jewish community]] remains active as it has been for hundreds of years.

==Economy==

===General data===
In 2014, the Nord-Pas de Calais [[GDP]] reached €140 billion making it the 4th biggest French economy, although this figure has to be put in the context of the large population of the region. The region was only in 16th place out of 24 for GDP per capita in 2014 with €34,422.

The unemployment rate is higher than the national average. About 11% of the population was unemployed in 2014, particularly people aged between 18 and 25.

The economy is essentially led by the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]], which employs 75% of the working population, followed by manufacturing (23%) and agriculture (2%).

=== Agriculture and fishing ===
Due to its location close to the [[North Sea]], the Nord-Pas de Calais region has a strong [[fishing industry]].

The [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] harbor is the biggest French port in terms of capacity with more than 150 boats. 45,000 tons of fish were traded there in 2012. The harbor is also a leading European [[seafood]] processing center with 380,000 tons of shellfish, fish and [[algae|seaweed]] traded every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port du peche|publisher=Port de Boulogne-sur-Mer|url=http://www.portboulogne.com/port-de-peche.html|access-date=2013-01-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220013002/http://www.portboulogne.com/port-de-peche.html|archivedate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 140 companies are present in the port.

The agricultural sector comprises 13,800 farm businesses using {{convert|820000|ha|acre}} of farmland. The temperate climate as well as great fertility makes the region a leading production center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/regions/nord-pas-de-calais/reg-dep.asp?theme=10&amp;suite=1 |title=Insee - Régions |publisher=Insee.fr |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nord-Pas de Calais region supplied 26.1 million tons of wheat (approximately 7% of the national production) and a third of the French potato production.

=== Industry ===
The region's industry was originally focused on coal and textile production, and was one of the cradles of the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the continent. After the end of the Second World War, migrant workers from all over Europe came to the region, making up for population losses due to the war. In the 1970s, the leading coal and textile industries began to fade away and unemployment rates increased rapidly. The region started a process of restructuring which still continues today. Nowadays, the manufacturing sector is led by the [[automobile industry]].

==== Automobile industry ====
In the 1970s, the sector represented a small part of the working population. Some 40 years later, it is the main industry in the region, employing 55,000 people. In terms of productivity, the Nord-Pas de Calais region is ranked second nationwide and is one of the main export areas.

Three main worldwide car manufacturers operate plants in the region: [[Toyota]] produce the [[Toyota Yaris|Yaris]] in [[Valenciennes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota-valenciennes.com |title=Toyota : Usine Toyota Valenciennes, Fabrication Yaris |publisher=Toyota-valenciennes.com |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renault]] build the [[Renault Scénic|Scénic]] in [[Douai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renault.com/fr/groupe/developpement-durable/fiches-sites/pages/douai.aspx |title=Le groupe automobile Renault |publisher=Renault.com |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] operate a plant in [[Lieu-Saint-Amand]] where [[Peugeot 807]], [[Citroën C8]], [[Fiat Scudo]], [[Peugeot Expert]] and [[Citroën Jumpy]] are fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sevelnord.psa.fr/index.php?id=536 |title=Les véhicules du site |publisher=Sevelnord.psa.fr |access-date=2016-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182735/http://www.sevelnord.psa.fr/index.php?id=536 |archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, automotive equipment manufacturers such as [[Faurecia]] employ 6,200 workers in the region. Small-scale manufacturers have also been based in the region, such as [[microcar]] manufacturers [[Automobiles ERAD|ERAD]], Savel, and Secma.

Nord-Pas de Calais is the second main region for the automotive industry in France after Île de France (Paris region). The sector trade fair, the Forum on European Automotive Industry in Lille Region (FEAL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Autoforumlille|url = http://www.autoforumlille.eu/|website = Autoforumlille|access-date = 2015-04-12|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150427014518/http://www.autoforumlille.eu/|archive-date = 27 April 2015|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place biennially to showcase the industry of the region and its importance for France and Europe.

==== Food industry ====
The food industry in Nord-Pas de Calais draws on the agricultural sector of the region. By income, this is the most important industry of the region due to strong exports (€3.2bn in 2006). More than 27,000 employees were employed in the sector in 2007. Many global corporations such as [[McCain Foods]], [[Roquette Freres]], [[Bonduelle]], [[Pasquier]] or [[Boulangeries Paul]] are present in the Nord-Pas de Calais region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/regions/nord-pas-de-calais/default.asp?page=themes/dossiers_de_profils/dp_96/dp_96.htm |title=Insee - Régions |publisher=Insee.fr |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Services ===

==== Mulliez Family ====
The services sector of the Nord-Pas de Calais region is dominated by the multi-billionaire [[Association Familiale Mulliez|Mulliez family]], who own the main superstore chains of the region, some of which are known worldwide: [[Auchan]], [[Decathlon (retailer)|Decathlon]] or [[Leroy Merlin]] as well as the [[Flunch]] [[restaurant chain]]. The family also holds a stake in [[3 Suisses]], [[Norauto]] and many other companies.

==Transport Infrastructures==
[[File:Carte ancienne du Nord-Pas-de-Calais.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A map of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region from the early 1920s, showing the road and railway network of that time.]]
As most of its population is urbanized, the region has a dense and complex transport system of [[highway]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airport]] and [[seaport]]s.

=== Highways ===
Nine highways are passing through the region; most of them are free:
* [[A1 highway (France)|A1]] between [[Lille]] and [[Paris]]
* [[A2 autoroute (France)|A2]] towards [[Brussels]]

=== Railways ===

==== Eurotunnel ====
Since 1994, the Nord-Pas de Calais region is linked to the United Kingdom by the Eurotunnel. The structure comprises three tunnels (one single-track railway tunnel each way and a service road tunnel for maintenance and emergency use) and has the longest undersea tunnel section of the world ({{convert|38|km|mi}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/ |title=The Channel Tunnel infrastructure |publisher=Eurotunnelgroup.com |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole structure is {{convert|50|km|mi}} long and connects [[Coquelles|Coquelles, France]] with [[Folkestone|Folkestone, UK]]. Between its official opening and 2012, 300 million passengers have crossed the [[English Channel]] aboard [[Eurostar]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/eurotunnel-celebrates-300-million-passengers/ |title=Eurotunnel celebrates 300 million passengers &amp;#124; News |publisher=Breaking Travel News |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Eurostar services, the tunnel is used by trains carrying road vehicles, branded as [[Eurotunnel Shuttle|Le Shuttle]], as well as freight trains.

==== TER-Nord ====
The [[Transport express régional|TER]]-Nord is the regional rail network operated by the [[SNCF]]. It links the major cities and villages throughout Nord-Pas de Calais. The network is controlled by the [[Conseil régional]].

=== Air transportation ===
The main airport of Nord-Pas de Calais is [[Lesquin Airport]] near [[Lille]]. Originally a regional hub, the airport now has several international routes to destinations in Europe and the Maghreb.

=== Inland and International freight transport ===

==== Dunkirk harbour ====
Dunkirk Harbour is one of the biggest seaports of France. It is the third-largest port nationally in terms of total volume but first in fruit and [[copper]] imports. A terminal able to handle [[LNG carrier]]s is built by [[Total S.A.|Total]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunkerque-port.fr/fr/presse/actualites/2011-06-02-terminal-methanier-demarrage-des-travaux-preparatoires-fr-14080.html |title=TERMINAL MÉTHANIER : DÉMARRAGE DES TRAVAUX PRÉPARATOIRES - Actualité du port de Dunkerque |publisher=Dunkerque-port.fr |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canal Seine-Nord ====
The [[Seine–Nord Europe Canal|Canal Seine-Nord]] is a future high-capacity canal between the [[Seine]] and [[Arleux]] in order to connect the former to the other northern canals in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. It is due to open in 2016. The project has attracted controversy mostly because of its huge cost (€4.6bn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picardie.france3.fr/info/canal-seine-nord-projet-suspendu--75290982.html |title=France 3 Picardie - Actualités |language=fr|publisher=Picardie.france3.fr |access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

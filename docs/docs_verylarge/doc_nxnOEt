Although this never occurred, in 1949, the South West Africa Affairs Act was amended to give representation in the [[Parliament of South Africa]] to whites in South West Africa, which gave them six seats in the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] and four in the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;''Official Documents of the 4th Session of the United Nations General Assembly''], United Nations, 1949, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MaU7AQAAMAA&amp;pg=PA11 page 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was to the advantage of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which enjoyed strong support from the predominantly [[Afrikaner]] and [[German Namibians|ethnic German]] white population in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Newell M. Stultz, ''Afrikaner Politics in South Africa, 1934-1948'', University of California Press, 1974, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CPqYkLNxEQgC&amp;lpg=PA161 page 161] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718114505/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CPqYkLNxEQgC&amp;lpg=PA161 |date=2018-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1977, all of South West Africa's parliamentary seats were held by the National Party.&lt;ref&gt;Vivienne Jabri, ''Mediating Conflict: Decision-making and Western Intervention in Namibia''], Manchester University Press, 1990, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WRnoAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 page 46] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718114518/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WRnoAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |date=2018-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional consequence of this was the extension of [[apartheid]] laws to the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFAA1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Turok |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Turok |title=Witness from the frontline: aggression and resistance in Southern Africa |page=86 |publisher=Institute for African Alternatives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtchAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |year=1990 |isbn=187042512X |access-date=2018-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718083840/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MtchAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |archive-date=2018-07-18 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to several rulings at the [[International Court of Justice]], which in 1950 ruled that South Africa was not obliged to convert South West Africa into a UN trust territory, but was still bound by the League of Nations Mandate, with the [[United Nations General Assembly]] assuming the supervisory role. The ICJ also clarified that the General Assembly was empowered to receive petitions from the inhabitants of South West Africa and to call for reports from the mandatory nation, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/isswasummary500711.htm |title=International Status of South West Africa – Advisory Opinion |accessdate=2006-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002115908/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/isswasummary500711.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Assembly constituted the Committee on South West Africa to perform the supervisory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Chronology/index_united_nations.htm|title=Index-United Nations Organisations and Resolutions|website=www.klausdierks.com|access-date=2006-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503031804/http://klausdierks.com/Chronology/index_united_nations.htm|archive-date=2006-05-03|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another Advisory Opinion issued in 1955, the Court further ruled that the General Assembly was not required to follow League of Nations voting procedures in determining questions concerning South West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/itswasummary550607.htm |title=Voting Procedure on Questions Relating to Reports and Petitions Concerning the Territory of South West Africa – Advisory Opinion |accessdate=2006-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002114910/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/itswasummary550607.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the Court further ruled that the Committee had the power to grant hearings to petitioners from the mandated territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/icswasummary560601.htm |title=Admissibility of Hearings of Petitioners by the Committee on South West Africa – Advisory Opinion |accessdate=2006-07-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002120611/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/icswasummary560601.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] filed a case in the International Court of Justice against South Africa alleging that South Africa had not fulfilled its mandatory duties. This case did not succeed, with the Court ruling in 1966 that they were not the proper parties to bring the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idecisions/isummaries/ilsaesasummary621221.htm |title=South West Africa Cases (Preliminary Objections) Ethiopia v.

===Mandate terminated===

There was a protracted struggle between South Africa and forces fighting for independence, particularly after the formation of the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) in 1960.

In 1966, the General Assembly passed resolution 2145 (XXI) which declared the Mandate terminated and that the Republic of South Africa had no further right to administer South West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, res n° 2154 (XXI), 17 November 1966. Available at http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/21/ares21.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124233301/https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/21/ares21.htm |date=2016-01-24 }} [recovered october 1, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, acting on a request for an Advisory Opinion from the [[United Nations Security Council]], the ICJ ruled that the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia was illegal and that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately. It also ruled that all member states of the United Nations were under an obligation not to recognise as valid any act performed by South Africa on behalf of Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;code=nam&amp;case=53&amp;k=a7|title=Cour internationale de Justice {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|access-date=2017-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908201222/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;code=nam&amp;case=53&amp;k=a7|archive-date=2017-09-08|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South West Africa became known as Namibia by the UN when the General Assembly changed the territory's name by Resolution 2372 (XXII) of 12 June 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/repertory/art77/english/rep_supp7_vol5-art77_e_advance.pdf Legal Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172411/http://legal.un.org/repertory/art77/english/rep_supp7_vol5-art77_e_advance.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SWAPO was recognised as representative of the [[Namibia]]n people, and gained UN observer status&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/303/35/IMG/NR030335.pdf?OpenElement UNGA Resolution A/RES/31/152] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144356/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/303/35/IMG/NR030335.pdf?OpenElement |date=2011-07-28 }} Observer status for the South West Africa People's Organisation&lt;/ref&gt; when the territory of South West Africa was already removed from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

In 1977, South Africa transferred control of [[Walvis Bay]] back to the [[Cape Province]], thereby making it an [[exclave]].&lt;ref&gt;
''The Green and the dry wood: The Roman Catholic Church (Vicariate of Windhoek) and the Namibian socio-political situation, 1971-1981'', Oblates of Mary Immaculate, 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tj8vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 page 6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718083906/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tj8vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |date=2018-07-18 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory became the independent [[Namibia|Republic of Namibia]] on 21 March 1990, although Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands remained under South African control until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/ZAF-NAM1994OI.PDF|title=Treaty between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the Government of the Republic of Namibia with respect to Walvis Bay and the off-shore Islands, 28 February 1994|access-date=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721011519/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/ZAF-NAM1994OI.PDF|archive-date=21 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bantustans===
The South African authorities established 10 [[bantustan]]s in South West Africa in the late 1960s and early 1970s in accordance with the [[Odendaal Commission]], three of which were granted self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Namibia_homelands.html|title=Namibian Homelands|first=Ben|last=Cahoon|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|access-date=2008-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525214100/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Namibia_homelands.html|archive-date=2011-05-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bantustans were replaced with separate ethnicity based governments in 1980.

The book was an immediate success.

[[File:Map of Gulliver's travels.jpg|thumb|Locations visited by Gulliver, according to Arthur Ellicott Case. Case contends that the maps in the published text were drawn by someone who did not follow Swift's geographical descriptions; to correct this, he makes changes such as placing Lilliput to the east of Australia instead of the west.

===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===
[[File:Gulliver in Liliput, Bremen.jpg|thumb|Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.]]
The travel begins with a short preamble in which [[Lemuel Gulliver]] gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

;4 May 1699&amp;nbsp;– 13 April 1702

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, &quot;a considerable person at court&quot;, he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.

===Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag===
[[File:gulliver.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver exhibited to the Brobdingnag Farmer'' (painting by [[Richard Redgrave]])]]

;20 June 1702&amp;nbsp;– 3 June 1706

Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship ''Adventure'' is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the [[North American]] continent.

The grass of [[Brobdingnag]] is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72&amp;nbsp;ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being {{convert|10|yd|m|0}}. The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter [[Glumdalclitch]] cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the Queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen's service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his &quot;travelling box&quot;.

Between small adventures such as fighting giant [[wasp]]s and being carried to the roof by a [[monkey]], he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannon. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England.

===Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan===

{{See also|Floating cities and islands in fiction}}

;5 August 1706&amp;nbsp;– 16 April 1710

Setting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by [[Piracy|pirates]], and he is [[Marooning|marooned]] close to a desolate rocky island near [[India]]. He is rescued by the [[Floating island (fiction)|flying island]] of [[Laputa]], a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than using armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.

Gulliver tours [[Balnibarbi]], the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the [[Royal Society]] and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of [[Lagado]] in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see [[Muckraker|muckraking]]). Gulliver is then taken to [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]], the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.

While waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of [[Glubbdubdrib]] which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the &quot;ancients versus moderns&quot; theme in the book. The ghosts include [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]].

On the island of [[Luggnagg]], he encounters the ''[[struldbrug]]s'', people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.

After reaching [[Japan in Gulliver’s Travels|Japan]], Gulliver asks [[Tenno|the Emperor]] &quot;to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of [[Fumi-e|trampling upon the crucifix]]&quot;, which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.

===Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms===
[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninimů - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 illustration by [[J.J. Grandville]]).]]

;7 September 1710&amp;nbsp;– 5 December 1715

Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a [[wikt:merchantman|merchantman]], as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew who, he believes, have turned against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of deformed savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]].

'''''The World According to Garp''''' is [[John Irving]]'s fourth novel, about a man, born out of wedlock to a feminist leader, who grows up to be a writer. Published in 1978, the book was a bestseller for several years. It was a finalist for the [[National Book Award for Fiction]] in 1979,&lt;ref name=nba1979&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1979 &quot;National Book Awards – 1979&quot;]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 14 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first paperback edition won the Award the following year.&lt;!-- National Book Awards were called &quot;American&quot; for several years from 1980, but must not be confused with [[American Book Awards]] --&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 &quot;National Book Awards – 1980&quot;].

A [[The World According to Garp (film)|movie adaptation]] of the novel starring [[Robin Williams]] was released in 1982, with a screenplay written by [[Steve Tesich]].

[[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''Classic Serial'' broadcast a three-part adaptation of the novel by Linda Marshall Griffiths in January 2014. The production was directed by Nadia Molinari and featured [[Miranda Richardson]] as Jenny, [[Lee Ingleby]] as Garp, Jonathan Keeble as Roberta and [[Lyndsey Marshal]] as Helen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 3 November 2015, Irving revealed that he'd been approached by [[HBO]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] to reconstruct ''The World According to Garp'' as a [[miniseries]]. He described the project as being in the early stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Haynes&quot;&gt;{{cite news

According to the byline of a self-penned, 20 February 2017 essay for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Irving completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on ''The World According to Garp''.

== Plot synopsis ==
The novel is about the life of T. S. Garp. His mother, Jenny Fields, is a strong-willed nurse who wants a child but not a husband. She encounters a dying [[ball turret]] gunner known only as [[Technical Sergeant]] Garp, who was severely [[brain damage]]d in combat. Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal. As a matter of practicality and kindness in making his death as comfortable as possible and reducing his agitation, she masturbates him several times. Unconstrained by convention and driven by her desire for a child, Jenny has sex with the brain-damaged Garp, impregnates herself and names the resulting son &quot;T. S.&quot; (a name derived from &quot;Technical Sergeant&quot;, but consisting of just initials). Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys Steering School in New England.

Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction—three topics in which his mother has little interest. After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to [[Vienna]], where he writes his first novella. At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, ''A Sexual Suspect''.  After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter, and begins his family—he a struggling writer, she a teacher of English. The publication of ''A Sexual Suspect'' makes his mother famous.  She becomes a [[Feminism|feminist]] icon, because feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own.  She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her. The members of the group cut off their own tongues in solidarity with the girl (the girl herself opposes this tongue cutting).

Garp becomes a devoted parent, wrestling with anxiety for the safety of his children and a desire to keep them safe from the dangers of the world. He and his family inevitably experience dark and violent events [what events?]
through which the characters change and grow. Garp learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transgender ex-football player Roberta Muldoon), who are struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance. The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp's fictional teacher) &quot;lunacy and sorrow&quot;.

The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp's first piece of fiction, a short story entitled &quot;The Pension Grillparzer&quot;; &quot;Vigilance&quot;, an essay; and the first chapter of his third novel, ''The World According to Bensenhaver''. The book also contains some motifs that appear in some, but not all, [[John Irving]] novels: bears, New England, Vienna, hotels, wrestling, and a person who prefers abstinence over sex. And, like nearly all of Irving's novels, it features a complex [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] plot which spans the protagonist's whole life. Adultery (another common Irving motif) also plays a large part, culminating in the novel's most harrowing and memorable scene.

== Background ==
John Irving's mother, Frances Winslow, had not been married at the time of his conception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irving never met his biological father. As a child, he was not told anything about his father, and he told his mother that unless she gave him some information about his biological father, in his writing he would invent the father and the circumstances of how she got pregnant. Winslow would reply, &quot;Go ahead, dear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] empire in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian]] eras for over eight hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.freersackler.si.edu/events/films/?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D128600412|title=Ctesiphon: An Ancient Royal Capital in Context |date= September 15, 2018|work=Smithsonian |access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ctesiphon remained the capital of the Sasanian Empire until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in 651 AD.

Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of [[Seleucia]]. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;The Cities&quot; ([[Aramaic]]: ''Mahuza'', {{lang-ar|المدائن}}, ''[[al-Mada'in]]''). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was listed as the [[largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world]] by some accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|publisher=geography.about.com|access-date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]], Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule.

== Names ==
The Latin name ''{{lang|la|Ctesiphon}}'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''{{transl|grc|Ktēsiphôn}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Κτησιφῶν|Κτησιφῶν]]}}). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as ''Tisfōn'' or ''Tisbōn''.&lt;ref&gt;''E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936'', Vol. 2 (Brill, 1987: {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as ''tyspwn'', which can be read as ''Tīsfōn'', ''Tēsifōn'', etc. in [[Manichean alphabet|Manichaean]] [[Parthian language|Parthian]] 𐫤𐫏𐫘𐫛𐫇𐫗, in [[Middle Persian]] 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭 and in Christian [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (in [[Syriac alphabet]]) languages. The [[New Persian]] form is ''Tisfun'' ({{lang|fa|تیسفون}}).

Texts from the [[Church of the East]]'s synods referred to the city as ''{{transl|syc|Qṭēspōn}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ}})&lt;ref name=&quot;syriaca.org&quot;/&gt; or some times ''{{transl|syc|Māḥôzē}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܡܚܘܙ̈ܐ}}) when referring to the metropolis of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]].

In modern Arabic, the name is usually ''Ṭaysafūn'' ({{lang|ar|طيسفون}}) or ''Qaṭaysfūn'' ({{lang|ar|قطيسفون}}) or as ''al-Mada'in'' ({{lang|ar|المدائن}} &quot;The Cities&quot;, referring to Greater Ctesiphon). &quot;According to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt]] [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Kröger|first=Jens|chapter=Ctesiphon|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=6|year=1993|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116013710/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|archive-date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian name of the city was ''Tizbon'' ({{lang|hy|[[wikt:Տիզբոն|Տիզբոն]]}}). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the [[Book of Ezra]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 8:17&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Old Testament]] as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name, [[Cas (people)|Cas]], and a cognate of [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Qazvin]]). It is also mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as Aktisfon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Talmud Bavli Tractate Gittin|pages=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another Talmudic reference it is written as Akistfon, located across the Tigris River from the city of Ardashir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Talmud Bavli Tractate Eruvin|pages=57b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ctesiphon-ruin 1864.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Taq Kasra]] or Ctesiphon palace ruin, with the arch in the centre, 1864]]
Ctesiphon is located approximately at [[Al-Mada'in]], {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the modern city of [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial [[Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[Taq Kasra|archway of Chosroes]] (''Taq Kasra'') was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 240).&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of [[Salman Pak]].

== History ==

===Parthian period===
Ctesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by [[Mithridates I of Parthia]]. The reign of [[Gotarzes I]] saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58&amp;nbsp;BC during the reign of [[Orodes II]]. Gradually, the city merged with the old [[Hellenistic]] capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125&quot;&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Mithradatkirt]], and [[Hecatompylos]] at [[Hyrcania]]) to the [[Scythian]] incursions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125&quot;/&gt;

[[Strabo]] abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times [[Babylon]] was the metropolis of [[Assyria]]; but now [[Seleucia]] is the metropolis, I mean the [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the [[Scythians|Scythian]] folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at [[Ecbatana]] and in [[Hyrcania]] because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16A*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book XVI Chapter 1, 16 |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the [[Roman Empire]] in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor [[Trajan]] captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, [[Hadrian]], decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general [[Avidius Cassius]] captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.

===Sasanian period===
[[File:Sasanian Asoristan and its surroundings.svg|right|thumb|Map of the southwestern Sasanian province of [[Asoristan]] and its surroundings]]
By 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the [[Sasanian Empire]], who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as [[al-Mada'in]], and in [[Aramaic]] as Mahoze.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic [[Arabic]] sources is called &quot;the Old City&quot; ({{lang|ar|مدينة العتيقة}} ''Madīnah al-'Atīqah''), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the [[White Palace (Ctesiphon)|White Palace]] ({{lang|ar|قصر الأبيض}}), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asbānbar or Aspānbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. [[Taq Kasra]] was located in the latter.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Houtsma |first1=M. Th |title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936 |date=1993 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004097919 |page=76a |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western side was known as [[Veh-Ardashir]] (meaning &quot;the good city of Ardashir&quot; in [[Middle Persian]]), known as Mahoza by the [[Jews]], Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Nestorian patriarch]]. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was [[Valashabad]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}

[[Severus Alexander]] advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by [[Herodian]], his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against [[Ardashir I]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 185).&lt;/ref&gt; In 283, emperor [[Carus]] sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. In 295, emperor [[Galerius]] was defeated outside the city. However, he returned a year later with a vengeance and won a victory which ended in the fifth and final capture of the city by the Romans in 299. He returned it to the Persian king [[Narseh of Persia|Narses]] in exchange for [[Armenia]] and western Mesopotamia. In c. 325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

After the conquest of Antioch in 541, [[Khosrau I]] built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city ''[[Weh Antiok Khusrau]]'', or literally, &quot;better than Antioch Khosrau built this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dingas, Winter 2007, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Local inhabitants of the area called the new city ''Rumagan'', meaning &quot;town of the Romans&quot; and Arabs called the city ''al-Rumiyya''. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrau built a number of fortified cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;frye&quot;&gt;Frye 1993, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau I deported 292,000 citizens, slaves, and conquered people to this new city in 542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christensen |title=The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500 |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=1993 |isbn=87-7289-259-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 590, a member of the [[House of Mihran]], [[Bahram Chobin]] repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler [[Khosrau II]] from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the [[Byzantine Empire]], reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, [[Dastagerd]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}} In 627, the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrau's son and successor, [[Kavadh II]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}

In 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper [[Shahrbaraz]], but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrau II's daughter [[Borandukht]]. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the [[House of Ispahbudhan]] and the Parsig (Persian) faction under [[Piruz Khosrow]]. {{see also|Sasanian interregnum}}

===Downfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests===
{{see| Siege of Ctesiphon (637)}}

In the mid-630s, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Arabs]], who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}} The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|early 637]].

The Muslim military officer [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] quickly seized [[Valashabad]] and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of [[Weh Antiok Khusrau]] and [[Veh-Ardashir]]. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (''[[jizya]]''). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the [[Sasanian family tree|Sasanian royal family]], [[nobility|nobles]], and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Furthermore, the throne hall in [[Taq Kasra]] was briefly used as a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Dr Julian (1999).

As walleye grow longer, they increase in weight. The relationship between total length (''L'') and total weight (''W'') for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;W = cL^b \,&lt;/math&gt;

Invariably, ''b'' is close to 3.0 for all species, and ''c'' is a constant that varies among species. For walleye, ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.180 and ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.000228 (with units in inches and pounds) or ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.180 and ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.000005337 (with units in cm and kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Anderson |first1=R. O.|last2=Neumann|first2=R. M.|title=Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices|encyclopedia= Fisheries Techniques|date=1996|editor-last1= Murphy|editor-first1=B. E.|editor-last2=Willis |editor-first2= D. W.|publisher=American Fisheries Society|edition=Second|isbn=1-888569-00-X|location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship suggests a {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} walleye will weigh about {{convert|1.5|kg|abbr=on}}, while a {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} walleye will likely weigh about {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}}.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Walleye larva (8741578944).jpg|thumb|Walleye larva]]
In most of the species' range, male walleyes mature sexually between three and four years of age. Females normally mature about a year later. Adults migrate to tributary streams in late winter or early spring to lay eggs over gravel and rock, although open-water [[reef]] or shoal-spawning strains are seen,  as well. Some populations are known to spawn on sand or vegetation. Spawning occurs at water temperatures of {{convert|6|to|10|C|F}}. A large female can lay up to 500,000 eggs, and no care is given by the parents to the eggs or fry. The eggs are slightly adhesive and fall into spaces between rocks. The incubation period for the [[embryo]]s is temperature-dependent, but generally lasts from 12 to 30 days. After hatching, the free-swimming embryos spend about a week absorbing a relatively small amount of [[Yolk#In fish|yolk]]. Once the yolk has been fully absorbed, the young walleyes begin to feed on [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[Diptera|fly]] [[larva|larvæ]] and [[Plankton|zooplankton]]. After 40 to 60 days, [[juvenile (animal)|juvenile]] walleyes become [[piscivorous]]. Thenceforth, both juvenile and [[adult]] walleyes eat fish almost exclusively, frequently [[yellow perch]] or [[Cisco (fish)|ciscoes]], moving onto bars and shoals at night to feed. Walleye also feed heavily on crayfish, minnows, and leeches.

==Taxonomy==
The walleye is part of the North American [[clade]] within the genus ''[[Sander (fish)|Sander]]'', alongside the [[sauger]] (''S. canadensis''). Hubbs [[Species description|described]] a taxon called the [[blue walleye]] (''S. glaucus'') from the Great Lakes but subsequent taxonomic work showed no consistent differences between this form and the &quot;yellow&quot; walleye and the blue walleye is now considered to be a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] and color variant of the walleye.&lt;ref name = S&amp;H&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Carol A.

==As food==
[[File:Okacic.jpg|thumb|Fresh walleye being cooked over a fire]]
The walleye is considered to be a quite palatable [[Fresh water|freshwater]] fish, and consequently, is fished [[Sport fishing|recreationally]] and [[Fishing industry|commercially]] for food.&lt;ref name=DNR&gt;{{cite web|title=Walleye, Sander vitreus|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_18958-45694--,00.html|work=Department of Natural Resources (DNR), State of Michigan|access-date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its nocturnal feeding habits, it is most easily caught at night using live minnows or lures that mimic small fish. In Minnesota, the walleye is often fished for in the late afternoon on windy days (known as a &quot;walleye chop&quot;) or at night. Most commercial fisheries for walleye are situated in the Canadian waters of the [[Great Lakes]]. Often served as a sandwich in Minnesota's pubs where the fish is very popular, deep fried walleye on a stick is a [[Minnesota State Fair]] food.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PK8wIfd19s0C&amp;pg=PA32 Field and Stream July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fishing ==
{{Main article|Walleye fishing}}
Because walleyes are popular with anglers, [[fishing]] for walleyes is regulated by most natural resource agencies. [[Fisheries management|Management]] may include the use of quotas and length limits to ensure that populations are not [[Overfishing|overexploited]]. For example, in [[Michigan]], walleyes shorter than {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} may not be legally kept, except in [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], the St. Clair River, and Saginaw Bay where fish as short as {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} may be taken.

Since walleyes have excellent visual acuity under low illumination levels, they tend to feed more extensively at dawn and dusk, on cloudy or overcast days, and under choppy conditions when light penetration into the water column is disrupted. Although anglers interpret this as light avoidance, it is merely an expression of the walleyes' competitive advantage over their prey under those conditions. Similarly, in darkly stained or [[Turbidity|turbid]] waters, walleyes tend to feed throughout the day.  In the spring and fall, walleyes are located near the shallower areas due to the spawning grounds, and they are most often located in shallower areas during higher winds due to the murkier, higher oxygenated water at around six feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Fellegy, Jr., Walleyes and Walleye Fishing (Dillon Press, 1974), 57, 58&lt;/ref&gt;  On calm spring days,  walleyes are more often located at the deep side of the shoreline drop-off and around shore slopes around or deeper than 10 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Fellegy, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of their widespread presence in Canada and the northern United States, walleyes are frequently caught while [[ice fishing]], a popular winter pastime throughout those regions.

&quot;Walleye chop&quot; is a term used by walleye [[fisherman|anglers]] for rough water typically with winds of {{convert|10|to|25|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, and is one of the indicators for good walleye fishing due to the walleyes' increased feeding activity during such conditions.  In addition to fishing this chop, night fishing with live bait can be very effective.

The current all-tackle world record for a walleye is held by Mabry Harper, who caught an 11.34-kg (25-lb) walleye in Old Hickory Lake in Tennessee on August 2, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=IGFA All-Tackle World Record | year=1960 | author=International Game and Fish Association | publisher=IGFA | url=http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&amp;cn=Walleye | access-date=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==
[[File:Garrison Big Fish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Large walleye statue at [[Mille Lacs Lake|Lake Mille Lacs]] in [[Garrison, Minnesota]]]]
The walleye is the state fish of [[Minnesota]], [[Vermont]], and [[South Dakota]], and the official provincial fish of [[Manitoba]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/visiting/docs/symbolsofmanitoba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saskatchewan|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/101/116-eng.cfm|work=Canadian Heritage|access-date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very popular with Minnesota residents; more walleye is eaten in Minnesota than in any other jurisdiction of the United States. Both [[Garrison, Minnesota|Garrison]] and [[Baudette, Minnesota]], claim to be the &quot;Walleye Capital of the World&quot;, each with a large statue of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/walleye.html &quot;Walleyed War of the Walleye Capitals&quot;]. RoadsideAmerica.com. Doug Kirby, Ken Smith, Mike Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winnipeg, Manitoba, considers the walleye (referred to locally as &quot;pickerel&quot;) its most important local fish.&lt;ref name=Nicholson2007/&gt;{{rp|76}} Icelandic fishermen in Lake Winnipeg have traditionally supplied the Winnipeg market.&lt;ref name=Nicholson2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Nicholson |first=Karen |title=A History of Manitoba's Commercial Fishery 1872-2005 |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/internal_reports/pdfs/Fishery_MB_Commercial.pdf |publisher=Manitoba Historic Resources Branch |date=May 2007 |access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23–26}}

{{Linguistic_typology topics}}

'''Linguistic typology''' (or '''language typology''') is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies and classifies languages according to their structural and functional{{clarify|date=July 2020 |reason=It is not clear what &quot;functional features&quot; mean. The article gives examples for structural features but not for functional ones}} features. Its aim is to describe and explain the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Its subdisciplines include, but are not limited to: qualitative typology, which deals with the issue of comparing languages and within-language variance; quantitative typology, which deals with the distribution of structural patterns in the world’s languages; theoretical typology, which explains these distributions; syntactic typology, which deals with word order, word form, word grammar and word choice; and lexical typology, which deals with language vocabulary.

==Qualitative typology==
Qualitative typology develops cross-linguistically viable notions or types that provide a framework for the description and comparison of individual languages. A few examples appear below.

===Typological systems===
====Subject–verb–object positioning====
{{main|Word order}}
One set of types reflects the basic order of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]], and [[direct object]] in sentences:

* [[Object–subject–verb]]
* [[Object–verb–subject]]
* [[Subject–verb–object]]
* [[Subject–object–verb]]
* [[Verb–subject–object]]
* [[Verb–object–subject]]

These labels usually appear abbreviated as &quot;SVO&quot; and so forth, and may be called &quot;typologies&quot; of the languages to which they apply.  The most commonly attested word orders are SOV and SVO while the least common orders are those that are object initial with OVS being the least common with only four attested instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gell-Mann |first1=Murray |last2=Ruhlen |first2=Merritt |date=2011-10-18 |title=The origin and evolution of word order |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=42 |pages=17290–17295 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1113716108 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=3198322 |pmid=21987807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, linguists began to question the relevance of geographical distribution of different values for various features of linguistic structure. They may have wanted to discover whether a particular grammatical structure found in one language is likewise found in another language in the same geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard, et al. “Chapter Introduction.” WALS Online - Chapter Introduction, The World Atlas of Language Structures Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages split verbs into an auxiliary and an infinitive or participle, and put the subject and/or object between them. For instance, German ({{lang|de|Ich '''habe''' einen Fuchs im Wald '''gesehen'''}} - *&quot;I have a fox in-the woods seen&quot;), Dutch ({{lang|nl|Hans '''vermoedde''' dat Jan Marie '''zag leren zwemmen'''}} - *&quot;Hans suspected that Jan Marie saw to learn to swim&quot;) and Welsh ({{lang|cy|'''Mae'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;r gwirio sillafu wedi'i '''gwblhau'''}} - *&quot;Is the checking spelling after its to complete&quot;). In this case, linguists base the typology on the non-analytic tenses (i.e. those sentences in which the verb is not split) or on the position of the auxiliary. German is thus SVO in main clauses and Welsh is VSO (and preposition phrases would go after the infinitive).

Many typologists{{Who|date=March 2017}} classify both German and Dutch as [[V2 word order|V2]] languages, as the verb invariantly occurs as the second element of a full clause.

Some languages allow varying degrees of freedom in their constituent order, posing a problem for their classification within the subject–verb–object schema. Languages with bound case markings for nouns, for example, tend to have more flexible word orders than languages where case is defined by position within a sentence or presence of a preposition.{{Example needed |date=May 2018}} To define a basic constituent order type in this case, one generally looks at frequency of different types in declarative affirmative main clauses in pragmatically neutral contexts, preferably with only old referents. Thus, for instance, Russian is widely considered an SVO language, as this is the most frequent constituent order under such conditions—all sorts of variations are possible, though, and occur in texts. In many inflected languages, such as Russian, Latin, and Greek, departures from the default word-orders are permissible but usually imply a shift in focus, an emphasis on the final element, or some special context. In the poetry of these languages, the word order may also shift freely to meet metrical demands. Additionally, freedom of word order may vary within the same language—for example, formal, literary, or archaizing varieties may have different, stricter, or more lenient constituent-order structures than an informal spoken variety of the same language.

On the other hand, when there is no clear preference under the described conditions, the language is considered to have &quot;flexible constituent order&quot; (a type unto itself).

An additional problem is that in languages without living speech communities, such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Old Church Slavonic]], linguists have only written evidence, perhaps written in a poetic, formalizing, or archaic style that mischaracterizes the actual daily use of the language. The daily spoken language of [[Sophocles]] or [[Cicero]] might have exhibited a different or much more regular syntax than their written legacy indicates.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Morphosyntactic alignment====
{{main|Morphosyntactic alignment}}
Another common classification distinguishes [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] alignment patterns and [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] ones. In a language with [[noun case|cases]], the classification depends on whether the subject (S) of an intransitive verb has the same case as the agent (A) or the patient (P) of a transitive verb. If a language has no cases, but the word order is AVP or PVA, then a classification may reflect whether the subject of an intransitive verb appears on the same side as the agent or the patient of the transitive verb. Bickel (2011) has argued that alignment should be seen as a construction-specific property rather than a language-specific property.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~bickel/research/papers/manifesto.pdf|title=What is typology? - a short note|last=Bickel|first=B.|date=|website=www.uni-leipzig.de|language=de|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages show mixed accusative and ergative behaviour (for example: ergative morphology marking the verb arguments, on top of an accusative syntax). Other languages (called &quot;[[active language]]s&quot;) have two types of intransitive verbs&amp;mdash;some of them (&quot;active verbs&quot;) join the subject in the same case as the agent of a transitive verb, and the rest (&quot;stative verbs&quot;) join the subject in the same case as the patient{{Example needed|date=May 2018}}. Yet other languages behave ergatively only in some contexts (this &quot;[[split ergativity]]&quot; is often based on the grammatical person of the arguments or on the tense/aspect of the verb). For example, only some verbs in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] behave this way, and, as a rule, only while using the [[perfective]] (aorist).

====Phonological systems====
{{main|Phonology}}
Linguistic typology also seeks to identify patterns in the structure and distribution of sound systems among the world's languages. This is accomplished by surveying and analyzing the relative frequencies of different phonological properties. These relative frequencies might, for example, be used to determine why contrastive voicing commonly occurs with plosives, as in English ''neat'' and ''need'', but occurs much more rarely among fricatives, such as the English ''niece'' and ''knees''. According to a worldwide sample of 637 languages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Song, 2011&quot;&gt;Song, J.J. (ed.) (2011). The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-928125-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 62% have the voicing contrast in stops but only 35% have this in fricatives. In the vast majority of those cases, the absence of voicing contrast occurs because there is a lack of voiced fricatives and because all languages have some form of plosive, but there are languages with no fricatives. Below is a chart showing the breakdown of voicing properties among languages in the aforementioned sample.

Languages worldwide also vary in the number of sounds they use. These languages can go from very small phonemic inventories ([[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] with six consonants and five vowels) to very large inventories ([[Taa language|!Xóõ]] with 128 consonants and 28 vowels). An interesting phonological observation found with this data is that the larger a consonant inventory a language has, the more likely it is to contain a sound from a defined set of complex consonants (clicks, glottalized consonants, doubly articulated labial-velar stops, lateral fricatives and affricates, uvular and pharyngeal consonants, and dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives). Of this list, only about 26% of languages in a survey&lt;ref name=&quot;Song, 2011&quot;/&gt; of over 600 with small inventories (less than 19 consonants) contain a member of this set, while 51% of average languages (19-25) contain at least one member and 69% of large consonant inventories (greater than 25 consonants) contain a member of this set. It is then seen that complex consonants are in proportion to the size of the inventory.

Vowels contain a more modest number of phonemes, with the average being 5-6, which 51% of the languages in the survey have. About a third of the languages have larger than average vowel inventories. Most interesting though is the lack of relationship between consonant inventory size and vowel inventory size. Below is a chart showing this lack of predictability between consonant and vowel inventory sizes in relation to each other.

==Quantitative typology==
Quantitative typology deals with the distribution and co-occurrence of structural patterns in the languages of the world. Major types of non-chance distribution include:

* preferences (for instance, absolute and implicational [[linguistic universal|universals]], semantic maps, and [[implicational hierarchy|hierarchies]])
* correlations (for instance, areal patterns, such as with a [[Sprachbund]])

Linguistic universals are patterns that can be seen cross linguistically. Universals can either be absolute, meaning that every documented language exhibits this characteristic, or statistical, meaning that this characteristic is seen in most languages or is probable in most languages. Universals, both absolute and statistical can be unrestricted, meaning that they apply to most or all languages without any additional conditions. Conversely, both absolute and statistical universals can be restricted or implicational, meaning that a characteristic will be true on the condition of something else (if Y characteristic is true, then X characteristic is true).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Edith|title=Introducing Language Typology|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, London|page=9|isbn=9780521193405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7IywiArQK8C&amp;q=universals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

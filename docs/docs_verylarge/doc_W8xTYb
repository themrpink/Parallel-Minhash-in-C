===Photo-etching===
{{main|Photochemical machining}}
Light sensitive polymer plates allow for photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using [[drypoint]], further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.

==Types of metal plates==
{{main|Photochemical machining}}

[[Copper]] is a traditional metal, and is still preferred, for etching, as it bites evenly, holds texture well, and does not distort the color of the ink when wiped. [[Zinc]] is cheaper than copper, so preferable for beginners, but it does not bite as cleanly as copper does, and it alters some colors of ink. [[Steel]] is growing in popularity as an etching substrate. Increases in the prices of copper and zinc have steered steel to an acceptable alternative. The line quality of steel is less fine than copper, but finer than zinc. Steel has a natural and rich aquatint.

The type of metal used for the plate impacts the number of prints the plate will produce. The firm pressure of the printing press slowly rubs out the finer details of the image with every pass-through. With relatively soft copper, for example, the etching details will begin to wear very quickly, some copper plates show extreme wear after only ten prints. Steel, on the other hand, is incredibly durable. This wearing out of the image over time is one of the reasons etched prints created early in a numbered series tend to be valued more highly. An artist thus takes the total number of prints he or she wishes to produce into account whenever choosing the metal.

==Industrial uses==
{{Main|Chemical milling}}
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}
Etching is also used in the manufacturing of [[printed circuit board]]s and [[semiconductor device]]s, and in the preparation of metallic specimens for microscopic observation.

==Controlling the acid's effects==
There are many ways for the printmaker to control the acid's effects.

===Hard grounds===
[[Image:Lesser Ury Junges Mädchen im Café.jpg|thumb|right|''Young Girl in cafe with street-view'', etching by [[Lesser Ury]], 1924]] 
Most typically, the surface of the plate is covered in a hard, [[wax]]y 'ground' that resists acid. The printmaker then scratches through the ground with a sharp point, exposing lines of metal which the mordant acid attacks.[[File:Sugar Lift and Spit Bite Effects.jpg|thumb|left|Example of sugar lift and spit bite effect]]

===Aquatint===
[[Aquatint]] is a variation giving only tone rather than lines when printed.  Particulate resin is evenly distributed on all or parts of the plate, then heated to form a screen ground of uniform, but less than perfect, density. After etching, any exposed surface will result in a roughened (i.e., darkened) surface. Areas that are to be light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths. Successive turns of varnishing and placing the plate in acid create areas of tone difficult or impossible to achieve by drawing through a wax ground.

===Sugar lift===
Designs in a syrupy solution of sugar or [[Camp Coffee]] are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When the plate is placed in hot water the sugar dissolves, leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.

===Spit bite===
A mixture of nitric acid and [[Gum Arabic]] (or, almost never, saliva) which can be dripped, spattered or painted onto a metal surface giving interesting results. A mixture of nitric acid and [[rosin]] may also be used.

==Printing==
[[File:Cylinder press at SCAD-Lacoste in Vaucluse, France.jpg|thumb|right|Cylinder press for printing etchings]] Printing the plate is done by covering the surface with [[printing ink]], then rubbing the ink off the surface with ''[[tarlatan]]'' cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper is placed on the plate, and both are run through a [[printing press]]; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (''c.f.'', [[chine-collé]]). Unfortunately, the pressure subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a [[copper]] plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be [[electroplating|electro-plated]] before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. [[Zinc]] is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.

==Faults==
[[File:Foul Bite through Soft Ground on Zinc.jpg|thumb|Example of foul bite in acid etching]]

''Foul-bite'' or &quot;over-biting&quot; is common in etching, and is the effect of minuscule amounts of acid leaking through the ground to create minor pitting and burning on the surface. This incidental roughening may be removed by smoothing and polishing the surface, but artists often leave faux-bite, or deliberately court it by handling the plate roughly, because it is viewed as a desirable mark of the process.

==&quot;Etchings&quot; euphemism== &lt;!-- This is linked from the redirect [[Come up and see my etchings]] --&gt;
The phrase &quot;Want to come up and see my etchings?&quot; is a romantic euphemism by which a person entices someone to come back to their place with an offer to look at something artistic, but with ulterior motives. The phrase is a corruption of some phrases in a novel by [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]] called ''The Erie Train Boy'', which was first published in 1891. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century—especially with young people—and his books were widely quoted. In chapter XXII of the book, a woman writes to her boyfriend, &quot;I have a new collection of etchings that I want to show you. Won't you name an evening when you will call, as I want to be certain to be at home when you really do come.&quot; The boyfriend then writes back &quot;I shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call.&quot;

This was referenced in a 1929 [[James Thurber]] cartoon in which a man tells a woman in a building lobby: &quot;You wait here and I'll bring the etchings down&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonists/2011/09/sexual-revolutions.html |title=My Sexual Revolution |author=Robert Mankoff |publisher=Newyorker.com |access-date=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also referenced in [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s 1934 novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'', in which the narrator answers his wife asking him about a lady he had wandered off with by saying: &quot;She just wanted to show me some French etchings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hammett, Dashiell, ''The Thin Man'', (1934) in Five Complete Novels, New York: Avanel Books, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was given new popularity in 1937: in a well publicized case, violinist [[David Rubinoff]] was accused of inviting a young woman to his hotel room to view some French etchings, but instead seducing her.

As early as 1895, [[Hjalmar Söderberg]] used the reference in his &quot;[[Decadent movement|decadent]]&quot; [[debut novel|début novel]] ''Delusions'' (swe: ''Förvillelser)'', when he lets the dandy Johannes Hall lure the main character's younger sister Greta into his room under the pretence that they browse through his etchings and engravings (e.g., ''[[Die Sünde]]'' by [[Franz Stuck]]).&lt;ref&gt;Förvillelser, Lind &amp; Co., 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;158—163&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''421''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CDXXI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Agricola and Eustathius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1174 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 421 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{History of printing}}
[[File:TeeshirtCopyleft cadre.jpg|thumb|A silk screen design]]

'''Screen printing''' is a printing technique where a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking [[stencil]]. A blade or [[squeegee]] is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact.  This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed. One colour is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multi-coloured image or design.

There are various terms used for what is essentially the same technique. Traditionally, the process was called screen printing or '''silkscreen printing''' because silk was used in the process. It is also known as '''serigraphy''' and '''serigraph printing'''. Currently, synthetic threads are commonly used in the screen printing process. The most popular mesh in general use is made of polyester. There are special-use mesh materials of nylon and stainless steel available to the screen-printer. There are also different types of mesh size which will determine the outcome and look of the finished design on the material.

==History==
[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Members of the Poster Shop Staff at the . . . - NARA - 539255.jpg|thumb|The poster shop at [[Heart Mountain War Relocation Center]] was operated by Japanese-American internees who used the silkscreen method to design information for the entire center (January 1943)]]
Screen printing first appeared in a recognizable form in [[China]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=Angela|title=Review: Why Ancient Silk Is Still Gold: Issues in Chinese Textile History|journal=Ars Orientalis|date=1999|volume=29|jstor=4629553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;screenweb.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenweb.com/content/historys-influence-screen-printings-future |title=History's Influence on Screen Printing's Future &amp;#124; ScreenWeb |publisher=screenweb.com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121150312/http://www.screenweb.com/content/historys-influence-screen-printings-future |archivedate=2013-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was then adapted by other Asian countries like Japan, and was further created using newer methods.

Screen printing was largely introduced to Western Europe from Asia sometime in the late 18th century, but did not gain large acceptance or use in Europe until silk mesh was more available for trade from the east and a profitable outlet for the medium discovered.

Early in the 1910s, several printers experimenting with photo-reactive chemicals used the well-known [[actinic light]]–activated cross linking or hardening traits of potassium, sodium or ammonium [[chromate and dichromate]] chemicals with glues and [[gelatin]] compounds. Roy Beck, Charles Peter and Edward Owens studied and experimented with chromic acid salt sensitized emulsions for photo-reactive stencils. This trio of developers would prove to revolutionize the commercial screen printing industry by introducing photo-imaged stencils to the industry, though the acceptance of this method would take many years. Commercial screen printing now uses sensitizers far safer and less toxic than bichromates. Currently,{{When|date=November 2019}} there are large selections of pre-sensitized and &quot;user mixed&quot; sensitized emulsion chemicals for creating photo-reactive stencils.

A group of artists who later formed the [[National Serigraph Society]], including [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] artists [[Max Arthur Cohn]] and [[Anthony Velonis]], coined the word &quot;serigraphy&quot; in the 1930s to differentiate the artistic application of screen printing from the industrial use of the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Velonis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with WPA silkscreen artist Tony Velonis |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wpapos/interview.html |website=Library of Congress |accessdate=29 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Serigraphy&quot; is a compound word formed from Latin &quot;sēricum&quot; (silk) and Greek &quot;graphein&quot; (to write or draw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/serigraphy?r=14 |title=Serigraphy &amp;#124; Define Serigraphy at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2012-11-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025131823/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/serigraphy?r=14 |archivedate=2012-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Printers' National Environmental Assistance Center says, &quot;Screenprinting is arguably the most versatile of all printing processes. Since rudimentary screenprinting materials are so affordable and readily available, it has been used frequently in [[underground art|underground]] settings and [[subculture]]s, and the non-professional look of such [[DIY culture]] screenprints have become a significant cultural aesthetic seen on movie posters, record album covers, flyers, shirts, commercial fonts in advertising, in artwork and elsewhere.{{Verify quote|date=October 2020}}

=== 1960s to present ===
Credit is given to the artist [[Andy Warhol]] for popularising screen printing as an artistic technique. Warhol's silk screens include his 1962 [[Marilyn Diptych]], which is a portrait of the actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] printed in bold colours. Warhol was supported in his production by master screen printer [[Michel Caza]], a founding member of [[Fespa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_183_300089967.pdf |location=New York, N.Y. |title=Pop impressions: Europe/USA |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, Department of Prints and Illustrated Books |date=1999 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.printweek.com/print-week/india-in-depth/1131201/guru-screen-print-michel-caza |last=Mistry |first=Bhargav |title=To the Guru of Screen Print, Michel Caza |work=Print Week |date=2010-12-07 |access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sister Mary Corita Kent]] gained international fame for her vibrant serigraphs during the 1960s and 1970s. Her works were rainbow coloured, contained words that were both political, and fostered peace and love and caring.

American entrepreneur, artist and inventor Michael Vasilantone started to use, develop, and sell a rotatable multicolour garment screen printing machine in 1960. Vasilantone later filed for a patent&lt;ref name=&quot;patft.uspto.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/ |title=patft » Page 1 of 1 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019041123/http://patft.uspto.gov/ |archivedate=2012-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on his invention in 1967 granted number 3,427,964 on February 18, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;patft.uspto.gov&quot;/&gt; The original machine was manufactured to print logos and team information on [[bowling]] garments, but was soon directed to the new fad of printing on T-shirts. The Vasilantone patent was licensed by multiple manufacturers and the resulting production and boom in printed T-shirts made this ''garment'' screen printing machine popular. Screen printing on garments currently{{When|date=November 2019}} accounts for over half of the screen printing activity in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;sgia.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgia.org/surveys_and_statistics/ |title=Industry Analysis |publisher=Sgia.org |access-date=2012-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014161004/http://www.sgia.org/surveys_and_statistics/ |archivedate=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic screen-printing is widely used today to create mass- or large-batch produced graphics, such as posters or display stands. Full colour prints can be created by printing in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (cyan, magenta, yellow and black).

Screen printing lends itself well to printing on canvas. [[Andy Warhol]], [[Arthur Okamura]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Harry Gottlieb]] and many other artists have used screen printing as an expression of creativity and artistic vision.

Another variation, digital hybrid screen printing, is a union between analog screen printing and traditional digital direct to garment printing, two of the most common textile embellishment technologies in use today. Essentially, digital hybrid screen printing is an automatic screen-printing press with a CMYK digital enhancement located on one of the screen print stations. Digital hybrid screen printing is capable of variable data options, creating endless customizations, with the added ability of screen print specific techniques. &amp;nbsp;

==Printing technique==

A screen is made of a piece of mesh stretched over a frame. The mesh could be made of a [[synthetic polymer]], such as [[nylon]], and a finer and smaller aperture for the mesh would be utilized for a design that requires a higher and more delicate degree of detail. For the mesh to be effective, it must be mounted on a frame and it must be under tension. The frame which holds the mesh could be made of diverse materials, such as wood or aluminum, depending on the sophistication of the machine or the artisan procedure. The tension of the mesh may be checked by using a tensiometer; a common unit for the measurement of the tension of the mesh is [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] per [[centimeter]] (N/cm).

A stencil is formed by blocking off parts of the screen in the negative image of the design to be printed; that is, the open spaces are where the ink will appear on the substrate.

Before printing occurs, the frame and screen must undergo the pre-press process, in which an emulsion is 'scooped' across the mesh. Once this emulsion has dried, it is selectively exposed to ultra-violet light, through a film printed with the required design. This hardens the emulsion in the exposed areas but leaves the unexposed parts soft. They are then washed away using a water spray, leaving behind a clean area in the mesh with the identical shape as the desired image, which will allow passage of ink. It is a positive process.

In fabric printing, the surface supporting the fabric to be printed (commonly referred to as a pallet) is coated with a wide 'pallet tape'. This serves to protect the 'pallet' from any unwanted ink leaking through the screen and potentially staining the 'pallet' or transferring unwanted ink onto the next substrate.

Next, the screen and frame are lined with a tape to prevent ink from reaching the edge of the screen and the frame. The type of tape used in for this purpose often depends upon the ink that is to be printed onto the substrate. More aggressive tapes are generally used for UV and water-based inks due to the inks' lower viscosities and greater tendency to creep underneath tape.

The last process in the 'pre-press' is blocking out any unwanted 'pin-holes' in the emulsion. If these holes are left in the emulsion, the ink will continue through and leave unwanted marks. To block out these holes, materials such as tapes, speciality emulsions and 'block-out pens' may be used effectively.

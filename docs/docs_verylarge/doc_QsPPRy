The Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 [[team handball|handball]] arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the [[Dinamo Arena]] (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the [[Mikheil Meskhi Stadium]] (24,680 seats). The [[Sports Palace (Tbilisi)|Sports Palace]] which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.

[[Vere Basketball Hall]] is a smaller [[Indoor arena|indoor sports arena]] with a 2,500 [[seating capacity]].

The most popular sports in Tbilisi today are [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], basketball, and [[wrestling]]. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. [[National Basketball Association]] players [[Zaza Pachulia]] and [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]] are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.

Tbilisi's signature football team, [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], has not won a major European championship since the [[1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup|1980–1981]] season, when it won the European [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the [[Euroleague]] in [[FIBA European Champions Cup 1961-62|1962]] but also never repeated any such feat.

Tbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the [[EuroBasket 2021]] in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).

==Media==
The large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular [[Rustavi 2]] television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the [[Rose Revolution]]. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including [[Imedi Media Holding|Imedi TV]] Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.

Tbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily ''24 Saati'' (&quot;24 Hours&quot;), ''Rezonansi'' (&quot;Resonance&quot;), ''Alia'', the English-language daily ''The Messenger'', weekly ''FINANCIAL, Georgia Today'', and the English-language weekly ''The Georgian Times''. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.

Radio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.tbilisi.gov.ge/?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=294?lang=eng Tbilisi Municipal Portal – Radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224836/http://new.tbilisi.gov.ge/?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=294%3Flang%3Deng |date=17 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Architecture===
[[File:Rustaveli National Theater in Georgia (Europe), built 19th century in Rococo style.jpg|thumb|[[Rustaveli Theatre]] seen on the [[Rustaveli Avenue]]]]
The architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|editor1-last=Curtis|editor1-first=Glen E.|title=Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0788128134|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B2W1YOG3N10C/page/n236 184]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B2W1YOG3N10C|quote=(...) Persian occupation added a new element, and in the nineteenth century Russian domination created a hybrid architectural style visible in many buildings in Tbilisi. The so-called Stalinist architecture of the mid-twentieth century also left its mark on the capital.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801–1917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.

Tbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected [[Stalinist architecture]] in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (&quot;Imeli&quot;), now housing the [[Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi]].{{ref}}

[[File:Erecle street, Tbilisi 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Open-air cafés in [[Old Tbilisi]]]]

Tbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 [[Bank of Georgia headquarters|Ministry of Roads]] and the 1984 [[Wedding Palace (Tbilisi)|Wedding Palace]]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout &quot;kamikaze loggia&quot; overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The [[Axis Towers]], Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new [[Ajara Hotel/Business Complex]], which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/[[skyscraper]]s in the [[Caucasus]].{{ref}}

===Theatre, dance and music===
[[File:Georgian National Opera Theater.jpg|thumb|[[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre]]|alt=]]

The city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the [[Tbilisi State Conservatoire]], the [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre]], the [[Rustaveli State Academic Theater|Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre]], and the [[Marjanishvili Theater|Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre]].

===Art museums and galleries===

The [[Georgian National Museum]] gathers several important museums, including the [[Shalva Amiranashvili Museum of Fine Arts|Art Museum of Georgia]]. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rabimov|first=Stephan|title=The Tbilisi Art Scene Looks Inside Georgia|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanrabimov/2019/11/04/the-tbilisi-art-scene-looks-inside-georgia/|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Forbes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two independent contemporary art organisations, [[Kunsthalle Tbilisi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kunsthalle Tbilisi: new art space opening with contemporary exhibitions|url=https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2018/1046|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Agenda.ge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Open Space of Experimental Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Open Space: new experimental art platform launches in Tbilisi|url=https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2018/1931|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Agenda.ge}}&lt;/ref&gt; were founded in 2018.

==Tourism==

===Main sights===
{{Main|List of museums in Tbilisi}}

Tbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The [[Parliament of Georgia|Parliament]] and the government ([[State Chancellery]]) buildings of Georgia, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (country)|Supreme Court of Georgia]], the [[Sameba Cathedral]], the [[Vorontsov]]'s Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the [[National Parliamentary Library of Georgia|National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia]], the [[National Bank of Georgia]], [[Tbilisi Circus]], [[The Bridge of Peace (Georgia)|The Bridge of Peace]], and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.

Out of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the [[Narikala fortress]] (4th–17th century), [[Anchiskhati Basilica]] (6th century, built up in the 16th century), [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Sioni Cathedral]] (8th century, later rebuilt), and [[Church of Metekhi]], Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.

===Nightlife===
Beyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as [[Bassiani]], Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Café Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=House|first1=Arthur|title=Clubbers, forget London and Berlin – the place to dance is eastern Europe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/clubbing-london-berlin-eastern-europe-closure-fabric|accessdate=11 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Will|title=Tbilisi and the politics of raving|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2666|accessdate=11 February 2017|work=Resident Advisor|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
With a GDP at basic prices of 12,147&amp;nbsp;million [[Georgian lari]] ([[Euro|€]]4.3&amp;nbsp;billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (€3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is – with 22.5 percent – significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Statistics|url=http://geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&amp;p_id=1181&amp;lang=eng|publisher=Geostat|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[File:Tbilisi airport 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tbilisi International Airport]]]]

===Airport===
[[Tbilisi International Airport|Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport]] is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16&amp;nbsp;million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the [[List of the busiest airports in the former USSR|seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union]]. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56&amp;nbsp;million passengers in 11 months of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passenger Traffic up by 23% at Georgian Airports|url=http://georgiatoday.ge/news/13646/Passenger-Traffic-up-by-23%25-at-Georgian-Airports|publisher=Georgian today|accessdate=10 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a hub for the National carrier [[Georgian Airways]] and a Georgian-Chinese start-up [[MyWay Airlines|Myway Airlines]]. 
As of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.
Tbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first &quot;green airport&quot; in the Caucasus region in 2008.

[[Natakhtari Airfield]], located 33&amp;nbsp;km north of Tbilisi in the town of [[Natakhtari]], is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to [[Batumi]], [[Mestia]] and [[Ambrolauri]].

The [[Tbilisi Metro]] serves the city with [[rapid transit]] subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the [[Akhmeteli-Varketili Line]] and the [[Saburtalo Line]]. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00&amp;nbsp;am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.

The third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and [[Tbilisi International Airport]] with a possible extension to [[Rustavi]], 30&amp;nbsp;km east of Tbilisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/New-metro-stations-to-link-center-and-outskirts-of-Tbilisi.html |title=New metro stations to link center and outskirts of Tbilisi |journal=Vestnik Kavkaza |date=22 October 2018 |accessdate=2019-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tram===
Tbilisi had a [[Tbilisi tram network|tram network]], since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subways.net/georgia/tbilisi.htm|accessdate=24 December 2010|title=Subways and Trams in Georgia: Tbilisi|date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5011&amp;Itemid=70|accessdate=24 December 2010|title=georgiandaily.com – Nostalgic Tbilisi residents want their tramway back|date=24 December 2010|quote=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to construct a modern tram network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/tbilisi-tram-design-contract-signed.html|accessdate=24 December 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Tbilisi tram design contract signed|date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=8365 |accessdate=24 December 2010 |title=Trams to return? : by Salome Kobalava : Georgia Today on the Web |date=24 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119032646/http://georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=8365 |archivedate=19 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minibus===
The most dominant form of transportation is the [[marshrutka|minibus]]. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 [[tetri]] in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commersant.ge/?view=post&amp;id=136776&amp;lang_id=ge |title= თბილისის ქუჩები, სადაც სამარშრუტო ტაქსები მხოლოდ გაჩერების ადგილებზე გაჩერდებიან |website= commersant.ge | date= 28 December 2017 | access-date= 7 April 2018|language=ka}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.

===Municipal bus===
The second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Bogdan (bus company)|Bogdan]] A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient [[MAN Lion's City]] buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tbilisi buys 143 new longer, gas-powered buses|url=http://dfwatch.net/tbilisi-buys-143-new-gas-powered-buses-43718|date= 13 July 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New [[MAN Lion's City]] buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&amp;Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tbilisi City Hall to Convey 90 New Buses|url=http://cbw.ge/georgia/tbilisi-city-hall-to-convey-90-new-buses/|date= 8 August 2018 |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gov't launches 'Green Policy – Eco-friendly Transport' project: What's in store for Tbilisi?|url=http://agenda.ge/en/news/2018/2188|date= 22 October 2018 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial tramways===
Historically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Since 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity [[gondola lift]] which operates between Rike Park and the [[Narikala fortress]]; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer [[Leitner Ropeways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/category.php?id=87&amp;size=wide&amp;gallery=86|title=Tbilisi Ropeway|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.

Since October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti &amp; Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.

Due to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities,{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the [[1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident]] and remaining closed ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9907/01/france.cable.car.04/list.html |title=Major worldwide cable car accidents since 1976 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by [[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group]].

===Funicular===

Tbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and [[Mtatsminda Park]], and covering almost {{Convert|300|m|abbr=on}} in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the [[Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower]] as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.

The half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from [[Mtatsminda Pantheon]], providing easy access to the necropolis.

==Education==

[[File:Classical School No.1 of Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Public School Number 1 of Tbilisi, also known as the [[Gymnasium (school)|First Classical Gymnasium]]]]

Tbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is [[Tbilisi State University]] which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region – [[Tbilisi State Medical University]], which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are {{when|date=February 2020}} almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.

Georgia's main and largest technical university, [[Georgian Technical University]], is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia —[[The University of Georgia (Tbilisi)]], [[Caucasus University]], and the [[Free University of Tbilisi]] – are in Tbilisi.

[[File:Tbilisi, Georgia — Tbilisi State University, I Corpus's front view.jpg|thumb|[[Tbilisi State University]], Building I]]

The [[University of Georgia (Tbilisi)]] is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.

Caucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools — Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School — delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.

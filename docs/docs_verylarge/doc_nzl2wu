'''Lyon Sprague de Camp''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|r|eɪ|ɡ|d|ə|ˈ|k|æ|m|p}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOCB-N_md_4|title=None But Lucifer – H.L. Gold &amp; L. Sprague de Camp|date=2009-11-17|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 27 November 1907 – 6 November 2000), better known as '''L. Sprague de Camp''', was an American writer of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[non-fiction]]. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, including novels and works of non-fiction, including biographies of other fantasy authors. He was a major figure in science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pace |first1=Eric |title=L.

==Biography==
De Camp was born in [[New York City]], one of three sons of Lyon de Camp, a businessman in real estate and lumber,&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking to Ghosts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Camp|first1=L. Sprague|title=Talking to Ghosts|agency=The New York Times Magazine|date=April 7, 1985|page=SM38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emma Beatrice Sprague. His maternal grandfather was the accountant, banker, pioneering [[Volapük]]ist and [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] veteran [[Charles Ezra Sprague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking to Ghosts&quot; /&gt; De Camp once noted that he rarely used pen-names, &quot;partly because my own true name sounds more like a pseudonym than most pseudonyms do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague. ''Science-Fiction Handbook'' (New York: Hermitage Press, 1953), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp began his education at the Trinity School in New York, then spent ten years attending the Snyder School in North Carolina,&lt;ref name=Robins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=William Mattathias|editor1-last=Cowart|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Wymer|editor2-first=Thomas L.|title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers (Vol. 8)|date=1981|publisher=Gale Research|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0810309180|chapter=L(yon) Sprague de Camp|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/twentiethcentury0008unse}}&lt;/ref&gt; a military-style institution. His stay at the Snyder School was an attempt by his parents, who were heavy-handed disciplinarians,&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking to Ghosts&quot; /&gt; to cure him of intellectual arrogance and lack of discipline. He was awkward and thin, an ineffective fighter, and suffered from bullying by his classmates. His experiences at the school taught him to develop a detached, analytical style considered cold by all but his closest friends,&lt;ref name=Moskowitz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Sam | authorlink =Sam Moskowitz|title=Seekers of Tomorrow|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/seekersoftomorro00mosk|chapter-url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-88355-158-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/seekersoftomorro00mosk/page/151 151–166]|chapter=L. Sprague de Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he could, like his father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking to Ghosts&quot; /&gt; be disarming and funny in social situations. He would later recall these challenging childhood experiences in the semi-autobiographical story ''Judgment Day'' (1955).&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M. | authorlink =Brian Stableford|editor1-last=Bleiler|editor1-first=Everett Franklin| editor-link =E.

An aeronautical engineer by profession, De Camp conducted his undergraduate studies at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (where his roommate was at one point noted [[rocket fuel]] scientist [[John Drury Clark]]),&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from Caltech in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2555/1/1930.pdf |title=Caltech Commencement Program |date=June 13, 1930 |publisher=Caltech Campus Publications ([[Caltech]]) |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Engineering]] from the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1933. De Camp was also a [[surveying|surveyor]] and an expert in [[patent]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

His first job was with the Inventors Foundation, Inc. in Hoboken, N.J., which was taken over by The International Correspondence Schools. De Camp transferred to the [[Scranton, PA]] division. He was Principal of the School of Inventing and Patenting when he resigned in 1937.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; His first book ''[[Inventions and Their Management]]'' resulted and was published in July 1937.

On August 12, 1939, de Camp married [[Catherine Crook de Camp|Catherine Crook]],&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catherine Crook wed in Riverside Chapel: Alumna of Barnard College is Bride of L. Sprague de Camp|agency=New York Times|date=August 13, 1939|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he collaborated on science fiction and nonfiction beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Heinlein-decamp-and-asimov.jpg|thumb|300px|right|De Camp (center) with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1944.]]

During [[World War II]], de Camp served as a researcher at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]] along with his fellow writers [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. De Camp eventually rose to the rank of [[lieutenant commander]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] as a [[reserve officer]].&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;

De Camp was a member of the all-male literary and dining club the &quot;[[Trap Door Spiders]]&quot; in [[New York City]], which served as the basis of Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the &quot;[[Black Widowers]].&quot;  De Camp himself was the model for the character named &quot;Geoffrey Avalon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asimov1994-120&quot;&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''I. Asimov: a Memoir'' (New York, Doubleday, 1994), chapter 120 &quot;The Trap Door Spiders.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp was a founding member of the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]] (SAGA), a loosely knit group of [[Heroic fantasy]] writers that was founded during the 1960s and led by [[Lin Carter]], with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone.

The de Camps moved to [[Plano, Texas]], in 1989, and Sprague de Camp died there on November 6, 2000, seven months after his wife,&lt;ref name=Thurber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thurber|first1=Jon|title=Obituaries; L. Sprague de Camp; Prolific Sci-Fi Writer|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 13, 2000|location=Los Angeles, CA|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; on what would have been her birthday, just three weeks before his own 93rd birthday. His ashes were inurned, together with hers, in the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Virginia]].

De Camp's personal library of about 1,200 books was acquired for auction by [[Half Price Books]] in 2005. The collection included books inscribed by fellow writers, such as [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Carl Sagan]], as well as de Camp himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMN&quot;&gt;Weeks, Jerome. &quot;De Camp library for sale.&quot; ''The Dallas Morning News'', October 24, 2005, p. 3G.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage of &quot;Extraterrestrial&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot;==
&quot;Extraterrestrial&quot;, a coinage from &quot;extra&quot; + &quot;terrestrial&quot;, meaning from beyond earth, is attested as an adjective as early as 1868, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Its first use in connection with ''life'' beyond earth was likely by [[H. G. Wells]], in his 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryer&quot;&gt;Cryer, Max. ''Common Phrases ... and the Amazing Stories Behind Them''. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendrickson&quot;&gt;Hendrickson, Robert. ''Words and Phrase Origins''. 3rd ed. New York: Facts On File, 2004, page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Sprague de Camp is credited with its first usage as a noun with the meaning of &quot;alien life&quot; and with coining the abbreviation &quot;E.T.&quot; in the first part of his two-part article &quot;Design for Life&quot;, published in the May 1939 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hendrickson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryer&quot;/&gt;

==Hypothesis regarding sea serpent sightings==
De Camp made a suggestion in 1968 that fossil discoveries had influenced modern reports of sea monster sightings. The suggestion was made in his article &quot;Dinosaurs in Today's World&quot; in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' v. 34, no. 3, March 1968, later reprinted in his nonfiction collection ''[[The Fringe of the Unknown]]'', Buffalo, New York: Prometheus, 1983. In 2019 de Camp's theory was scientifically tested by C. G. M. Paxton and D. Naish, who concluded trends in the data of reported sightings appear to support his hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, C. G. M., &amp; Naish, D. &quot;[https://earthscienceshistory.org/doi/pdf/10.17704/1944-6178-38.1.16 Did Nineteenth Century Marine Vertebrate Fossil Discoveries Influence Sea Serpent Reports?]&quot; In ''Earth Sciences History'' v. 38, iss. 1 (2019), pp. 16-27. https://doi.org/10.17704/1944-6178-38.1.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body of work==
De Camp was a [[materialism|materialist]] who wrote works examining [[society]], [[history]], [[technology]] and [[mythology|myth]]. He published numerous short stories, novels, non-fiction works and poems during his long career.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;

De Camp had the mind of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is a corrective impulse regarding similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others' writings.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt; Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp's conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was reluctant to use technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) if he did not think them possible.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt; Thus, his response to [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' was to write a similar [[time travel]] novel (''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'') in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero's technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

In like fashion, he reimagined [[space opera]] and [[planetary romance]] in his &quot;''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]''&quot; series, and the prehistoric precursor civilizations characteristic of much [[heroic fantasy]] in his [[Pusadian series]]. When he was not debunking literary conventions he was often explaining them. For example, in the [[Harold Shea]] stories co-written with his longtime friend [[Fletcher Pratt]] (1897–1956), the magical premises of some bodies of [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s were accepted but examined and elucidated in terms of their own systems of inherent logic. The imaginative civilizations in [[The Complete Compleat Enchanter|''The Compleat Enchanter'']], for example, are built upon a cultural and technological reality based on scientific formulas. Characters may be transported to these different worlds, but the magic contained within those worlds is only feasible to the extent that it coincides with the technology of the day (e.g., the combustion engine).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean, J.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=John|title=Strangely Familiar Forms: Exploitations of Romance in American Science Fiction and Fantasy|journal=Revue française d'études américaines|date=April 1980|volume=9, L'Etranger dans la Culture Americaine|issue=9|pages=149–158|jstor=20872772|publisher=Editions Belin}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Camp's explanatory tendency also carried over into his non-fictional writings, including advice to science fiction writers on handling the different states of languages in future worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers, W.E.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyers|first1=Walter E.|title=The Future History and Development of the English Language|journal=Science Fiction Studies|date=July 1976|volume=3|issue=2|pages=130–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science fiction===
De Camp's science fiction is marked by his interests in linguistics, ancient history, and the history and philosophy of science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. ''De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography''. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, David, ed. ''First Flight: Maiden Voyages in Space and Time'', New York, Lancer Books, 1963, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His first published story was &quot;[[The Isolinguals]]&quot;, in the September 1937 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;—the last issue edited by [[F. Orlin Tremaine]], prior to the long tenure of [[John W. Campbell]].&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; Most of his early science fiction stories were unrelated to each other, the exceptions being his &quot;Johnny Black&quot; tales about a black bear [[Uplift (science fiction)|uplifted]] to human-level intelligence, and his &quot;Drinkwhiskey Institute&quot; stories, a series of tall tales involving time travel. Campbell's fantasy magazine, [[Unknown (magazine)|''Unknown'']], was suited to de Camp's idosyncratic imagination, logic, and sense of humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle, D.&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Pringle|editor-first1=David|title=St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers|date=1996|publisher=St. James Press|location=New York|isbn=9781558622050|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558622050}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed ten novels (five as collaborations), much of it characterized by humor and dry wit.&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt; De Camp eschewed the intention of being a satirist, insisting, instead, that the stories he wrote were meant less for instruction or improvement, as satire requires, and more for the amusement of his readers.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

De Camp's treatment of [[time travel]] and [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] in stories such as ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' (1939), &quot;[[The Wheels of If]]&quot; (1940), &quot;[[A Gun for Dinosaur]]&quot; (1956), &quot;[[Aristotle and the Gun]]&quot; (1958), and ''[[The Glory That Was]]'' (1960) challenged the popular notion of his time that history consisted of an arbitrary series of accidents. Instead, de Camp, through sound background knowledge and logical thought, systematically demonstrated how technological advances could determine the pattern of an eventful history. His display of technological determinism in historical recreation is considered a ''tour de force.''&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Remington, T.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=Thomas|title=SF as Structural Fabulation|journal=The North American Review|date=Winter 1975|volume=260|issue=4|pages=53–55|jstor=25117723}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Lest Darkness Fall'', &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; and &quot;Aristotle and the Gun&quot; have been recognized as seminal works in the field of alternate history.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWfAH&quot;&gt;[http://www.uchronia.net/sidewise/complete.html#achieve &quot;Past Winners and Finalists&quot;]. Sidewise Awards for Alternate History (''uchronia.net''). Retrieved 2013-04-23. This was a Special Achievement award &quot;for seminal works in the field&quot; among the first annual Sidewise Awards in 1996 (generally recognizing 1995 publications).&lt;/ref&gt;

His most extended work was his &quot;''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]''&quot; series, set in a future where Brazil is the dominant power, particularly a sub-series of [[sword and planet]] novels set on the planet Krishna, beginning with ''[[The Queen of Zamba]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;&gt;Power, Colleen. &quot;DeCamp, L. (Lyon) Sprague.&quot; ''Reader's Guide to Twentieth-Century Science Fiction'' (Chicago, American Library Association, 1989), pp. 170-74.&lt;/ref&gt; His most influential ''Viagens'' novel was the non-Krishna work ''[[Rogue Queen]]'', a tale of a hive society undermined by interstellar contact, which was one of the earliest science fiction novels to deal with sexual themes.&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

De Camp wrote a number of lesser-known but nonetheless significant works that explored such topics as [[racism]], which he considered to be more accurately described as [[ethnocentrism]]. He pointed out that no scholar comparing the merits of various ethnicities has ever sought to prove that his own ethnicity was inferior to others.&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L.

De Camp was best known for his light fantasy, particularly two series written in collaboration with Pratt, the [[Harold Shea]] stories (from 1940 et seq.) and [[Tales from Gavagan's Bar|Gavagan's Bar]] (from 1950).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; [[Floyd C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Camp and Pratt also wrote some stand-alone novels similar in tone to the Harold Shea stories, of which the most highly regarded is ''[[Land of Unreason]]'' (1942), and de Camp wrote a few more of this genre on his own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle, D.&quot; /&gt;

He was also known for his [[sword and sorcery]], a fantasy genre revived partly by his editorial work on and continuation of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle, D.&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Un laboratorio di fantastici libri.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt.&quot; ''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror'', ed. [[Everett F. Bleiler]] (New York, Scribner, 1985), vol. 2, p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp also created three noteworthy sword and sorcery sequences. The [[Pusadian series]] (from 1951), composed of the novel ''[[The Tritonian Ring]]'' and several short stories, is set in an [[antediluvian]] era similar to Howard's.

More substantial is the [[Novarian series]] (from 1968), of which the core is the ''[[The Reluctant King|Reluctant King]]'' trilogy, beginning with ''[[The Goblin Tower]]'', de Camp's most accomplished effort in the genre, continuing in ''[[The Clocks of Iraz]]'', and concluding with ''[[The Unbeheaded King]]''. The trilogy features the adventurer Jorian, ex-king of Xylar. Jorian's world is an alternate reality to which our own serves as an afterlife. Other novels in the sequence include ''[[The Fallible Fiend]]'', a satire told from the point of view of a demon, and ''[[The Honorable Barbarian]]'', a follow-up to the trilogy featuring Jorian's brother as the hero.

The Incorporated Knight series comprises some 1970s short stories by de Camp and two novels written in collaboration with Catherine Crook de Camp, ''[[The Incorporated Knight]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Pixilated Peeress]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; The early short stories were incorporated into the first of these. The sequence is set in the medieval era of another alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a Neapolitan empire filled the role of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and no universal religion like [[Christianity]] ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The setting is borrowed in part from ''[[John Mandeville|Mandeville's Travels]]''.

===Historical fiction===
De Camp also wrote [[historical fiction]] set in the era of classical antiquity from the height of the [[Achaemenid Empire|First Persian Empire]] to the waning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period. Five novels published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] from 1958 to 1969&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; form a loosely connected series based on their common setting and occasional cross references. They were also linked by a common focus on the advancement of scientific knowledge, de Camp's chosen protagonists being explorers, artisans, engineers, innovators and practical philosophers rather than famous names from antiquity, who are relegated to secondary roles. The best known of his historical novels is ''[[The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate]]''.

===Nonfiction===
[[File:Galaxy 195202.jpg|thumb|right|In 1952, [[Richard M. Powers]] provided a ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' cover highlighting essays by de Camp and by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]]]
De Camp's first book was ''[[Inventions and Their Management]]'', co-written with Alf K. Berle and published by [[International Textbook Company]] in 1937: a 733-page book with three-page list of law cases cited.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC1/&gt;

He enjoyed [[debunker|debunking]] doubtful history and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims about the supernatural. He conducted extensive research for what was to be a book on magic, witchcraft and occultism, though only the first chapter, &quot;The Unwritten Classics&quot; (March, 1947), was published in the ''Saturday Review of Literature''.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; By May, 1976, concerned with what [[Paul Kurtz]] described as &quot;an enormous increase in public interest in psychic phenomena, the occult and pseudoscience,&quot; de Camp joined the newly formed [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] along with astronomers [[George O. Abell|George Abell]], [[Bart Bok]], and [[Carl Sagan]]; philosophers [[Brand Blanshard]], [[Antony Flew]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Ernest Nagel]]; authors Isaac Asimov, [[Daniel Cohen (children's writer)|Daniel Cohen]], [[Charles Fair]], [[Martin Gardner]], and [[Phillip J. Klass]]; psychologists [[Ray Hyman]] and [[B.F Skinner]]; and magician [[James Randi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frazier, K.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Science and the Parascience Cults|journal=Science News|date=May 29, 1976|volume=109|issue=22|pages=346–348+350|jstor=3961111|publisher=Society for Science and the Public|doi=10.2307/3961111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a long-time writer of fantasy, de Camp did not believe in ghosts in the supernatural sense. His ghosts dwelt only in his mind as memories of his parents. His mother, he wrote in a ''New York Times Magazine'' article, died of an overdose of faith healing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talking to Ghosts&quot; /&gt; When considering claims of UFO sightings, astrology, and other subjects considered moot by the scientific community, de Camp would address the circular logic expressed by enthusiasts by insisting on first-hand, unbiased, measurable data to back up the claims. &quot;In the history of cultism,&quot; de Camp said in a [[Science News]] interview, &quot;one is always experiencing a feeling of deja vu.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frazier, K.&quot; /&gt;

He explained how [[ancient civilization]]s produced structures and [[architecture]] that many considered to be impossible for them, such as the [[Pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Works in this area include ''[[Lost Continents]]'', ''[[Citadels of Mystery]]'', and ''[[The Ancient Engineers]]''.

Some others of his many and wide-ranging nonfiction works were ''[[The Great Monkey Trial]]'' (about the [[Scopes Trial]]), ''[[The Ragged Edge of Science]]'', ''[[Energy and Power]]'', ''[[The Heroic Age of American Invention]]'', ''[[The Day of the Dinosaur]]'' (which argued, among other things, that evolution took hold after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] because of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] interest spurred by recently popularized [[dinosaur]] remains, corresponding to [[legend]]s of [[dragons]]), ''[[Great Cities of the Ancient World]]'' and ''[[The Evolution of Naval Weapons]]'' (a United States government textbook).

Examples of defined contribution pension schemes in other countries are, the UK's personal pensions and proposed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), Germany's Riester plans, Australia's Superannuation system and New Zealand's KiwiSaver scheme. Individual pension savings plans also exist in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Economic Policy Committee and the European Commission|title=The impact of ageing on public expenditure|year=2006|publisher=EU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk sharing pensions==
Many developed economies are moving beyond DB &amp; DC Plans and are adopting a new breed of collective risk sharing schemes where plan members pool their contributions and to a greater or less extent share the investment &amp; [[Longevity risk]].

There are multiple naming conventions for these plans reflecting the fact that the future payouts are a ''target'' or ''ambition'' of the plan sponsor rather than a guarantee, common naming conventions include: 
* Defined Ambition Plans
* [[Target benefit plan]]s
* Collective Defined Contribution Schemes
* [[Tontine]] Pensions (the original [[Longevity risk]] sharing scheme invented in 1653).

===Risk sharing pension sponsor examples===
* Canada: [[Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan]] (HOOPP)
* US: [[State of Wisconsin Investment Board]]
* US: [[TIAA]]
* APAC/Europe: [[Tontine Trust]]
* UK: [[Royal Mail]] Pension Fund 
* Netherlands: [[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP]]
* Denmark: [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension]]

==Other pension plan types==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
===Hybrid and cash balance plans===
Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs.

A [[cash balance plan]] is a defined benefit plan made to appear as if it were a defined contribution plan.  They have ''notional balances'' in hypothetical accounts where, typically, each year the plan administrator will contribute an amount equal to a certain percentage of each participant's salary; a second contribution, called ''interest credit'', is made as well.  These are not actual contributions and further discussion is beyond the scope of this entry suffice it to say that there is currently much controversy.
In general, they are usually treated as [[defined benefit plan]]s for tax, accounting and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans, investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional ''account balance,'' and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more [[Portability (social security)|portable]] than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a more highly mobile workforce.

[[Target benefit plan]]s are defined contribution plans made to match (or resemble) defined benefit plans.

===Contrasting types of retirement plans===
Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts. This debate parallels the discussion currently{{when|date=July 2020}} going on in the U.S., where many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leaders favor transforming the Social Security system, at least in part, to a self-directed investment plan.

==Financing==

{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}

Defined contribution pensions, by definition, are funded, as the &quot;guarantee&quot; made to employees is that specified (defined) contributions will be made during an individual's working life.

There are many ways to finance a pension and save for retirement. Pension plans can be set up by an employer, matching a monetary contribution each month, by the state or personally through a pension scheme with a financial institution, such as a bank or brokerage firm. Pension plans often come with a tax break depending on the country and plan type.

For example, Canadians have the option to open a [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]] (RRSP), as well as a range of employee and state pension programs. This plan allows contributions to this account to be marked as un-taxable income and remain un-taxed until withdrawal. Most countries' governments will provide advice on pension schemes.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
{{see also|History of retirement}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}

In the classical world, Romans offered veteran legionnaires (centurions) military pensions, typically in the form of a land grant or a special, often semi-public, appointment. [[Augustus]] Caesar (63 B.C.–A.D. 14)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/people/reference/augustus-caesar/|title=Who was Augustus Caesar?|date=20 May 2019|website=Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced one of the first recognisable pension schemes in history with his military treasury. In 13 B.C. Augustus created a pension plan in which retired soldiers were to receive a pension (of minimum 3,000 denarii in a lump sum, which at the time represented around 13 times a legionnaires’ annual salary) after 16 years of service in a legion and four years in the military reserves. The retiring soldiers were in the beginning paid from general revenues and later from a special fund (''aeririum militare'') established by Augustus in 5 or 6 A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;Clark, R. L., Craig, L. A., &amp; Wilson, J. W. (n.d.). A History of Public Sector Pensions in the United States. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4011: University of Pennsylvania Press. Retrieved from https://pensionresearchcouncil.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0-8122-3714-5-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in an attempt to quell a rebellion within the Roman Empire which was facing militaristic turmoil at the time. This, whilst did ease tensions within the empire, allegedly became one of the main reasons for the Empires eventual collapse&lt;ref&gt;https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzE2OTk0MDlfX0FO0?sid=c9f981df-c19d-422d-a0b2-4967af8ffedf@pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;vid=2&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=2&lt;/ref&gt; as it struggled to finance the extensive support to which it committed itself. Despite helping the military, the Empire did little to help ordinary systems as the concept of social security came around at a much later time in history.

Widows' funds were among the first pension type arrangement to appear. For example, [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha|Duke Ernest the Pious]] of [[Gotha]] in Germany founded a widows' fund for clergy in 1645 and another for teachers in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haberman|first=Steven|title=History of Actuarial Science, vol. 1|year=1995|publisher=William Pickering|location=London|isbn=978-1-85196-160-3|pages=xlviii|oclc=468359649}}&lt;/ref&gt;   'Various schemes of provision for ministers' widows were then established throughout Europe at about the start of the eighteenth century, some based on a single premium others based on yearly premiums to be distributed as benefits in the same year.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hald|first=A.|title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications Before 1750|year=1990|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-50230-2|oclc=19629739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main|State Socialism (Germany)}}
{{See also|Pensions in Germany}}
As part of [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s social legislation, the [[State Socialism (Germany)#Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889|Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill]] was enacted and implemented in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gianasso|first1=Alexandre|title=A Brief History of Pensions|url=http://www.damgoodpensions.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-pensions/|website=Davidson Asset Management|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Age Pension program, financed by a tax on workers, was originally designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70 years, though this was lowered to 65 years in 1916. Unlike accident insurance and health insurance, this program covered industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants from the start and was supervised directly by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Holborn, Hajo: A History of Modern Germany – 1840–1945: Princeton University Press; 1969; pp. 291–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's mandatory state pension provisions are based on the pay-as-you-go (or redistributive) model. Funds paid in by contributors (employees and employers) are not saved and neither invested but are used to pay current pension obligations.

Recently, the German government has come under criticism for the impending disaster posed by the exorbitant tax burden resulting from civil servants' pensions. A study, commissioned by the Taxpayers Association, that Professor Bernd Raffelhüschen of the Generation Contracts Research Center of the University of Freiburg carried out states that by 2050, the state will have to spend 1.3 to 1.4 trillion EUR to supply its civil servants. The majority of it, about 870 billion EUR, is therefore spent on pensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.focus.de/finanzen/altersvorsorge/pensionslasten-schon-jetzt-dramatisch-hoch-billionen-risiko-1-5-millionen-beamte-gehen-bald-in-ruhestand-wer-soll-das-zahlen_id_8219726.html|title=Billionen-Risiko! 1,5 Millionen Beamte gehen bald in Ruhestand - wer zahlt das?|last=Online|first=FOCUS|website=FOCUS Online|language=de|access-date=2020-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/1844|title=Die Pensionslasten der Bundesländer im Vergleich : Status Quo und zukünftige Entwicklung|website=freidok.uni-freiburg.de|access-date=2020-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government's financial statements for 2016 already show the extent of that disaster. According to this, the expected costs for pensions and subsidies for medical treatment  for the number of federal civil servants at the end of 2016 will amount to 647 billion EUR over the course of the next ten years. That is 63 billion EUR more than in the previous year - an increase of ten percent in just one year.

The sum is divided into:

* Pension obligations of EUR 477.96 billion (plus 9.7 percent) and

* Aid obligations of EUR 169.02 billion (plus 13.4 percent).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;/&gt;

Officials, judges and soldiers account for 238.4 billion EUR of the expected pension expenditure of almost 478 billion EUR. In addition, there are legacy issues from the times of large state-owned companies: the federal government has to pay out 171 billion EUR for old-age pensions for former postal officials and 68.5 billion EUR for former railway officials.

The problem: while the government preaches private pension provision to workers, the state itself has failed to build adequate reserves for the wave of pensions in the coming years. The federal government has been trying to create a cushion since 2007. So far, however, this has only amounted to 14 billion EUR by 2018. Professor Bernd Raffelhüschen criticised that the state had made high pension commitments for decades, &quot;but initially didn't build up any reserves for a long time.&quot;

Pensions, thus, represent a considerable burden for public budgets. As Professor Bernd Raffelhüschen calculated in his study in 2005, the present value of the pension burden for the federal states amounts to 1,797 billion EUR, which is larger than the Germany's total public debt.

In various federal states, efforts are being made to secure pension expenditure by setting up pension funds for newly hired civil servants. Fiscal relief is, however, only to be expected when the newly hired officials retire. The share of tax revenue needed to supply for the pensions will increase from approximately 10% in 2001 in many federal states to over 20% in 2020. In the extrem-case of the city-state of Hamburg, every fourth euro of income will be used to finance pensions for their retired civil servants.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Pensions in the Republic of Ireland}}
There is a history of pensions in [[Ireland]] that can be traced back to [[Brehon Law]] imposing a legal responsibility on the kin group to take care of its members who were aged, blind, deaf, sick or insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynn|first1=Theodore G.|last2=Clarke|first2=Blanaid J.|title=The Irish Corporate Governance System|date=19 August 2010|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1661617|ssrn=1661617}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion on pension funds and early Irish law, see F Kelly, ''A Guide to Early Irish Law'' (Dublin, [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], 1988).

[[File:Leeds public sector pensions strike in November 2011 14.jpg|thumb|Public sector workers in [[Leeds]] striking over pension changes by the government in November 2011]]
The decline of Feudal systems and formation of national states throughout Europe led to the reemergence of standing armies with their allegiances to states. Consequently, the sixteenth century in England marked the establishment of standardised systems of military pensions. During its 1592–93 session, Parliament established disability payments or “reliefe for Souldiours ... [who] adventured their lives and lost their limbs or disabled their bodies” in the service of the Crown. This pension was again generous by contemporary standards, even though annual pensions were not to exceed ten pounds for “private soldiers,” or twenty pounds for a “lieutenant.” &lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt;
 
The beginning of the modern state pension came with the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]], that provided 5 shillings (£0.25) a week for those over 70 whose annual means do not exceed £31.50. It coincided with the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09]] and was the first step in the [[Liberal welfare reforms]] to the completion of a system of social security, with unemployment and health insurance through the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].

In 1921, The Finance Act introduced tax relief on pension contributions in line with savings and life insurance. As a consequence, the overall size of the fund was increased since the income tax was now added to the pension as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portafina.co.uk/pensions/the-pension-timeline/|title=The Pension Timeline - complete history of pensions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1978, The [[State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme]] (SERPS) replaced The Graduated Pension Scheme from 1959, providing a pension related to earnings, in addition to the basic state pension. Employees and employers had the possibility to contribute to it between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 2002, when it was replaced by the [[State Second Pension]].

After the Second World War, the [[National Insurance Act 1946]] completed universal coverage of social security, introducing a State Pension for everybody on a contributory basis, with men being eligible at 65 and women at 60.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fixmypension.com/2018/02/27/a-brief-history-of-pensions/|title=A Brief History of Pensions – Fix My Pension}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Assistance Act 1948]] formally abolished the poor law, and gave a minimum income to those not paying national insurance.

The early 1990s established the existing framework for state pensions in the [[Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992]] and Superannuation and other Funds (Validation) Act 1992. Following the highly respected [[Goode Report]], occupational pensions were covered by comprehensive statutes in the [[Pension Schemes Act 1993]] and the [[Pensions Act 1995]].

In 2002 the [[Pensions Commission]] was established as a cross party body to review pensions in the United Kingdom. The first Act to follow was the [[Pensions Act 2004]] that updated regulation by replacing OPRA with the [[Pensions Regulator]] and relaxing the stringency of minimum funding requirements for pensions while ensuring protection for insolvent businesses. In a major update of the state pension, the [[Pensions Act 2007]], which aligned and raised retirement ages. Following that, the [[Pensions Act 2008]] has set up automatic enrolment for [[occupational pensions]], and a public competitor designed to be a low-cost and efficient fund manager, called the [[National Employment Savings Trust]] (or &quot;Nest&quot;).

===United States===
{{Main|Pensions in the United States}}
First &quot;American&quot; pensions came in 1636, when [[Plymouth colony]], and subsequently, other colonies such as Virginia, Maryland (1670s) and NY (1690s), offered the first colonial pension. The general assembly of the [[Virginia Company]] followed by approving a resolution known as Virginia Act IX of 1644 stating that &quot;...all hurt or maymed men be relieved and provided for by the several counties, where such men reside or inhabit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hening’s Laws of Virginia, Vol. I, page 287&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, during [[King Philip's War]], otherwise known as the First Indian War, this Act was expanded to widows and orphans in Virginia's Act of 1675.&lt;ref&gt;Hening’s Laws of Virginia, Vol. II, page 324 and page 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.statutesandstories.com/blog_html/first-american-colonial-pensions/|title=First American Colonial Pensions|date=18 November 2017|accessdate=29 April 2020|publisher=Statutes and Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public pensions got their start with various 'promises', informal and legislated, made to veterans of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and, more extensively, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  They were expanded greatly, and began to be offered by a number of state and local governments during the early [[Progressive Era]] in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. E. (1948). The Mexican War veterans as an organized group. The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, 35(2), 221-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costa, D. L. (1995). Pensions and retirement: Evidence from union army veterans. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110(2), 297-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal civilian pensions were offered under the [[Civil Service Retirement System]] (CSRS), formed in 1920.  CSRS provided retirement, disability and survivor benefits for most civilian employees in the US Federal government, until the creation of a new Federal agency, the [[Federal Employees Retirement System]] (FERS), in 1987.

Pension plans became popular in the United States during [[World War II]], when wage freezes prohibited outright increases in workers' pay. The defined benefit plan had been the most popular and common type of [[Retirement plans in the United States|retirement plan in the United States]] through the 1980s; since that time, defined contribution plans have become the more common type of retirement plan in the United States and many other western countries.

In April 2012, the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] Retirement Fund filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] protection.  The retirement fund is a [[defined benefit]] type pension plan and was only partially funded by the government, with only $268.4 million in [[asset]]s and $911 million in [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].  The plan experienced low investment returns and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in funding.&lt;ref name=p&amp;i20120419&gt;

==Current challenges==
[[File:Митинг 2 сентября 2018 пенсии Суворовская площадь (Москва) 05.jpg|thumb|[[2018 Russian pension protests]]]]
A growing challenge for many nations is [[population ageing]].  As birth rates drop and life expectancy increases an ever-larger portion of the population is elderly. This leaves fewer workers for each retired person.  In many developed countries this means that government and [[public sector]] pensions could potentially be a drag on their economies unless pension systems are reformed or taxes are increased.  One method of reforming the pension system is to increase the retirement age.  Two exceptions are [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], where the pension system is forecast to be [[Solvency|solvent]] for the foreseeable future. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  In Canada, for instance, the annual payments were increased by some 70% in 1998 to achieve this.  These two nations also have an advantage from their relative openness to immigration: immigrants tend to be of working age. However, their populations are not growing as fast as the U.S., which supplements a high immigration rate with one of the highest birthrates among Western countries. Thus, the population in the U.S. is not ageing to the extent as those in Europe, Australia, or Canada.

Another growing challenge is the recent trend of states and businesses in the United States purposely under-funding their pension schemes in order to push the costs onto the federal government. For example, in 2009, the majority of states have unfunded pension liabilities exceeding all reported state debt. [[Bradley Belt]], former executive director of the PBGC (the [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]], the federal agency that insures private-sector defined-benefit pension plans in the event of bankruptcy), testified before a Congressional hearing in October 2004, &quot;I am particularly concerned with the temptation, and indeed, growing tendency, to use the pension insurance fund as a means to obtain an interest-free and risk-free loan to enable companies to restructure. Unfortunately, the current calculation appears to be that shifting pension liabilities onto other premium payers or potentially taxpayers is the path of least resistance rather than a last resort.&quot;

Challenges have further been increased by the post-2007 credit crunch. Total funding of the nation's 100 largest corporate pension plans fell by $303bn in 2008, going from a $86bn surplus at the end of 2007 to a $217bn deficit at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Largest U.S. pension plans assets fall $217 billion short|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/retirement/2009-03-11-pension-plan-assets-short_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today, citing a report by Watson Wyatt|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pillars==
Most national pension systems are based on multi-pillar schemes to ensure greater flexibility and financial security to the old in contrast to reliance on one single system. In general, there are three main functions of pension systems: saving, redistribution and insurance functions. 
According to the report by the World Bank titled &quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&quot;, countries should consider separating the saving and redistributive functions, when creating pension systems, and placing them under different financing and managerial arrangements into three main pillars.

However, this typology is a rather prescriptive one than descriptive and most specialists usually allocate all public programmes to the first pillar, including earnings-related public schemes, which does not fit the original definition of the first pillar.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto6&quot;&gt;OECD (2006), “Pension-system Typology”, in OECD Pensions at a Glance 2005: Public Policies across
OECD Countries, OECD Publishing, Paris. https://doi.org/10.1787/pension_glance-2005-3-en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero pillar===
This non-contributory pillar was introduced only recently, aiming to alleviate poverty among the elderly, and permitting fiscal conditions. It is usually financed by the state and is in form of basic pension schemes or social assistance. &lt;ref&gt;Terziev, Venelin. (2019). HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PENSION SYSTEMS. 5. 124-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;Holzmann, R., Hinz, R., von Gersdorff, H., Gill, I., Impavido, G., Musalem, A. R., … Subbarao, K. (2005). Old-Age Income Support in the 21st Century: An International Perspective on Pension Systems and Reform (pp. 10–10). N.W. Washington, D.C. 20433,USA: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / THE WORLD BANK. Retrieved from http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPENSIONS/Resources/Old_Age_Inc_Supp_Full_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In some typologies, the zero and the first pillar overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto6&quot;/&gt;

===First pillar===
Pillar 1, sometimes referred to as ''the public pillar'' or ''first-tier'', answers the aim to prevent the poverty of the elderly, provide some absolute, minimum income based on solidarity and replace some portion of lifetime pre-retirement income. It is financed on a redistributive principle without constructing large reserves and takes the form of mandatory contributions linked to earnings such as minimum pensions within earnings-related plans, or separate targeted programs for retirement income. These are provided by the public sector and typically financed on pay-as-you-go basis.

===Second pillar===
Pillar 2, or ''the second tier,'' built on the basis of defined benefit and defined contribution plans with independent investment management, aims to protect the elderly from relative poverty and provides benefits supplementary to the income from the first pillar to contributors. &lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;[Terziev, Venelin. (2019). HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PENSION SYSTEMS. 5. 124-135.]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the second pillar fulfils the insurance function. In addition to DB's and DC's, other types of pension schemes of the second pillar are ''the contingent accounts'', known also as [[Notional Defined Contributions]] (implemented for example in Italy, Latvia, Poland and Sweden) or ''occupational pension schemes'' (applied, for instance, in Estonia, Germany and Norway).&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

===Third pillar===
The third tier consists of voluntary contributions in various different forms, including occupational or private saving plans, and products for individuals. 

===Fourth Pillar=== 
The fourth pillar is usually excluded from classifications since it does not usually have a legal basis and consists of &quot;informal support (such as family), other formal social programs (such as health care or housing), and other individual assets (such as home ownership and reverse mortgages).&quot;

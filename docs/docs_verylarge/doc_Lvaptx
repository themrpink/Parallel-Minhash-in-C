'''Payload''' is the carrying capacity of an [[aircraft]] or [[launch vehicle]], usually measured in terms of weight. Depending on the nature of the flight or mission, the payload of a vehicle may include [[cargo]], [[passenger]]s, [[flight crew]], [[munition]]s, scientific instruments or experiments, or other equipment. Extra fuel, when optionally carried, is also considered part of the payload. In a commercial context (i.e., an [[airline]] or [[air freight carrier]]), payload may refer only to revenue-generating cargo or paying passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/payload|title=Payload - Define Payload at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080445/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/payload|archivedate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a rocket, the payload can be a [[satellite]], [[space probe]], or [[spacecraft]] carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a [[ballistic missile]], the payload is one or more [[warhead]]s and related systems; their total weight is referred to as the [[throw-weight]].

The fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the &quot;[[payload fraction]]&quot;. When the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together, it is known as the &quot;[[useful load fraction]]&quot;. In spacecraft, &quot;mass fraction&quot; is normally used, which is the ratio of payload to everything else, including the rocket structure.&lt;ref&gt;Launius, Roger D. Jenkins, Dennis R. 2002.

==Relationship of range and payload==
[[File:Payloadrange.jpg|thumb]]
There is a natural trade-off between the payload and the [[range (aircraft)|range]] of an aircraft. A payload range diagram (also known as the &quot;elbow chart&quot;) illustrates the trade-off.

The top horizontal line represents the maximum payload. It is limited structurally by [[maximum zero-fuel weight]] (MZFW) of the aircraft. Maximum payload is the difference between maximum zero-fuel weight and operational empty weight (OEW). Moving left-to-right along the line shows the constant maximum payload as the range increases. More fuel needs to be added for more range.

The vertical line represents the range at which the combined weight of the aircraft, maximum payload and needed fuel reaches the [[maximum take-off weight]] (MTOW) of the aircraft. If the range is increased beyond that point, payload has to be sacrificed for fuel.

The maximum take-off weight is limited by a combination of the maximum net power of the engines and the lift/drag ratio of the wings. The diagonal line after the range-at-maximum-payload point shows how reducing the payload allows increasing the fuel (and range) when taking off with the maximum take-off weight.

The second kink in the curve represents the point at which the maximum fuel capacity is reached. Flying further than that point means that the payload has to be reduced further, for an even lesser increase in range. The absolute range is thus the range at which an aircraft can fly with maximum possible fuel without carrying any payload.

==Examples==
Examples of payload capacity:
*[[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']]: 250,000&amp;nbsp;kg
*[[Saturn V]]:
**Payload to [[Low Earth Orbit]] 140,000&amp;nbsp;kg
**Payload to Lunar orbit 47,000&amp;nbsp;kg
*[[Space Shuttle]]:
**Payload to Low Earth Orbit (Not counting the 110,000&amp;nbsp;kg serviced orbiter) 27,000&amp;nbsp;kg (53,700&amp;nbsp;lb)
**Payload to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (Not counting the 110,000&amp;nbsp;kg serviced orbiter) 3,810&amp;nbsp;kg (8,390&amp;nbsp;lb)
*[[Trident (missile)]]: 2800&amp;nbsp;kg [[throw weight]] {{specify|date=February 2015}}{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
*[[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]
**Payload:&lt;ref&gt;http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/ATV/FS003_12_ATV_updated_launch_2008.pdf [[European Space Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; 7,667&amp;nbsp;kg 8 racks with 2 x 0.314 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 2 x 0.414 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
**Envelope: each 1.146 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in front of 4 of these 8 racks
**Cargo mass: Dry cargo: 1,500 - 5,500&amp;nbsp;kg
**Water: 0 – 840&amp;nbsp;kg
**Gas (Nitrogen, Oxygen, air, 2 gases/flight): 0 – 100&amp;nbsp;kg
**ISS Refueling propellant: 0 – 860&amp;nbsp;kg (306&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel, 554&amp;nbsp;kg of oxidizer)
**ISS re-boost and attitude control propellant: 0 - 4,700&amp;nbsp;kg
**Total cargo upload capacity: 7,667&amp;nbsp;kg

==Structural capacity==
For aircraft, the weight of fuel in [[wing tank]]s does not contribute as significantly to the [[bending moment]] of the wing as does weight in the fuselage. So even when the airplane has been loaded with its maximum payload that the wings can support, it can still carry a significant amount of fuel.

==Payload constraints==
Launch and transport system differ not only on the payload that can be carried but also in the stresses and other factors placed on the payload.  The payload must not only be lifted to its target, it must also arrive safely, whether elsewhere on the surface of the Earth or a specific orbit.  To ensure this the payload, such as a warhead or satellite, is designed to withstand certain amounts of various types of &quot;punishment&quot; on the way to its destination.  Most rocket payloads are fitted within a [[payload fairing]] to protect them against [[dynamic pressure]] of high-velocity travel through the atmosphere, and to improve the overall aerodynamics of the launch vehicle. Most aircraft payloads are carried within the [[fuselage]] for similar reasons.  [[Outsize cargo]] may require a fuselage with unusual proportions, such as the [[Super Guppy]].

The various constraints placed on the launch system can be roughly categorized into those that cause physical damage to the payload and those that can damage its electronic or chemical makeup. Examples of physical damage include extreme accelerations over short time scales caused by atmospheric buffeting or oscillations, extreme accelerations over longer time scales caused by rocket thrust and gravity, and sudden changes in the magnitude or direction of the acceleration caused by how quick engines are throttled and shut down, etc. Electrical, chemical, or biological payloads can be damage by extreme temperatures (hot or cold), rapid changes in temperature or pressure, contact with fast moving air streams causing ionization, and radiation exposure from [[cosmic ray]]s, the [[van Allen belt]], or [[solar wind]].

'''Pseudo bit error ratio''' (PBER) in adaptive [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]], is a [[bit error ratio]] derived by a majority decoder that processes redundant transmissions. 

''Note:''  In adaptive HF radio [[automatic link establishment]], PBER is determined by the extent of error correction, such as by using the fraction of non-unanimous votes in the 2-of-3 majority decoder.

It was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former [[Poznań Voivodeship|Poznań]], [[Kalisz Voivodeship|Kalisz]], [[Konin Voivodeship|Konin]], [[Piła Voivodeship|Piła]] and [[Leszno Voivodeship|Leszno]] Voivodeships, pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998. The province is named after the region called [[Greater Poland]] or ''Wielkopolska'' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Wielkopolska.ogg|w|j|e|l|k|o|'|p|o|l|s|k|a}}. The modern province includes most of this historic region, except for some western parts.

Greater Poland Voivodeship is second in area and third in population among Poland's sixteen voivodeships, with an area of {{convert|29826|km2|sqmi}} and a population of close to 3.5&amp;nbsp;million. Its capital city is [[Poznań]]; other important cities include [[Kalisz]], [[Konin]], [[Piła]], [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], [[Gniezno]] (an early capital of Poland) and [[Leszno]]. It is bordered by seven other voivodeships: [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West Pomeranian]] to the northwest, [[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]] to the north, [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kuyavian-Pomeranian]] to the north-east, [[Łódź Voivodeship|Łódź]] to the south-east, [[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]] to the south, [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] to the southwest and [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz]] to the west.

==History==
{{main|Greater Poland}}

Greater Poland, sometimes called the &quot;cradle of Poland,&quot; formed the heart of the 10th-century [[History of Poland (966–1385)|early Polish state]]. [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]] were early centers of royal power, but following the region's devastation by [[pagan]] rebellion in the 1030s, and an invasion by [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia]] in 1038, the capital was moved by [[Casimir the Restorer]] from Gniezno to [[Kraków]].

In the [[testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth]], which initiated the period of fragmentation of Poland (1138–1320), the western part of Greater Poland (including Poznań) was granted to [[Mieszko III the Old]]. The eastern part, with Gniezno and [[Kalisz]], was part of the [[Duchy of Kraków]], granted to [[Władysław II the Exile]]. However, for most of the period the two parts were under a single ruler, and were known as the [[Duchy of Greater Poland]] (although at times there were separately ruled duchies of Poznań, Gniezno, [[Kalisz]] and [[Ujście]]). The region came under the control of [[Władysław I the Elbow-High]] in 1314, and thus became part of the reunited Poland of which Władysław was crowned king in 1320.

In the reunited kingdom, and later in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the country came to be divided into administrative units called [[voivodeship]]s. In the case of the Greater Poland region these were [[Poznań Voivodeship]] and [[Kalisz Voivodeship]]. The Commonwealth also had larger subdivisions known as ''[[prowincja]]'', one of which was named Greater Poland. However, this ''prowincja'' covered a larger area than the Greater Poland region itself, also taking in [[Masovia]] and [[Royal Prussia]]. (This division of [[Crown Poland]] into two entities called Greater and [[Lesser Poland]] had its roots in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] of 1346–1362, where the laws of &quot;Greater Poland&quot; – the northern part of the country – were codified in the [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] statute, with those of &quot;Lesser Poland&quot; in the separate [[Wiślica]] statute.)

In 1768 a new [[Gniezno Voivodeship]] was formed out of the northern part of Kalisz Voivodeship. However more far-reaching changes would come with the [[Partitions of Poland]]. In the first partition (1772), northern parts of Greater Poland along the [[Noteć]] (German ''Netze'') were taken over by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], becoming the [[Netze District]]. In the second partition (1793) the whole of Greater Poland was absorbed by Prussia, becoming part of the province of [[South Prussia]]. It remained so in spite of the first [[Greater Poland Uprising (1794)]], part of the unsuccessful [[Kościuszko Uprising]] directed chiefly against the [[Russian Empire]].

[[File:POL województwo kaliskie IRP COA.svg|thumb|right|150px|Historical coat of arms of the [[Greater Poland]] region]]

More successful was the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1806)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1806]], which led to the region's becoming part of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] (forming the [[Poznań Department]] and parts of the [[Kalisz Department|Kalisz]] and [[Bydgoszcz Department|Bydgoszcz]] Departments). However, following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Greater Poland was again partitioned, with the western part (including Poznań) going to Prussia. The eastern part joined the Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], where it formed the [[Kalisz Voivodeship]] until 1837, then the [[Kalisz Governorate]] (merged into the [[Warsaw Governorate]] between 1844 and 1867).

Within the Prussian empire, western Greater Poland became the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] (Poznań), which theoretically held some autonomy. Following an unrealized [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising in 1846]], and the more substantial but still unsuccessful [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|uprising of 1848]] (during the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]]), the Grand Duchy was replaced by the [[Province of Posen]]. The authorities made efforts to [[Germanization|Germanize]] the region, particularly after the founding of Germany in 1871, and from 1886 onwards the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] was active in increasing German land ownership in formerly Polish areas.

[[File:Powstancy Wlkp.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Soldiers during [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] of 1918–19]]
Following the end of World War I, the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)]] ensured that most of the region became part of the newly independent Polish state, forming most of [[Poznań Voivodeship (1921–1939)]]. Northern and some western parts of Greater Poland remained in Germany, where they formed much of the province of [[Posen-West Prussia]] (1922–1938), whose capital was Schneidemühl ([[Piła]]).

Following the [[German invasion of Poland|German invasion]] of 1939, Greater Poland was incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]], becoming the province called [[Reichsgau Posen]], later Reichsgau Wartheland (''Warthe'' being the German name for the [[Warta]] river). The Polish population was oppressed, with many former officials and others considered potential enemies by the Nazis being imprisoned or executed, including at the notorious [[Fort VII]] concentration camp in Poznań. Poznań was declared a stronghold city ''([[German World War II strongholds|Festung]])'' in the closing stages of the war, being taken by the [[Red Army]] in the [[Battle of Poznań (1945)|Battle of Poznań]], which ended on 22 February 1945.

After the war, Greater Poland was fully within the [[Polish People's Republic]], as [[Poznań Voivodeship]]. With the reforms of 1975 this was divided into smaller provinces (the voivodeships of [[Kalisz Voivodeship|Kalisz]], [[Konin Voivodeship|Konin]], [[Leszno Voivodeship|Leszno]] and [[Piła Voivodeship|Piła]], and a smaller Poznań Voivodeship). The present-day Greater Poland Voivodeship, again with Poznań as its capital, was created in 1999.

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[File:DB$-54.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Barycz Valley Landscape Park]]]]
The relief of Greater Poland, geological conditions and soil have been shaped by two glaciations:
* The Baltic glaciation in the lowlands of northern and central Europe where there are now numerous lakes of the Pomeranian Lake District, a feature especially common in and around [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]].
* The Mid-glaciation in the southern part of the province, where there is less terrain diversity and a lack of major lakes.

The highest elevation is Greater Kobyla Mountain (284 m) in the Ostrzeszowski Hills, the lowest area is located in the valley of the [[Warta]] River at the mouth of its tributary the [[Noteć]] (21 m) in the north-western part of the region. Agriculturally fertile soils account for around 60% of the province's area, while 20%, the rest of the non-forested or urban areas, is mostly wetland soil (muck-peat and alluvial soils).

An area of approximately 800 thousand hectares is covered by forests, this represents around 25.8% of the total surface area of the region.
In the lake districts of the northern and central parts of the province there are about 800 lakes; 58% of which cover an area of at least 10 hectares and 8%, with an area exceeding 100 hectares. The largest reservoir is the natural Greater Powidzkie Lake (1036 ha) in the Gniezno Lake District.

Wielkopolska Region lies within the basin of the [[Oder River]], 88% of the province's surface water drains into the Warta river basin, and the remaining 12% is drained by a multitude of other river systems, including the Barycz, Ladislaus Trench and Obrzycy waterways. The quality of river waters is generally poor, but their condition is gradually improving and should soon be classed as 'clean'.

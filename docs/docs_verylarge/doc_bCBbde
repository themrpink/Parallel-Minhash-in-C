In 2002, the South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme was launched to help further the studies and conservation of the coelacanth. This program focuses on biodiversity conservation, evolutionary biology, capacity building, and public understanding. The South African government committed to spending R10&amp;nbsp;million on the program.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref16&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=South Africa announces plans for Coelacanth Programme |publisher=Science in Africa |date=February 2002 |url=http://scienceinafrica.com/south-africa-announces-plans-coelacanth-programme |access-date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref15&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme |publisher=African Conservation Foundation |url=http://www.wildnetafrica.org/explorer/item/south-african-coelacanth-conservation-and-genome-resource-programme?category_id=2545 |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155421/http://www.wildnetafrica.org/explorer/item/south-african-coelacanth-conservation-and-genome-resource-programme?category_id=2545 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, a plan for a Tanga Coelacanth Marine Park was designed to conserve marine biodiversity for marine animals including the coelacanth. The park was designed to reduce habitat destruction and improve prey availability for endangered species.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

== Human consumption ==
Coelacanths are considered a poor source of food for humans and likely most other fish-eating animals. Coelacanth flesh has high amounts of oil, [[urea]], [[wax ester]]s, and other compounds that give the flesh a distinctly unpleasant flavor, make it difficult to digest and can cause [[diarrhea]]. Their scales themselves emit mucus, which combined with the excessive oil their bodies produce, make coelacanths a slimy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Creature Feature: 10 Fun Facts About the Coelacanth|url = https://www.wired.com/2015/03/creature-feature-10-fun-facts-coelacanth/|journal = Wired|access-date = 2015-10-30|date = 2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the coelacanth is more common, local fishermen avoid it because of its potential to sicken consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3029/know-any-good-recipes-for-endangered-prehistoric-fish-plus |title=Know any good recipes for endangered prehistoric fish?

==Cultural significance==
Because of the surprising nature of the coelacanth's discovery, they have been a frequent source of inspiration in modern artwork, craftsmanship, and literature. At least 22 countries have depicted them on their postage stamps, particularly the [[Comoros]], where they have issued twelve different sets of coelacanth stamps. The coelacanth is also depicted on the 1000 [[Comorian franc]] banknote, as well as the 55 CF coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=J. L.

'''UNCF''', the '''United Negro College Fund''', also known as the '''United Fund''', is an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 37 private [[historically black colleges and universities]]. UNCF was incorporated on April 25, 1944 by [[Frederick D. Patterson]] (then president of what is now [[Tuskegee University]]), [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and others. UNCF is headquartered at 1805 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;uncf-contact&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/contact_us.asp Contact Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142807/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/contact_us.asp |date=2013-10-02 }}&quot;. United Negro College Fund. Accessed October 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Look up the address 1805 7th Street, NW--&gt;  In 2005, UNCF supported approximately 65,000 students at over 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships. About 60% of these students are the first in their families to attend college, and 62% have annual family incomes of less than $25,000. UNCF also administers over 450 named scholarships.

UNCF's president and chief executive officer is [[Michael Lomax]]. Past presidents of the UNCF included [[William H. Gray (Pennsylvania politician)|William H. Gray]] and [[Vernon Jordan]].

==Scholarships==
Though founded to address funding inequities in education resources for [[African Americans]], UNCF-administered scholarships are open to all ethnicities; the great majority of recipients are still African-American. It provides scholarships to students attending its member colleges as well as to those going elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;uncf-faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/faqs.asp |title=UNCF Faq |publisher=UNCF |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142851/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/faqs.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of UNCF member institutions and scholarships have included many Black people in the fields of business, politics, health care and the arts. Some prominent UNCF alumni include: Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and leader in the [[civil rights movement]]; [[Alexis Herman]], former [[U.S. Secretary of Labor]]; movie director [[Spike Lee]]; actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]]; [[General]] [[Chappie James]], the [[U.S. Air Force]]’s first black four-star general; and Dr. [[David Satcher]], a former [[U.S. Surgeon General]] and director of the [[Centers for Disease Control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uncf-aboutus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/aboutus.asp |title=UNCF |publisher=UNCF |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142108/http://www.uncf.org/sections/WhoWeAre/SS_AboutUs/aboutus.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1944 [[William J. Trent]], a long time activist for education for blacks, joined with Tuskegee Institute President Frederick D. Patterson and Mary McLeod Bethune to found the UNCF, a nonprofit that united college presidents to raise money collectively through an &quot;appeal to the national conscience&quot;. As the first executive director from the organization's start in 1944 until 1964, Trent raised $78 million for historically black colleges so they could become &quot;strong citadels of learning, carriers of the American dream, seedbeds of social evolution and revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Wharton Alumni Magazine'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, reflecting shifting attitudes toward the word [[negro]] in its name, the UNCF shifted from using its full name to using only its initials, releasing a new logo with the initials alone and featuring their slogan more prominently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/business/media/17adco.html |title=Revising a Name, but Not a Familiar Slogan |last=Quenqua |first=Douglas |date=January 17, 2008 |website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/United-Negro-College-Fund/40274 |title=United Negro College Fund Decides Its Great Tag Line Is a Terrible Thing to Waste |last=Schmidt |first=Peter |date=January 17, 2008 |website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising and the Lou Rawls Parade of Stars ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
[[File:United Negro College Fund DC.JPG|thumb|United Negro College Fund headquarters in Washington, D.C.]]
The UNCF has received charitable donations for its scholarship programs.  One of the more high-profile donations made was by then-senator and future [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] who donated the money from the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his book ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'' to the Fund. The largest ever single donation was made in 1990 by [[Walter Annenberg]], who donated $50 million to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211134655/http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/african/2000/1990.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1980, singer [[Lou Rawls]] began the &quot;Lou Rawls Parade of Stars&quot; [[telethon]] to benefit the UNCF. The annual event, now known as &quot;An Evening of Stars&quot;, consists of stories of successful African-American students who have graduated or benefited from one of the many historically black colleges and universities and who received support from the UNCF.  The telethon featured comedy and musical performances from various artists in support of the UNCF's and Rawls' efforts. The event has raised over $200 million in 27 shows for the fund through 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;prnewstoday.com&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313124917/http://www.prnewstoday.com/release.htm?cat=music&amp;dat=20060106&amp;rl=DCF04006012006-1] &lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, Rawls was honored by the United Negro College Fund for his more than 25 years of charity work with the organization. Instead of Rawls' hosting and performing, he was given the [[seat of honor]] and celebrated by his performing colleagues, including [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Gerald Levert]], [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], and several others. Before his death in January 2006, Rawls' last performance was a taping for the 2006 telethon that honored Wonder, months before entering the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;prnewstoday.com&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the telethon, there are a number of other fundraising activities, including the &quot;Walk for Education&quot; held annually in [[Los Angeles, California]], which includes a five kilometer walk/run. In [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], the [[Cypresswood Golf Club]] hosts an annual golf tournament in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;uncf-events&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncf.org/sections/Events/Events.asp |title=UNCF Events |publisher=UNCF |accessdate=2013-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002142226/http://www.uncf.org/sections/Events/Events.asp |archivedate=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Koch Industries Inc.]] and the [[Charles Koch Foundation]] made a $25 million grant to UNCF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Koch brothers donate $25 million to United Negro College Fund|author=Sullivan, Sean|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/06/koch-brothers-donate-25-million-to-united-negro-college-fund/|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest of the Kochs, the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]], a major labor union, ended its yearly $50,000–60,000 support for UNCF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/10/koch-brother-grant-halts-union-support-for-united-negro-college-fund/ |title=Union halts support for United Negro College Fund over Koch brothers' grant |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2014-07-11|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2020, philanthropists [[Reed Hastings]] and his wife Patty Quillin donated $40 million to the UNCF to be used as scholarship funds for students enrolled at UNCF institutions.  Their single donation is the largest in UNCF history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/netflix-ceo-hastings-donating-120-million-to-historically-black-institutions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-donation-120-million-hbcus-morehouse-spelman/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UNCF motto==
In 1972, the UNCF adopted as its [[motto]] the maxim &quot;A mind is a terrible thing to waste.&quot; This maxim has become one of the most widely recognized slogans in [[advertising]] history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdant-systems.com/Mind.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183340/http://www.verdant-systems.com/Mind.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto was notably mangled in a 1989 address to the organization by then–Vice President of the United States [[Dan Quayle]], who stated: &quot;And you take the U.N.C.F. model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, Maureen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/25/magazine/the-education-of-dan-quayle.html?pagewanted=all &quot;The Education of Dan Quayle&quot;]. ''The New York Times''. June 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
The motto, which has been used in numerous award-winning UNCF ad campaigns, was created by Forest Long, of the advertising agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]], in partnership with the [[Ad Council]].&lt;ref&gt;See the UNCF website.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesser-known slogan the UNCF also uses, in reference to its intended beneficiaries, points out that they're &quot;not asking for a handout, just a hand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gasman, Marybeth (2007). ''Envisioning Black Colleges: A History of the United Negro College Fund'' (page 192). Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World peace''', or '''peace on Earth''', is the concept of an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] state of happiness, [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[peace]] within and among all people and nations on [[Earth|Planet Earth]]. This idea of the world [[non-violence]] is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that has this objective. Different cultures, religions, philosophies, and organizations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.

Various religious and secular organizations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing [[human rights]], technology, [[peace education|education]], engineering, medicine, or [[diplomat|diplomacy]] used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the [[United Nations]] and the five [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] ([[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. None the less, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==World peace theories==
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}

Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.
===Peace through strength===
{{Main|Peace through strength}}

The term is traced back to the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] (reigned AD 117 – 138) but the concept is as old as recorded history. In the Indian Epic Ramayana, considered 7000 years old, Lord Rama is quoted as saying &quot;Bhay Bin Hoye na Preet&quot; meaning once prayers for peace fail, one may need to instill fear to bring peace. In 1943, at the peak of [[World War II]], the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], argued that after the war the United States is bound to take &quot;command of the skies&quot; to ensure the lasting world peace:
{{quote|
But the inauguration of such a glorious century of peace demands from us abandonment of old conceptions of peace. The new Angel of Peace must no longer be pictured as a charming but helpless lady with an olive branch in her hand, but like the Goddess of Justice with a balance in her left and a sword in her right; or like the Archangel Michael, with a fiery sword and wings of steel, fighting the devil to restore and protect the peace of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), p 299, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] at [[Offutt Air Force Base]] stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: &quot;Peace is our profession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Thomas S. Power]], ''Design for Survival'', (New York: Coward McCann, 1964), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The motto &quot;was a staggering paradox that was also completely accurate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip S. Meilinger, ''Bomber: The Formation and Early History of Strategic Air Command'', (Alabama: Air University Press, 2012), p XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; One SAC Bomber—[[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|Convair B-36]]—is called ''Peacemaker'' and one inter-continental missile-[[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|LGM-118]]-''Peacekeeper''.

In 2016, former US Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] envisaged that the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will make the region &quot;peaceful&quot; through &quot;strength&quot;: 
{{quote|
You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific ... realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play ... You'll do so with strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=&quot;The Future of the Rebalance: Enabling Security in the Vital &amp; Dynamic Asia-Pacific&quot;, Secretary of Defense Speech, September 29, 2016, Washington: Department of Defense|url= https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/959937/remarks-on-the-future-of-the-rebalance-enabling-security-in-the-vital-dynamic-a?source=GovDelivery}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
Introduction to US National Security and Defense Strategies of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will &quot;preserve peace through strength&quot;. The document proceeds to detail what &quot;achieving peace through strength requires&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf|title=Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with ''peace through strength'' are concepts of ''preponderance of power'' (as opposed to [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]), [[hegemonic stability theory]], ''unipolar stability'', and imperial peace (such as [[Pax Romana]], [[Pax Britannica]], or [[Pax Americana]]).

===Marxism: World peace via world revolution===

According to the dialectic materialist theory of [[Karl Marx]], humanity under capitalism is divided into just two classes: the proletariat - who do not possess the means of production, and the bourgeoisie - who do possess the means of production. Once the communist revolution occurs and consequently abolishes the private propriety of the means of production, humanity will not be divided and the tension created between these two classes will cease. Through a period called socialism, the rule of the proletariat will dissolve the last vestiges of capitalism and will help to make the revolution worldwide. Once private propriety has been abolished worldwide, the state will no longer be needed to act as a monopoly of violence and will therefore disappear. Organizations of workers will take their place and manage the production of things, but no organization will have any military power, a police force, nor prisons.

The main principle of Marx's theory is that material conditions limit spiritual conditions. Should their material conditions allow it, people around the world will not be violent but respectful, peaceful, and altruistic. In a state of communism, they will no longer need to live for survival, but for their own spiritual fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tyagi|first=Abhishek|title=Peace|url=https://innerpeacezone.com/about/|website=Inner Peace Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential interactions ===
Several adverse interactions with drugs have been documented, both prescription and nonprescription&amp;nbsp;– including, but not limited to, [[anticonvulsants]], alcohol, [[anxiolytics]] (CNS depressants such as [[benzodiazepines]]), [[antipsychotics]], [[levodopa]], diuretics, and drugs metabolized by [[Cytochrome P450|CYP450]] in the liver.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;

A few notable potential drug interactions are, but are not limited to:
* Alcohol: It has been reported that combined use of alcohol and kava extract can have additive sedative effects.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cairney S. |author2=Maruff P. |author3=Clough A.

* Anxiolytics (CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates): Kava may have potential additive CNS depressant effects (such as sedation and anxiolytic effects) with [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturates]].&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* [[Dopamine]] [[agonist]] - [[levodopa]]: One of levodopa’s chronic side effects that Parkinson’s patients experience is the &quot;on-off phenomenon&quot; of motor fluctuations where there will be periods of oscillations between &quot;on&quot; where the patient experiences symptomatic relief and &quot;off&quot; where the therapeutic effect wears off early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lees AJ|title=The on-off phenomenon|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=1989|volume=Suppl|issue=9|pages=29–37|pmid=1033307|doi=10.1136/jnnp.52.suppl.29|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking levodopa and kava together, it has been shown that there is an increased frequency of this &quot;on-off phenomenon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Izzo AA, Ernst E.

=== Kava dermopathy ===
Long term and heavy kava consumption is associated with a fully reversible [[cutaneous condition|skin condition]] known as &quot;kava dermopathy&quot; or ''kani kani'' (in Fiji) characterised by dry and scaly skin covering the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and back.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruze|first=P.|date=1990-06-16|title=Originally published as Volume 1, Issue 8703Kava-induced dermopathy: a niacin deficiency?|journal=The Lancet|volume=335|issue=8703|pages=1442–1445|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(90)91458-M|pmid=1972218|s2cid=9737032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton 89–97&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Scott A.|last2=Ruze|first2=Patricia|date=1994-07-01|title=Kava dermopathy|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=89–97|doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(94)70142-3|pmid=8021378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first symptom to appear usually is dry, peeling skin; some Pacific Islanders deliberately consume large quantities of Kava for several weeks in order to get the peeling effect, resulting in a layer of new skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kava Side Effects|url=http://www.kavalibrary.com/side-effects.html|website=The Kava Library|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects appeared at consumption levels between {{convert|31|g|oz}} to {{convert|440|g|lb}} a week of kava powder.

==Research==
Kava is under preliminary research for its potential [[psychoactive]]&lt;ref name=pmid21073405/&gt; &amp;ndash; primarily [[anxiolytic]] &amp;ndash; sleep-inducing, and sleep-enhancing properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheatley|first=David|date=2001-06-01|title=Stress-induced insomnia treated with kava and valerian: singly and in combination|journal=Human Psychopharmacology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=353–356|doi=10.1002/hup.299|issn=1099-1077|pmid=12404572|s2cid=37457833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary [[randomised controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]] in [[anxiety disorder]]s indicate a higher rate of improvement in anxiety symptoms after kava treatment, relative to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sarris|first1=Jerome|last2=Stough|first2=Con|last3=Bousman|first3=Chad|last4=Wahid|first4=Zahra|last5=Murray|first5=Greg|last6=Teschke|first6=Rolf|last7=Dowell|first7=Ashley|last8=Ng|first8=Chee|last9=Schweitzer|first9=Isaac|date=2013-10-01|title=Kava in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=643–48|doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e318291be67|pmid=23635869|s2cid=13747661|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12eaf5b8fd6a795d78233d65584ee05de0f67c7b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional medicine==
[[File:Yaqona-bundle-Fiji-2010.jpg|thumb|A traditional Fijian yaqona bundle of roots]]

Over centuries, kava has been used in the [[traditional medicine]] of the South [[Pacific Islands]] for [[central nervous system]] and peripheral effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Showman 56–67&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Showman|first1=Angelique F.|last2=Baker|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Linares|first3=Christina|last4=Naeole|first4=Chrystie K.|last5=Borris|first5=Robert|last6=Johnston|first6=Edward|last7=Konanui|first7=Jerry|last8=Turner|first8=Helen|date=2015-01-01|title=Contemporary Pacific and Western perspectives on 'awa (Piper methysticum) toxicology|journal=Fitoterapia|volume=100|pages=56–67|doi=10.1016/j.fitote.2014.11.012|issn=1873-6971|pmid=25464054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in one literature review: &quot;Peripherally, kava is indicated in traditional Pacific medicine for urogenital conditions ([[gonorrhea]] infections, chronic [[Urinary tract infection|cystitis]], difficulty urinating), reproductive and women's health (...), gastrointestinal upsets, respiratory ailments ([[asthma]], coughs, and [[tuberculosis]]), skin diseases and topical wounds, and as an [[analgesic]], with significant subtlety and nuance attending the precise strain, plant component (leaf, stem, root) and preparative method to be used&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Showman 56–67&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation==
Kava remains legal in most countries. Regulations often treat it as a food or [[dietary supplement]].

===Australia===
In Australia, the supply of kava is regulated through the National Code of Kava Management.&lt;ref name=ANZFSC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2009C01242|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.6.3 - Kava|publisher=Federal Register of Legislation|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers to Australia are allowed to bring up to 4&amp;nbsp;kg of kava in their baggage, provided they are at least 18 years old, and the kava is in root or dried form. Commercial import of larger quantities is allowed, under licence for medical or scientific purposes. These restrictions were introduced in 2007 after concern about abuse of kava in indigenous communities. Initially, the import limit was 2&amp;nbsp;kg per person; it was raised to 4&amp;nbsp;kg in December 2019, and a pilot program allowing for commercial importation was announced, to be implemented by the end of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tga.gov.au/restrictions-import-kava-australia|title=Restrictions on the import of kava to Australia|date=14 April 2015|website=Therapeutic Goods Administration, Department of Health, Australian Government|accessdate=22 October 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/17/c_138637423.htm |title=Travelers from Fiji to Australia can now take more kava for social functions |date=17 December 2019 |accessdate=21 January 2020 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] has recommended no more than 250&amp;nbsp;mg of kavalactones be taken in a 24‑hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.htm | accessdate=10 July 2006 | title=Kava fact sheet | publisher=Therapeutic Goods Administration, Government of Australia | date=April 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720200953/http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.htm | archivedate=20 July 2006}} ([http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.pdf Download PDF 44KB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014802/http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.pdf |date=20 August 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Following the discussions on the safety of certain pharmaceutical products derived from kava and sold in Germany, in 2002 the EU imposed a temporary ban on imports of kava-based pharmaceutical products. The sale of kava plant became regulated in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], and in prepared form in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C.I.J.M.

In Germany, kava-based pharmaceutical preparations are currently prescription drugs. Furthermore, patient and professional information brochures have been redesigned to warn about potential side effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/index.php?id=57419Kava-Kava, Comeback unter strengen Auflagen]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}(in German). PHARMAZEUTISCHE ZEITUNG online 16/2015. Retrieved 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; These strict measures have been opposed by some of the leading kava scientists. In early 2016 a court case has been filed against the Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM/German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) arguing that the new regulatory regime is too strict and not justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.dailypost.vu/news/new-kava-challenge/article_8e921a99-f924-54a9-b17c-891d55811f52.html?mode=jqm|title=New Kava Challenge|website=Vanuatu Daily Post|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fijian kava ceremony.jpg|thumb|Fijian kava ceremony being performed for tourists (2015)]]

In the [[United Kingdom]] it is a criminal offence to sell, supply or import any medicinal product containing kava for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3170/contents/made|title=The Medicines for Human Use (Kava-kava) (Prohibition) Order 2002|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is legal to possess kava for personal use, or to import it for purposes other than human consumption (e.g. for animals).

Until August 2018, Poland was the only EU country with an &quot;outright ban on kava&quot; and where the mere possession of kava was prohibited and may have resulted in a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailypost.vu/news/kava-banned-in-poland/article_845575d3-6dd0-5c03-a1c4-e0720c868a7a.html|title=KAVA BANNED IN POLAND|last=Garae|first=Len|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new legislation, kava is no longer listed among prohibited substances and it is therefore legal to possess, import and consume the plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001591|title=Rozporządzenie Ministra Zdrowia z dnia 17 sierpnia 2018 r. w sprawie wykazu substancji psychotropowych, środków odurzających oraz nowych substancji psychoaktywnych|website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains illegal to sell it within Poland for the purpose of human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rp.pl/Zdrowie/309039965-Kava-zalegalizowana-Marihuana-bedzie-nastepna.html|title=Kava zalegalizowana.

===New Zealand===
When used traditionally kava is regulated as a food under the Food Standards Code. Kava can also be used as a herbal remedy. When used in this way kava is currently regulated by the Dietary Supplements Regulations. Only traditionally consumed forms and parts of the kava plant (i.e. pure roots of the kava plant and water extractions prepared from these roots) can legally be sold as food or dietary supplements in New Zealand. The sale of never traditionally consumed above-ground parts of the plant (unlike the roots of the plant, the aerial parts contain very small amounts of kavalactones and instead contain a mildly toxic alkaloid pipermethysticine&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;) and non-water based extract (such as CO2, acetonic or ethanol extractions) is prohibited for the purpose of human consumption (but can be sold as an ingredient in cosmetics or other products not intended for human consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/dunne-kava-unaffected-psychoactive-substances-bill|title=Dunne: Kava unaffected by Psychoactive Substances Bill|website=The Beehive|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2015-gs1906|title=Standard 2.6.3 – Kava – Food Standards (Proposal P1025 – Code Revision) Variation—Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Amendment No. 154 - 2015-gs1906 - New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the U.S. [[regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] issued a Consumer Advisory: &quot;Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury.&quot; No legal action was taken and this advisory has since been archived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm085482.htm|title=Consumer Advisory: Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603082809/https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm085482.htm|archive-date=2009-06-03|access-date=2020-06-28|url-status=dead|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vanuatu===
The Pacific island-state of Vanuatu has passed legislation to regulate the quality of its kava exports. Vanuatu prohibits the export or consumption of non-noble kava varieties or the parts of the plant that are unsuitable for consumption (such as leaves and stems).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faolex.fao.org/docs/html/van38473.htm|title=Vanuatu - Legislation - Kava Act 2002|website=faolex.fao.org|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidereal time''' {{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|d|ɪər|i|əl}} is a [[timekeeper|timekeeping]] system that [[astronomer]]s use to locate [[astronomical object|celestial objects]]. Using sidereal time, it is possible to easily point a [[telescope]] to the proper [[celestial coordinate system|coordinates]] in the [[night sky]]. Briefly, sidereal time is a &quot;time scale that is based on [[Earth's rotation|Earth's rate of rotation]] measured relative to the [[fixed stars]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIST|n.d.}} A more precise definition is given later in the lead.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed from the same [[location]], a star seen at one position in the sky will be seen at the same position on another night at the same sidereal time. This is similar to how the time kept by a [[sundial]] can be used to find the location of the [[Sun]]. Just as the Sun and [[Moon]] appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to the rotation of Earth, so do the stars. Both [[solar time]] and sidereal time make use of the regularity of Earth's rotation about its polar axis, solar time following the Sun while sidereal time roughly follows the stars.

More exactly, sidereal time is the angle, measured along the [[celestial equator]], from the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] to the [[great circle]] that passes through the [[March equinox]] and both [[celestial pole]]s, and is usually expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds.{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|loc= &quot;Glossary&quot; s.v. hour angle, hour circle, sidereal time}} Common time on a typical clock measures a slightly longer cycle, accounting not only for Earth's axial rotation but also for Earth's orbit around the Sun.

{{anchor|Sidereal day}}A '''sidereal day''' is approximately 86164.0905 [[second]]s (23 h 56 min 4.0905&amp;nbsp;s or 23.9344696 h). 

''([[Seconds]] here follow the [[SI]] definition and are not to be confused with [[ephemeris second]].)''

The March equinox itself [[axial precession|precesses]] slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day (&quot;sidereal&quot; is derived from the Latin ''sidus'' meaning &quot;star&quot;) is 0.0084&amp;nbsp;seconds shorter than the [[stellar day]], Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars.{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|p=78}}
The slightly longer &quot;true&quot; sidereal period is measured as the [[Earth Rotation Angle]] (ERA), formerly the stellar angle.{{Sfn|IERS|2013}} An increase of 360° in the ERA is a full rotation of the Earth.

Because Earth orbits the Sun once a year, the sidereal time at any given place and time will gain about four minutes against local [[civil time]], every 24 hours, until, after a year has passed, one additional sidereal &quot;day&quot; has elapsed compared to the number of solar days that have gone by.

==Comparison to solar time==
[[File:Sidereal time.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Sidereal time vs solar time. '''Above left''': a distant star (the small orange star) and the Sun are at [[culmination]], on the local meridian '''m'''. ''Centre'': only the distant star is at culmination (a mean [[sidereal day]]). ''Right'': a few minutes later the Sun is on the local meridian again. A [[solar day]] is complete.]]

[[Solar time]] is measured by the apparent [[diurnal motion]] of the Sun, and local noon in apparent solar time is the moment when the Sun is exactly due south or north (depending on the observer's latitude and the season). A mean solar day (what we normally measure as a &quot;day&quot;) is the average time between local solar noons (&quot;average&quot; since this varies slightly over the year).

Earth makes one rotation around its axis in a sidereal day; during that time it moves a short distance (about 1°) along its orbit around the Sun. So after a sidereal day has passed, Earth still needs to rotate slightly more before the Sun reaches local noon according to solar time. A mean solar day is, therefore, nearly 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day.

The stars are so far away that Earth's movement along its orbit makes nearly no difference to their apparent direction (see, however, [[parallax]]), and so they return to their highest point in a sidereal day.

Another way to see this difference is to notice that, relative to the stars, the Sun appears to move around Earth once per year. Therefore, there is one fewer [[solar day]] per year than there are sidereal days. This makes a sidereal day approximately {{sfrac|365.24|366.24}} times the length of the 24-hour solar day, giving approximately 23&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;56&amp;nbsp;min&amp;nbsp;4.1&amp;nbsp;s (86,164.1&amp;nbsp;s).

==Precession effects==

Earth's rotation is not a simple rotation around an axis that would always remain parallel to itself. Earth's rotational axis itself rotates about a second axis, [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to Earth's orbit, taking about 25,800&amp;nbsp;years to perform a complete rotation. This phenomenon is called the [[Axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]]. Because of this precession, the stars appear to move around Earth in a manner more complicated than a simple constant rotation.

For this reason, to simplify the description of Earth's orientation in astronomy and [[geodesy]], it was conventional to chart the positions of the stars in the sky according to [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], which are based on a frame that follows Earth's precession, and to keep track of Earth's rotation, through sidereal time, relative to this frame as well.{{efn|The conventional reference frame, for purposes of star catalogues, was replaced in 1998 with the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]], which is fixed with respect to extra-galactic radio sources. Because of the great distances, these sources have no appreciable [[proper motion]].{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|page=105}}}} In this reference frame, Earth's rotation is close to constant, but the stars appear to rotate slowly with a period of about 25,800 years. It is also in this reference frame that the [[tropical year]], the year related to Earth's seasons, represents one orbit of Earth around the Sun. The precise definition of a sidereal day is the time taken for one rotation of Earth in this precessing reference frame.

==Modern definitions==
In the past, time was measured by observing stars with instruments such as [[Zenith telescope|photographic zenith tube]]s and [[André-Louis Danjon|Danjon]] astrolabes, and the passage of stars across defined lines would be timed with the observatory clock. Then, using the [[right ascension]] of the stars from a star catalog, the time when the star should have passed through the meridian of the observatory was computed, and a correction to the time kept by the observatory clock was computed. Sidereal time was defined such that the March equinox would [[Astronomical transit|transit]] the meridian of the observatory at 0 hours local sidereal time.{{Sfn|ES1|1961|loc=Ch 3, &quot;Systems of Time Measurement&quot;}}

Beginning in the 1970s the [[radio astronomy]] methods [[very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI) and [[Pulsar timing array|pulsar timing]] overtook optical instruments for the most precise [[astrometry]]. This led to the determination of [[UT1]] (mean solar time at 0° longitude) using VLBI, a new measure of the Earth Rotation Angle, and new definitions of sidereal time. These changes were put into practice on 1 January 2003.{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|pages= 78–81, 112}}

===Earth Rotation Angle===

The Earth Rotation Angle (ERA) measures the rotation of the Earth from an origin on the celestial equator, the Celestial Intermediate Origin, that has no instantaneous motion along the equator; it was originally referred to as the non-rotating origin. ERA replaces Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time (GAST). The origin on the celestial equator for GAST, called the true [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], does move, due to the movement of the equator and the ecliptic. The lack of motion of the origin of ERA is considered a significant advantage.{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|page=6}}

ERA, measured in [[radian]]s, is related to [[Universal time|UT1]] by the expression{{sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|page=78}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\theta(t_U)=2\pi(0.779\,057\,273\,2640+1.002\,737\,811\,911\,354\,48t_U)&lt;/math&gt;}}
where ''t&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Julian day|Julian UT1 date]] &amp;minus; 2451545.0.

The ERA may be converted to other units; for example, the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2017'' tabulated it in degrees, minutes, and seconds.{{Sfn|Astronomical Almanac|2016|pages=B21–B24}}

As an example, the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2017'' gave the ERA at 0 h 1 January 2017 UT1 as 100° 37′ 12.4365″.{{Sfn|Astronomical Almanac|2016|page=B21}}

===Sidereal time===
[[File:20180505 123207-sidereal-clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo of the face of the other surviving Sidereal Angle clock in the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, made by [[Thomas Tompion]]. The dial has been ornately inscribed with the name [[John Flamsteed|''J Flamsteed'']], who was the [[Astronomer Royal]], and the date 1691.]]
Although ERA is intended to replace sidereal time, there is a need to maintain definitions for sidereal time during the transition, and when working with older data and documents.

Similarly to mean solar time, every location on Earth has its own local sidereal time (LST), depending on the longitude of the point. Since it is not feasible to publish tables for every longitude, astronomical tables make use of Greenwich sidereal time (GST), which is sidereal time on the [[IERS Reference Meridian]], less precisely called the Greenwich, or [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime meridian]]. There are two varieties, mean sidereal time if the mean equator and equinox of date are used, or apparent sidereal time if the apparent equator and equinox of date are used. The former ignores the effect of [[astronomical nutation]] while the latter includes it. When the choice of location is combined with the choice of including astronomical nutation or not, the acronyms GMST, LMST, GAST, and LAST result.

The following relationships hold:{{Sfn|Urban|Seidelmann|2013|page=80}}
{{block indent|1=local mean sidereal time = GMST + east longitude}}
{{block indent|1=local apparent sidereal time = GAST + east longitude}}

The new definitions of Greenwich mean and apparent sidereal time (since 2003, see above) are:
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GMST}(t_U,t)=\theta(t_U)-E_\mathrm{PREC}(t)&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GAST}(t_U,t)=\theta(t_U)-E_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;}}

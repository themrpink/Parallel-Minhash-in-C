Eventually the ''Airplane!'' script found its way to Paramount through [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner had learned of the script via Susan Baerwald, another scriptwriter with [[United Artists]], who had passed on the script that she thought was funny. Eisner had [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] track down and meet with ZAZ to discuss details.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt; Around the same time, ZAZ had also been contacted by [[Avco Embassy Pictures]] who had also expressed interest in producing the film, but ZAZ decided to go with Paramount.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt;

Paramount insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black-and-white as ZAZ wanted, and to be set aboard a jet airliner rather than propeller plane to better identify with modern filmgoers. In exchange, Paramount agreed with ZAZ's decision to cast serious actors for the film rather than comedy actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; Principal photography began on June 20 and wrapped on August 31, 1979, with the bulk of filming having been done in August. Jerry Zucker stood beside the camera during shooting, while David Zucker and Jim Abrahams would be watching the video feed to see how the film would look; they would confer after each take.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClub&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/robert-hays,62766/ |title=Random Roles: Robert Hays|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|work=avclub.com|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
David Zucker explained that &quot;the trick was to cast actors like [[Robert Stack]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]. These were people who, up to that time, had never done comedy. We thought they were much funnier than the comedians of that time were&quot;.&lt;ref name=directors/&gt;

David Zucker felt Stack was the most important actor to be cast, since he was the &quot;linchpin&quot; of the film's plot.&lt;ref name=directors/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt; Stack initially played his role in a way that was different from what the directors had in mind. They showed him a tape of impressionist [[John Byner]] impersonating Robert Stack. According to the producers, Stack was &quot;doing an impression of John Byner doing an impression of Stack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot;/&gt; Stack was not initially interested in the part, but ZAZ persuaded him. Bridges' children advised him to take the part.&lt;ref name=directors/&gt; Graves rejected the script at first, considering it tasteless. During filming, ZAZ had explained to Graves that his lines spoken to a young boy, like &quot;Have you ever seen a grown man naked?&quot;, would &quot;be explained later in a part that you aren't in&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; On the DVD commentary, Abrahams said: &quot;I don't understand. What did he think was tasteless about pedophilia?&quot;&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt;

Initially for Dr. Rumack, ZAZ had suggested [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Christopher Lee]], and [[Jack Webb]], all who had turned it down, before they came to the idea of Nielsen.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; Nielsen, in contrast, was &quot;just a fish in water&quot; with his role, according to Jerry Zucker.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt; Nielsen had done leading roles in his career to this point but had been desiring to get into more comedies and had been looking for some film to help in this direction. He was considered &quot;closet comedian&quot; on set, pranking his fellow actors between shoots, but immediately took to his serious, deadpan role as Rumack for filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; During filming, Leslie Nielsen used a [[whoopee cushion]] to keep the cast off-balance. Hays said that Nielsen &quot;played that thing like a maestro&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/movies/27airplane.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Surely It's 30 (Don't Call Me Shirley!)|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Ted Striker was written for [[David Letterman]], who had previously auditioned the role of the news anchor in ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]''. Letterman screen tested for the role in 1979, but ultimately was not selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Jon Davison]], [[Jim Abrahams]], [[Jerry Zucker]], [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]]|title=Airplane!

Instead, ZAZ opted for [[Robert Hays]], who was a co-star of ''[[Angie (TV series)|Angie]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; Elaine's part was auditioned for by [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Shelley Long]] but eventually went to [[Julie Hagerty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; The directors advised the pair to play their roles straight.&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Hays and Hagerty developed an on-screen chemistry that worked in the film's favor; they spent time to perfect the bar dance routine set to &quot;[[Stayin' Alive]]&quot;, among other scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt;

For the &quot;red zone/white zone&quot; send-up of curbside terminal announcements in which public address announcers &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Vernon&quot; argue over the red and white zones, ZAZ went through the usual process of auditioning professional voice actors but failed to find ones who could provide the desired verisimilitude. Instead, the filmmakers ultimately sought out and hired the real-life married couple who had recorded the announcement tapes which were then being used at Los Angeles International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.nerdist.com/pepisode/nerdist-podcast-airplane-the-movie/|title=Nerdist Podcast: Airplane!

===Music===
The film's score was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]], who had previously done films like ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''. ZAZ had instructed Bernstein that they did not want an epic score like his past works but &quot;a B-Movie level score, overdone and corny&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph 40th&quot;/&gt; ZAZ said that Bernstein completely understood what they were trying to do and had laughed throughout a previous cut of the film, and wrote a &quot;fantastic score&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub oral&quot;/&gt;

In 1980, an LP soundtrack for the film was released by Regency Records and included dialog and songs from the film. It was also narrated by [[Shadoe Stevens]], and only featured one score track, the &quot;Love Theme from ''Airplane''&quot; composed by Bernstein. The soundtrack was altered for the European 'Flying High' release, with several of the featured tracks swapped for pieces original to the LP.

On April 2009, La-La Land Records announced that it would release the first official score album for ''Airplane!'', containing Bernstein's complete score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpecialAnnouncement.html |title=La-La Land Records Announces a Special Mayday Alert! |website=Lalalandrecords.com |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819155257/http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpecialAnnouncement.html |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was released digitally on February 19, 2013, by Paramount Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airplane!

==Release==
Before its release, the directors had been apprehensive, owing to a mediocre response at one of the pre-screenings, but the film earned its entire budget of about $3.5 million in its first five days of wide release.

The film opened on June 27, 1980 in seven theatres in Toronto, grossing $83,058 in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=op&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 2, 1980|page=3|title='Empire' Major Exception To B.O.

==Reception==
{{quote box|align=right|quote=&quot;''Airplane!'' emerged in 1980 as a sharply perceptive parody of the big-budget disaster films that dominated Hollywood during the 1970s [and] introduced a much-needed deflating assessment of the tendency of theatrical film producers to push successful formulaic movie conventions beyond the point of logic&quot;.|width=30em|source=[[Library of Congress]]}}

In the same year, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' voted it the second-greatest comedy film of all time. It also came second in the British 50 Greatest Comedy Films poll on [[Channel 4]], beaten by ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' voted the film the &quot;funniest movie on video&quot; in their list of the 100 funniest movies on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brod, Doug|title=The Kings of Comedy|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 16, 1992|url=https://www.ew.com/article/1992/10/16/kings-comedy|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several actors were cast to spoof their established images: prior to their roles in ''Airplane!'', Nielsen, Stack, and Bridges were known for portraying adventurous, no-nonsense tough-guy characters. Stack's role as the captain who loses his nerve in one of the earliest airline &quot;disaster&quot; films, ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' (1954), is spoofed in ''Airplane!'', as is Lloyd Bridges' 1970–1971 television role as airport manager Jim Conrad in ''[[San Francisco International Airport (TV series)|San Francisco International Airport]]''. Peter Graves was in the made-for-television film ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'', in which an [[Supersonic transport|SST]] was unable to land owing to an emergency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Synposis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/478220/SST-Death-Flight/|title=Synopsis: SST Death Flight|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen saw a major boost to his career after ''Airplane!''{{'}}s release. The film marked a significant change in his film persona towards a new specialty in [[deadpan]] comedy, notably in the three ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' films based on the six-episode television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', in which he also starred and which was created and produced by the Abrahams–Zucker–Zucker team behind ''Airplane''. This also led to his casting, many years later, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]''. Brooks had wanted to make that film for a long time, but put it off because, as he said: &quot;I just could not find the right Dracula&quot;. Brooks said he had never seen ''Airplane!'' until years after its release. When he did, he knew Nielsen would be right for the part. When it was suggested that his role in ''Airplane!'' was [[Typecasting|against type]], Nielsen protested that he had &quot;always been cast against type before&quot;, and that comedy was what he always really wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Dalton |first2=Bob |last2=Thomas |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title='Airplane!', 'Forbidden Planet' actor Nielsen dies |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208205723/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[Peter Farrelly]] said of the film: &quot;I was in Rhode Island the first time I saw ''Airplane!'' Seeing it for the first time was like going to a great rock concert, like seeing [[Led Zeppelin]] or the [[Talking Heads]]. We didn't realize until later that what we'd seen was a very specific kind of comedy that we now call the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker school&quot;.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; Farrelly, along with his writing partner Bennett Yellin, sent a comedy script to David Zucker, who in return gave them their first Hollywood writing job. Farrelly said: &quot;I'll tell you right now, if the Zuckers didn't exist, there would be no [[Farrelly brothers]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;

Thirty years later, the documentary ''[[Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story]]'' opened with a scene from the film.&lt;ref name=latimes1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/19/entertainment/la-et-jews-baseball-20101119|author=Kenneth Turan|title=Movie review: 'Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jewsandbaseball1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsandbaseball.com/film1.html|title=Film|publisher=Jewsandbaseball.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[MythBusters]]'' TV show episode &quot;Airplane Hour&quot; reenacted the climax of the film to see if an inexperienced pilot could land a plane with only a call from Air Traffic Control. The Mythbusters had to use a simulation to test the myth but concluded that the scene was plausible. They did, however, mention that most planes today have an autopilot to land the plane safely.

In the 2012 film ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', the main character, John Bennett, tells the story of how he met Lori Collins. The flashback is a close recreation of the scene where Ted Striker met Elaine Dickinson in the disco.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ryan/ted-25-questions_b_1619250.html |title='Ted': Will 'Ted' Make You Feel Guilty For Laughing?|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] began using a new on-board safety film with many 1980s references, featuring an ending with a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] of [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] reprising his role as co-pilot Roger Murdock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/delta-airlines-promotes-safety-1980s-themed-video-article-1.1595323|title=SEE IT: Delta Airlines promotes safety in 1980s-themed video |author=Joel Landau|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Travel [[Wisconsin]] began airing an ad with Robert Hays and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reprising their roles from the film. Kareem makes the comment &quot;Why did I ever leave this place?&quot; referring to his time playing for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kareem|url = http://www.nba.com/bucks/features/boeder-140303|website = THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS|access-date = January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/MB_071121.html|title = Kareem: The return of the King|date = November 21, 2007|access-date = January 29, 2016|website = The Official Site of the Milwaukee Bucks|publisher = National Basketball Association|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202183302/http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/MB_071121.html|archive-date = February 2, 2017|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jsonline.com/sports/lew-alcindor-jersey-sells-for-95600-gh8t6pv-192796261.html|title = Lew Alcindor jersey sells for $95,600|date = Feb 24, 2013|access-date = Jan 29, 2016|website = Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|publisher = Journal Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hays also reprises his role as an airline pilot in ''[[Sharknado 2: The Second One]]''.

The first episode of the eighth season of the [[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]] re-enacts the scenes.

==Sequel==
''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'', first released on December 10, 1982, attempted to tackle the [[science fiction film]] genre, though there was still emphasis on the general theme of disaster films. Although most of the cast reunited for the sequel, the writers and directors of ''Airplane!'' chose not to be involved. In the DVD commentary for ''Airplane!'' David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker claim to have never seen nor to have any desire to see ''Airplane II''.

{{United States Senate}}

The '''Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader''' are two [[United States Senate|United States senators]] and members of the [[party leadership of the United States Senate]]. They serve as the chief Senate spokespersons for their respective [[Political party|political parties]] holding the majority and the minority in the [[United States Senate]].  They also manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate. They are each elected as Majority Leader and Minority Leader by the Senators of their party [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|caucuses]]: the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Senate Democratic Caucus]] and the [[Republican Conference of the United States Senate|Senate Republican Conference]].

By Senate rule, the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer]] gives the Majority Leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the Senate. The Majority Leader serves as the chief representative of his or her party in the Senate. They also serve as the chief representative of their party in the entire [[United States Congress|Congress]] if the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and thus the office of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], is controlled by the opposition party.

The Assistant Majority and Assistant Minority Leaders of the United States Senate (commonly called Senate Majority and Minority [[Whip (politics)|Whips]]) are the second-ranking members of each party's leadership. The main function of the Majority and Minority Whips is to gather votes of their respective parties on major issues. Because they are the second ranking members of the Senate leadership, if there is no [[floor leader]] present, the whip may become acting floor leader. Before 1969, their official titles were Majority Whip and Minority Whip.

==Current floor leaders==
The Senate is [[Current members of the United States Senate|currently composed]] of 53 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], 45 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and 2 [[independent politician|independents]], both of whom [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|caucus with the Democrats]].

The current leaders are Senators [[Mitch McConnell]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) from [[List of United States senators from Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Chuck Schumer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) from [[List of United States senators from New York|New York]]. The current Assistant Leaders, or Whips, are Senators [[John Thune]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) from [[List of United States senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]] and [[Dick Durbin]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]) from [[List of United States senators from Illinois|Illinois]].

==History==
Senate Democrats began the practice of electing their floor leaders in 1920 while they were in the minority. [[John W. Kern]] was a Democratic Senator from Indiana. While the title was not official, the Senate website identifies Kern as the first Senate party leader, serving in that capacity from 1913 through 1917 (and in turn, the first Senate Democratic Leader), while serving concurrently as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Majority and Minority Leaders |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Majority_Minority_Leaders.htm |website=senate.gov |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the Republicans (who were in the majority at the time) also adopted this language when [[Charles Curtis]] became the first (official) Majority Leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senate Leader |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/People_Leaders_Curtis.htm |website=senate.gov |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=14 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his immediate predecessor [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] is considered the first (unofficial) Senate Majority Leader.

The United States Constitution designates the [[Vice President of the United States]] as [[Vice President of the United States#Roles of the vice president|President of the United States Senate]]. The Constitution also calls for a [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]], to serve as Senate leader when the President of the Senate (the Vice President) is absent. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President ''pro tempore''—customarily the most senior (longest-serving) Senator in the majority party—actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior Senators of the majority party.  Since the Vice President may be of a different party from the majority and is not a Senate member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role.  For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate.  This is in contrast to the House of Representatives, where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on legislative bills.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==List of party leaders==
The Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920. The Republican Party first formally designated a leader in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Majority_Minority_Leaders.htm |accessdate=June 27, 2019 |title=Majority and Minority Leaders |publisher=United States Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the image below the meanings of the expressions ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three &quot;truth values&quot;—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as &quot;not hot&quot;; i.e. this temperature has zero membership in the fuzzy set &quot;hot&quot;. The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as &quot;slightly warm&quot; and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) &quot;fairly cold&quot;. Therefore, this temperature has 0.2 membership in the fuzzy set &quot;warm&quot; and 0.8 membership in the fuzzy set &quot;cold&quot;. The degree of membership assigned for each fuzzy set is the result of fuzzification.

[[Fuzzy set]]s are often defined as triangle or trapezoid-shaped curves, as each value will have a slope where the value is increasing, a peak where the value is equal to 1 (which can have a length of 0 or greater) and a slope where the value is decreasing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} They can also be defined using a [[sigmoid function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wierman|first1=Mark J.|title=An Introduction to the Mathematics of Uncertainty: including Set Theory, Logic, Probability, Fuzzy Sets, Rough Sets, and Evidence Theory|url=https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|publisher=Creighton University|access-date=16 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730155249/https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|archive-date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common case is the [[Logistic function|standard logistic function]] defined as

: &lt;math&gt; S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} &lt;/math&gt;

which has the following symmetry property

: &lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; S(x) + S(-x) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

From this it follows that

&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; (S(x) + S(-x)) \cdot (S(y) + S(-y)) \cdot (S(z) + S(-z)) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Fuzzy logic operators===

Fuzzy logic works with membership values in a way that mimics [[Boolean logic]]. To this end, replacements for basic [[operator (computer programming)|operator]]s AND, OR, NOT must be available. There are several ways to this. A common replacement is called the ''Zadeh operators'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Boolean
! Fuzzy
|-
| AND(x,y)
| MIN(x,y)
|-
| OR(x,y)
| MAX(x,y)
|-
| NOT(x)
| 1 – x
|-
|}

For TRUE/1 and FALSE/0, the fuzzy expressions produce the same result as the Boolean expressions.

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called ''hedges'' that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as ''very'', or ''somewhat'', which modify the meaning of a set using a [[mathematical formula]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

However, an arbitrary choice table does not always define a fuzzy logic function. In the paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal | last1 = Zaitsev | first1 = D.A. | author2 = Sarbei, V.G. | author3 = Sleptsov, A.I. | year = 1998 | title = Synthesis of continuous-valued logic functions defined in tabular form | journal = [[Cybernetics and Systems Analysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–195 | doi = 10.1007/BF02742068 | s2cid = 120220846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a criterion has been formulated to recognize whether a given choice table defines a fuzzy logic function and a simple algorithm of fuzzy logic function synthesis has been proposed based on introduced concepts of constituents of minimum and maximum. A fuzzy logic function represents a disjunction of constituents of minimum, where a constituent of minimum is a conjunction of variables of the current area greater than or equal to the function value in this area (to the right of the function value in the inequality, including the function value).

Another set of AND/OR operators is based on multiplication, where

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
x AND y = x*y
NOT x = 1 - x

Hence, 
x OR y = NOT( AND( NOT(x), NOT(y) ) )
x OR y = NOT( AND(1-x, 1-y) )
x OR y = NOT( (1-x)*(1-y) )
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Given any two of AND/OR/NOT, it is possible to derive the third. The generalization of AND is known as a [[t-norm]].

=== IF-THEN rules ===
{{Main|Fuzzy rule}}
IF-THEN rules  map input or computed truth values to desired output truth values. Example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
IF temperature IS very cold THEN fan_speed is stopped
IF temperature IS cold THEN fan_speed is slow
IF temperature IS warm THEN fan_speed is moderate
IF temperature IS hot THEN fan_speed is high
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Given a certain temperature, the fuzzy variable ''hot'' has a certain truth value, which is copied to the ''high'' variable.

Should an output variable occur in several THEN parts, then the values from the respective IF parts are combined using the OR operator.

===Defuzzification===
{{Main|Defuzzification}}
The goal is to get a continuous variable from fuzzy truth values.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This would be easy if the output truth values were exactly those obtained from fuzzification of a given number.
Since, however, all output truth values are computed independently, in most cases they do not represent such a set of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
One has then to decide for a number that matches best the &quot;intention&quot; encoded in the truth value.
For example, for several truth values of fan_speed, an actual speed must be found that best fits the computed truth values of the variables 'slow', 'moderate' and so on. {{Citation needed | date = September 2017 }}

There is no single algorithm for this purpose.

A common algorithm is
# For each truth value, cut the membership function at this value
# Combine the resulting curves using the OR operator
# Find the center-of-weight of the area under the curve
# The x position of this center is then the final output.

==Forming a consensus of inputs and fuzzy rules==

Since the fuzzy system output is a consensus of all of the inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate the degree to which a rule affects the output values. These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule. These rule weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.

==Early applications==

Many of the early successful applications of fuzzy logic were implemented in Japan. The first notable application was on the subway train in [[Sendai]], in which fuzzy logic was able to improve the economy, comfort, and precision of the ride{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. It has also been used in [[handwriting recognition|recognition of hand-written symbols]] in Sony pocket computers, flight aid for helicopters, controlling of subway systems in order to improve driving comfort, precision of halting, and power economy, improved fuel consumption for automobiles, single-button control for washing machines, automatic motor control for vacuum cleaners with recognition of surface condition and degree of soiling, and prediction systems for early recognition of earthquakes through the Institute of Seismology Bureau of Meteorology, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bansod |first1=Nitin A |last2=Kulkarni |first2=Marshall |last3=Patil |first3=S.H. |editor1-last=Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering |title=Soft Computing |date=2005 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-7764-632-0 |pages=73 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkajJC9iGxMC&amp;pg=PA73 |access-date=9 November 2018 |chapter=Soft Computing- A Fuzzy Logic Approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current applications==

===In medical decision making===

Fuzzy logic is an important concept when it comes to medical decision making.  Since medical and healthcare data can be subjective or fuzzy, applications in this domain have a great potential to benefit a lot by using fuzzy logic based approaches.  One of the common application areas that use fuzzy logic is [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yanase|first1=Juri|last2=Triantaphyllou|first2=Evangelos|date=2019|title=A Systematic Survey of Computer-Aided Diagnosis in Medicine: Past and Present Developments|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=138|pages=112821|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112821}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAD is a computerized set of inter-related tools which can be used to aid physicians in their diagnostic decision-making. For example, when a physician finds a lesion which is abnormal but still at a very early stage of development he/she may use a CAD approach to characterize the lesion and diagnose its nature. Fuzzy logic can be highly appropriate to describe key characteristics of this lesion. Fuzzy logic can be used in many different aspects within the CAD framework. Such aspects include in medical image analysis, biomedical signal analysis, [[image segmentation|segmentation of images]] or signals, and [[feature extraction]] / selection of images or signals as described, for instance, in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin KP, Chang HF, Chen TL, Lu YM, and Wang CH | title = Intuitionistic fuzzy C-regression by using least squares support vector regression. | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | date = 2016 | volume = 64 |pages=296–304| doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deng H, Deng W, Sun X, Ye C, and Zhou X| title = Adaptive intuitionistic fuzzy enhancement of brain tumor MR images | journal = Scientific Reports | date = 2016 | volume=6 | pages=35760 | doi=10.1038/srep35760 | pmid = 27786240 | pmc = 5082372 | doi-access=free| bibcode = 2016NatSR...635760D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlachos IK, Sergiadis GD| title = Intuitionistic fuzzy information–applications to pattern recognition. | journal = Pattern Recognition Letters | date = 2007 | volume= 28 | issue = 2 | pages= 197–206| doi = 10.1016/j.patrec.2006.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gonzalez-Hidalgo|first1=Manuel|last2=Munar|first2=Marc|last3=Bibiloni|first3=Pedro|last4=Moya-Alcover|first4=Gabriel|last5=Craus-Miguel|first5=Andrea|last6=Segura-Sampedro|first6=Juan Jose|date=October 2019|title=Detection of infected wounds in abdominal surgery images using fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets|journal=2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)|location=Barcelona, Spain|publisher=IEEE|pages=99–106|doi=10.1109/WiMOB.2019.8923289|isbn=978-1-7281-3316-4|s2cid=208880793}}&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Das S, Guha D, and Dutta B| title = Medical diagnosis with the aid of using fuzzy logic and intuitionistic fuzzy logic. | journal = Applied Intelligence | date = 2016 | volume= 45 | issue = 3 | pages= 850–867| doi = 10.1007/s10489-016-0792-0 | s2cid = 14590409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest question in this application area is how much useful information can be derived when using fuzzy logic. A major challenge is how to derive the required fuzzy data.  This is even more challenging when one has to elicit such data from humans (usually, patients).  As it said &quot;The envelope of what can be achieved and what cannot be achieved in medical diagnosis, ironically, is itself a fuzzy one&quot; [Seven Challenges, 2019].  How to elicit fuzzy data, and how to validate the accuracy of the data is still an ongoing effort strongly related to the application of fuzzy logic. The problem of assessing the quality of fuzzy data is a difficult one.  This is why fuzzy logic is a highly promising possibility within the CAD application area but still requires more research to achieve its full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yanase|first1=Juri|last2=Triantaphyllou|first2=Evangelos|date=2019|title=The Seven Key Challenges for the Future of Computer-Aided Diagnosis in Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=129|pages=413–422|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.06.017|pmid=31445285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concepts of using fuzzy logic in CAD is exciting, there are still several challenges that fuzzy approaches face within the CAD framework.

== Logical analysis ==
In [[mathematical logic]], there are several [[formal system]]s of &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;, most of which are in the family of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]].

=== Propositional fuzzy logics ===
The most important propositional fuzzy logics are:
* [[MTL (logic)|Monoidal t-norm-based propositional fuzzy logic]] MTL is an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of logic where [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is defined by a left continuous [[t-norm]] and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]s correspond to MTL-algebras that are pre-linear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.
* [[BL (logic)|Basic propositional fuzzy logic]] BL is an extension of MTL logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous t-norm, and implication is also defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras.
* [[Lukasiewicz fuzzy logic|Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]] is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras.
* Gödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is [[Gödel]] t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras.
* Product fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is product t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras.
* Fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka's logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ is evaluated also syntax. This means that each formula has an evaluation. Axiomatization of EVŁ stems from Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic. A generalization of classical Gödel completeness theorem is provable in EVŁ{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}.

=== Predicate fuzzy logics ===
These extend the above-mentioned fuzzy logics by adding [[universal quantifier|universal]] and [[existential quantifier]]s in a manner similar to the way that [[predicate logic]] is created from [[propositional logic]]. The semantics of the universal (resp. existential) quantifier in [[t-norm fuzzy logics]] is the [[infimum]] (resp. [[supremum]]) of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula.

===Decidability issues for fuzzy logic===
The notions of a &quot;decidable subset&quot; and &quot;[[recursively enumerable]] subset&quot; are basic ones for [[classical mathematics]] and [[classical logic]]. Thus the question of a suitable extension of them to [[fuzzy set theory]] is a crucial one. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of ''fuzzy [[Turing machine]]'', ''Markov normal fuzzy algorithm'' and ''fuzzy program'' (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerla|first=G.|year=2016|title=Comments on some theories of fuzzy computation|journal= International Journal of General Systems|volume=45|issue=4|pages=372–392|doi=10.1080/03081079.2015.1076403|bibcode=2016IJGS...45..372G|s2cid=22577357}}&lt;/ref&gt; one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not  adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine.  Then, they proposed the following definitions. Denote by ''Ü''  the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset ''s'' : ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[0,1] of a set ''S'' is recursively enumerable if a recursive map ''h'' : ''S''×''N'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''Ü'' exists such that, for every ''x'' in ''S'', the function ''h''(''x'',''n'') is increasing with respect to ''n'' and ''s''(''x'') = lim ''h''(''x'',''n'').
We say that ''s'' is ''decidable'' if both ''s'' and its complement –''s'' are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).
The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).

Any &quot;axiomatizable&quot; fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the [[fuzzy set]] of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.

It is an open question to give supports for a &quot;Church thesis&quot; for [[fuzzy mathematics]], the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. In order to solve this, an extension of the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy [[Turing machine]] are necessary. Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of [[Gödel]]'s theorems to fuzzy logic.

==Fuzzy databases==
Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy [[relational database]]s. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in [[Maria Zemankova]]'s dissertation (1983). Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al.

Fuzzy querying languages have been defined, such as the [[SQLf]] by P. Bosc et al. and the [[FSQL]] by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels etc.

==Comparison to probability==
Fuzzy logic and probability address different forms of uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can represent degrees of certain kinds of subjective belief, [[fuzzy set theory]] uses the concept of fuzzy set membership, i.e., how much an observation is within a vaguely defined set, and probability theory uses the concept of [[subjective probability]], i.e., frequency of occurrence or likelihood of some event or condition {{clarify|date=April 2019}}. The concept of fuzzy sets was developed in the mid-twentieth century at Berkeley &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |title=Lofti Zadeh Berkeley |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080227/https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |archive-date=2017-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a response to the lacking of probability theory for jointly modelling uncertainty and [[vagueness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Fuzzy Sets |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=2031 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2031 |year=2006 |last1=Mares |first1=Milan |bibcode=2006SchpJ...1.2031M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Kosko]] claims in Fuzziness vs. Probability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kosko |first1=Bart |author-link1=Bart Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |url=http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Fuzziness_Vs_Probability.pdf |publisher=University of South California |access-date=9 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that probability theory is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as questions of degrees of belief in mutually-exclusive set membership in probability theory can be represented as certain cases of non-mutually-exclusive graded membership in fuzzy theory. In that context, he also derives [[Bayes' theorem]] from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy probability and also generalized it to [[possibility theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novák | first1 = V | year = 2005 | title = Are fuzzy sets a reasonable tool for modeling vague phenomena? | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 156 | issue = 3| pages = 341–348 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2005.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, fuzzy logic is one of many different extensions to classical logic intended to deal with issues of uncertainty outside of the scope of classical logic, the inapplicability of probability theory in many domains, and the paradoxes of [[Dempster-Shafer theory]].

==Relation to ecorithms==
Computational theorist [[Leslie Valiant]] uses the term ''ecorithms'' to describe how many less exact systems and techniques like fuzzy logic (and &quot;less robust&quot; logic) can be applied to [[learning algorithms]]. Valiant essentially redefines machine learning as evolutionary. In general use, ecorithms are algorithms that learn from their more complex environments (hence ''eco-'') to generalize, approximate and simplify solution logic. Like fuzzy logic, they are methods used to overcome continuous variables or systems too complex to completely enumerate or understand discretely or exactly. &lt;!-- See in particular p.&amp;nbsp;58 of the reference comparing induction/invariance, robust, mathematical and other logical limits in computing, where techniques including fuzzy logic and natural data selection (à la &quot;computational Darwinism&quot;) can be used to short-cut computational complexity and limits in a &quot;practical&quot; way (such as the brake temperature example in this article). --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valiant, Leslie |title=Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World |date=2013 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0465032716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and [[feed forward (control)|feed forward]], basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.

== Compensatory fuzzy logic ==

Compensatory fuzzy logic (CFL) is a branch of fuzzy logic with modified rules for conjunction and disjunction. When the truth value of one component of a conjunction or disjunction is increased or decreased, the other component is decreased or increased to compensate. This increase or decrease in truth value may be offset by the increase or decrease in another component. An offset may be blocked when certain thresholds are met. Proponents{{who|date=July 2015}} claim that CFL allows for better computational semantic behaviors and mimic natural language.{{vague|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004060002/http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |archive-date=2015-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veri|first=Francesco|year=2017|title=Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Conditions in fsQCA: Problems and Solutions|journal= Sociological Methods &amp; Research|volume=49|issue=2|pages=312–355|doi=10.1177/0049124117729693|s2cid=125146607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensatory Fuzzy Logic consists of four continuous operators: conjunction (c); disjunction (d); fuzzy strict order (or); and negation (n). The conjunction is the geometric mean and its dual as conjunctive and disjunctive operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cejas |first1=Jesús |title=Compensatory Fuzzy Logic |journal=Revista de Ingeniería Industrial |date=2011 |issn=1815-5936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016 – IEEE Standard for Fuzzy Markup Language ==

The [[IEEE 1855]], the IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016, is about a specification language named [[Fuzzy markup language|Fuzzy Markup Language]] (FML)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acampora |first1=Giovanni |last2=Di Stefano |first2=Bruno N. |last3=Vitiello |first3=Autilia |title=IEEE 1855™: The First IEEE Standard Sponsored by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society [Society Briefs] |journal= IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=2016 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=4–6 |doi= 10.1109/MCI.2016.2602068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[IEEE Standards Association]]. FML allows modelling a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). The designers of fuzzy systems with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016 uses the [[W3C]] [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.

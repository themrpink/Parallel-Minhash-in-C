In the last months of World War II, about five million German civilians from the German provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] fled the advance of the Red Army from the east and became refugees in [[Mecklenburg]], [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]]. Since the spring of 1945 the Poles had been forcefully expelling the remaining German population in these provinces. When the Allies met in Potsdam on 17 July 1945 at the [[Potsdam Conference]], a chaotic refugee situation faced the occupying powers. The [[Potsdam Agreement]], signed on 2 August 1945, defined the Polish western border as that of 1937, (Article VIII) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/truman/psources/ps_potsdam.html Agreements of the Berlin (Potsdam) Conference] placing one fourth of Germany's territory under the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|Provisional Polish administration]]. Article XII ordered that the remaining German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary be transferred west in an &quot;orderly and humane&quot; manner.[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/truman/psources/ps_potsdam.html Agreements of the Berlin (Potsdam) Conference] (See [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)]].)

Although not approved by Allies at Potsdam, hundreds of thousands of [[ethnic German]]s living in Yugoslavia and Romania were deported to slave labour in the Soviet Union, to [[Allied Control Council|Allied-occupied Germany]], and subsequently to the [[German Democratic Republic]] ([[East Germany]]), Austria and the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]]). This entailed the largest [[population transfer]] in history. In all 15 million Germans were affected, and more than two million perished during the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsions of the German population]].{{sfn|Statistisches Bundesamt, Die|1958}}{{sfn|Forced Resettlement&quot;, &quot;Population,|2003}}{{sfn|Naimark|1995}}{{sfn|de Zayas|1977}}{{sfn|de Zayas|2006}} (See [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)]].) Between the end of War and the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, more than 563,700 refugees from East Germany traveled to West Germany for asylum from the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]].

During the same period, millions of former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated]] against their will into the USSR.{{sfn|Elliott|1973|pp=253–275}} On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.{{sfn|Repatriation Dark Side}} The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets regardless of their wishes. When the war ended in May 1945, British and United States civilian authorities ordered their military forces in Europe to deport to the Soviet Union millions of former residents of the USSR, including many persons who had left Russia and established different citizenship decades before. The forced repatriation operations took place from 1945 to 1947.{{sfn|Forced Repatriation to}}

At the end of World War II, there were more than 5 million &quot;displaced persons&quot; from the Soviet Union in [[Western Europe]]. About 3 million had been [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced laborers]] ([[Ostarbeiter]]s){{sfn|Final Compensation Pending}} in Germany and occupied territories.{{sfn|Forced Labor}}{{sfn|Nazi Ostarbeiter (Eastern}} The Soviet [[POWs]] and the [[Andrey Vlasov|Vlasov]] men were put under the jurisdiction of [[SMERSH]] (Death to Spies).

Poland and [[Soviet Ukraine]] conducted population exchanges following the imposition of a new Poland-Soviet border at the [[Curzon Line]] in 1944. About 2,100,000 [[Poles]] were expelled west of the new border (see [[Repatriation of Poles (1944–1946)|Repatriation of Poles]]), while about 450,000 [[Ukrainians]] were expelled to the east of the new border. The [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfer to Soviet Ukraine]] occurred from September 1944 to May 1946 (see [[repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union|Repatriation of Ukrainians]]). A further 200,000 Ukrainians left southeast Poland more or less voluntarily between 1944 and 1945.{{sfn|Forced migration}}

Due to the report of the U.S. Committee for Refugees (1995), 10 to 15 percent of 7,5 million Azerbaijani population were refugees or displaced people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/country,COI,UNHCR,,AZE,,3ae6a6490,0.html|title=Refworld – UNHCR CDR Background Paper on Refugees and Asylum Seekers from Azerbaijan|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them were 228,840 refugee people of Azerbaijan who fled from Armenia in 1988 as a result of deportation policy of Armenia against ethnic Azerbaijanis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/country-by-country/azerbaijan/AZE-CbC-IV-2011-019-ENG.pdf | title=ECRI REPORT ON AZERBAIJAN | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO) was founded on 20 April 1946, and took over the functions of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]], which was shut down in 1947. While the handover was originally planned to take place at the beginning of 1947, it did not occur until July 1947.{{sfn|United Nations Relief|1994}} The International Refugee Organization was a temporary organization of the [[United Nations]] (UN), which itself had been founded in 1945, with a mandate to largely finish the UNRRA's work of repatriating or resettling European refugees. It was dissolved in 1952 after resettling about one million refugees.{{sfn|International Refugee Organization|1994}} The definition of a refugee at this time was an individual with either a [[Nansen passport]] or a &quot;[[Certificate of identity]]&quot; issued by the International Refugee Organization.

The Constitution of the International Refugee Organization, adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 15 December 1946, specified the agency's field of operations. Controversially, this defined &quot;persons of German ethnic origin&quot; who had been expelled, or were to be expelled from their countries of birth into the postwar Germany, as individuals who would &quot;not be the concern of the Organization.&quot; This excluded from its purview a group that exceeded in number all the other European displaced persons put together. Also, because of disagreements between the Western allies and the Soviet Union, the IRO only worked in areas controlled by Western armies of occupation.

== Refugee studies ==
With the occurrence of major instances of diaspora and [[forced migration]], the study of their causes and implications has emerged as a legitimate interdisciplinary area of research, and began to rise by mid to late 20th century, after [[World War II]]. Although significant contributions had been made before, the latter half of the 20th century saw the establishment of institutions dedicated to the study of refugees, such as the Association for the Study of the World Refugee Problem, which was closely followed by the founding of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]. In particular, the 1981 volume of the ''International Migration Review'' defined refugee studies as &quot;a comprehensive, historical, interdisciplinary and comparative perspective which focuses on the consistencies and patterns in the refugee experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Barry N., and Silvano M. Tomasi. &quot;Foreword.&quot; ''The International Migration Review'', vol. 15, no. 1/2, 1981, pp. 5–7. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2545317.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its publishing, the field saw a rapid increase in academic interest and scholarly inquiry, which has continued to the present. Most notably in 1988, the ''[[Journal of Refugee Studies]]'' was established as the field's first major interdisciplinary journal.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard. &quot;Fifty years of refugee studies: From theory to policy.&quot; ''International Migration Review'' 35.1 (2001): 57-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of refugee studies as a distinct field of study has been criticized by scholars due to terminological difficulty. Since no universally accepted definition for the term &quot;refugee&quot; exists, the academic respectability of the policy-based definition, as outlined in the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], is disputed. Additionally, academics have critiqued the lack of a theoretical basis of refugee studies and dominance of policy-oriented research. In response, scholars have attempted to steer the field toward establishing a theoretical groundwork of refugee studies through &quot;situating studies of particular refugee (and other forced migrant) groups in the theories of cognate areas (and major disciplines), [providing] an opportunity to use the particular circumstances of refugee situations to illuminate these more general theories and thus participate in the development of social science, rather than leading refugee studies into an intellectual cul-de-sac.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malkki|first=Liisa H.|date=1995|title=Refugees and Exile: From &quot;Refugee Studies&quot; to the National Order of Things|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=495–523|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.24.100195.002431|s2cid=146314135|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1413dec66a9a7f7593379d8ffa29884e196953fe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term ''refugee'' in the context of refugee studies can be referred to as &quot;legal or descriptive rubric&quot;, encompassing socioeconomic backgrounds, personal histories, psychological analyses, and spiritualities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;

==UN Refugee Agency==
{{Main|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:South Africa-Xenophobia-001.jpg|thumb|UNHCR tents at a refugee camp following episodes of [[Xenophobia in South Africa|xenophobic violence]] and rioting in [[South Africa]], 2008]]

Headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was established on 14 December 1950. It protects and supports refugees at the request of a government or the [[United Nations]] and assists in providing durable solutions, such as [[voluntary return|return]] or [[third country resettlement|resettlement]]. All refugees in the world are under UNHCR mandate except [[Palestinian refugees]], who fled the current state of [[Israel]] between 1947 and 1949, as a result of the [[1948 Palestine War]]. These refugees are assisted by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA). However, Palestinian Arabs who fled the West Bank and Gaza after 1949 (for example, during the 1967 [[Six Day war]]) are under the jurisdiction of the UNHCR. Moreover, the UNHCR also provides protection and assistance to other categories of displaced persons: asylum seekers, refugees who [[voluntary return|returned home voluntarily]] but still need help rebuilding their lives, local civilian communities directly affected by large refugee movements, [[statelessness|stateless]] people and so-called [[internally displaced people]] (IDPs), as well as people in refugee-like and IDP-like situations.

The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and to resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to [[asylum seeker|seek asylum]] and find safe refuge in another state or territory and to offer &quot;durable solutions&quot; to refugees and refugee hosting countries.

===Acute and temporary protection===

====Refugee camp====
[[File:Refugee camp in Guinea.jpg|thumb|A camp in [[Guinea]] for refugees from [[Sierra Leone]] ]]
[[File:Refugee camp.jpg|thumb|Refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]
{{Main|Refugee camp}}
A refugee camp is a place built by [[government]]s or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] (such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]]) to receive refugees, [[internally displaced person]]s or sometimes also other migrants. It is usually designed to offer acute and temporary accommodation and services and any more permanent facilities and structures often banned. People may stay in these camps for many years, receiving emergency food, education and medical aid until it is safe enough to return to their country of origin.
There, refugees are at risk of disease, child soldier and terrorist recruitment, and physical and sexual violence. There are estimated to be 700 refugee camp locations worldwide.{{sfn|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}

====Urban refugee====
{{Main|Urban refugee}}
Not all refugees who are supported by the UNHCR live in refugee camps. A significant number, actually more than half, live in urban settings,{{sfn|Learn}} such as the ~60,000 Iraqi refugees in Damascus (Syria),{{sfn|Dehghanpisheh|2013}}&lt;!-- as of 2015, Kenyan government requires refugees to reside in camps --&gt; and the ~30,000 Sudanese refugees in Cairo (Egypt).{{sfn|Mahmoud}}

===Durable solutions===
The residency status in the host country whilst under temporary UNHCR protection is very uncertain as refugees are only granted temporary visas that have to be regularly renewed. Rather than only safeguarding the rights and basic well-being of refugees in the camps or in urban settings on a temporary basis the UNHCR's ultimate goal is to find one of the three durable solutions for refugees: integration, repatriation, resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/solutions.html|title=Refugees solutions|website=UNHCR|access-date=26 August 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integration and naturalisation====
{{Main|Naturalization}}
Local integration is aiming at providing the refugee with the permanent right to stay in the country of asylum, including, in some situations, as a naturalized citizen. It follows the formal granting of refugee status by the country of asylum. It is difficult to quantify the number of refugees who settled and integrated in their first country of asylum and only the number of naturalisations can give an indication.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 2014 Tanzania granted citizenship to 162,000 refugees from Burundi and in 1982 to 32,000 Rwandan refugees.{{sfn|Markus|2014}} Mexico naturalised 6,200 Guatemalan refugees in 2001.{{sfn|Goldberg|2001}}

====Voluntary return====
{{Main|Voluntary return}}

Voluntary return of refugees into their country of origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In the last couple of years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC,{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC{{sfn|Schmitt|2014}} and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia.{{sfn|Nairobi to open|2014}} The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who want to go back or were [[Asylum seeker#Refusal of asylum|refused asylum]].

====Third country resettlement====
{{Main|Third country resettlement}}

Third country resettlement involves the assisted transfer of refugees from the country in which they have sought asylum to a safe third country that has agreed to admit them as refugees. This can be for permanent settlement or limited to a certain number of years. It is the third durable solution and it can only be considered once the two other solutions have proved impossible.{{sfn|What is resettlement?}}{{sfn|Resettlement: new beginning}} The UNHCR has traditionally seen resettlement as the least preferable of the &quot;durable solutions&quot; to refugee situations.{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}} However, in April 2000 the then UN High Commissioner for Refugees, [[Sadako Ogata]], stated &quot;Resettlement can no longer be seen as the least-preferred durable solution; in many cases it is the ''only'' solution for refugees.&quot;{{sfn|Understanding Resettlement to|2004}}

===Internally displaced person===
{{main|Internally displaced person}}
UNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs) and people in IDP-like situations. These are civilians who have been forced to flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country. IDPs do not fit the legal definition of a refugee under the [[1951 Refugee Convention]], [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]] and the [[OAU Convention|1969 Organization for African Unity Convention]], because they have not left their country. As the nature of war has changed in the last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly.

==Refugee status==
The term refugee is often used in different contexts: in everyday usage it refers to a forcibly displaced person who has fled their country of origin; in a more specific context it refers to such a person who was, on top of that, granted refugee status in the country the person fled to. Even more exclusive is the Convention refugee status which is given only to persons who fall within the [[#Legal definitions|refugee definition]] of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.

To receive refugee status, a person must have applied for asylum, making them—while waiting for a decision—an asylum seeker. However, a displaced person otherwise legally entitled to refugee status may never apply for asylum, or may not be allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus may not have official asylum seeker status.

Once a displaced person is granted refugee status they enjoy certain [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees#Rights and responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention|rights]] as agreed in the 1951 Refugee convention. Not all countries have signed and ratified this convention and some countries do not have a legal procedure for dealing with asylum seekers.

===Seeking asylum===
{{main|Asylum seeker}}
[[File:Erstaufnahmelager Jenfelder Moorpark 4.jpg|thumb|Erstaufnahmelager [[Hamburg|Jenfelder]] Moorpark]]

An asylum seeker is a displaced person or immigrant who has formally sought the protection of the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for [[Asylum seeker#Complementary forms of protection|complementary forms of protection]]. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definition]] that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker receives either Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection, and can stay in the country—or is refused asylum, and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR—wherever the application was made—recognises the protection needs does the asylum seeker ''officially'' receive refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations, according to the legislation of the receiving country.

{{anchor|Qouta}}[[Quota refugee]]s do not need to apply for asylum on arrival in the third countries as they already went through the UNHCR refugee status determination process whilst being in the first country of asylum and this is usually accepted by the third countries.

===Refugee status determination===
[[File:The Sahrawi refugees&amp;nbsp;– a forgotten crisis in the Algerian desert (7).jpg|thumb|For over 30 years, several tens of thousands of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees have been living in the region of [[Tindouf, Algeria]], in the heart of the desert.]]
{{see|Refugee law#Refugee status determination|Asylum seeker#Status determination processes}}
To receive refugee status, a displaced person must go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is conducted by the government of the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and is based on [[Refugee law|international, regional]] or national law.{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} RSD can be done on a case by case basis as well as for whole groups of people. Which of the [[Asylum seeker#Status determination processes|two processes]] is used often depends on the size of the influx of displaced persons.
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 117.png|thumb|After challenging Queen Jezebel, Elijah takes refuge in a cave until the voice of God calls him in this 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]
There is no specific method mandated for RSD (apart from the commitment to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]]) and it is subject to the overall efficacy of the country's internal administrative and judicial system as well as the characteristics of the refugee flow to which the country responds. This lack of a procedural direction could create a situation where political and strategic interests override humanitarian considerations in the RSD process.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|pp=71–93}} There are also no fixed interpretations of the elements in the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and countries may interpret them differently (see also [[refugee roulette]]).

However, in 2013, the UNHCR conducted them in more than 50 countries and co-conducted them parallel to or jointly with governments in another 20 countries, which made it the second largest RSD body in the world{{sfn|Refugee Status Determination}} The UNHCR follows a set of guidelines described in the ''Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status'' to determine which individuals are eligible for refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/4d93528a9.pdf|title=Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee rights==
{{Main|Refugee law}}

Refugee rights encompass both customary law, [[peremptory norm]]s, and international legal instruments. If the entity granting refugee status is a state that has signed the 1951 Refugee Convention then the refugee has the [[Refugee employment|right to employment]]. Further rights include the following rights and obligations for refugees:

===Right of return===
{{Main|Right of return}}
Even in a supposedly &quot;post-conflict&quot; environment, it is not a simple process for refugees to return home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot;&gt;Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&amp;title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Pinheiro Principles are guided by the idea that people not only have the right to return home, but also the right to the same property.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot;/&gt; It seeks to return to the pre-conflict status quo and ensure that no one profits from violence. Yet this is a very complex issue and every situation is different; conflict is a highly transformative force and the pre-war status-quo can never be reestablished completely, even if that were desirable (it may have caused the conflict in the first place).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot;/&gt; Therefore, the following are of particular importance to the right to return:&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot;/&gt;
* May never have had property (e.g., in Afghanistan)
* Cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan)
* Ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue
* Death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land
* People settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste)
* Have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan).
Refugees who were [[third country resettlement|resettled to a third country]] will likely lose the indefinite leave to remain in this country if they return to their country of origin or the country of first asylum.

===Right to non-refoulement===
{{Main|Non-refoulement}}
Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.{{sfn|Convention relating to}} The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. To respect the right to asylum, states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|pages=232–266}} This proposal attempts to strike a balance between the interest of national governments and the interests of refugees.

===Right to family reunification===
{{Main|Family reunification}}

Family reunification (which can also be a form of resettlement) is a recognized reason for immigration in many countries. [[Divided family|Divided families]] have the right to be reunited if a family member with permanent right of residency applies for the reunification and can prove the people on the application were a family unit before arrival and wish to live as a family unit since separation. If application is successful this enables the rest of the family to immigrate to that country as well.

===Right to travel===
{{Main|Refugee travel document}}
Those states that signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] are obliged to issue travel documents (i.e. &quot;Convention Travel Document&quot;) to refugees lawfully residing in their territory.{{efn-ua|Under Article 28 of the Convention.}} It is a valid travel document in place of a passport, however, it cannot be used to travel to the country of origin, i.e. from where the refugee fled.

===Restriction of onward movement===
Once refugees or asylum seekers have found a safe place and protection of a state or territory outside their territory of origin they are discouraged from leaving again and seeking protection in another country. If they do move onward into a second country of asylum this movement is also called ''&quot;irregular movement&quot;'' by the UNHCR (see also [[asylum shopping]]). UNHCR support in the second country may be less than in the first country and they can even be returned to the first country.{{sfn|Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme|1989}}

==World Refugee Day==

[[File:Hopeful.jpg|thumb|A [[Syrian refugee]] girl in Istanbul, Turkey.]]

[[World Refugee Day]] has occurred annually on 20 June since 2000 by a special United Nations General Assembly Resolution. 20 June had previously been commemorated as &quot;African Refugee Day&quot; in a number of African countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the United Kingdom World Refugee Day is celebrated as part of [[Refugee Week]]. Refugee Week is a nationwide festival designed to promote understanding and to celebrate the cultural contributions of refugees, and features many events such as music, dance and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://refugeeweek.org.uk/about-us/ |title=Refugee Week (UK) About Us |publisher=Refugee Week |access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the World Day of Migrants and Refugees is celebrated in January each year, since instituted in 1914 by Pope [[Pius X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/research/news/pope-francis-world-day-migrants-and-refugees|title=Day 10, Year of #Mygration: Pope Francis World Day of Migrants and Refugees, 14 January 2018|date=2018-01-12|work=Research at The Open University|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Protracted displacement===
Displacement is a long lasting reality for most refugees. Two-thirds of all refugees around the world have been displaced for over three years, which is known as being in 'protracted displacement'. 50% of refugees&amp;nbsp;– around 10 million people&amp;nbsp;– have been displaced for over ten years.

The [[Overseas Development Institute]] has found that aid programmes need to move from short-term models of assistance (such as food or cash handouts) to more sustainable long-term programmes that help refugees become more self-reliant.

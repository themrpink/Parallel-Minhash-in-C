==History==
Kamov was founded by [[Nikolay Kamov|Nikolai Ilyich Kamov]], who started building his first rotary-winged aircraft in 1929, together with [[N. K. Skrzhinskii]]. Up to the 1940, the year of Kamov plant establishment, they created many [[autogyro]]s, including the [[TsAGI A-7-3]], the only armed autogyro to see (limited) combat action.

From 2002 [[AFK Sistema]] controlled a 51% stake in the company, with [[MiG]] controlling the remaining 49%.&lt;ref name=&quot;vedo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=АФК &quot;Система&quot; продает &quot;Камов-Холдинг&quot; Оборонпрому за $11.8 млн.|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/library/news/2005/11/07/afk-sistema-prodaet-kamov-holding-oboronpromu-za-118-mln|accessdate=16 December 2017|work=Vedomosti|date=7 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamov was sold to [[Oboronprom]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;vedo&quot;/&gt;

Kamov merged with [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mil]] and [[Rostvertol]] to form [[Russian Helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kamov Design Bureau|url=http://www.russianhelicopters.aero/en/kamov/|website=Russianhelicopters.aero|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kamov brand name was retained, though the new company dropped overlapping product lines.

'''Aérospatiale'''&lt;ref&gt;Gunston 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|aeʁɔspasjal}}), sometimes styled '''Aerospatiale''', was a French state-owned [[aerospace manufacturer]] that built both civilian and military [[aircraft]], [[rocket]]s and [[satellite]]s. It was originally known as '''Société nationale industrielle aérospatiale''' ('''SNIAS'''). Its head office was in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who owns whom: Continental Europe, Volume 1''. [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]., 1990.

During the 1990s, Aérospatiale underwent several significant restructures and mergers. Its helicopter division was, along with Germany's [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|DaimlerBenz Aerospace AG]] (DASA), combined together to form the [[Eurocopter Group]]. In 1999, the majority of Aérospatiale, except for its satellite activities, merged with French conglomerate [[Matra]]'s defense wing, [[Matra|Matra Haute Technologie]], to form [[Aérospatiale-Matra]]. That same year, the satellite manufacturing division merged with [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] to become [[Alcatel Space]], now [[Thales Alenia Space]]. In 2001, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with Spanish aviation company [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] (CASA) and German defense firm [[DASA|DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG]] (DASA) to form the multinational [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS). Currently, the majority of the former assets of the company are part of the multinational [[Airbus]] consortium.

==History==
===Formation===
[[File:Boulevard de Montmorency, 37.jpg|thumb|Former head office, Boulevard de Montmorency, 37]]
During 1970, ''Aérospatiale'' was created under the name ''SNIAS'' as a result of the merger of several French state-owned companies - [[Sud Aviation]], [[Nord Aviation]] and [[Société d'étude et de réalisation d'engins balistiques]] (SEREB). The newly formed entity was the largest aerospace company in France. From the onset, the French government owned a controlling stake in Aérospatiale; at one stage, a 97 per cent ownership of the company was held by the government.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;&gt;[https://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Aerospace/Sud/Aero48.htm &quot;Sud Aviation and Aérospatiale.&quot;] ''centennialofflight.net'', Retrieved: 19 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Aérospatiale was managed by the French industrialist [[Henri Ziegler]]; that same year, the firm's North American marketing and sales arm, which had previously operated under the trading name of the ''French Aerospace Corporation'', was officially rebranded as the ''European Aerospace Corporation'', which was intended to better reflect Aérospatiale's increasing focus on collaborative efforts with its European partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=none |magazine=Air Progress |date=September 1971 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major activities===
Many of Aérospatiale's initial programmes were holdovers from its predecessors, particularly those of Sud Aviation.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; Perhaps the most iconic and high-profile of these programmes was [[Concorde]], a joint French-British attempt to develop and market a [[supersonic]] commercial airliner. Initial work on this project had begun at Sud Aviation and the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], its British counterpart.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; The engines for Concorde were also developed as a joint Anglo-French effort between [[SNECMA]] and [[Bristol Siddeley]]. However, the programme was highly politicised and encountered considerable cost overruns and delays.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; Ultimately,it was negatively affected equally by bad political decisions and an [[1970s energy crisis|oil crisis]] in the 1970s, thus; only two airlines purchased Concorde.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt;

Aérospatiale's senior management were keen to avoid the mistakes of the  Concorde program.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; Their next major effort was would be an international consortium between [[British Aerospace]] and [[West German]]'s aircraft company [[Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm]] (MBB), called Airbus Industries.

This was established with the purpose of building a twin-engined [[widebody]] airliner, known as the [[Airbus A300|A300]].&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; While at first, it was difficult to achieve sales and the outlook for the A300 seemed negative. However, Aérospatiale continued to manufacture the airliner without orders, as it could not reasonably cut back production as French law required that laid-off employees were to receive 90 percent of their pay for a year as well as to retain their health benefits throughout.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt;

Sales of the A300 picked up and the type eventually became a major commercial success, subsequently driving both the [[United States|American]] [[Lockheed L-1011]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] from the market due to its cheaper operating model.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; On the back of this success, further airliners would be produced under the Airbus brand and the company would become a world leader in the field of large commercial aircraft during the 1990s.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt;

Aérospatiale played a leading role in the development of the European space sector.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; During the 1960s, Sud Aviation had been involved in a multinational European programme to produce the [[Europa (rocket)|Europa]] space launch vehicle, this being a three-stage rocket with 
the separate stages being manufactured in Britain, France, and Germany respectively. However, all of the flight tests conducted were failures; the programme's misfortune has been attributed to there being no central authority responsible for operations. This came was a result of the issue of workshare becoming highly politicized.

When Aérospatiale stepped in, during 1973, it was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Europa.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; The company proposed to build a new heavy launch vehicle, which would later be called the Ariane, to take the place of Europa. While other European nations were invited to participate, it would be French officials who would hold primary responsibility, and thus, make the most important decisions.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; This approach was agreed upon with several other nations; during 1979.

Ariane was an immediate success, allowing the French to gain a strong advantage over the United States, which had centred its efforts on the Space Shuttle. However, the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] during 1986 showed that it was too complex for routine use as a satellite launch platform.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt; Aérospatiale went on to develop more capable versions of the Ariane, which took much of the business of space launches away from the Americans during the 1990s.&lt;ref name = &quot;cent aero&quot;/&gt;

===Privatisation and mergers===
In 1992, German defense company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|DaimlerBenz Aerospace AG]] (DASA) and Aérospatiale combined their respective helicopter divisions together to form the [[Eurocopter Group]]; ownership of this new entity was shared between the two parent companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbushelicopters.com/w1/jrotor/83/docs/all.pdf &quot;A Bit of History: American Eurocopter’s Growth over the Decades.&quot;] ''Rotor Journal'', No. 83. October/November 2009. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government initiated a policy towards the [[privatization]] of Aérospatiale.&lt;ref&gt;Godsmark, Chris and John Lichfield.

On 10 July 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with Spanish aviation company [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] (CASA) and German defense firm [[DASA|DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG]] (DASA) to form the multinational [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/dasaaerospatiale-matra-merger-creates-european-aerospace-giant &quot;Dasa/Aerospatiale Matra Merger Creates European Aerospace Giant.&quot;] ''Aviation Week'', 15 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; EADS would later rebrand itself as [[Airbus Military]], taking the name of its commercial aircraft division, its primary business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23513650 &quot;EADS to be renamed Airbus Group.&quot;] ''[[BBC News]]'', 31 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Daniel.

'''Espresso''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Back ache-espresso.wav|ɛ|ˈ|s|p|r|ɛ|s|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|eˈsprɛsso|lang}}) is a [[coffee]]-brewing method of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water (about {{convert|190|F|C|round=5|disp=or|order=flip}}) is forced under {{convert|9|-|10|bar|kPa psi}} of atmospheric pressure (''expressed'') through finely-ground [[coffee bean]]s. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and [[Coffee roasting|roast degrees]]. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity of warm honey. This is due to the higher concentration of [[Suspended solids|suspended]] and [[dissolved solids]], and has ''crema'' on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).&lt;ref&gt;Illy, &quot;Il caffè e i cinque sensi&quot; [http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/it/caffe/degustazione-caffe]: &quot;La tazzina di porcellana bianca incornicia la ''crema'': una trama sottile nei toni del nocciola, percorsa da leggere striature rossastre&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.  The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.  The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.  This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.  These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms.  This preserves the strong coffee flavor present in the espresso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Illy |first1=Andrea |title=Espresso Coffee: The Science of Quality |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Espresso is also the base for various coffee drinks—including [[caffè latte]], [[cappuccino]], [[caffè macchiato]], [[caffè mocha]], [[flat white]], and [[caffè Americano]].

Espresso has more [[caffeine]] per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mr. Coffee blog post&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Debate: Does Espresso or Drip Coffee Have More Caffeine?|url=http://www.mrcoffee.com/blog/archive/2014/october/the-great-debate%3A-does-espresso-or-drip-coffee-have-more-caffeine%3F.html|publisher=[[Mr. Coffee]]|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, but a typical {{convert|1|oz|g|abbr=off|order=flip}} serving of espresso usually contains 65 milligrams of caffeine, whereas a typical serving of drip coffee usually contains 150 to 200&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4291|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124143904/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4291 |title=Show Foods|archive-date=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/caffeine/AN01211 How much caffeine is in your daily habit? – MayoClinic.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4290|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122090248/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4290 |title=Show Foods|archive-date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration through the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm |title=Espresso Tamping |publisher=CoffeeResearch.org |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process produces an almost syrupy beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components. The ''crema''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Crema?|url=http://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/coffee-101/articles/what-is-crema|publisher=seattlecoffeegear|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Espresso Crema|url=http://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/6372721/Espresso_Crema.html|publisher=ChemistryViews.org|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is produced by [[emulsion|emulsifying]] the oils in the ground coffee into a [[colloid]], which does not occur in other brewing methods. There is no universal standard defining the process of extracting espresso,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today's Espresso Scene|url=http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-todays-scene.html|publisher=Home Barista|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several published definitions attempt to constrain the amount and type of ground coffee used, the temperature and pressure of the water, and the rate of extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Espresso Coffee|url=http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/definitions.htm|publisher=Coffee Research Institute|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Espresso Italiano Certificato|url=http://www.espressoitaliano.org/doc/EIC%20-%20Eng%20-%20LQ.pdf|publisher=Istituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, one uses an [[espresso machine]] to make espresso. The act of producing a shot of espresso is often called &quot;pulling&quot; a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, with which a [[barista]] pulls down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, which forces hot water through the coffee at high pressure. Today, however, it is more common for an electric pump to generate the pressure.

== Espresso roast ==

Espresso is both a coffee beverage and a brewing method.  It is not a specific bean, bean blend, or [[Coffee roasting|roast level]]. Any bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso. For example, in southern Italy, a darker roast is generally preferred.  Farther north, the trend moves toward slightly lighter roasts, while outside Italy a wide range is popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Illy|first1=Francesco|last2=Illy|first2=Riccardo|title=The book of coffee : a gourmet's guide|date=1992|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1558593213|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angelo Moriondo]], from [[Turin]], patented a [[Angelo Moriondo#First Espresso machine|steam-driven &quot;instantaneous&quot; coffee beverage making device]] in 1884 (No. 33/256). The device is &quot;almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee&quot; and Moriondo is &quot;certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso {{sic}} machine, if not the earliest&quot;.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=105}} Unlike true espresso machines, it brewed in bulk, not as individual servings. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from [[Milan]], devised and patented several improvements to the espresso machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled &quot;Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage&quot;; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-long-history-of-the-espresso-machine-126012814/|title=The Long History of the Espresso Machine|last=Stamp|first=Jimmy|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of espresso developed in various ways; a detailed discussion of the spread of espresso is given in {{Harv|Morris|2007}}, which is a source of various statements below. In Italy, the rise of espresso consumption was associated with urbanization, [[espresso bar]]s providing a place for socializing. Further, coffee [[price controls|prices were controlled]] by local authorities, provided the coffee was consumed standing up, encouraging the &quot;stand at a bar&quot; culture.

In the English-speaking world, espresso became popular, particularly in the form of [[cappuccino]], owing to the tradition of drinking coffee with milk and the exotic appeal of the foam; in the United States, this was more often in the form of [[latte]]s, with or without flavored syrups added. The latte is claimed to have been invented in the 1950s by Italian American Lino Meiorin of [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]], as a long cappuccino, and was then popularized in Seattle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = Caffe Mediterraneum | title = Invention of the Caffe Latte | url = http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | accessdate = 19 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090614060123/http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | archive-date = 14 June 2009 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then nationally and internationally by Seattle-based [[Starbucks]] in the late 1980s and 1990s.

In the United Kingdom, espresso grew in popularity among youth in the 1950s, who felt more welcome in the coffee shops than in [[pub]]s. Espresso was initially popular, particularly within the Italian diaspora, growing in popularity with tourism to Italy exposing others to espresso, as developed by Eiscafès established by Italians in Germany. Initially, expatriate Italian espresso bars were seen as downmarket venues, serving the working-class Italian diaspora and thus providing appeal to the alternative subculture; this can still be seen in the United States in Italian American neighborhoods, such as [[North End, Boston|Boston's North End]], [[Little Italy, Manhattan|New York's Little Italy]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|San Francisco's North Beach]]. As specialty coffee developed in the 1980s (following earlier developments in the 1970s and even 1960s), an indigenous artisanal coffee culture developed, with espresso instead positioned as an upmarket drink.

In the 2010s, [[coffee culture]] commentators distinguish large-chain mid-market coffee as &quot;Second Wave Coffee&quot;, and upmarket artisanal coffee as &quot;[[Third wave of coffee|Third Wave Coffee]]&quot;. In the Middle East and Asia, espresso is growing in popularity, with the opening of Western coffee-shop chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbQrDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=espresso+became+popular+because+of+cappuccino&amp;pg=PA69|title=Coffee Culture|last=Hutchins|first=Timothy|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781387074518|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

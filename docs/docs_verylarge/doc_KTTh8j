===Civil War===
[[File:Confederates marching through Frederick, MD in 1862.jpg|thumb|Confederate troops marching south on North Market Street during the Civil War]]
Frederick became Maryland's capital city briefly in 1861, as the legislature moved from Annapolis to vote on the secession question. President Lincoln arrested several members, and the assembly was unable to convene a quorum to vote on secession.

As a major crossroads, Frederick, like [[Winchester, Virginia]], and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], saw considerable action during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwartrails.org|title=Civil War Trails: Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slaves]] also escaped from or through Frederick (since Maryland was still a &quot;slave state&quot; although an unseceded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom. During the [[Maryland Campaign|Maryland campaigns]], both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops marched through the city. Frederick also hosted several hospitals to nurse the wounded from those battles, as is related in the [[National Museum of Civil War Medicine]] on East Patrick Street.

[[File:Barbara Frietchie (poem).jpg|thumb|1896 print illustrating the legend of [[Barbara Fritchie]].]]
A legend related by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] claimed that Frederick's Pennsylvania Dutch women (including [[Barbara Fritchie]] who reportedly waved a flag) booed the Confederates in September 1862, as General [[Stonewall Jackson]] led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of [[Battle of South Mountain|Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps]] on [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]]. Union Major General [[Jesse L. Reno]]'s IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the [[Battle of South Mountain]], where Reno died. The sites of the battles are due west of the city along the [[National Road]], west of [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]]. Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the [[Cumberland Valley]] and towards [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]].  [[Gathland State Park]] has the War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor [[George Alfred Townsend]] (1841–1914). The 1889 memorial commemorating Major General Reno and the Union soldiers of his IX Corps is on Reno Monument Road west of [[Middletown, Maryland|Middletown]], just below the summit of [[Fox's Gap]], as is a 1993 memorial to slain Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Samuel Garland Jr.]], and the [[North Carolina]] troops who held the line.

President [[Abraham Lincoln]], on his way to visit Gen. [[George McClellan]] after the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Antietam]], delivered a short speech at what was then the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B. &amp; O. Railroad]] depot at the current intersection of East All Saints and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech (at what is today the Frederick Community Action Agency, a Social Services office).

At the [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger arrived from President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry Halleck]], informing General [[George Meade]] that he would be replacing General [[Joseph Hooker]] after the latter's disastrous performance at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May. The [[Army of the Potomac]] camped around the Prospect Hall property for the several days as skirmishers pursued [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] prior to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the &quot;Devil's Den&quot; in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.

In July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early occupied Frederick and extorted $200,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000|1864}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from citizens for not razing the city on their way to Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Historic District inventory, NRIS F-3-039, section 8 p. 2 available at http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/010000/010400/010482/pdf/msa_se5_10482.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Union troops under Major General [[Lew Wallace]] fought a successful delaying action, in what became the last significant Confederate advance at the [[Battle of Monocacy]], also known as the &quot;Battle that saved Washington.&quot; The [[Monocacy National Battlefield]] lies just southeast of the city limits, along the [[Monocacy River]] at the B. &amp; O. Railroad junction where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further northeast of town at the stone-arched &quot;Jug Bridge&quot; where the [[National Road]] crossed the Monocacy; and an artillery bombardment occurred along the National Road west of town near Red Man's Hill and [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion as the Union troops retreated eastward.  [[Antietam National Battlefield]] and [[South Mountain State Park|South Mountain State Battlefield Park]] which commemorates the 1862 battles are located 23 miles and 35 miles respectively to the west-northwest. While [[Gettysburg National Battlefield]] of 1863 lies approximately {{convert|35|mi}} to the north-northeast.

The reconstructed home of [[Barbara Fritchie]] stands on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park. Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Frederick)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]]. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] quoted Whittier's poem to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called &quot;Shangra-La&quot; (now &quot;[[Camp David]]&quot;) within the [[Catoctin Mountains]] near Thurmont.

===Late 19th century===
Admiral [[Winfield Scott Schley]] (1839–1911) was born at &quot;Richfields&quot;, the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser [[USS Baltimore (C-3)|USS ''Baltimore'']] along with Admiral [[William T. Sampson]] in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] off the shores of the Spanish island colony of [[Cuba]] in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Thomas Scharf|Scharf, J. Thomas]]. ''History of Western Maryland'', Vol. I. Philadelphia: Louis H. Everts. 1882. pp. 418–419.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilmer Schley]] served as Mayor from 1919 to 1922, and the Schleys remained one of the town's leading families into the late-20th century.

Nathaniel Wilson Schley, a prominent banker, and his wife Mary Margaret Schley helped organize and raise funds for the annual Great Frederick Fair, one of the two largest agricultural fairs in the State. Since the 1960s, the fair has featured many outstanding country-western singers and become a major music festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatfrederickfair.com/1997/events.htm The Great Frederick Fair Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106192303/http://www.thegreatfrederickfair.com/1997/events.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schley Avenue commemorates the family's role in the city's heritage.

The [[Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad Company|Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad]] ran from Frederick to the Pennsylvania–Maryland State line, a/k/a [[Mason–Dixon line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goo.gl/maps/4A6FB|title=Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chartered in 1867, construction began in 1869 and the line opened October 8, 1872. However, it defaulted on its interest payments in 1874 and acquired by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1875, which formed a new division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale to the Pennsylvania Railroad for $150,000. The railroad survived through mergers and the Penn-Central bankruptcy. However, the State of Maryland acquired the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line in 1982. As of 2013, all but two miles ({{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=output only|1}}) at the southern terminus at Frederick still exist, operated by either the [[Walkersville Southern Railroad|Walkersville Southern]], or the [[Maryland Midland Railway|Maryland Midland Railway (MMID)]] railroads.

[[Jewish]] pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the [[Frederick Hebrew Congregation]] in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name [[Beth Sholom Congregation (Frederick, Maryland)|Beth Sholom Congregation]].

In 1905, Rev. E. B. Hatcher started the First [[Baptist]] Church of Frederick.

After the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for [[African Americans]]. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as [[South Frederick Elementary]]. The building presently houses the [[Lincoln Elementary School (Frederick, Maryland)|Lincoln Elementary School]]. The [[Laboring Sons Memorial Grounds]], a cemetery for [[free negro|free blacks]], was founded in 1851.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|23.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.18|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2017 |url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_24.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 29, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's area is predominantly land, with small areas of water being the [[Monocacy River]], which runs to the east of the city, Carroll Creek (which runs through the city and causes periodic floods, such as that during the summer of 1972 and fall of 1976), as well as several neighborhood ponds and small city owned lakes, such as Culler Lake, a man-made small body of water in the downtown area.&lt;ref name=&quot;man_made&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historysharkproductions.com/living-united-for-80-years-part-i-a-community-chest/a-waterless-culler-lake|access-date=January 4, 2019|date=April 7, 2016|df=mdy|title=A &quot;waterless&quot; Culler Lake|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205011115/http://www.historysharkproductions.com/living-united-for-80-years-part-i-a-community-chest/a-waterless-culler-lake|archive-date=February 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally cool winters. It lies to the west of the [[fall line]], which gives the city slightly lower temperatures compared to locales further east. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Frederick has a [[humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated ''Cfa'' on climate maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6337&amp;cityname=Frederick%2C+Maryland%2C+United+States+of+America&amp;units= Climate Summary for Frederick, Maryland].&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick's relative proximity to Washington, D.C., has always been an important factor in the development of its local economy, as well as the presence of Fort Detrick, its largest employer.

Frederick is the home of [[Riverside Research Park]], a large biomedical research park located on Frederick's east side. Tenants include relocated offices of the National Cancer Institute (Fort Detrick) as well as [[Charles River Labs]]. As a result of continued and enhanced [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] investment, the Frederick area will likely maintain a continued growth pattern over the next decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;rrp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riversideresearchpark.com

Frederick has also been impacted by recent national trends centered on the gentrification of the downtown areas of cities across the nation (particularly in the northeast and mid-Atlantic), and to re-brand them as sites for cultural consumption.

The [[Frederick Historic District]] in the city's downtown houses more than 200 retailers, restaurants and antique shops along Market, Patrick and East Streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinfrederick.com/economic_development/carroll_creek_park.htm|title=Economic Development: Carroll Creek Park|access-date=March 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220172945/http://www.businessinfrederick.com/economic_development/carroll_creek_park.htm|archive-date=February 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants feature a diverse array of cuisines, including Italian American, Thai, Vietnamese, and Cuban, as well as a number of regionally recognized dining establishments, such as The Tasting Room and Olde Towne Tavern.

In addition to retail and dining, downtown Frederick is home to 600 businesses and organizations totaling nearly 5,000 employees. A growing technology sector can be found in downtown's historic renovated spaces, as well as in new office buildings located along Carroll Creek Park.

Carroll Creek Park began as a flood control project in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccp&quot;/&gt; It was an effort to reduce the risk to downtown Frederick from the 100-year floodplain and restore economic vitality to the historic commercial district. Today, more than $150 million in private investing is underway or planned in new construction, infill development or historic renovation in the park area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccp&quot;/&gt;

The first phase of the park improvements, totaling nearly $11 million in construction, run from Court Street to just past Carroll Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccp&quot;/&gt; New elements to the park include brick pedestrian paths, water features, planters with shade trees and plantings, pedestrian bridges and a 350-seat amphitheater for outdoor performances.

A recreational and cultural resource, the park also serves as an economic development catalyst, with private investment along the creek functioning as a key component to the park's success. More than 400,000 sf of office space; 150,000 sf of commercial/retail space; nearly 300 residential units; and more than 2,000 parking spaces are planned or under construction.

On the first Saturday of every month, Frederick hosts an evening event in the downtown area called &quot;First Saturday&quot;. Each Saturday has a theme, and activities are planned according to those themes in the downtown area (particularly around the Carroll Creek Promenade). The event spans a ten-block area of Frederick and takes place from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. During the late spring, summer, and early fall months, this event draws particularly large crowds from neighboring cities and towns in Maryland, and nearby locations in the tri-state area (Virginia and Pennsylvania). The average number of attendees visiting downtown Frederick during first Saturday events is around 11,000, with higher numbers from May to October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownfrederick.org/downloads/FirstSaturdayAttendeeProfileFinalReport.pdf|title=First Saturday Attendee Profile Study|access-date=March 27, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick is well known for the &quot;clustered spires&quot; skyline of its historic downtown churches. These spires are depicted on the city's seal and many other city-affiliated logos and insignia. The phrase &quot;clustered spires&quot; is used as the name of several city locations such as Clustered Spires Cemetery and the city-operated Clustered Spires Golf Course. 
[[File:Downtown view of Frederick, MD IMG 4699.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Another view of downtown Frederick]]
The scale of the older part of the city is dense, with streets and sidewalks suitable for pedestrians, and a variety of shops and restaurants, comprising what ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in 2010 called one of the United States' &quot;Greatest Neighborhoods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/11/03/americas-best-neighborhoods-2010-business-beltway-best-neighborhoods.html | work=Forbes | first=Brian | last=Wingfield | title=America's Best Neighborhoods 2010 | date= November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick has a bridge painted with a mural titled ''Community Bridge''.  The artist William Cochran has been acclaimed for the ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' realism of the mural.  Thousands of people sent ideas representing &quot;community&quot;, which he painted on the stonework of the bridge. The residents of Frederick call it &quot;the mural&quot;, &quot;painted bridge&quot;, or more commonly, the &quot;mural bridge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/maryland/frederick-and-western-maryland/review-453201.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120125615/http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/maryland/frederick-and-western-maryland/review-453201.html |date=January 20, 2013 }}.

===Arts===
The Frederick Arts Council is the designated arts organization for Frederick County. The organization is charged with promoting, supporting, and advocating the arts. There are over ten art galleries in downtown Frederick, and three theaters are located within 50 feet of each other (Cultural Arts Center, [[Weinberg Center for the Arts]], and the Maryland Ensemble Theatre). Frederick is the home of The Delaplaine Visual Arts Education Center, a leading non-profit in the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delaplaine.org/Center/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524084209/http://www.delaplaine.org/Center/ |archive-date=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Maryland Shakespeare Festival.

In August 2007, the streets of Frederick were adorned with 30 life-size fiberglass keys as part of a major public art project entitled &quot;The Keys to Frederick&quot;.  In October 2007, artist William Cochran created a large-scale glass project titled ''[[The Dreaming (Frederick, Maryland)|The Dreaming]]''. The project is in the historic theater district, across from the Wienberg Center for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamcochran.com/3/gallerymain.asp?GalleryID=5790&amp;AKey=yx679bsx|title=William Cochran, large-scale public art installations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican Hill]] (Latin ''Collis Vaticanus'') lying northwest of the [[Tiber]], the [[Pincian Hill]] (Latin ''Mons Pincius''), lying to the north, and the [[Janiculum Hill]] (Latin ''Ianiculum''), lying to the west, are not counted among the traditional Seven Hills, being outside the boundaries of the ancient city of Rome.

==History==
[[Tradition]] holds that [[Romulus and Remus]] founded the original city on the Palatine Hill on April 21, 753 BCE, and that the seven hills were first occupied by small settlements that were not grouped. The seven hills' denizens began to interact, which began to bond the groups. The city of Rome, thus, came into being as these separate settlements acted as a group, draining the marshy valleys between them and turning them into markets (''[[Forum (Roman)|fora]]'' in Latin). Later, in the early 4th century BC, the [[Servian Walls]] were constructed to protect the seven hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italymagazine.com/dual-language/seven-hills-rome &quot;The Seven Hills of Rome&quot;, ''Italy Magazine''] ''italymagazine.com'', accessed 14 February 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Rome, five of the seven hills - the Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Quirinal, and Viminal Hills -  are now the sites of monuments, buildings, and parks. The Capitoline Hill is the location of Rome's city hall, and the Palatine Hill is part of the main archaeological area.

A smaller area was covered by the seven peaks associated with the [[Septimontium]] festival: [[Oppius]], [[Palatine Hill|Palatium]], [[Velian Hill|Velia]], [[Fagutal]], [[Cermalus]], [[Caelian Hill|Caelius]], and [[Cispius]]; essentially the Palatine and Caelian Hills and the western parts of the Esquiline Hill.

'''Dąbrowa Górnicza''' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Dąbrowa Górnicza.ogg|d|o|m|'|b|r|o|w|a|-|g|u|r|'|ń|i|cz|a}} is a city in [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], southern [[Poland]], near [[Katowice]] and [[Sosnowiec]]. It is located in eastern part of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], on the ''Czarna Przemsza'' and ''Biała Przemsza'' rivers (tributaries of the [[Vistula River|Vistula]], see [[Przemsza]]).

Even though Dąbrowa Górnicza belongs to the historic province of [[Lesser Poland]], it now is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship (since 1999), and previously (1975–1999) it was in [[Katowice Voivodeship]]. Dąbrowa Górnicza is one of the cities of the 2.7&amp;nbsp;million conurbation – [[Katowice urban area]], and within a greater [[silesian metropolitan area]] populated by about 5.2&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]] (ESPON){{cite web|url=http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728052348/http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html |archivedate=28 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city itself is 119,373 (Dec 2019).&lt;ref name=&quot;population&quot; /&gt;

==Area and districts==
Dąbrowa Górnicza is the largest city of the province and the 9th largest in Poland in terms of territory, with total area of 188 square kilometers. The city lies among the hills, at 258 to 390 meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Dąbrowa Górnicza borders [[Będzin]] County, [[Zawiercie]] County, [[Olkusz]] County and the city of [[Sosnowiec]]. The city is divided into several districts: Antoniów, Błędów, Bugaj, Centrum, Dziewiąty, Gołonóg, Korzeniec, Kuźniczka Nowa, Łazy Błędowskie, Łęka, Łęknice, Łosień, Marianki, Mydlice, Okradzionów, Piekło, Ratanice, Reden, Sikorka, [[Strzemieszyce Małe]], [[Strzemieszyce Wielkie]], Trzebiesławice, Trzydziesty, [[Tucznawa]], Ujejsce, Ząbkowice. Furthermore, in 1977–1984 the town of [[Sławków]] was a district of Dąbrowa Górnicza.

The [[Toponomy|place name]] ''Dąbrowa'', is derived from the Polish word ''dąb'' ([[oak]]), and denotes an ''oak grove'', as the territory of the original village is believed to have been covered by oak forests back in the early days of its existence. From the 19th century, the settlement grew to be an important coal mining center, and its name was supplemented by the [[adjective]] ''Górnicza'' (which refers to mining) in 1919, to distinguish it from such towns, as [[Dąbrowa Tarnowska]] and [[Dąbrowa Białostocka]].

==History==
In the first half of the 18th century ''Dąbrowa'' was a small agricultural settlement belonging to the [[Będzin]] parish of Lesser Poland's [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]]. First mentioned on 25 July 1726, when parish priest of Holy Trinity Church at Będzin noted a woman named Anna Lisowa from Dąbrowa. According to the 1787 census of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków|Archdiocese of Kraków]], the settlement numbered 184 inhabitants. The districts of Dąbrowa, which for centuries had been separate villages, are much older. Trzebieslawice was first mentioned in the 12th century, Błędow was mentioned by Bishop of Kraków [[Iwo Odrowąż]] in the year 1220, Strzemieszyce and Ujejsce were mentioned in the 14th century, Gołonóg in the 15th century, while Ząbkowice was described by [[Jan Długosz]].

[[File:Strzemieszyce Kosciol.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Church in [[Strzemieszyce Wielkie]]]]

After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) Dąbrowa was incorporated into the [[Prussia]]n province of [[New Silesia]]. The Prussians discovered rich deposits of coal here and the first coal mine was established by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden]] in 1796. In 1799, first detailed map of this area was created, on which a settlement called ''Stara Dąbrowa'' is presented. It was located along a road from Kraków to [[Upper Silesia]]. The coal mine, established by Friedrich Reden, attracted workers, and a settlement was soon established around it. In 1815, Dąbrowa was annexed by Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]]. In 1846, the ''Cieszkowski Coal Mine'' was opened, named after Józef Cieszkowski. The ''Zinc Plant Konstanty'' operated as early as 1823, and the ''Huta Bankowa'' steel works, which is still in operation, was built in Dąbrowa Górnicza in 1834. First primary school was opened in 1820, and first Roman Catholic church of St. Alexander was built in the 1870s. In 1909 the [[gmina]] of Dąbrowa Górnicza was established by [[Tsar]]ist authorities. Even though its population reached 30,000, the Russians were reluctant to grant Dąbrowa town charter, so it remained a village until 18 August 1916, when Austrian authorities, which during [[World War I]] occupied southern part of Congress Poland, agreed to establish the town. In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Dąbrowa belonged to [[Kielce Voivodeship]], and during [[World War II]] it was annexed into the [[Third Reich]], as part of the [[Upper Silesia Province]]. Together with whole [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], the city was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship after World War II, in 1945.
 
The 1970s saw the construction of the [[Katowice Steelworks]], which is nowadays the biggest steel producing plant in Poland, after [[privatization]] owned by [[ArcelorMittal]]. In the 1970s the town expanded territorially and economically. In 1975 and 1977 the neighboring localities of [[Strzemieszyce Małe]], [[Strzemieszyce Wielkie]], Ząbkowice and others became suburbanized. The population of Dąbrowa Górnicza reached its peak in 1982 with 152,373 inhabitants. In the 1990s all local coal mines were closed, because of lack of coal. But the oldest part of the town Reden still exists.

[[File:Mortadella tagliata.jpg|thumb|Mortadella Bologna, with [[pistachio]]s, [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|IGP]] from Italy]]
'''Mortadella''' ({{IPA-it|mortaˈdɛlla}}) is a large [[Italian sausage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mortadella|title=Mortadella - Define Mortadella at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[luncheon meat]] (''[[salumi|salume]]'' {{IPA-it|saˈluːme|}}) made of finely hashed or ground heat-cured pork, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). It is traditionally flavoured with [[black pepper]] grains, but modern versions can also contain [[pistachio]]s or, more rarely, [[myrtle (common)|myrtle]] berries.

The best-known version of mortadella is Mortadella Bologna [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|IGP]], but other varieties are found across Italy, including some made of other meats.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name ''mortadella'' is debated. One theory derives the name from the [[Latin]] word ''mortarium'' ([[Mortar and pestle|mortar]]), traditionally used to pound the meat to produce the sausage.&lt;ref name=Hazan&gt;{{cite book |last= Hazan|first= Marcella |date= 2012|title= The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IciBQN-0VS4C&amp;pg=PP17|location= |publisher= Pan Macmillan|page= 17|isbn= 9780752228044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book |last= Davidson|first= Alan |date= 2014|title= The Oxford Companion to Food|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA533|location= Oxford|publisher= OUP Oxford|page= 533|isbn= 9780191040726}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, proposed by Giancarlo Susini, professor of ancient history in the [[University of Bologna]], relies on two funerary [[stele]]s kept in the [[Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna|Archaeological Museum of Bologna]], believed to pertain to the same monument, one showing a herd of piglets and the other a mortar and pestle.&lt;ref name=Roversi1&gt;{{cite book|url= https://mortadellabologna.com/blog/etruschi-galli-bol-o-romani-chi-e-stato-l-inventore/|title= La Mortadella Bologna IGP. Storia di un mito|last= Roversi|first= Giancarlo|date= 2013|location= Bologna|publisher= Consorzio mortadella Bologna|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory, introduced by [[Ovidio Montalbani]] in the [[17th century]], derives the name from a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sausage flavoured with [[myrtle (common)|myrtle]] berries that Romans called ''farcimen myrtatum'' or ''farcimen murtatum'' (myrtle sausage).&lt;ref name=Roversi2&gt;{{cite book|url= https://mortadellabologna.com/blog/mirto-o-mortella-al-posto-del-pepe-troppo-pregato-e-costo/|title= La Mortadella Bologna IGP. Storia di un mito|last= Roversi|first= Giancarlo|date= 2013|location= Bologna|publisher= Consorzio mortadella Bologna|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; &lt;ref name=Hazan/&gt; Myrtle was in fact a popular spice before [[Black pepper|pepper]] became available to European markets.&lt;ref name=Roversi2/&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, the pork filling was ground to a paste using a large [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] (''mortaio'' {{IPA-it|morˈtaːjo|}}) and pestle. 

Mortadella originated in [[Bologna]], the capital of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. [[Anna Del Conte]] (''The Gastronomy of Italy'' 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.

==Varieties==
* Mortadella Bologna has [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Geographical Indication (IGP)]] status under [[European Union law]] and is the best known world-wide. The zone of production is extensive; as well as [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the neighbouring regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Marche]] and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and [[Trentino]].

* Mortadella di [[Prato]], produced in [[Tuscany]], is also defined by an IGP. It is flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with [[alchermes]].

* Mortadella of [[Amatrice]], high in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] of northern [[Lazio]], is lightly smoked.

* Mortadella di cavallo is made from [[horsemeat]] in [[Albano Laziale]] in [[Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsial.it/portalearsial/prd_tipici/scheda_prodotto.asp?tip=0&amp;id=103&amp;bio=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The American sausage called &quot;[[Bologna sausage|bologna]]&quot; is named after the mortadella of Bologna.

Mortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[olive]]s is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as ''mortadela italiana'' (Italian mortadella), to differentiate it from a local variant named ''catalana''.

Mortadella is also very popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries it is spelled ''mortadela'', and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains. In Peru is known as ''Jamonada''.

In Brazil, [[São Paulo]] has a very popular ''mortadela'' sandwich sold in the Mercado Municipal.

In Puerto Rico, &quot;smoked mortadella&quot; is sometimes confused with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados, and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.

===Central, Southern and Eastern Europe===
In Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as ''parizer''. It is a type of artisan bologna.
In Hungary, a similar product is called, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''mortadella'' and a plain variety called ''pariser'', ''parizer'' or ''párizsi''. The term ''parizer'' is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while ''parizier'' is used in other territories of the Balkans. The classic Italian ''mortadella'' is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast.

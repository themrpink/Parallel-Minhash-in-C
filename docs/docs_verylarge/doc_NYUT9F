A '''simulation''' is an approximate [[imitation]] of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Discrete-Event System Simulation|author1=J. Banks|author2=J. Carson|author3=B. Nelson|author4=D. Nicol|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=978-0-13-088702-3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of [[technology]] for [[performance tuning]] or optimizing, [[safety engineering]], [[Experiment|testing]], [[training]], [[education]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2020-09-27|title=Words of advice: teaching enzyme kinetics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.15537|journal=The FEBS Journal|doi=10.1111/febs.15537|pmid=32981225|issn=1742-464X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[video game]]s. Often, [[computer experiment]]s are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with [[scientific modelling]] of natural systems&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; or human systems to gain insight into their functioning,&lt;ref&gt;In the words of the [http://www.modelbenders.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html Simulation article] in Encyclopedia of Computer Science, &quot;designing a model of a real or imagined system and conducting experiments with that model&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[economics]]. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sokolowski, J.A. |author2=Banks, C.M. |title=Principles of Modeling and Simulation |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmodeli00soko_034 |url-access=limited |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|year=2009 |page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmodeli00soko_034/page/n15 6] |isbn=978-0-470-28943-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key issues in simulation include the acquisition of valid sources of information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviors, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|model verification and validation]] are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of [[computer simulation]].

==Classification and terminology==
[[File:Christer Fuglesang underwater EVA simulation for STS-116.jpg|thumb|Human-in-the-loop simulation of [[outer space]]]]
[[File:Lambda2 scherschicht.png|thumb|right|Visualization of a [[direct numerical simulation]] model.]]

Historically, simulations used in different fields developed largely independently, but 20th-century studies of [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] combined with spreading use of computers across all those fields have led to some unification and a more systematic view of the concept.

''[[Physical simulation]]'' refers to simulation in which physical objects are substituted for the real thing (some circles&lt;ref&gt;For example in [[computer graphics]] [http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/attendees/papers/12.html SIGGRAPH 2007 | For Attendees | Papers] [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Physical_Simulation Doc:Tutorials/Physics/BSoD - BlenderWiki] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012202002/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Physical_Simulation |date=2007-10-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; use the term for computer simulations modelling selected laws of [[physics]], but this article does not). These physical objects are often chosen because they are smaller or cheaper than the actual object or system.

''Interactive simulation'' is a special kind of physical simulation, often referred to as a ''[[Human-in-the-loop|human in the loop]]'' simulation, in which physical simulations include human operators, such as in a [[flight simulator]], [[Maritime simulator|sailing simulator]], or [[driving simulator]].

''[[Continuous simulation]]'' is a simulation based on continuous time, rather than discrete time steps, using numerical integration of [[differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod, J. 1968&quot;&gt;McLeod, J. (1968) “Simulation: the Dynamic Modeling of Ideas And Systems with Computers”, McGraw-Hill, NYC.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Discrete-event simulation]]'' studies systems whose states change their values only at discrete times.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, B. P., Praehofer, H., &amp; Kim, T. G. (2000) &quot;Theory of Modeling and Simulation: Integrating Discrete Event and Continuous Complex Dynamic Systems&quot;, Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a simulation of an epidemic could change the number of infected people at  time instants when susceptible individuals get infected or when infected individuals recover.

''[[Stochastic simulation]]'' is a simulation where some variable or process is subject to random variations and is projected using [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] techniques using pseudo-random numbers. Thus replicated runs with the same boundary conditions will each produce different results within a specific confidence band.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod, J. 1968&quot;/&gt;

''[[Deterministic simulation]]'' is a simulation which is not stochastic: thus the variables are regulated by deterministic algorithms. So replicated runs from the same boundary conditions always produce identical results.

''Hybrid Simulation'' (sometime Combined Simulation) corresponds to a mix between Continuous and Discrete Event Simulation and results in integrating numerically the differential equations between two sequential events to reduce the number of discontinuities.&lt;ref&gt;Giambiasi, N., Escude, B., &amp; Ghosh, S. (2001). GDEVS: A generalized discrete event specification for accurate modeling of dynamic systems. In Autonomous Decentralized Systems, 2001. Proceedings. 5th International Symposium on (pp. 464–469). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''stand alone simulation'' is a simulation running on a single workstation by itself.

A ''distributed simulation'' is one which uses more than one computer simultaneously, in order to guarantee access from/to different resources (e.g. multi-users operating different systems, or distributed data sets); a classical example is [[Distributed Interactive Simulation]] (DIS).&lt;ref&gt;Petty, M. D. (1995, April). Computer-generated forces in a distributed interactive simulation. In Distributed Interactive Simulation Systems for Simulation and Training in the Aerospace Environment: A Critical Review (Vol. 10280, p. 102800I). International Society for Optics and Photonics.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Parallel Simulation'' speeds up a simulation's execution by concurrently distributing its workload over multiple processors, as in [[High-Performance Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;Fujimoto, R. M. (1990). Parallel discrete event simulation. Communications of the ACM, 33(10), 30–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interoperable Simulation'' where multiple models, simulators (often defined as Federates) interoperate locally, distributed over a network; a classical example is [[High-Level Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhl, F., Weatherly, R., &amp; Dahmann, J. (1999). Creating computer simulation systems: an introduction to the high-level architecture. Prentice Hall PTR.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruzzone A.G., Massei M., Simulation-Based Military Training, in Guide to Simulation-Based Disciplines, Vol.1. 315–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modeling &amp; Simulation as a Service'' where simulation is accessed as a service over the web.&lt;ref&gt;Cayirci, E. (2013, December). Modeling and simulation as a cloud service: a survey. In Simulation Conference (WSC), 2013 Winter (pp. 389–400). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modeling, interoperable Simulation and Serious Games'' where Serious Games Approaches (e.g. Game Engines and Engagement Methods) are integrated with Interoperable Simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruzzone, A. G., Massei, M., Tremori, A., Longo, F., Nicoletti, L., Poggi, S., ... &amp; Poggio, G. (2014). MS2G: simulation as a service for data mining and crowdsourcing in vulnerability Reduction. Proceedings of WAMS, Istanbul, September.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation Fidelity'' is used to describe the accuracy of a simulation and how closely it imitates the real-life counterpart. Fidelity is broadly classified as one of three categories: low, medium, and high. Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation, but the following generalizations can be made:
* Low – the minimum simulation required for a system to respond to accept inputs and provide outputs
* Medium – responds automatically to stimuli, with limited accuracy
* High – nearly indistinguishable or as close as possible to the real system

Human in the loop simulations can include a computer simulation as a so-called ''synthetic environment''.{{refn|name=&quot;environment&quot;|1=[[Thales Group|Thales]] defines synthetic environment as &quot;the counterpart to simulated models of sensors, platforms and other active objects&quot; for &quot;the simulation of the external factors that affect them&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|website=Thalse|accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621052423/http://thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|archive-date=2006-06-21|title= Modelling, Simulation &amp; Synthetic Environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other vendors use the term for more visual, [[virtual reality]]-style simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic Environments|website=CAE|url= http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080122060652/http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml|archive-date=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Simulation in failure analysis'' refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This was the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.

==Computer simulation==
{{Main|Computer simulation}}
A computer simulation (or &quot;sim&quot;) is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, [[prediction]]s may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;/&gt;

Computer simulation has become a useful part of [[model (abstract)|modeling]] many natural systems in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]],&lt;ref&gt;For a popular research project in the field of [[biochemistry]] where &quot;computer simulation is particularly well suited to address these questions&quot;[http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main Folding@home - Main], see [[Folding@Home]].&lt;/ref&gt; and human systems in [[economics]] and [[social science]] (e.g., [[computational sociology]]) as well as in [[engineering]] to gain insight into the operation of those systems. A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of [[network traffic simulation]]. In such simulations, the [[model (abstract)|model]] behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.

Traditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a [[mathematical model]], which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative [[scenario]]s for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.

Several software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation, [[stochastic|stochastic modeling]], multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.

Modern usage of the term &quot;computer simulation&quot; may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.

===Computer science===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Emulator]] --&gt;

In [[computer science]], simulation has some specialized meanings: [[Alan Turing]] used the term &quot;simulation&quot; to refer to what happens when a [[Universal Turing machine|universal machine]] executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.mit.edu/manoli/turing/www/turing.html|title=Universal Turing Machine|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2019-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in [[theoretical computer science]] the term ''[[simulation preorder|simulation]]'' is a relation between [[state transition system]]s, useful in the study of [[operational semantics]].

Less theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In [[computer architecture]], a type of simulator, typically called an ''[[emulator]]'', is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see ''[[Computer architecture simulator]]'' and ''[[Platform virtualization]]''). For example, simulators have been used to debug a [[microprogram]] or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer's operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.

Simulators may also be used to interpret [[fault tree]]s, or test [[VLSI]] logic designs before they are constructed. [[Symbolic simulation]] uses variables to stand for unknown values.

In the field of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with [[evolutionary computation]] to optimize control strategies.

==Simulation in education and training==
{{Main|Adaptive educational hypermedia}}

Simulation is extensively used for educational purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2020-09-27|title=Words of advice: teaching enzyme kinetics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.15537|journal=The FEBS Journal|doi=10.1111/febs.15537|pmid=32981225|issn=1742-464X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is used for cases where it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a &quot;safe&quot; virtual environment yet living a [[lifelike experience]] (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.

Simulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real-world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. [[Seymour Papert]] was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most well-known microworlds.

[[Project Management Simulation]] is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for [[project management]] training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidovitch, L.|author2=A. Parush|author3=A.

''Social simulations'' may be used in social science classrooms to illustrate social and political processes in anthropology, economics, history, political science, or sociology courses, typically at the high school or university level. These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events. An example of the latter would be [[Barnard College]]'s ''Reacting to the Past'' series of historical educational games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/reacting/ &quot;Reacting to the Past Home Page&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416225730/http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/reacting/ |date=2009-04-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]] has also supported the creation of [[reacting games]] that address science and math education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/reactingscience/ &quot;Reacting to the Past: STEM Games&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; In social media simulations, participants train communication with critics and other stakeholders in a private environment.

In recent years, there has been increasing use of social simulations for staff training in aid and development agencies. The Carana simulation, for example, was first developed by the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and is now used in a very revised form by the [[World Bank]] for training staff to deal with fragile and conflict-affected countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paxsims.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/carana/ &quot;Carana,&quot; at 'PaxSims' blog, 27 January 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

Military uses for simulation often involve aircraft or armoured fighting vehicles, but can also target small arms and other weapon systems training. Specifically, virtual firearms ranges have become the norm in most military training processes and there is a significant amount of data to suggest this is a useful tool for armed professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kratzig|first=Gregory|date=March 2013|title=Simulated Pistol Training: The Future of Law Enforcement Training?|url=https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/9365737/50222postpub.pdf|journal=International Police Training Journal|volume=Issue 5|pages=5–7}} (pages missing)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common user interaction systems for virtual simulations ==
Virtual simulations represent a specific category of simulation that utilizes simulation equipment to create a simulated world for the user. Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) .&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&amp;CA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sherman, W.R. |author2=Craig, A.B. |title=Understanding Virtual Reality |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=San Francisco, CA |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55860-353-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] for the user.

===Virtual simulation input hardware===
[[File:Simuladormotocicleta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Motorcycle]] simulator of ''Bienal do Automóvel'' exhibition, in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]
There is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:

'''Body tracking''': The [[motion capture]] method is often used to record the user's movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.
* [[Mo-cap suit|Capture suits]] and/or gloves may be used to capture movements of users body parts. The systems may have sensors incorporated inside them to sense movements of different body parts (e.g., fingers). Alternatively, these systems may have exterior tracking devices or marks that can be detected by external ultrasound, optical receivers or electromagnetic sensors. Internal inertial sensors are also available on some systems. The units may transmit data either wirelessly or through cables.
* [[Eye tracker]]s can also be used to detect eye movements so that the system can determine precisely where a user is looking at any given instant.
'''Physical controllers''': Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.
* [[Omnidirectional treadmill]]s can be used to capture the users locomotion as they walk or run.
* High fidelity instrumentation such as instrument panels in virtual aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls to raise the level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual [[global positioning system]] controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device in the context of the integrated cockpit system.
'''Voice/sound recognition''': This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.
* Users may use headsets with boom microphones, lapel microphones or the room may be equipped with strategically located microphones.

====Current research into user input systems====
Research in future input systems holds a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as [[brain–computer interface]]s (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2007.906956 |pmid=18198704 |author=Leeb, R. |author2=Lee, F. |author3=Keinrath, C. |author4=Schere, R. |author5=Bischof, H. |author6=Pfurtscheller, G. |title=Brain-Computer Communication: Motivation, Aim, and Impact of Exploring a Virtual Apartment |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=473–481 |year=2007 |s2cid=19998029 |url=http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vr/Projects/PRESENCCIA/Public/presenccia_pub/sharedDocuments/presenccia_publications/Publications/wp4/tug/0221.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that naïve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.

===Virtual simulation output hardware===
There is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver a stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:

In times of [[war]] or political tension, satellite states sometimes serve as [[Buffer zone|buffers]] between an enemy country and the nation exerting control over the satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Alan |title=Stalin and Stalinism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvxtVk0XMpgC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62 |format= |accessdate=2009-09-10 |year=2005 |origyear=1990 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-30732-1 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Satellite state&quot; is one of several contentious terms used to describe the (alleged) subordination of one state to another.  Other such terms include [[puppet state]] and [[Neocolonialism|neo-colony]]. In general, the term &quot;satellite state&quot; implies deep ideological and military allegiance to the hegemonic power, whereas &quot;puppet state&quot; implies political and military dependence, and &quot;neo-colony&quot; implies (often abject) economic dependence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}  Depending on which aspect of dependence is being emphasised, a state may fall into more than one category. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Soviet satellite states ==

=== Interwar period ===
When the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921]] broke out, Mongolian revolutionaries expelled [[Russia]]n [[White Movement|White Guards]] (during the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917–1923 following the [[Communist]] [[October Revolution]] of 1917) from [[Mongolia]], with the assistance of the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The revolution also officially ended Manchurian sovereignty over Mongolia, which had existed since 1691. Although the [[theocratic]] [[Bogd Khanate of Mongolia]] still nominally continued, with successive series of violent struggles, Soviet influence got ever stronger, and after the death of the [[Bogd Khaan]] (&quot;Great Khan&quot;, or &quot;Emperor&quot;), the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] was proclaimed on November 26, 1924. A nominally independent and sovereign country, it has been described as being a satellite state of the Soviet Union in the years from 1924 until 1990.&lt;ref name=Sik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Japan&gt;{{cite book|pages=13, 66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGQMKex16AsC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia: 1895–1945|isbn=978-0-7007-1482-7|author1=Narangoa|first1=Li|last2=Cribb|first2=Robert B|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Russian Civil War, the Soviet Red Army troops took [[Tuva]] in January 1920, which had also been part of the Qing Empire of China and a [[protectorate]] of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. The [[Tuvan People's Republic]], was proclaimed independent in 1921 and was a satellite state of Soviet Union until its annexation in 1944 by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Japan /&gt;

Another early Soviet satellite state in [[Asia]] was the short-lived [[Far East Republic]] in Siberia.&lt;ref name=Japan /&gt;

=== Post-World War II ===
At the end of [[World War II]], most eastern and central European countries were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig69&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with the Soviet Union made up what is sometimes called the [[Soviet Empire]]. The Soviets remained in these countries after the war's end.&lt;ref name=&quot;rao280&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rao|2006|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of coalition governments including [[Communist parties]], and then a forced liquidation of coalition members disliked by the Soviets, [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] systems were established in each country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rao280&quot; /&gt; Stalinists gained control of existing governments, police, press and radio outlets in these countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;rao280&quot; /&gt; Soviet satellite states in [[Europe]] included:&lt;ref name=&quot;rao280&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Langley&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Langley|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Merkl&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Merkl|2004|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rajagopal&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rajagopal|2003|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] (Satellite 1944–1960; government extant until 1992)
* The [[Polish People's Republic]] (1944–1989)
* The [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] (1946–1990)
* The [[People's Republic of Romania]] (1947–1965)
* The [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1948–1989)
* The [[German Democratic Republic]] (1949–1990)
* The [[Hungarian People's Republic]] (1949–1989)

The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] is sometimes referred to as a Soviet satellite,&lt;ref name=&quot;rao280&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Langley&quot; /&gt; though it broke from Soviet orbit in the 1948 [[Tito-Stalin split]], with the [[Cominform]] offices being moved from [[Belgrade]] to [[Bucharest]], and Yugoslavia subsequently formed the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], under the leadership of Stalinist [[Enver Hoxha]], broke ties with the Soviet Union in the 1960 [[Soviet–Albanian split]] following the Soviet [[de-Stalinization]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;olsen19&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries were, at least between 1945 and 1948, all members of the [[Eastern Bloc]].

The [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] can also be considered a Soviet satellite; from 1978 until 1992, the central government in [[Kabul]] was aligned with the Eastern Bloc, and was directly supported by Soviet military [[Soviet–Afghan War|between 1979 and 1989]]. The short-lived [[Second East Turkestan Republic|East Turkestan Republic]] (1944–1949) was a Soviet satellite until [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|it was absorbed into]] the [[People's Republic of China]] along with the rest of [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Mongolian People's Republic]] was a Soviet satellite from 1924 to 1991. It was so tightly controlled by the Soviet Union that it ceased to exist in February 1992, less than two months after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

== Post-Cold War use of the term ==
Some commentators have expressed concern that United States military and diplomatic interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere might lead, or perhaps have already led, to the existence of American satellite states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/news@antic.org/msg10704.html|title=[news] Serbia Accuses US Of Wanting To Create Satellite State Out Of Kosovo|website=www.mail-archive.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125638/https://www.mail-archive.com/news@antic.org/msg10704.html|archivedate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=finkelstein&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101128045212/http://www.stateofnature.org/normanFinkelstein.html On Israel: An Interview with Norman Finkelstein], by  Jon Bailes &amp; Cihan Aksan; published Autumn 2008; via [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Pfaff]] has warned that a permanent American presence in [[Iraq]] would &quot;turn Iraq into an American satellite state&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p09s01-coop.htm|title=How to silence that Iran war drumbeat|last=Cooley|first=John|date=June 18, 2008|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has also been used in the past to describe the relationship between [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]], as Syria has been accused of intervening in Lebanese political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/01/26/lebanon/index.html|title=Who killed Elie Hobeika?|last=Wachter|first=Paul|date=January 26, 2002|work=Salon|accessdate=2009-11-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523065854/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/01/26/lebanon/index.html|archivedate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Eswatini]] and [[Lesotho]] have both been described as satellite states of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamrava2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehran Kamrava|title=Understanding Comparative Politics: A Framework for Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtiFy3vlufYC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-77304-1|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribute in Light in 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|In 2010, as seen from [[Brooklyn]].]]
The '''''Tribute in Light''''' is an art installation created in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=godark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/will-the-tribute-in-light-go-dark-after-08/|newspaper=New York Times|title=Will ''Tribute in Light'' Go Dark After '08?|date=September 11, 2007|first=Sewell|last=Chan|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of 88 vertical [[searchlight]]s arranged in two columns of light to represent the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]]. It stands six blocks south of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] on top of the Battery Parking Garage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tribute in Light|url=https://www.911memorial.org/tribute-light|website= 9/11 Memorial|publisher= National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|accessdate= June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]]. ''Tribute in Light'' began as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002, but it became an annual event, currently produced on September 11 by the [[Municipal Art Society]] of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|publisher=Creative Time, Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=https://www.mas.org/programs/tribute-in-light/|website=mas.org|publisher=The Municipal Art Society of New York|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribute in Light was conceived by artists John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian LaVerdiere, and Paul Myoda, and lighting consultant Paul Marantz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tribute in Light {{!}} National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|url=https://www.911memorial.org/visit/memorial/tribute-light|access-date=2020-08-14|website=www.911memorial.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On clear nights, the lights can be seen from over {{Convert|60|mi}} away, visible in all of [[New York City]] and most of suburban [[North Jersey|Northern New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]]. The lights can also be seen in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], as well as [[Westchester County|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties in [[New York State|New York]].{{cn|date=June 2020}}

The two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0.11 per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]) to run for 24 hours. The 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) each consume 7,000 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaban|first1=Matt|title=The End of Tribute in Light: Memorial Goes Dark Forever on 9/12|url=http://observer.com/2011/08/the-end-of-tribute-in-light-memorial-goes-dark-forever-on-912/|website=observer.com|publisher=Observer|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the annual cost for the entire project was about half a million dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/9-11-10-years-on/5572219/9-11-light-tribute-still-dazzles-future-cloudy|title=9/11 light tribute still dazzles; future cloudy|last=Caruso|first=David B.|date=2011-09-07|work=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=2019-01-27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New York City|COVID-19 pandemic]] and the need for [[social distancing]], it was originally announced that the installation would not light up on the 19th anniversary of the attacks in September 2020, for the first time since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=9/11 Tribute Lights Won’t Be Projected Into Sky This Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/nyregion/911-tribute-lights.html |accessdate=14 August 2020 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Governor Andrew Cuomo later announced that the state would provide health care personnel and supervision to allow the tribute to be held as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Governor Cuomo announces NYC's annual 9/11 light tribute is back on|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyc-september-11-twin-towers-light-tribute-back-on-cuomo-says-2020-08-15/|access-date=2020-08-15|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tribute in Light, 2018 (10092).jpg|thumb|''Tribute in Light'' set up atop Battery Parking Garage in 2018]]
After the September 11 attacks, John Englehart conceived the idea of using lights for remembrance. His and other efforts were merged under the umbrella of the [[Municipal Art Society]] and [[Creative Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|title=Tribute In Light – The Municipal Art Society of New York|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172813/http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|archive-date=August 25, 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tribute in Light'' initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and it ran again on September 11, 2003, to mark the second anniversary of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year,&lt;ref name=&quot;godark&quot; /&gt; but the tribute was continued in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NY1.com|title=September 11th Tribute Lights Up Again|url=http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx&quot;|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914135857/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx|archivedate=September 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but it continued in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/tribute-in-light-will-keep-shining-this-year-and-the-next//|newspaper=New York Times|title='Tribute in Light' Will Keep Shining, This Year and the Next|date=September 10, 2010|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, plans were underway for the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Ted|title='Tribute' Handover|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443437504577545520666491842|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lights are produced by an Italian company named Space Cannon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacecannonsne.it/|title=Home - Spacecannon SNe - Excellence in the lighting field|website=spacecannon SNe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sends a team every year to help with the installation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; A [[Las Vegas]]-based company, Light America, was also part of the team who implemented the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/world-trade-center-memorial-has-local-connection/79318001|title=World Trade Center Memorial Has Local Connection|date=2002-03-12|website=LASVEGASNOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, about 30 technicians, electricians, and stagehands work for about ten days to install the lights. During a testing phase of several days, observers in Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey, and uptown Manhattan help make sure that the beams are adjusted accurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The project was originally going to be named ''Towers of Light'', but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm|title=Tribute in light to New York victims|accessdate=April 27, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent fixture of the ''Tribute in Light'' was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of [[One World Trade Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Tower rendering Time-lapse|url=http://www.wtc.com/media/videos|publisher=Silverstein Properties Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOM Freedom Tower Fact Sheet|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/content/pdfs/freedom_tower_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not included in the finished design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design changes to base, spire of 1 World Trade Center|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|publisher=Fox New York|accessdate=March 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317171748/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|archivedate=March 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the generators that power ''Tribute in Light'' have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevill|first1=Kris|title=Tri-State Biodiesel fuels Sept. 11 memorial|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2726/tri-state-biodiesel-fuels-sept.-11-memorial/|publisher=Biodiesel Magazine|accessdate=September 12, 2017|date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on birds==
The [[light pollution]] from ''Tribute in Light'' has caused confusion for over a million migrating birds, trapping them in the beams.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Doren|first=Benjamin M.|last2=Horton|first2=Kyle G.|last3=Dokter|first3=Adriaan M.|last4=Klinck|first4=Holger|last5=Elbin|first5=Susan B.|last6=Farnsworth|first6=Andrew|date=2017-10-02|title=High-intensity urban light installation dramatically alters nocturnal bird migration|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/09/26/1708574114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=42|language=en|pages=11175–11180|doi=10.1073/pnas.1708574114|pmid=28973942|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5651764}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this effect, the lights are switched off for 20-minute periods to allow the birds to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8005051/10000-birds-trapped-in-Twin-Towers-memorial-light.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|title=10000 birds trapped in Twin Towers memorial light|date=September 15, 2010 | accessdate=Sep 15, 2010|location=London|first=Nick|last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure the lights do not affect migrating birds, the Municipal Art Society works with the [[New York City Audubon]] on the illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110818/FREE/110819880|publisher=Crain's|title=Tribute in Light seeks funders|date=August 18, 2011 | first=Emily | last=Laermer | accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found that the installation &quot;dramatically altered multiple behaviors of nocturnally migrating birds—but these effects disappeared when lights were extinguished&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/science/september-11-tribute-lights-birds.html|title=Yearly 9/11 Tribute Shows Light Pollution's Effects on Birds|last=Quenqua|first=Douglas|date=2017-10-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
''Tribute in Light'' was featured in [[Boyz II Men]]'s music video for &quot;Color of Love&quot;. It made a notable appearance during the opening credits of [[Spike Lee]]'s 2002 film ''[[25th Hour]]''. The tribute was also shown and referenced in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.
These lights were featured in the music video of [[U2]]'s &quot;[[You're the Best Thing About Me]]&quot;.

The [[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|video game adaptation]] of the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' features the lights at the approximate location of the WTC site.

'''Siegmund''' ('''Sigismund''') '''Freiherr von Herberstein'''&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or Baron '''Sigismund von Herberstein'''; 23 August 1486 – 28 March 1566) was a [[Carniola]]n diplomat, writer, historian and member of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] Imperial Council. He was most noted for his extensive writing on the geography, history and customs of [[Russia]], and contributed greatly to early Western European knowledge of that area.

==Early life==
Herberstein was born in 1486 in [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] ({{lang-de|Wippach}}) in the [[Duchy of Carniola]], now in [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. His parents were Leonhard von Herberstein and Barbara von Lueg, members of the prominent German-speaking family which had already resided in Herberstein Castle for nearly 200 years. Little is known of his early life apart from the fact that he became familiar with the [[Slovene language]] spoken in the region. This knowledge became significant later in his life.

In 1499 he entered the [[University of Vienna]] to study philosophy and law. In 1506 he entered the army as an officer and served in a number of campaigns. In 1508 he was knighted by the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], in person. In 1515 he entered the Imperial council, or Parliament, and began a long and illustrious diplomatic career.

==Diplomatic career==
Between 1515 and 1553, Herberstein carried out approximately 69 missions abroad, travelling throughout much of Europe, including [[Turkey]]. He was feted by the ruling [[Habsburg]]s and rewarded with titles and estates. He was twice sent to [[Russia]] as ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor, in 1517 to attempt to arrange a truce between Russia and [[Lithuania]], and  in 1526 to renew a treaty between the two signed in 1522. These extended visits (nine months in his 1517 visit) provided him with the opportunity to study a hitherto largely unknown Russian society.

==Writing on Russia==
[[File:Moscovia.png|thumb|300px|Engraving from the book Sigmund Herberstein. Ambassadors present gifts the Tsar of Muscovy]]
Herberstein's knowledge of [[Slovene language|Slovene]], acquired in his youth, allowed him to communicate freely with Russians, as Slovene and [[Russian language|Russian]] both belong to the [[Slavic languages]]. He used this ability to question a variety of people in Russia on a wide range of topics. This gave him an insight into Russia and Russians unavailable to the few previous visitors to Russia. 

He probably wrote his first account of life in Russia between 1517 and 1527, but no copy of this survives. In 1526, he was asked to produce a formal report on his experiences in Russia, but this remained relatively unnoticed in the archives until he was able to find time to revise and expand it, which he possibly started in the 1530s.

The evidence suggests that Herberstein was an energetic and capable ethnographer. He investigated in depth both by questioning locals and by critically examining the scarce existing literature on Russia. The result was his major work, a book written in Latin titled ''[[Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii]]'' (literally ''Notes on Muscovite Affairs''), published in 1549. This became the main early source of knowledge in Western Europe on Russia.

He was the first to record the spelling of ''[[tsar]]'' as ''czar'' (both spellings are meant to express the same pronunciation). Later, English and French began to move from the 'cz' spelling to the 'ts' spelling in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;for the derivation of ''tsar'' and Herberstein's contribution of ''czar'', see the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition, entry on ''tsar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marwan Yousef Mohamed Rashid Lekrab al-Shehhi''' ({{lang-ar|مروان يوسف محمد رشيد لكراب الشحي}}, {{transl|ar|''Marwān Yūsuf Muḥammad Rashīd Lekrāb ash-Sheḥḥī''}}, also [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alshehhi''';&lt;ref&gt;Alternate forms of his name include Marwan Yusif Muhammad Rashid Al-Shehi, Marwan Yusif Muhammad Rashid Lakrab Al-Shihhi, and others. He was known to have used the alias Abu Abdullah.&lt;/ref&gt; 9 May 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=162|access-date=2016-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019203222/https://9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-19|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 11 September 2001) was the hijacker-pilot of [[United Airlines Flight 175]], crashing the [[Boeing 767]] into the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Al-Shehhi was a student from the [[United Arab Emirates]] who moved to Germany in 1996 and soon became close friends with [[Mohamed Atta]], [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], forming the [[Hamburg cell]]. Together, after pledging their lives to martyrdom, they became the leaders of the September 11 attacks. In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Jarrah, and bin al-Shibh traveled to terrorist training camps in [[Afghanistan]] and met with [[Osama bin Laden]] who recruited the four Hamburg cell members for the attacks in the United States. He arrived in the [[United States]] in May 2000, one month before Atta. Atta, Al-Shehhi, and Jarrah had been trained as pilots in [[Florida]] at [[Huffman Aviation]], receiving their [[Commercial Pilot Licence|commercial pilot licenses]] in December 2000 and January 2001 from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]].

Al-Shehhi spent his time making preparations for the attack itself, such as meeting with crucial [[Planning of the September 11 attacks|planners]] abroad, assisting with the arrival of hijackers aboard the other flights, and travelling on surveillance flights determining details on how the hijacking would take place. On September 9, 2001, he traveled from [[Florida]] to [[Boston]], where he stayed at the Milner Hotel until September 11. After boarding [[United Airlines Flight 175]] at [[Logan International Airport]], al-Shehhi and 4 other hijackers waited 30 minutes into the flight to make their attack, which then allowed al-Shehhi to take over control as pilot, and at 9:03&amp;nbsp;a.m., 17 minutes after [[Mohamed Atta]] crashed [[American Airlines Flight 11]] into the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]], al-Shehhi crashed the [[Boeing 767#767-200|Boeing 767]] into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;ntsb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/foia/9_11/Flight_Path_Study_UA175.pdf|title=Flight Path Study - United Airlines Flight 175|accessdate=11 September 2014|work=National Transportation Safety Board|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023122449/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/foia/9_11/Flight_Path_Study_UA175.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-23|url-status=live|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 23 years of age, he was the youngest hijacker-pilot to participate in the attacks. The impact of the Boeing 767 operating as United 175 into the South Tower was seen live on television as it happened. At 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m., after 56 minutes of burning, the 110-story skyscraper collapsed, killing hundreds of people, including around 900 office workers and first responders.

On Odysseus's return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised tricks to delay her suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus's elderly father [[Laertes]] and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until [[Melantho]], a slave woman, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Thread: How Fabric Changed History|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2018|isbn=978-1-4736-5903-2|location=London|pages=11-12|oclc=1057250632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of her efforts to put off remarriage, Penelope is often seen as a symbol of connubial fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Mackail, ''Penelope in the Odyssey'' (Cambridge University Press, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; But because [[Athena]] wants her &quot;to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore&quot;, Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors (xviii.160–162). As Irene de Jong comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors’ desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to [[Telemachus]] (which she will indeed do).&lt;ref&gt;Irene de Jong. (2001). ''A Narratological commentary on the Odyssey'', p.&amp;nbsp;445. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Antoine Bourdelle - Pénélope 1912 - Montauban.jpg|thumb|left|''Penelope'', bronze by [[Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]]]]
She is ambivalent, variously asking [[Artemis]] to kill her and, apparently, considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. &quot;For the plot of the ''Odyssey'', of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Knox]]. (1996). ''Introduction to [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation of '''The Odyssey''''' p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether Penelope is aware that Odysseus is behind the disguise.  Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have intentionally started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity.  On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (perhaps excepting Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Steve, &quot;Penelope's ‘Early Recognition’ of Odysseus from a Neoanalytic and Oral Perspective,&quot; ''College Literature'' 38.2 (2011) 101-117. [https://www.academia.edu/30640742/Penelopes_Early_Recognition_of_Odysseus_from_a_Neoanalytic_and_Oral_Perspective Penelopes Early Recognition of Odysseus]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, but Odysseus does, and wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors—beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from Odysseus' cup—with help from Telemachus, Athena and two slaves, [[Eumaeus]] the [[swineherd]] and [[Philoetius]] the [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]]. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned—she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of [[Alcmene]]—and tests him by ordering her slave [[Euryclea|Eurycleia]] to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living [[olive tree]]. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is her husband, a moment that highlights their ''homophrosýnē'' (ὁμοφροσύνη, &quot;like-mindedness&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Norman|title=Archery at the Dark of the Moon: Poetic Problems in Homer's Odyssey|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer implies, that from then on, Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom and enjoying wide respect and much success.&lt;ref&gt;Lawall, Thalman, Patterson, James, Spacks. &quot;The Norton Anthology: Western Literature.&quot;[[The Odyssey]]&quot;. New York, London. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some early sources such as [[Pindar]], Pan's father is [[Apollo]] via Penelope.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Fr. 90 ([[Maurice Bowra|Bowra]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] (2.145), [[Cicero]] (''[[De Natura Deorum|ND]]'' 3.22.56), [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] (7.38) and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] (''[[Fabulae]]'' 224) all make Hermes and Penelope his parents. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.12.5 records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. 5th-century AD source ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' by [[Nonnus]] (14.92) names Penelope of [[Mantineia]] in Arcadia Pan's mother. Other sources ([[Duris of Samos]]; the Vergilian commentator [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 Footnote in the ''Library'' by Apollodorus (of Athens)], edited by E. Capps Ph.D, LL.D.; T. E. Page, Litt.D.; W. H. D. Rouse, Litt.d.; Webster Collection of Social Anthropology, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (Πάν) with the Greek word for &quot;all&quot; (πᾶν).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Pan]] provides the earliest example of this wordplay, suggesting that Pan's name was born from the fact that he delighted &quot;all&quot; the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Ring Penelope CdM Luynes 515.jpg|thumb|upright|Gold [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] ring, Syria, last quarter of the 5th century BC ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her—to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.&lt;ref&gt;But compare, for an unusual exception, the seated ''aulos'' player on the &quot;[[Ludovisi Throne]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin tradition==
Latin references to Penelope revolved around the sexual loyalty to her absent husband. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mactoux|first=Marie-Madeleine|title=Pénélope: Légende et Mythe|date=1975|publisher=Annales Litteraires de L'Universite de Basancon|location=Paris|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is mentioned by various classical authors including [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=Plautus|date=1968|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|location=London}} She is mentioned in the opening lines of the play Stychus&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Propertius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Propertius|title=Complete Elegies of Propertius|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford}}see Elegies 2.6; 2.9 and 3.12. Propertius was one of the few Latin authors to mention Penelope's weaving ruse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]] and [[Statius]].  The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by [[Saint Jerome]] among pagan women famed for their chastity.

==Modern adaptations==

Penelope is the subject and speaker of [[Margaret Atwood]]'s retelling of the ''Odyssey''. In the ''[[The Penelopiad|Penelopiad]]'', Atwood essentially tells the story (and backstory) of Homer's epic from Penelope's perspective; that said, Atwood's Penelope speaks in a very &quot;modern&quot;, dead-pan manner.

She is remembered in ''[[De Mulieribus Claris]]'', a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the [[Florence|Florentine]] author [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], composed in 1361{{endash}}62. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown_xi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Boccaccio |first=Giovanni |authorlink=Giovanni Boccaccio |year=2003 |translator=Virginia Brown |title=Famous Women |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |series=I Tatti Renaissance Library |volume=1 |isbn=0-674-01130-9 |p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penelope is a recurring character throughout the works of American novelist [[Madeline Miller]]. A former Latin and Greek teacher, Miller emphasizes Penelope’s intellectual brilliance and tactical politicking, while also examining the grim reality of her relationship with Odysseus after the end of The Odyssey. She appears briefly and early in Miller’s 2011 novel “The Song of Achilles,” alongside her cousin Helen, though their faces are veiled. She is viewed from a distance by the novel’s lead character [[Patroclus]], (lover and companion of [[Achilles]]), but does not speak. Odysseus mentions her often and glowingly over the course of the novel, including recounting the story of their first meeting and engagement - much to the recurring chagrin of most of the Greek army. 

Penelope also appears in Miller’s 2018 novel ''Circe'', which is a narrative biography of the titular witch, tracing her life from birth past the conclusion of both The Odyssey and the [[Telegony]]. Penelope is a major figure in the novel, but does not appear physically until its final quarter, fleeing Ithaca and arriving on Circe's island in the aftermath of her husband’s accidental death at the hands of [[Telegonus (son of Odysseus)|Telegonus]], son of Circe and an unknowing Odysseus. Also present is Penelope's son Telemachus, whom Circe initially suspects of seeking vengeance, but eventually falls in love with. The conclusion of the novel sees Penelope and Circe navigate the complexities of their relationship and ally against [[Athena]], who plans to take Telemachus away to serve as his fathers' successor. Penelope takes up witchcraft, and Circe’s mantle as Witch of Aeaea, (an idea she vastly prefers over returning to Sparta), and helps her son and daughter-in-law raise their daughters. Contrary to the plot of the Telegony, Penelope and Telegonus do not marry; instead, Miller appears to imply that Telegonus, now King of a new Greek colony in Italy, is in a relationship with his male Captain of the Guard, and would never marry.

In their performance ''Penelope Sleeps'' the Norwegian performance artist [[Mette Edvardsen]] and the composer Matteo Fargion are examining alternative scenarios for the mythological female role figure of Penelope by leveraging dream and action, voice and language, body and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penelope&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://staging.festwochen.kju.at/en/programme/programme/detail/penelope-sleeps/ |title=Mette Edvardsen, Matteo Fargion : Penelope Sleeps |website=staging.festwochen.kju.at/en/ |access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music theory]], an '''interval''' is the difference in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] between two sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Prout | first = Ebenezer | title=Harmony, Its Theory and Practice | publisher = London: Augener; Boston: Boston Music Co. | edition = 30th edition, revised and largely rewritten | year = 1903 | chapter = I-Introduction | page = 1 | isbn = 978-0781207836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An interval may be described as '''horizontal''', '''linear''', or '''melodic''' if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and '''vertical''' or '''harmonic''' if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a [[Chord (music)|chord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LindleyMarkCampbell&quot;&gt;{{GroveOnline |last=Lindley |first=Mark |last2=Campbell |first2=Murray |last3=Greated |first3=Clive |title=Interval}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Aldwell | first =  E | last2 = Schachter | first2 = C. | last3 = Cadwallader | first3 = A. |title = Harmony and Voice Leading | edition = 4th | chapter = Part 1: The Primary Materials and Procedures, Unit 1 | page = 8 | publisher = Schirmer | ISBN = 978-0495189756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture|Western]] music, intervals are most commonly differences between [[musical note|notes]] of a [[diatonic scale]]. The smallest of these intervals is a [[semitone]]. Intervals smaller than a semitone are called [[microtone]]s. They can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales. Some of the very smallest ones are called [[Comma (music)|comma]]s, and describe small discrepancies, observed in some [[tuning system]]s, between [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] notes such as C{{music|#}} and D{{music|flat}}. Intervals can be arbitrarily small, and even imperceptible to the human ear.

In physical terms, an interval is the [[Interval ratio|ratio]] between two sonic frequencies. For example, any two notes an octave apart have a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that successive increments of pitch by the same interval result in an exponential increase of frequency, even though the human ear perceives this as a linear increase in pitch. For this reason, intervals are often measured in [[Cent (music)|cents]], a unit derived from the [[logarithm]] of the frequency ratio.

In Western music theory, the most common naming scheme for intervals describes two properties of the interval: the [[Interval (music)#Quality|quality]] (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] (unison, second, third, etc.). Examples include the [[minor third]] or [[perfect fifth]]. These names identify not only the difference in semitones between the upper and lower notes, but also how the interval is [[enharmonic spelling|spelled]]. The importance of spelling stems from the historical practice of differentiating the frequency ratios of enharmonic intervals such as G–G{{music|#}} and G–A{{music|b}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Duffin | first = Ross W. | title=How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (and Why You Should Care) | publisher = W.

}}

The size of an interval (also known as its width or height) can be represented using two alternative and equivalently valid methods, each appropriate to a different context: frequency ratios or cents.

=== Frequency ratios ===
{{Main|Interval ratio}}

The size of an interval between two notes may be measured by the [[ratio]] of their [[frequency|frequencies]]. When a [[musical instrument]] is tuned using a [[just intonation]] tuning system, the size of the main intervals can be expressed by small-[[Integer number|integer]] ratios, such as 1:1 ([[unison]]), 2:1 ([[octave]]), 5:3 ([[major sixth]]), 3:2 ([[perfect fifth]]), 4:3 ([[perfect fourth]]), 5:4 ([[major third]]), 6:5 ([[minor third]]). Intervals with small-integer ratios are often called ''just intervals'', or ''pure intervals''.

Most commonly, however, musical instruments are nowadays tuned using a different tuning system, called [[12-tone equal temperament]]. As a consequence, the size of most equal-tempered intervals cannot be expressed by small-integer ratios, although it is very close to the size of the corresponding just intervals. For instance, an [[equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth has a frequency ratio of 2{{sup|{{frac|7|12}}}}:1, approximately equal to 1.498:1, or 2.997:2 (very close to 3:2). For a comparison between the size of intervals in different tuning systems, see {{Section link||Size of intervals used in different tuning systems}}.

=== Cents ===
{{Main|Cent (music)}}

The standard system for comparing interval sizes is with [[Cent (music)|cents]]. The cent is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] unit of measurement. If frequency is expressed in a [[logarithmic scale]], and along that scale the distance between a given frequency and its double (also called [[octave]]) is divided into 1200 equal parts, each of these parts is one cent. In twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] (12-TET), a tuning system in which all [[semitone]]s have the same size, the size of one semitone is exactly 100 cents. Hence, in 12-TET the cent can be also defined as one hundredth of a [[semitone]].

Mathematically, the size in cents of the interval from frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;n = 1200 \cdot \log_2 \left( \frac{f_2}{f_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Main intervals ==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of pitch intervals]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;

The table shows the most widely used conventional names for the intervals between the notes of a [[chromatic scale]]. A [[perfect unison]] (also known as perfect prime)&lt;ref name=prime&gt;&quot;Prime (ii). See Unison&quot; (from [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/53859 Prime]. ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford University Press. Accessed August 2013. {{subscription required}})&lt;/ref&gt; is an interval formed by two identical notes. Its size is zero [[Cent (music)|cents]]. A [[semitone]] is any interval between two adjacent notes in a chromatic scale, a [[whole tone]] is an interval spanning two semitones (for example, a [[major second]]), and a [[tritone]] is an interval spanning three tones, or six semitones (for example, an augmented fourth).{{efn|name=TritoneA4|The term [[tritone]] is sometimes used more strictly as a synonym of augmented fourth (A4).}} Rarely, the term [[ditone]] is also used to indicate an interval spanning two whole tones (for example, a [[major third]]), or more strictly as a synonym of major third.

Intervals with different names may span the same number of semitones, and may even have the same width. For instance, the interval from D to F{{Music|#}} is a [[major third]], while that from D to G{{Music|b}} is a [[diminished fourth]]. However, they both span 4 semitones. If the [[Musical instrument|instrument]] is tuned so that the 12 notes of the chromatic scale are equally spaced (as in [[equal temperament]]), these intervals also have the same width. Namely, all semitones have a width of 100 [[Cent (music)|cents]], and all intervals spanning 4 semitones are 400 cents wide.

The names listed here cannot be determined by counting semitones alone. The rules to determine them are explained below. Other names, determined with different naming conventions, are listed in [[Interval (music)#Alternative interval naming conventions|a separate section]]. Intervals [[#Minute intervals|smaller than one semitone]] (commas or microtones) and [[#Compound intervals|larger than one octave]] (compound intervals) are introduced below.

== Interval number and quality ==
[[File:Main intervals from C.png|thumb|450px|right|Main intervals from C. {{audio|Intervals.mid|Play}}]]

In Western [[music theory]], an interval is named according to its ''number'' (also called ''diatonic number'') and ''quality''. For instance, ''major third'' (or '''M3''') is an interval name, in which the term ''major'' ('''M''') describes the quality of the interval, and ''third'' ('''3''') indicates its number.

The number of an interval is the number of letter names or [[staff position]]s (lines and spaces) it encompasses, including the positions of both notes forming the interval. For instance, the interval C–G is a fifth (denoted '''P5''') because the notes from C to the G above it encompass five letter names (C, D, E, F, G) and occupy five consecutive staff positions, including the positions of C and G. The [[#Main intervals|table]] and the figure above show intervals with numbers ranging from 1 (e.g., '''P1''') to 8 (e.g., '''P8'''). Intervals with larger numbers are called [[Interval (music)#Compound intervals|compound intervals]].

There is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between staff positions and diatonic-scale [[Degree (music)|degrees]] (the notes of  [[diatonic scale]]).{{efn|name=diatonic|
The expression [[diatonic scale]] is herein strictly defined as a [[Heptatonic scale|7-tone scale]], which is either a sequence of successive [[natural note]]s (such as the C-[[major scale]], C–D–E–F–G–A–B, or the A-[[minor scale]], A–B–C–D–E–F–G) or any [[transposition (music)|transposition]] thereof. In other words, a scale that can be written using seven consecutive notes without [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] with a conventional [[key signature]], or with no signature. This includes, for instance, the [[Major scale|major]] and the [[Natural minor scale|natural minor]] scales, but does not include some other seven-tone scales, such as the [[Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]] and the [[Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor]] scales (see also [[Diatonic and chromatic]]).}}
This means that interval numbers can be also determined by counting diatonic scale degrees, rather than staff positions, provided that the two notes that form the interval are drawn from a diatonic scale. Namely, C–G is a fifth because in any diatonic scale that contains C and G, the sequence from C to G includes five notes. For instance, in the A{{music|flat}}-[[Major scale|major]] diatonic scale, the five notes are C–D{{music|flat}}–E{{music|flat}}–F–G (see figure). This is not true for all kinds of scales. For instance, in a [[chromatic scale]], the notes from C to G are eight (C–C{{music|sharp}}–D–D{{music|sharp}}–E–F–F{{music|sharp}}–G). This is the reason interval numbers are also called ''diatonic numbers'', and this convention is called ''diatonic numbering''.

If one adds any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s to the notes that form an interval, by definition the notes do not change their staff positions. As a consequence, any interval has the same interval number as the corresponding [[Natural (music)|natural]] interval, formed by the same notes without accidentals. For instance, the intervals C–G{{music|sharp}} (spanning 8 semitones) and C{{music|sharp}}–G (spanning 6 semitones) are fifths, like the corresponding natural interval C–G (7 semitones).

Notice that interval numbers represent an inclusive count of encompassed staff positions or note names, not the difference between the endpoints. In other words, one starts counting the lower pitch as one, not zero. For that reason, the interval C–C, a perfect unison, is called a prime (meaning &quot;1&quot;), even though there is no difference between the endpoints. Continuing, the interval C–D is a second, but D is only one staff position, or diatonic-scale degree, above C. Similarly, C–E is a third, but E is only two staff positions above C, and so on. As a consequence, joining two intervals always yields an interval number one less than their sum. For instance, the intervals C–E and E–G are thirds, but joined together they form a fifth (C–G), not a sixth. Similarly, a stack of three thirds, such as C–E, E–G, and G–B, is a seventh (C–B), not a ninth.

This scheme applies to intervals up to an octave (12 semitones). For larger intervals, see {{format link|#Compound intervals}} below.

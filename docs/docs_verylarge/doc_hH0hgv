'''Psyche''' are a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Dark wave|dark]] [[synthpop]] band, now based in Germany. They are centered on singer [[Darrin Huss]], who has been the only constant member, with various line-ups including his brother [[Stephen Huss (musician)|Stephen Huss]], later followed by [[David Kristian]], Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Remi Szyszka, all recording albums with Darrin under the name Psyche.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/psyche-mn0000369211/biography &quot;Psyche&quot;]. ''AllMusic'' biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
Psyche was formed by brothers [[Darrin C. Huss|Darrin]] and [[Stephen Huss (musician)|Stephen Huss]]&lt;ref name=the-record&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.psyche-hq.de/waterloo.html | author=Schneider, Jason | title=Psyche ahead of its time | publisher=The Record .com | date=July 5, 2001  | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], named after the B-Side of [[Killing Joke]]'s ''Wardance'' single as well as being chosen for the meaning of the word. The band's debut performance was on December 13, 1982 with [[Dwayne Goettel]] on additional keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canpopencyclopedia.home.blog/p/ &quot;Psyche&quot;]. Jamie Vernon's Canadian Pop Music Encyclopedia. (archived from [http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/P/Psyche.html the original)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period, Psyche performed bizarre live shows wherein Darrin performed nude (except for being covered in shaving cream) while talk-singing and shouting over the music. The performance idea was prompted by pictures seen of [[Fad Gadget]] in British Music magazines.

While demos were recorded during the collaboration with Dwayne Goettel, no albums were released until 1985's ''Insomnia Theatre'', after Goettel's departure.

===Early years===
After ''Insomnia Theatre'' achieved moderate success in Europe, Psyche signed with New Rose Records in Paris.&lt;ref name=murray&gt;[https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/music/psyche-reunites-with-long-lost-electronic-friends-and-fans-in-9910-concert &quot;Psyche reunites with long-lost electronic friends and fans in 9910 concert&quot;]. ''Edmonton Journal'', Tom Murray, July 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; They released two singles followed by a studio album, ''Unveiling the Secret'', in 1986.&lt;ref name=the-record/&gt; To promote the record, Psyche performed as the opening act for [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], at [[Élysée Montmartre]] in Paris, then as headliners on their own European tour.

After the release of their third studio album, ''Mystery Hotel'', Stephen Huss was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and took a hiatus from the group. During this period Darrin began collaborating with [[David Kristian]], leading to a new album, ''The Influence'', in 1989. This album introduced new elements to Psyche's sound, with samples created by Kristian, and being performed entirely on the [[Casio FZ1]]. The songs &quot;Misery&quot;, and &quot;Haunted&quot; began Psyche's shift to the [[dark wave]] music scene.

A visit home to Waterloo in 1991 reunited the Huss brothers and, the subsequent recording sessions produced 1991's ''Daydream Avenue''. Though Psyche returned to tour Europe with German keyboardist Johannes Haeusler in support of English poetic artist [[Anne Clark (poet)|Anne Clark]], Stephen Huss stayed behind in Canada because of his illness.

In 1994, the album ''Intimacy'', produced in collaboration with Joseph Watt (of Razormaid) was released, along with a companion EP of dance numbers, ''Private Desires'', which featured a cover of [[Soft Cell]]'s classic ''[[Sex Dwarf]]''. The group embarked on a small German tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zitty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpsjAQAAIAAJ|volume=Volume 18, Issues 4-6|year=1994|publisher=Zitty Verlag GmbH|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stephen Huss remained in Canada, leaving Darrin to find new collaborators in Germany.

===Crossover success===
After another hiatus while Darrin took part in side projects, Psyche resumed activities in 1996 with Per-Anders Kurenbach joining as a new member. The first single release was &quot;You Ran Away&quot; with a cover version of [[Goodbye Horses]] by [[Q Lazzarus]] as the B-Side. This cover version became a permanent staple in Psyche's live repertoire, as well as being included on the album ''Strange Romance'', which took a musical shift toward an accessible, upbeat pop sound. 

After playing for the first time in [[Oslo, Norway]] and a return to Sweden, Psyche released a live video featuring highlights from their ''Strange Romance'' Tour. In 1998 the group signed with the StrangeWays label out of [[Hamburg]], Germany, and released their eighth album, ''Love Among the Ruined'', which included some experimental pop music.

At the beginning of 2000, Psyche signed to [[Artoffact Records]] of Toronto, Canada. The release of ''Misguided Angels'' contained material from 1983 through 2000 as a re-introduction of Psyche back on their original continent. It contained the last material from Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Darrin as well as some lesser-known mixes. By this point the partnership was dissolved, and Darrin began the next decade of music with Remi Szyszka as his collaborator in Psyche.

The new line-up made its debut on Accession Records with the single, ''Sanctuary'', released in April 2001. After a series of concerts in both Europe and North America, a ninth studio album ''The Hiding Place'' was released and well-received, charting at fourth place in the year-end Top 100 of the German Alternative Charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djcharts.de/jahrescharts2001/DACAlben.html ''DJ Charts - Denmark'']&lt;/ref&gt; To capitalize on this success, a remix album entitled ''Endangered Species'' was released mid-2002. A series of live performances followed in 2003, along with the release of ''Babylon Deluxe'', which appeared in the German Alternative Top Ten.

''The 11th Hour'', Psyche's 11th album, featured the return of previous collaborator Per-Anders Kurenbach, but including a farewell track with Remi Szyszka, and a guest appearance by Christian Wirsig. ''The 11th Hour'' was released through Accession Records in Europe, Metropolis Records in North America, and Irond Records in Russia making it the widest release in the band's history. The album topped the German Alternative Charts (DAC).

In 2006, as the band neared its 25-year mark, a DVD collection documenting Psyche's appearances in every incarnation from 1983–2005 was released. Titled ''Imaginary Life'', its 23 tracks included at least one song from each of the previous albums released. It contains music videos and performances beginning with &quot;The Crawler&quot; on an Edmonton TV station in 1983 through to 2005, an audio commentary track, and a backstage interview with the Huss brothers in Sweden after their debut concert in Gothenburg in 1988.

Following ''The 11th Hour'', Psyche shifted their focus to touring rather than recording, playing shows and festivals across Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. While no new studio albums were recorded, the band released remix albums (''Unveiling the Secret 2.0'', ''Until The Shadows'', ''Halloween EP''), compilations of old and unreleased materials (''Re-Membering Dwayne'', ''Unknown Treasures'', ''As The Brain Collapses'', ''Rare Mixes &amp; B-Sides''), several live albums, and some re-releases of early albums.

In 2011, Psyche releases a cover album, &quot;Unknown Treasures&quot;, that includes re interpretations of songs by The Cure, The Doors, Depeche Mode or Visage. In 2012, they released the &quot;All Things Pass Into The Night&quot; EP which included a re-recorded extended version of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; on the [[Optimo]] Label.  Also in 2012 Psyche released an updated version of &quot;The Influence&quot; album on Italian label Final Muzik, with new interpretations of the songs &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;The Sundial&quot;, and &quot;Salvation Stranger&quot; as well as once again &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; as &quot;Immortality Mix&quot;.

2014 saw a collaboration with [[Rational Youth]] resulting in an electronic interpretation of [[AC/DC]]'s hit &quot;[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]&quot; being released in three different coloured vinyl 7&quot; singles on [[Artoffact Records]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/rational_youth_psyche-thunderstruck_acdc_cover_underrated 'Rational Youth &amp; Psyche &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; (AC/DC cover) / &quot;Underrated&quot; ']. ''Exclaim!'', by Alex Hudson,  Nov 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Psyche collaborated with Belgian artist LUMINANCE on two songs written by LUMINANCE and sung by Darrin Huss as PSYCHE on a limited coloured vinyl 7&quot; release on [[Artoffact Records]] in 2015.

Also in the same year, continuing with Artoffact Records, Psyche began re-releasing their 80s material starting with the 30th anniversary edition of their first 12&quot; single &quot;Thundershowers (In Ivory Towers) which was originally from 1985.

===Recent work===
In July 2016, the first three albums ''Insomnia Theatre'' (1985), ''Unveiling the Secret'' (1986/1987), and ''Mystery Hotel'' (1988) were digitally remastered and re-released as double albums including archival bonus tracks, plus related singles, and mixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.side-line.com/first-3-psyche-albums-re-released-with-lots-of-extra-rare-material-we-talked-with-darrin-huss/ &quot;First 3 Psyche albums re-released with lots of extra rare material – we talked with Darrin Huss&quot;]. ''Side=Line'', By Bernard Van Isacker. May 12,2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Psyche released their first new original song &quot;Youth of Tomorrow&quot; as a video on Halloween, 2017. A 12&quot; single followed early 2018 making it their first new release in 13 years.

After some European dates, Psyche returned to Canada for their first official tour of their home country since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

'''Amalthea''' {{IPAc-en|æ|m|əl|ˈ|θ|iː|ə}} is a [[moons of Jupiter|moon of Jupiter]]. It has the third closest orbit around [[Jupiter]] among known moons and was the fifth moon of Jupiter to be discovered, so it is also known as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter V}}'''. [[Edward Emerson Barnard]] discovered the moon on 9 September 1892 and named it after [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] of Greek mythology.{{sfn|Barnard|1892}} It was the last [[natural satellite]] to be discovered by direct visual observation; all later moons were discovered by [[astronomical photography|photographic]] or [[digital imaging]].

Amalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the [[Rings of Jupiter#Amalthea gossamer ring|Amalthea Gossamer Ring]] which is formed from dust ejected from its surface.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}} Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter from its surface.{{efn|name=stub2}} Amalthea is the largest of the [[inner satellites of Jupiter]] and is irregularly shaped and reddish in color. It is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

Close range images of Amalthea were taken in 1979 by the [[Voyager program|''Voyager 1'' and ''2'']] spacecraft, and in more detail by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' orbiter]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

==History==

=== Discovery ===
[[File:Amalthea Voyager-1.png|thumb|upright|left|''Voyager 1'' color image of Amalthea (1979)]]

Amalthea was discovered on 9 September 1892 by [[Edward Emerson Barnard]] using the [[James Lick telescope|36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope]] at [[Lick Observatory]].{{sfn|Barnard|1892}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Observatory1894&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Lick Observatory|title=A Brief Account of the Lick Observatory of the University of California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbA2AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA7-PA27|year=1894|publisher=The University Press|page=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) and was the first new satellite of Jupiter since [[Galileo Galilei]]'s discovery of the [[Galilean satellites]] in 1610.&lt;ref name=Bakich_2000/&gt;

===Name===
Amalthea is named after the [[nymph]] [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] from [[Greek mythology]], who nursed the infant [[Zeus]] (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter) with [[goat's milk]].&lt;ref name=gazetteer_names/&gt; Its [[Roman numeral]] designation is {{nowrap|Jupiter V}}. The name &quot;Amalthea&quot; was not formally adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] until 1976,&lt;ref name=Blunck_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=IAU_1975/&gt; although it had been in informal use for many decades. The name was initially suggested by [[Camille Flammarion]].{{sfn|Flammarion|1893}} Before 1976, Amalthea was most commonly known simply as {{nowrap|Jupiter V}}.{{sfn|Simonelli|1983}}

== Orbit ==

Amalthea orbits [[Jupiter]] at a distance of 181&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km (2.54&amp;nbsp;Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.003 and an [[inclination]] of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter.{{sfn|Cooper Murray et al.|2006}} Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an [[inner satellite]] and can be explained by the influence of the innermost [[Galilean satellites|Galilean satellite]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]: in the past Amalthea has passed through several [[orbital resonance|mean-motion resonances]] with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like ''m'':''n'').{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

Amalthea's orbit lies near the outer edge of the [[Rings of Jupiter#Amalthea gossamer ring|Amalthea Gossamer Ring]], which is composed of the dust ejected from the satellite.{{sfn|Burns Showalter et al.|1999}}

== Physical characteristics ==
The surface of Amalthea is very red.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} This color may be due to [[sulfur]] originating from [[Io (moon)|Io]] or some other non-ice material.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}  Bright patches of less red tint appear on the major slopes of Amalthea, but the nature of this color is currently unknown.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} The surface of Amalthea is slightly brighter than surfaces of other [[inner satellites of Jupiter]].{{sfn|Simonelli Rossier et al.|2000}} There is also a substantial asymmetry between leading and trailing [[Sphere|hemispheres]]: the leading hemisphere is 1.3&amp;nbsp;times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of [[impact crater|impacts]] on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material—presumably ice—from the interior of the moon.{{sfn|Simonelli Rossier et al.|2000}}

[[File:GrassHopperOviPositor.jpg|thumb|upright|Ovipositor of [[Tettigoniidae|long-horned grasshopper]] (the two [[cercus|cerci]] are also visible)]]

The '''ovipositor''' is a tube-like [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] used by some [[animal]]s, especially insects for the laying of [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. In insects, an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages.  The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as preparing a place for the egg, transmitting the egg, and then placing it properly.  For insects, the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but for many [[parasite|parasitic]] species (primarily in [[wasp]]s and other [[Hymenoptera]]), it is a piercing organ as well.

Some ovipositors only retract partly when not in use, and the [[basal (anatomy)|basal]] part that sticks out is known as the '''scape''', or more specifically '''oviscape''', the word ''scape'' deriving from the Latin word ''[[wikt:scapus#Latin|scāpus]]'', meaning &quot;stalk&quot; or &quot;shaft&quot;.

== In insects ==

[[File:Dolichomitus imperator Oviposition R Bartz.jpg|thumb|upright=1|&lt;br/&gt;The process of oviposition in ''[[Ichneumonidae|Dolichomitus imperator]]'':&lt;small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Tapping with her antennae, the wasp listens for the vibrations that indicate a host is present&lt;br/&gt;2. With the longer ovipositor, the wasp drills a hole through the bark&lt;br/&gt;3. The wasp inserts the ovipositor into the cavity which contains the host larva&lt;br/&gt;4. Making corrections&lt;br/&gt;5-6. Depositing the eggs&lt;/small&gt;]]

[[Grasshopper]]s use their ovipositors to force a burrow into the earth to receive the eggs. [[Cicada]]s pierce the [[wood]] of twigs with their ovipositors to insert the eggs. [[Symphyta|Sawflies]] slit the [[biological tissue|tissues]] of [[plant]]s by means of the ovipositor and so do some species of [[Ensifera|long-horned grasshoppers]]. In the ichneumon wasp genus ''[[Megarhyssa]]'', the females have a slender ovipositor (terebra) several inches long that is used to drill into the wood of [[tree trunks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sezen |first=Uzay |title=Two ichneumon wasps competing to oviposit |url=http://naturedocumentaries.org/1517/competing-wasps/ |access-date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species are parasitic in the [[larva]]l stage on the larvae of [[horntail]] wasps, hence the egg must be deposited directly into the host's body as it is feeding. The ovipositors of ''Megarhyssa'' are among the longest egg-laying organs (relative to body size) known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sezen |first=Uzay |title=Giant ichneumon wasp ovipositing |url=http://naturedocumentaries.org/3843/giant-ichneumon-megarhyssa-macrurus-ovipositing/ |access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stinger|stinger]]s of the [[Aculeata]] (wasps, hornets, bees, and ants) are ovipositors, highly modified and with associated [[venom]] [[gland]]s. They are used to paralyze prey, or as defensive weapons. The penetrating sting plus venom allows the wasp to lay eggs with less risk of injury from the host. In some cases the injection also introduces virus particles that suppress the host's immune system and prevent it from destroying the eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~bio336/Bio336/Lectures/Lecture5/Overheads.html|title=Evolutionary Genetics|website=www.zoology.ubc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in virtually all stinging [[Hymenoptera]], the ovipositor is no longer used for egg-laying. An exception is the family [[Cuckoo wasp|Chrysididae]], members of the Hymenoptera, in which species such as ''[[Chrysis ignita]]'' have reduced stinging apparatus and a functional ovipositor. 

[[Fig wasp]] ovipositors have specialized serrated teeth to penetrate fruits, but [[gall wasp]]s have either uniform teeth or no teeth on their ovipositors, meaning the [[morphology (biology) | morphology]] of the organ is related to the life history. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elias |first1=Larissa |last2=Kjellberg |first2=Finn |last3=Farache |first3=Fernando Henriche Antoniolli |last4=Almeida |first4=Eduardo |last5=Rasplus |first5=Jean-Yves |last6=Cruaud |first6=Astrid |last7=Peng |first7=Yan-Quiong |last8=Yang |first8=Da-Rong |last9=Pereira |first9=Rodrigo Augusto Santinelo |title=Ovipositor morphology correlates with life history evolution in agaonid fig wasps |journal=Acta Oecologica |date=July 2018 |volume=90 |pages=109-116 |doi=10.1016/j.actao.2017.10.007 |url=https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272011/1-s2.0-S1146609X18X00058/1-s2.0-S1146609X17300358/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEI%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIFrRhRX4xObadBffbMqYGgRCTEOpeS7UtzyAT7hyHTRfAiEA%2BWQfhCMOgnR9oEUu%2FddZLRXoXXkve9ibaQdQPj%2FUIN0qtAMIeBADGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDGzHh3FlzqeK%2BixfNCqRA8zy9bHuoJsH0wcjXyV%2BWABeXG66U6z0p6p0Im7pS4r%2FPppiqOjwAWF3%2Fj5gMuQoFlZabbDQCIqbSUMH2Ii8H2FqhUdp87texV8lpn4v5k9ZLlV0hw%2BBUz28%2B3jTyxD%2BAXtxoxuFP2QwxST%2BZTggBObdAc4ki7KhakpxGUx5INW923CGprKbIPbPfgB8wBhgEQXa9eGJKif%2BFyZxs7HOri%2BPKHMAM0tmaK0LD6EQVhWw3nJTgzyFb6xY%2FzuRqYhD%2BCYrN0R9US8rYRXVJCm1oNODlq4dwuwZBazn8vG2NlRW233DluOF87U78g41tUNqX3WNTUOGI7mIJrDVNGl%2F9%2FU6%2Fu%2BoMys5K2GQadEPQNjOIye2qZHwQN0r5W5G3NGUem0H6AtQVXl4EFYKndYqAm0DZRmXCxB7IifSLhCgGE6DeQj5ds%2BA9YB%2FX9H3ybAr2Hs32tg5fyQT3cNE52vye78Yy4254Za715fnbhEz%2FKBHYcRg8iILBye41sRGTPHheRV3YkRhtG9g7mNj7KjLgueVMNDUhPoFOusBkbuS4mAdtCfk9W4wtltmmWrLSlxtyj9HRZN%2FLcJa90m3B4tTYAUol91rsszXx69cJjcPqbsFiNEuROpl2sDmRTebATKZaCZ6i51WoxbwuCUCWsJRJHJ2J6oTpkLVVkrbI%2Bnucyse%2F%2FvsCKmh7tKSBBtm%2BNfkOVrprQlQTz6pB79DJuWSwWfRfUH8Q0FuOjcs9UuHADcUTCJstZ04YiQqsFfsTVrMhZjcSNqbwkdfv7nu2VffxgzI3atoUSzN5KCna5wPtuONJft0221ZbdPLhYaz%2FkVZs6MD2zEfX%2FNP7UXnxKM%2FSLSkp3wBVQ%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200822T152944Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYVISSQXUW%2F20200822%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=28895442a8ee152401380c7958b4fb81f3a344c213645922309c5c7820cd788b&amp;hash=6099f782f2922dbccbaa418107c716a83a988b36f7817aefa839808221bde026&amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;pii=S1146609X17300358&amp;tid=spdf-2c41f932-3b6f-40bf-a950-4a985da65b8c&amp;sid=975252b783e7b3462018f1e4033e89c787d1gxrqa&amp;type=client |accessdate=22 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Fly|Diptera]]n (fly) families [[Tephritidae]] and [[Pyrgotidae]] have well-developed ovipositors that are partly retracted when not in use, with the part that sticks out being the oviscape. [[Oestridae]], another family within Diptera, often have short hairy ovipositors, the species ''[[Cuterebra fontinella]]'' has one of the shortest within the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hadwen S |title=A description the egg and ovipositor of ''Cuterebra fontinella'', Clark (Cottontail Bot.)|journal=Journal of the Entomological Society of British Columbia |volume=5 |pages=88–91 |year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovipositors exist not only in [[Pterygota| winged insects]], but also in [[Apterygota]], where the ovipositor has an additional function in gathering the spermatophore during mating. Little is known about the egg-laying habits of these insects in the wild. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matushkina |first1=Natalia A. |title=Ovipositor Internal Microsculpture in the Relic Silverfish Tricholepidion gertschi (Insecta: Zygentoma) |journal=Publication:Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |date=January 2011 |url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/2011/563852.pdf |accessdate=22 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fish ==

Female bitterlings in the genus ''[[Rhodeus]]'' have an ovipositor in the form of a tubular extension of the [[genital]] orifice. During breeding season, they use it when depositing eggs in the mantle cavity of freshwater [[mussel]]s, where their eggs develop in reasonable security. [[Seahorse]]s have an ovipositor for introducing eggs into the brood pouch of the male, who carries them until it is time to release the fry into a suitable situation in the open water.

An '''ionic crystal''' is a [[crystal]] consisting of [[ion]]s bound together by their [[electrostatic]] attraction.

NaCl has a 6:6 co-ordination.
The properties of NaCl reflect the strong interactions that exist between the ions. It is a good conductor of electricity when molten, but very poor in the solid state. When fused the mobile ions carry charge through the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/structures/ionicstruct.html|title=Ionic Structures|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are characterized by strong absorption of [[infrared radiation]] and have planes along which they cleave easily.
The exact arrangement of ions in an ionic lattice varies according to the size of the ions in the solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf|title=Chemicals of the natural environment|accessdate=1 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spleen''' is an [[organ (biology)|organ]] found in virtually all [[vertebrate]]s. Similar in structure to a large [[lymph node]], it acts primarily as a blood filter. The word spleen comes {{ety|grc|''σπλήν'' (splḗn)}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;σπλήν&quot;&gt;[https://inthehumanbody.com/how-many-red-blood-cells-in-the-human-body/doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsplh%2Fn σπλήν],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The spleen plays important roles in regard to [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes) and the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;all-vert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/spleen.html|title=spleen|first=David|last=Darling|website=www.daviddarling.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of [[Shock (circulatory)|hemorrhagic shock]], and also [[Human iron metabolism|recycles iron]]. As a part of the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]], it metabolizes [[hemoglobin]] removed from [[senescent]] [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes). The [[globin]] portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive [[amino acid]]s, and the [[heme]] portion is metabolized to [[bilirubin]], which is removed in the [[liver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mebius&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16056254|year=2005|last1=Mebius|first1=RE|last2=Kraal|first2=G|title=Structure and function of the spleen|volume=5|issue=8|pages=606–16|doi=10.1038/nri1669|journal=Nature Reviews.

The spleen synthesizes [[antibodies]] in its [[white pulp]] and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and [[lymph node]] circulation. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after [[myocardial infarction]]), turn into [[dendritic cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s while promoting tissue healing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swirski&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jia&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19644100|year=2009|last1=Jia|first1=T|last2=Pamer|first2=EG|title=Immunology.

==Anatomy==
The spleen is underneath the left part of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the [[stomach]]. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the [[pancreas]]. The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface, and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left [[adrenal gland]].

The spleen, in healthy adult humans, is approximately {{convert|7|cm}} to {{convert|14|cm}}  in length. 

An easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1×3×5×7×9×10×11 rule.

===Blood supply===
[[File:Gray1188.png|200px|thumb|Visceral surface of the spleen]]
Near the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]], which is the point of attachment for the [[gastrosplenic ligament]] and the point of insertion for the [[splenic artery]] and [[splenic vein]]. There are other openings present for [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s.

Like the [[thymus]], the spleen possesses only [[efferent lymphatic vessels]]. The spleen is part of the [[lymphatic system]]. Both the [[short gastric arteries]] and the splenic artery supply it with blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Nerve supply===
The spleen is innervated by the [[splenic plexus]], which connects a branch of the [[celiac ganglia]] to the [[vagus nerve]].

The underlying [[Central nervous system|central nervous]] processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis]], and the [[brainstem]], especially the [[subfornical organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lori|first=Andrea|last2=Perrotta|first2=Marialuisa|last3=Lembo|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Carnevale|first4=Daniela|date=2017-06-07|title=The Spleen: A Hub Connecting Nervous and Immune Systems in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1216|doi=10.3390/ijms18061216|issn=1422-0067|pmc=5486039|pmid=28590409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gut]]. While most of the gut [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are [[endodermally]] derived (with the exception of the [[neural-crest]] derived [[adrenal gland]]), the spleen is derived from [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tissue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Vellguth | first=Swantje |author2=Brita von Gaudecker |author3=Hans-Konrad Müller-Hermelink | title=The development of the human spleen | journal=[[Cell and Tissue Research]] | volume=242 | issue=3 | pages=579–92 | doi=10.1007/BF00225424 | pmid=4075378 | year= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the [[dorsal mesentery]]. However, it still shares the same blood supply—the [[celiac trunk]]—as the [[foregut]] organs.

|}

===Other===
Other functions of the spleen are less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:
*Spleen produces all types of blood cells during fetal life
* Production of [[opsonin]]s, [[properdin]], and [[tuftsin]].
* Creation of [[red blood cell]]s. While the [[bone marrow]] is the primary site of [[hematopoiesis]] in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the 5th month of gestation. After birth, [[Erythropoiesis|erythropoietic]] functions cease, except in some hematologic disorders. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the [[reticuloendothelial system]], the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.
* Storage of [[red blood cell]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s and other formed elements. The spleen of horses stores roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC2006-Carey&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Bjorn | last=Carey | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12648465 | title=Horse science: What makes a Derby winner – Spleen acts as a 'natural blood doper,' scientist says | publisher=NBC News | date=May 5, 2006  | access-date=2006-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and released in cases of [[hypovolemia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Spleen: Information, Surgery and Functions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chp.edu/CHP/organs+spleen+functions |title=Spleen: Information, Surgery and Functions |publisher=Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh |website= Chp.edu |date=2010-11-17 |access-date=2011-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926085253/http://www.chp.edu/CHP/organs+spleen+functions |archive-date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lodin-Sundström|first1=Angelica|last2=Schagatay|first2=Erika|title=Spleen contraction during 20 min normobaric hypoxia and 2 min apnea in humans|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2010|volume=8|issue=6|pages=545–49|doi=10.3357/ASEM.2682.2010|pmid=20540444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can store [[platelets]] in case of an emergency and also clears old platelets from the circulation. Up to a quarter, or one fourth, of [[lymphocytes]] are stored in the spleen at any one time.

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Spleen after spleenectomy.jpg|alt=Surgically removed spleen of a child with thalassemia. It is about 15 times larger than normal.|thumb|Thalassemia enlarged spleen after splenectomy]]

===Enlarged spleen===
{{Main|Splenomegaly}}
Enlargement of the spleen is known as [[splenomegaly]]. It may be caused by [[sickle cell anemia]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[malaria]], [[bacterial endocarditis]], [[leukemia]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[Gaucher's disease]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[Banti's syndrome|Banti's disease]], [[hereditary spherocytosis]], [[cyst]]s, glandular fever ([[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] or 'Mono' caused by the [[Epstein–Barr virus]]), and [[tumour]]s. Primary tumors of the spleen include [[hemangioma]]s and [[hemangiosarcoma]]s. Marked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.

The spleen is the largest collection of [[lymphoid tissue]] in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants, in 30% of normal, full-term [[neonates]], and in 5% to 10% of infants and toddlers. A spleen easily palpable below the [[costal margin]] in any child over the age of 3–4 years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.

Splenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., [[hemolytic anemia]]), or infiltration (e.g., [[leukemia]] or storage disease, such as [[Gaucher's disease]]). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a [[complete blood count]] with differential, platelet count, and [[reticulocyte]] and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of [[IgM]] antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising [[titer]]) is indicated to confirm Epstein–Barr virus or [[cytomegalovirus]]. Other infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.

===Rupture of spleen===
{{Main|Ruptured spleen}}
[[trauma (medicine)|Traumas]], such as a [[traffic collision|road traffic collision]], can cause [[ruptured spleen|rupture of the spleen]], which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.

===Asplenia===
{{Main|Asplenia}}
[[Asplenia]] refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be [[genetic disorder|congenital]], or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection ([[splenectomy]]) or a disease such as [[sickle cell anaemia]]. Hyposplenia refers to a partially functioning spleen. These conditions may cause&lt;ref name=&quot;Jia&quot;/&gt; a modest increase in circulating [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s, a diminished response to some [[vaccine]]s, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is an increased risk of [[sepsis]] from [[polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria]]. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by [[immunoglobulin M|IgM]] [[memory B cell]]s (a subtype of [[B cell]]s) in the [[marginal zone]] of the spleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Sabatino|first=A|author2=Carsetti, R |author3=Corazza, GR |title=Post-splenectomy and hyposplenic states|journal=Lancet|date=Jul 2, 2011|volume=378|issue=9785|pages=86–97|pmid=21474172|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carsetti|first=R|author2=Rosado, MM |author3=Wardmann, H |title=Peripheral development of B cells in mouse and man|journal=Immunological Reviews|date=February 2004|volume=197|pages=179–91|pmid=14962195|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[splenectomy]] (removal of the spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruetzmann|first=S |author2=Rosado, MM |author3=Weber, H |author4=Germing, U |author5=Tournilhac, O |author6=Peter, HH |author7=Berner, R |author8=Peters, A |author9=Boehm, T |author10=Plebani, A |author11=Quinti, I |author12=Carsetti, R|title=Human immunoglobulin M memory B cells controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are generated in the spleen|journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=Apr 7, 2003|volume=197|issue=7|pages=939–45|pmid=12682112|doi=10.1084/jem.20022020|pmc=2193885}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 28-year follow-up of 740 [[World War II]] veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from [[pneumonia]] (6 rather than the expected 1.3) and an increase in the death rate from [[ischemic heart disease]] (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=69206|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(77)90132-5|title=Splenectomy and Subsequent Mortality in Veterans of the 1939–45 War|year=1977|last1=Dennis Robinette|first1=C.|last2=Fraumeni|first2=Josephf.|journal=The Lancet|volume=310|issue=8029|pages=127–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessory spleen===
An [[accessory spleen]] is a small splenic nodule extra to the spleen usually formed in early [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population&lt;ref name=klmoore&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Keith L. | author-link = Keith L. Moore | title = Clinically Oriented Anatomy | edition = 3rd | year = 1992 | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = Baltimore | isbn = 978-0-683-06133-8 | page = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are typically around 1 centimeter in diameter. ''[[Splenosis]]'' is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue (often following [[physical trauma|trauma]] or splenectomy) [[autotransplantation|autotransplant]] in the abdominal cavity as accessory spleens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abu Hilal M |author2=Harb A|author3=Zeidan B|author4=Steadman B|author5=Primrose JN|author6= Pearce NW | date = January 5, 2009 | title = Hepatic splenosis mimicking HCC in a patient with hepatitis C liver cirrhosis and mildly raised alpha feto protein; the important role of explorative laparoscopy | journal = World Journal of Surgical Oncology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pmid = 19123935 | pmc = 2630926 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7819-7-1
| pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polysplenia]] is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|seven/000085247|polysplenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen.  Polysplenia sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as [[intestinal malrotation]] or [[biliary atresia]], or cardiac abnormalities, such as [[dextrocardia]]. These accessory spleens are non-functional.

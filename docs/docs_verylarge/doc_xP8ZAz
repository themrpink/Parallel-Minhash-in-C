&quot;clearly the law was inspired by the predatory competitive tactics of the great trusts, and its primary purpose was the maintenance of the competitive system in industry.&quot;

Legislative and judicial action of both a criminal and civil nature already restrained concerted action by labor. ''See, e.g.,'' the kinds of strikes which were declared illegal in Pennsylvania, including a strike accompanied by force or threat of harm to persons or property, Brightly's Purdon's Digest of 1885, pp. 426, 1172.

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, when the Sherman Act was adopted, there were only a few federal statutes imposing penalties for obstructing or misusing interstate transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 13 appears here: &quot;Three statutes covered in 1890 the Congressional action in relation to obstructions to interstate commerce. A penalty was imposed for the refusal to transmit a telegraph message (R.S. § 5269, 17 Stat. 366 (1872)) for transporting nitroglycerine and other explosives without proper safeguards (R.S. § 5353, 14 Stat. 81 (1866)) and for combining to prevent the continuous carriage of freight, 24 Stat. 382, 49 U.S.C. § 7.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; With an expanding commerce, many others have since been enacted safeguarding transportation in interstate commerce as the need was seen, including statutes declaring conspiracies to interfere or actual interference with interstate commerce by violence or threats of violence to be felonies.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 14 appears here:

&quot;''See, e.g.'' regulation of; interstate carriage of lottery tickets, 28 Stat. 963 (1895), 18 U.S.C. § 387; Transportation of obscene books, 29 Stat. 512 (1897), 18 U.S.C. § 396; transportation of illegally killed game, 31 Stat. 188 (1900), 18 U.S.C. §§ 392–395; interstate shipment of intoxicating liquors, 35 Stat. 1136 (1909), 18 U.S.C. §§ 388–390; white slave traffic, 36 Stat. 825 (1910), 18 U.S.C. §§ 397–404; transportation of prize-fight films, 37 Stat. 240 (1912), 18 U.S.C. §§ 405–407; larceny of goods moving in interstate commerce, 37 Stat. 670 (1913), 18 U.S.C. § 409; violent interference with foreign commerce, 40 Stat. 221 (1917), 18 U.S.C. § 381; transportation of stolen motor vehicles, 41 Stat. 324 (1919), 18 U.S.C. § 408; transportation of kidnapped persons, 47 Stat. 326 (1932), 18 U.S.C. § 408a–408c; threatening communication in interstate commerce, 48 Stat. 781 (1934), 18 U.S.C. § 408d; transportation of stolen or feloniously taken goods, securities or money, 48 Stat. 794 (1934), 18 U.S.C. § 415; transporting strikebreakers, 49 Stat. 1899 (1936), 18 U.S.C. § 407a; destruction or dumping of farm products received in interstate commerce, 44 Stat. 1355 (1927), 7 U.S.C. § 491. ''Cf.''

National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449 (1935), 29 U.S.C., Ch. 7, § 151,

&quot;Findings and declaration of policy. The denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce. . . .&quot;

The Anti-Racketeering Act, 48 Stat. 979, 18 U.S.C. §§ 420a-420e (1934), is designed to protect trade and commerce against interference by violence and threats. § 420a provides that

&quot;any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce --&quot;

&quot;(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations . . . not including, however, the payment of wages by a bonafide employer to a bona fide employee; or&quot;

&quot;(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right; or&quot;

&quot;(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate subsections (a) or (b); or&quot;

&quot;(d) Conspires or acts concertedly with any other person or persons to commit any of the foregoing acts; shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by a fine of $10,000 or both.&quot;

But the application of the provisions of § 420a to labor unions is restricted by § 420d, which provides:

&quot;Jurisdiction of offenses. Any person charged with violating section 420a of this title may be prosecuted in any district in which any part of the offense has been committed by him or by his actual associates participating with him in the offense or by his fellow conspirators: ''Provided,'' That no court of the United States shall construe or apply any of the provisions of sections 420a to 420e of this title in such manner as to impair, diminish, or in any manner affect the rights of bona fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, as such rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States.&quot;

It is significant that Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code, dealing with &quot;Offenses Against Foreign And Interstate Commerce&quot; and relating specifically to acts of interstate transportation or its obstruction, makes no mention of the Sherman Act, which is made a part of the Code which deals with social, economic and commercial results of interstate activity, notwithstanding its criminal penalty.&quot;

&lt;/ref&gt; The law was enacted in the era of &quot;trusts&quot; and of &quot;combinations&quot; of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern. The goal was to prevent restraints of free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 15 appears here:

&quot;The history of the Sherman Act, as contained in the legislative proceedings, is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that &quot;business competition&quot; was the problem considered, and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.

On July 10, 1888, the Senate adopted without discussion a resolution offered by Senator Sherman which directed the Committee on Finance to inquire into, and report in connection with, revenue bills

&quot;such measures as it may deem expedient to set aside, control, restrain or prohibit all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations, made with a view, or which tend to prevent ''free and full competition'' . . . with such penalties and provisions . . . as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production, the natural competition of increasing production, the lowering of prices by such competition . . .&quot;

(19 Cong.Rec. 6041).

This resolution explicitly presented the economic theory of the proponents of such legislation. The various bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 follow the theory of this resolution. Many bills sought to make void all arrangements

&quot;made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles of domestic growth or production, . . .&quot;

S. 3445; S. 3510; H.R. 11339; all of the 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) were bills of this type. In the 51st Cong. (1889), the bills were in a similar vein. ''See'' S. 1, sec. 1 (this bill as redrafted by the Judiciary Committee ultimately became the Sherman Law); H.R. 202, sec. 3; H.R. 270; H.R. 286; H.R. 402; H.R. 509; H.R. 826; H.R. 3819. ''See'' Bills and Debates in Congress relating to Trusts (1909), Vol. 1, pp. 1025–1031.

Only one, which was never enacted, S. 1268 in the 52d Cong., 1st Sess. (1892), introduced by Senator Peffer, sought to prohibit

&quot;every willful act . . . which shall have the effect to in any way interfere with the freedom of transit of articles in interstate commerce, . . .&quot;

When the antitrust bill (S. 1, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.) came before Congress for debate, the debates point to a similar purpose. Senator Sherman asserted the bill prevented only &quot;business combinations&quot; &quot;made with a view to prevent competition&quot;, 21 Cong.Rec. 2457, 2562; ''see also ibid.'' at 2459, 2461.

Senator Allison spoke of combinations which &quot;control prices,&quot; ''ibid.,'' 2471; Senator Pugh of combinations &quot;to limit production&quot; for &quot;the purpose of destroying competition&quot;, ''ibid.,'' 2558; Senator Morgan of combinations &quot;that affect the price of commodities,&quot; ''ibid.,'' 2609; Senator Platt, a critic of the bill, said this bill proceeds on the assumption that &quot;competition is beneficent to the country,&quot; ''ibid.,'' 2729; Senator George denounced trusts which crush out competition, &quot;and that is the great evil at which all this legislation ought to be directed,&quot; ''ibid.,'' 3147.

In the House, Representative Culberson, who was in charge of the bill, interpreted the bill to prohibit various arrangements which tend to drive out competition, ''ibid.,'' 4089; Representative Wilson spoke in favor of the bill against combinations among

&quot;competing producers to control the supply of their product, in order that they may dictate the terms on which they shall sell in the market, and may secure release from the stress of competition among themselves,&quot;

''ibid.,'' 4090.

The unanimity with which foes and supporters of the bill spoke of its aims as the protection of free competition permits use of the debates in interpreting the purpose of the act.

&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason the phrase &quot;restraint of trade,&quot; which, as will presently appear, had a well understood meaning in common law, was made the means of defining the activities prohibited. The addition of the words &quot;or commerce among the several States&quot; was not an additional kind of restraint to be prohibited by the Sherman Act, but was the means used to relate the prohibited restraint of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes, Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 286 U. S. 434, so that Congress, through its commerce power, might suppress and penalize restraints on the competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce. Because many forms of restraint upon commercial competition extended across state lines so as to make regulation by state action difficult or impossible, Congress enacted the Sherman Act, 21 Cong.Rec. 2456. It was in this sense of preventing restraints on commercial competition that Congress exercised &quot;all the power it possessed.&quot; Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers v. United States, supra, 286 U. S. 435.}}

==Provisions==
===Original text===
The Sherman Act is divided into three sections. Section 1 delineates and prohibits specific means of anticompetitive conduct, while Section 2 deals with end results that are anti-competitive in nature. Thus, these sections supplement each other in an effort to prevent businesses from violating the spirit of the Act, while technically remaining within the letter of the law. Section 3 simply extends the provisions of Section 1 to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.

{{quote|Section 1:
:Every contract, combination in the form of [[Trust (19th century)|trust]] or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|15|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Section 2:
:Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony [. . . ]&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|15|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Subsequent legislation expanding its scope====
The [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], passed in 1914, proscribes certain additional activities that had been discovered to fall outside the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act. For example, the Clayton Act added certain practices to the list of impermissible activities:
* price discrimination between different purchasers, if such discrimination tends to create a monopoly
* exclusive dealing agreements
* tying arrangements
* mergers and acquisitions that substantially reduce market competition.

The [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936 amended the Clayton Act. The amendment proscribed certain anti-competitive practices in which manufacturers engaged in price discrimination against equally-situated distributors.

==Legal application==
===Constitutional basis for legislation===
Congress claimed power to pass the Sherman Act through its [[Commerce Clause|constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce]]. Therefore, federal courts only have jurisdiction to apply the Act to conduct that restrains or substantially affects either interstate commerce or trade within the District of Columbia. This requires that the plaintiff must show that the conduct occurred during the flow of interstate commerce or had an appreciable effect on some activity that occurs during interstate commerce.

===Elements===
A Section 1 violation has three elements:&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.,'' [https://www.lexis.com/research/buttonTFLink?_m=c2cdaffd0ce470de6e524fd3149b710f&amp;_xfercite=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b54%20Fordham%20L.%20Rev.%20247%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&amp;_butType=3&amp;_butStat=2&amp;_butNum=322&amp;_butInline=1&amp;_butinfo=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b547%20F.%20Supp.%20893%2cat%20917%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=27&amp;_startdoc=21&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAB&amp;_md5=79b43fe5414599f9b527852cc3923437 Richter Concrete Corp. v.

:(1) an agreement;
:(2) which unreasonably restrains competition; and
:(3) which affects interstate commerce.

A Section 2 monopolization violation has two elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v.

:(1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market; and
:(2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.

Section 2 also bans attempted monopolization, which has the following elements:
:(1) qualifying exclusionary or anticompetitive acts designed to establish a monopoly
:(2) specific intent to monopolize; and
:(3) dangerous probability of success (actual monopolization).

===Violations &quot;per se&quot; and violations of the &quot;rule of reason&quot;===
Violations of the Sherman Act fall (loosely&lt;ref&gt;The truth is that our categories of analysis of anticompetitive effect are less fixed than terms like 'per se,' 'quick look,' and 'rule of reason' tend to make them appear. We have recognized, for example, that 'there is often no bright line separating per se from rule of reason analysis,' since 'considerable inquiry into market conditions' may be required before the application of any so-called 'per se' condemnation is justified. [[Cal. Dental Association v. FTC]] at 779 (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 104 n.26). &quot;'Whether the ultimate finding is the product of a presumption or actual market analysis, the essential inquiry remains the same whether or not the challenged restraint enhances competition.'&quot; 526 U.S. at 779–80 (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 104).&lt;/ref&gt;) into two categories:
* '''Violations &quot;per se&quot;:''' these are violations that meet the strict characterization of Section 1 (&quot;agreements, conspiracies or trusts in restraint of trade&quot;). A per se violation requires no further inquiry into the practice's actual effect on the market or the intentions of those individuals who engaged in the practice. Conduct characterized as per se unlawful is that which has been found to have a &quot;'pernicious effect on competition' or 'lack[s] . . . any redeeming virtue'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Continental T.V., Inc. v.

* '''Violations of the &quot;rule of reason&quot;:''' A totality of the circumstances test, asking whether the challenged practice promotes or suppresses market competition. Unlike with per se violations, intent and motive are relevant when predicting future consequences. The rule of reason is said to be the &quot;traditional framework of analysis&quot; to determine whether Section 1 is violated.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental T.V.'', 433 U.S. at 49.

::'''Quick-look:''' A &quot;quick look&quot; analysis under the rule of reason may be used when &quot;an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets,&quot; yet the violation is also not one considered illegal per se.&lt;ref&gt;''Cal. Dental Ass'n'', 526 U.S. at 770.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a &quot;quick look,&quot; economic harm is presumed from the questionable nature of the conduct, and the burden is shifted to the defendant to prove harmlessness or justification. The quick-look became a popular way of disposing of cases where the conduct was in a grey area between illegality &quot;per se&quot; and demonstrable harmfulness under the &quot;rule of reason&quot;.

===Modern trends===

====Inference of conspiracy====
A modern trend has increased difficulty for antitrust plaintiffs as courts have come to hold plaintiffs to increasing burdens of pleading. Under older Section 1 precedent, it was not settled how much evidence was required to show a conspiracy. For example, a conspiracy could be inferred based on parallel conduct, etc. That is, plaintiffs were only required to show that a conspiracy was conceivable. Since the 1970s, however, courts have held plaintiffs to higher standards, giving antitrust defendants an opportunity to resolve cases in their favor before significant discovery under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 12(b)(6). That is, to overcome a [[Motion in United States law|motion to dismiss]], plaintiffs, under ''[[Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly]]'', must plead facts consistent with [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 8(a) sufficient to show that a conspiracy is plausible (and not merely conceivable or possible). This protects defendants from bearing the costs of antitrust &quot;fishing expeditions&quot;; however it deprives plaintiffs of perhaps their only tool to acquire evidence (discovery).

=====Manipulation of market=====
Second, courts have employed more sophisticated and principled definitions of markets. Market definition is necessary, in rule of reason cases, for the plaintiff to prove a conspiracy is harmful. It is also necessary for the plaintiff to establish the market relationship between conspirators to prove their conduct is within the per se rule.

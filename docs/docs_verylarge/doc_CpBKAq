[[File:RIP Data Flow.svg|thumb|300px|Generating the raster image data]]

A '''raster image processor''' ('''RIP''') is a component used in a [[printing]] system which produces a [[raster graphics|raster]] image also known as a [[bitmap]]. Such a bitmap is used by a later stage of the printing system to produce the printed output. The input may be a page description in a high-level [[page description language]] such as [[PostScript]], [[PDF]], or [[Open XML Paper Specification|XPS]]. The input can be or include bitmaps of higher or lower resolution than the output device, which the RIP resizes using an [[image scaling]] algorithm.

Originally a RIP was a [[19-inch rack|rack]] of electronic hardware which received the page description via some interface (e.g. [[RS-232]]) and generated a &quot;hardware bitmap output&quot; which was used to enable or disable each [[pixel]] on a real-time output device such as an optical [[film recorder]], [[computer to film]], or [[computer to plate]].

A RIP can be implemented as a software module on a general-purpose computer, or as a firmware program executed on a [[microprocessor]] inside a printer. For high-end typesetting, standalone hardware RIPs are sometimes used. [[Ghostscript]], GhostPCL, and ColorBurst's Overdrive (for [[macOS]]) are examples of software RIPs. Every PostScript printer contains a RIP in its [[firmware]]. The RIP [[microprocessor|chip]] in a [[laser printing|laser printer]] sends its [[raster image]] output to the [[laser]].

Earlier RIPs retained backward compatibility with [[phototypesetting|phototypesetters]]/photosetters, so they supported the older languages. So, for example, Linotype RIPs supported CORA (RIP30).

==Stages of RIP==
# '''Interpretation''': This is the stage where the supported PDLs (page description languages) are translated into a private internal representation of each page. Most RIPs process pages serially, one page at a time, so the current machine state is only for the current page. After a page has been output, the page state is discarded to prepare for the next page.
# '''Rendering''': A process through which the private internal representation is turned into a [[continuous tone|continuous-tone]] bitmap. In practical RIPs, interpretation and rendering are frequently done together. Simple languages were designed to work on minimal hardware, so tend to &quot;directly drive&quot; the renderer.
# '''Screening''': In order to print, the continuous-tone image is converted into a [[halftone]] (pattern of dots). Two screening methods or types are ''amplitude modulation'' (AM) screening and ''stochastic'' or ''frequency modulation'' (FM) screening. In AM screening, dot size varies depending on object density—tonal values; dots are placed in a fixed grid. In FM screening, dot size remains constant and dots are placed in random order to create darker or lighter areas of the image; dot placement is precisely controlled by sophisticated mathematical algorithms.

'''Giulio''' ('''Yoel''') '''Racah'''  '''({{lang-he|ג'וליו (יואל) רקח}};'''  February 9, 1909 – August 28, 1965) was an Italian–Israeli [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]].&lt;ref name=&quot;physicstoday118&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Giulio Racah|journal=Physics Today|volume=18|issue=10|page=118|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v18/i10/p118_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3046917|bibcode=1965PhT....18j.118.|year=1965}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Acting President of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] from 1961 to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &amp;#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &amp;#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |accessdate=2020-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Racah (crater)|Racah]] on the Moon is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41134314?seq=1 Giulio Racah and theoretical physics in Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guilio (Yoel) Racah was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~szwetch/Stamps.of.Israel/62.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012154305/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~szwetch/Stamps.of.Israel/62.html |archivedate=2012-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his BA from the [[University of Florence]] in 1930, and continued his studies at [[University of Rome La Sapienza|Rome]] with [[Enrico Fermi]]. 

In 1939, due to application of [[Italian Racial Laws|Anti-Jewish laws in Italy]], Racah [[aliyah|immigrated]] to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]], Racah served as deputy commander of the Israeli forces defending [[Mount Scopus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16308.html Jewish Virtual Library,  sourced from Encyclopaedia Judaica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Racah died at the age of 56, apparently asphyxiated by gas from a faulty heater while visiting Florence.&lt;ref name=&quot;physicstoday118&quot;/&gt;

==Academic and scientific career==
In 1937 Racah was appointed Professor of Physics at the [[University of Pisa]]. In 1939, after his move to Palestine, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], He later became  Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and finally [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and acting President from 1961 to 1962, following [[Benjamin Mazar]] and succeeded by [[Eliahu Eilat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://new.huji.ac.il/en/page/454 |title=Office of the President &amp;#124; האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים &amp;#124; The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=New.huji.ac.il |date=2017-09-01 |accessdate=2020-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physics institute at the Hebrew University is named &quot;[[The Racah Institute of Physics]]&quot;.

Racah's research was mainly in the fields of [[quantum physics]] and atomic [[spectroscopy]]. He first devised a systematic general procedure for classifying the [[energy level]]s of open shell atoms, which remains to this day the accepted technique for practical calculations of [[atomic structure]]. This formalism was described in a monograph coauthored by his cousin [[Ugo Fano]] (''Irreducible Tensorial Sets'', 1959).

==Awards and recognition==
In 1958, Racah was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in exact sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208115723/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reason''' is the capacity of [[Consciousness|consciously]] making sense of things, applying [[logic]], and adapting or justifying practices, [[institution]]s, and [[belief]]s based on new or existing [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/096725500750039282 | volume=8 | issue=3 | title=So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean | year=2000 | journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies | pages=271–295 | last1 = Kompridis | first1 = Nikolas| s2cid=171038942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely associated with such characteristically [[human]] activities as [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[language]], [[mathematics]], and [[art]], and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by [[humans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mercier |first1=Hugo |last2=Sperber |first2=Dan |authorlink2=Dan Sperber |date=2017 |title=The Enigma of Reason |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674368309 |oclc=959650235 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zc-WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 2] |ref=harv |quote=Enhanced with reason, cognition can secure better knowledge in all domains and adjust action to novel and ambitious goals, or so the story goes.

'''Reasoning''' is associated with the acts of [[Thought|thinking]] and [[cognition]], and involves using one's [[intellect]]. The field of [[logic]] studies the ways in which humans can use [[Logical form|formal]] reasoning to produce [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] [[argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Hintikka|first=J.|title=Philosophy of logic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346240/philosophy-of-logic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=12 November 2013|authorlink=Jaako Hintikka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of [[logical reasoning]], such as: [[deductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], and [[abductive reasoning]]. [[Aristotle]] drew a distinction between logical '''discursive reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; (reason proper), and [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive reasoning]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.6.vi.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, Book VI, Translated by W. D. Ross |website=classics.mit.edu |accessdate=25 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in [[mathematics]], intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a [[formal proof]], arguably the most difficult of '''formal reasoning'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or [[intuition]], is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as [[cause]] and [[Causality|effect]], [[truth]] and [[False (logic)|falsehood]], or ideas regarding notions of [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. Reasoning, as a part of [[Executive functions|executive decision making]], is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of [[goal]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[tradition]]s, and [[institution]]s, and therefore with the capacity for [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; in ''The Essential Foucault'', eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose, New York: The New Press, 2003, 43–57. See also Nikolas Kompridis, &quot;The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom,&quot; in ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 32–59; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096725500750039282 &quot;So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean&quot;], ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 8: 3, 271–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the use of &quot;reason&quot; as an [[Noun#Concrete nouns and abstract nouns|abstract noun]], [[Reason (argument)|a reason]] is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of reason&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.

Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, &quot;morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by ''reason''—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rachels, James. The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 4th ed. McGraw Hill, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have attempted to study and explain [[psychology of reasoning|how people reason]], e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of [[automated reasoning]] studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. [[comparative psychology|Animal psychology]] considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

==Etymology and related words==
In the [[English language]] and other modern [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], &quot;reason&quot;, and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.
* The original [[Greek language|Greek]] term was {{lang|grc|&quot;λόγος&quot;}} ''[[wikt:logos#Greek|logos]]'', the root of the modern English word &quot;[[logic]]&quot; but also a word which could mean for example &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; or an &quot;account&quot; (of money handled).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell| first2=Robert |last2=Scott|title=A Greek–English Lexicon|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos|chapter=logos}}. For etymology of English &quot;logic&quot; see any dictionary such as [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic?show=0&amp;t=1296722456 the Merriam Webster entry for logic].&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a philosophical term ''logos'' was translated in its non-linguistic senses in [[Latin]] as ''[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]''. This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy, but was also commonly a translation for ''logos'' in the sense of an account of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dratio|chapter=ratio|first1=Charlton |last1=Lewis|first2= Charles |last2=Short|title=A Latin Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:raison|raison]]'' is derived directly from Latin, and this is the direct source of the English word &quot;reason&quot;.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

The earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], and [[John Locke]] also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words &quot;''logos''&quot;, &quot;''ratio''&quot;, &quot;''raison''&quot; and &quot;reason&quot; as interchangeable. The meaning of the word &quot;reason&quot; in senses such as &quot;human reason&quot; also overlaps to a large extent with &quot;[[rationality]]&quot; and the adjective of &quot;reason&quot; in philosophical contexts is normally &quot;[[Rationality|rational]]&quot;, rather than &quot;reasoned&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational Merriam Webster &quot;rational&quot;] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable Merriam Webster &quot;reasonable&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers, [[Thomas Hobbes]] for example, also used the word '''ratiocination'''&lt;!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--&gt; as a synonym for &quot;reasoning&quot;.

==Philosophical history{{anchor|History_of_reasoning}}==
[[File:Goya Caprichos3.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]], ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (''El sueño de la razón produce monstruos''), c. 1797]]
The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western [[philosophy]] and later western [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], or &quot;self-correcting&quot;, and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jürgen Habermas 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Habermas |first1=Jürgen |authorlink=Jürgen Habermas |title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.

===Classical philosophy===
For many classical [[philosophers]], nature was understood [[teleology|teleologically]], meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose that fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with [[Pythagoras]] or [[Heraclitus]], the cosmos is even said to have reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pp. 204 &amp; 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''), reason was described by [[Plato]] as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (''[[thumos]]'') and the passions. [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, defined human beings as [[rational animal]]s, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of [[human nature]]. He ''defined'' the highest human happiness or well being (''[[eudaimonia]]'') as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean Ethics#Defining Happiness and the aim of the Ethics|Book 1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with [[monotheism]] and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the [[Neoplatonism|neo-platonist]] account of [[Plotinus]], the [[cosmos]] has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter-url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via [[Averroes]], came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the [[renaissance]], and they remain important in [[Iranian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===

The [[early modern era]] was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in [[Europe]]. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Dreyfus |title=Telepistemology: Descartes' Last Stand |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/rtf/Limits_of_Telepresence_6_99.rtf |publisher= socrates.berkeley.edu |accessdate= February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same &quot;[[natural law|laws of nature]]&quot; which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous [[world view]] that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.

Accordingly, in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as &quot;rational animals&quot;, suggesting instead that they are nothing more than &quot;thinking things&quot; along the lines of other &quot;things&quot; in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.

In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt ''all'' knowledge – ''except'' that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, &quot;Second Meditation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This eventually became known as [[epistemological]] or &quot;subject-centred&quot; reason, because it is based on the ''knowing subject'', who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.

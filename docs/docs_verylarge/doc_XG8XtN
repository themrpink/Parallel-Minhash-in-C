The first truly successful container shipping company dates to April 26, 1956, when American trucking entrepreneur McLean put 58 ''trailer vans'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/04/27/archives/tankers-to-carry-2way-pay-loads-filled-trailer-vans-to-form-cargoes.html|title=TANKERS TO CARRY 2-WAY PAY LOADS; Filled Trailer Vans to Form Cargoes for Vessels That Normally Carry Ballast|work=New York Times| date= April 27, 1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; later called containers, aboard a refitted tanker ship, the {{SS|Ideal X}}, and sailed them from [[Newark, New Jersey]] to [[Houston|Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson2006&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}} Independently of the events in Canada, McLean had the idea of using large containers that never opened in transit and that were transferable on an intermodal basis, among trucks, ships, and railroad cars. McLean had initially favored the construction of &quot;trailerships&quot;—taking trailers from large trucks and stowing them in a ship's [[cargo]] hold. This method of stowage, referred to as [[roll-on/roll-off]], was not adopted because of the large waste in potential cargo space on board the vessel, known as broken [[stowage]]. Instead, McLean modified his original concept into loading just the containers, not the chassis, onto the ship; hence the designation &quot;container ship&quot; or &quot;box&quot; ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;CudahyB-TRN-2006-Sep-Oct&quot;&gt;Cudahy, Brian J.,  [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/trnews/trnews246.pdf &quot;The Containership Revolution: Malcom McLean's 1956 Innovation Goes Global&quot;].

During the first 20 years of containerization, many container sizes and corner fittings were used; there were dozens of incompatible container systems in the United States alone. Among the biggest operators, the [[Matson Navigation Company]] had a fleet of {{convert|24|ft|m|2|adj=on}} containers, while [[Sea-Land Service, Inc]] used {{convert|35|ft|m|2|adj=on}} containers. The standard sizes and fitting and reinforcement norms that now exist evolved out of a series of compromises among international shipping companies, European railroads, US railroads, and US trucking companies. Four important ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]]) recommendations standardized containerization globally:&lt;ref name=&quot;Rushton&quot;&gt;Rushton, A., Oxley, J., Croucher, P. (2004). ''The Handbook of Logistics and Distribution Management''. Kogan Page: London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 1968: '''[[ISO 668]]''' defined the terminology, dimensions and ratings.
* July 1968: '''R-790''' defined the identification markings.
* January 1970: '''R-1161''' made recommendations about corner fittings.
* October 1970: '''R-1897''' set out the minimum internal dimensions of general purpose freight containers.

Based on these standards, the first [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] container ship was the Japanese ''[[:de:Hakone Maru]]'' from shipowner NYK, who started sailing in 1968 and could carry 752 TEU containers.

In the United States, containerization and other advances in shipping were impeded by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC), which was created in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to [[regulatory capture]]. By the 1960s, ICC approval was required before any shipper could carry different items in the same vehicle or change rates. The fully integrated systems in the United States today became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Postrel |first =Virginia |title =The Box that Changed the World | work =Dynamist.com | date =2006-03-23 | url =http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/archives/002097.html | access-date =2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double-stack rail transport|Double-stacked rail transport]], where containers are stacked two high on railway cars, was introduced in the United States. The concept was developed by Sea-Land and the Southern Pacific railroad. The first standalone double-stack container car (or single-unit 40-ft COFC well car) was delivered in July 1977. The 5-unit well car, the industry standard, appeared for the first time in 1981. Initially, these double-stack railway cars were deployed in regular train service. Ever since American President Lines initiated in 1984 a dedicated double-stack container train service between Los Angeles and Chicago, transport volumes increased rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Effects ===
[[File:Shanghai Express Port of Rotterdam 17-Apr-2006.jpg|thumb|''Shanghai Express'', [[Port of Rotterdam]]]]

Containerization greatly reduced the expense of [[international trade]] and increased its speed, especially of consumer goods and commodities. It also dramatically changed the character of port cities worldwide. Prior to highly mechanized container transfers, crews of 20–22 [[longshoremen]] would pack individual cargoes into the hold of a ship. After containerization, large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.

Meanwhile, the port facilities needed to support containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports and the rise of others. At the [[Port of San Francisco]], the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring [[port of Oakland]] emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|ports of Manhattan and New Jersey]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[Port of London]] and [[Port of Liverpool]] declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's [[Port of Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Rotterdam]] in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, [[inland port]]s on waterways incapable of deep-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of [[seaport]]s. With intermodal containers, the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.

The effects of containerization rapidly spread beyond the shipping industry. Containers were quickly adopted by trucking and rail transport industries for cargo transport not involving sea transport. Manufacturing also evolved to adapt to take advantage of containers. Companies that once sent small consignments began grouping them into containers. Many cargoes are now designed to fit precisely into containers. The reliability of containers also made [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just in time manufacturing]] possible as component suppliers could deliver specific components on regular fixed schedules.

In 2004, the global container's traffic was of 354 millions of [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]], with an estimated 82-per-cent share handled by the top-100 container ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Jixian Wang | url = https://books.google.com/?id=PfOcUn9GCc4C&amp;pg=PA71 | title = Ports, Cities, and Global Supply Chains | language = en | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | date = Jan 1, 2007| oclc  = 1074025516 |pages =61–72|isbn = 9780754670544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009}}, approximately 90% of non-[[bulk cargo]] worldwide is moved by containers stacked on transport ships;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ebeling | first = C. E. | title = Evolution of a Box | journal = Invention and Technology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 8–9 | date = Winter 2009 | issn = 8756-7296}}&lt;/ref&gt; 26% of all container [[transshipment]] is carried out in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.SHP.GOOD.TU |title=Container port traffic (TEU: 20 foot equivalent units) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2009 there were 105,976,701 transshipments in China (both international and coastal, excluding Hong Kong), 21,040,096 in Hong Kong (which is listed separately), and only 34,299,572 in the United States. In 2005, some 18 million containers made over 200 million trips per year. Some ships can carry over {{TEU|14,500|first=yes}}, such as the ''[[Emma Mærsk]]'', {{convert|396|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, launched in August 2006. It has been predicted that, at some point, container ships will be constrained in size only by the depth of the [[Straits of Malacca]], one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, linking the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. This so-called [[Malaccamax]] size constrains a ship to dimensions of {{convert|470|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;box&quot;/&gt;

However, few initially foresaw the extent of the influence of containerization on the [[shipping industry]]. In the 1950s, Harvard University economist [[Benjamin Chinitz]] predicted that containerization would benefit New York by allowing it to ship its industrial goods more cheaply to the Southern United States than other areas, but he did not anticipate that containerization might make it cheaper to import such goods from abroad. Most economic studies of containerization merely assumed that shipping companies would begin to replace older forms of transportation with containerization, but did not predict that the process of containerization itself would have a more direct influence on the choice of producers and increase the total volume of trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;box&quot;/&gt;

The widespread use of ISO standard containers has driven modifications in other freight-moving standards, gradually forcing removable truck bodies or [[swap body|swap bodies]] into standard sizes and shapes (though without the strength needed to be stacked), and changing completely the worldwide use of freight [[pallet]]s that fit into ISO containers or into commercial vehicles.

Improved cargo security is also an important benefit of containerization. Once the cargo is loaded into a container, it isn't touched again until it reaches its destination. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.courtesytransferinc.com/detroit-michigan-intermodal-transport-and-drayage/|title=Detroit, Michigan Intermodal Transport and Drayage {{!}} Courtesy Transfer Inc.|work=Courtesy Transfer Inc.|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when the doors are opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.

The use of the same basic sizes of containers across the globe has lessened the problems caused by incompatible [[rail gauge]] sizes in different countries.  The majority of the rail networks in the world operate on a {{RailGauge|sg}} gauge track known as [[standard gauge]], but many countries (such as Russia, India, Finland, and Lithuania) use [[broad gauge|broader gauges]], while many others in Africa and South America use [[narrow gauge|narrower gauges]] on their networks. The use of container trains in all these countries makes transshipment between different trains of different gauges easier.

Containers have become a popular way to [[Car shipping|ship private cars and other vehicles]] overseas using 20- or 40-foot containers. Unlike [[roll-on/roll-off]] vehicle shipping, personal effects can be loaded into the container with the vehicle, allowing for easy international relocation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In July, 2020, The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA), a non-profit group established to further digitalisation of container shipping technology standards, published standards for the digital exchange of operational vessel schedules (OVS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DCSA publishes standards for digital schedules |url=https://www.globalcargonews.com/dcsa-publishes-standards-for-digital-schedules |access-date=8 July 2020 |issue=8 July 2020 |publisher=Global Cargo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Container standards ==

=== ISO standard ===
&lt;!-- Please do not change the above heading; if it has to be changed, then please change the huge number of links to Containerization#ISO_standard. --&gt;
{{Main article|Intermodal container}}

There are five common [[wikt:standardization|standard]] lengths:
*{{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|45|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|48|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|53|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}

US domestic standard containers are generally {{convert|48|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|53|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (rail and truck). Container capacity is often expressed in [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEU, or sometimes ''teu''). An equivalent unit is a measure of containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (length) × {{convert|8|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} (width) container. As this is an approximate measure, the height of the box is not considered. For instance, the {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} ''high cube'' and the {{convert|4|ft|3|in|m|2|abbr=on}} ''half height'' {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} containers are also called one TEU. 48' containers have been phased out over the last ten years in favor of 53' containers.

The maximum gross mass for a {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} dry cargo container was initially set at {{convert|24,000|kg|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|30,480|kg|abbr=on}}for a {{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} container (including the {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}} &lt;!-- {{convert|2.87|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=or}} --&gt; high cube) . Allowing for the [[tare weight|tare mass]] of the container, the maximum payload mass is therefore reduced to approximately {{convert|22,000|kg|abbr=on}} for {{convert|20|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|27,000|kg|abbr=on}} for {{convert|40|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emase.co.uk/data/cont.html |title=Shipping containers |publisher=Emase |access-date=2007-02-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143514/http://emase.co.uk/data/cont.html |archive-date=2009-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was increased to 30,480 kg for the 20' in 2005, then further increased to a max of 36,000 kg for all sizes by the amendment 2 (2016) of the ISO standard 668 (2013).

The original choice of {{convert|8|ft|m|2|adj=on}} height for ISO containers was made in part to suit a large proportion of railway tunnels, though some had to be modified.  The current standard is {{convert|8|ft|6|in|m|2|spell=in}} high. With the arrival of even taller hi-cube containers at {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|2|spell=in}} and [[Double-stack rail transport|double stacking]] rail cars, further enlargement of the rail [[loading gauge]] is proving necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railwaysafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3493&amp;Itemid=36|title=Railways Africa|first=Railways|last=Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air freight containers ===

{{Main article|Unit load device}}

While major airlines use containers that are custom designed for their aircraft and associated ground handling equipment the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] has created a set of standard aluminium container sizes of up to {{convert|11.52|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in volume.

== Container loading ==

=== Full container load ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
A full container load (FCL) is an [[ISO standard]] container that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, it means that the whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower [[freight rate]]s than an equivalent weight of [[cargo]] in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on [[ocean freight]] does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.

=== Less-than-container load ===
{{See also|less-than-carload}}
Less-than-container load (LCL) is a [[shipment]] that is not large enough to fill a standard [[cargo container]]. The abbreviation LCL formerly applied to &quot;less than (railway) car load&quot; for quantities of material from different shippers or for delivery to different destinations carried in a single [[Railway carriage|railway car]] for efficiency. LCL freight was often sorted and redistributed into different railway cars at intermediate [[railway terminal]]s en route to the final destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=This Fascinating Railroad Business |author=Henry, Robert Selph|author-link=Robert Selph Henry |publisher=The Bobs-Merrill Company |year=1942 |pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCL is &quot;a quantity of [[cargo]] less than that required for the application of a carload rate. A quantity of cargo less than that which fills the visible or rated capacity of an inter-modal container.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} It can also be defined as &quot;a consignment of cargo which is inefficient to fill a shipping container. It is grouped with other consignments for the same destination in a container at a container [[freight station]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knownet.hhs.gov/log/transDR/Glossary/definitions.htm |title=The Federal Logistics SuperSite&amp;nbsp;– The Federal Transportation Management Desk Reference: Glossary&amp;nbsp;– Definitions |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031151651/http://www.knownet.hhs.gov/log/transDR/Glossary/definitions.htm |archive-date=October 31, 2004 }}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Hazards ===
Containers have been used to [[Smuggling|smuggle]] [[contraband]] or [[Motor vehicle theft|stolen cars]]. The vast majority of containers are never subjected to scrutiny due to the large number of containers in use. In recent years there have been increased concerns that containers might be used to transport [[terrorist]]s or terrorist materials into a country undetected.  The US government has advanced the [[Container Security Initiative]] (CSI), intended to ensure that high-risk cargo is examined or scanned, preferably at the port of departure.

=== Empty containers ===
Containers are intended to be used constantly, being loaded with new cargo for a new destination soon after having been emptied of previous cargo. This is not always possible, and in some cases, the cost of transporting an empty container to a place where it can be used is considered to be higher than the worth of the used container. [[Shipping line]]s and container leasing companies have become expert at repositioning empty containers from areas of low or no demand, such as the US West Coast, to areas of high demand, such as China. Repositioning within the port hinterland has also been the focus of recent logistics optimization work. However, damaged or retired containers may also be recycled in the form of [[shipping container architecture]], or the steel content salvaged. In the summer of 2010, a worldwide shortage of containers developed as shipping increased after the recession, while new container production had largely ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalcargo.com/blog/bid/49979/Shipping-Container-Shortage-Pushing-Up-Prices |title=Shipping Container Shortage Pushing Up Prices |website=Universal Cargo |date=2010-08-19 |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[MV Rena]] ran aground off the coast of New Zealand. As the ship listed, some containers were lost, while others were held on board at a precarious angle.

=== Trade union challenges ===
Some of the biggest battles in the container revolution were waged in Washington, D.C.. Intermodal shipping got a huge boost in the early 1970s, when carriers won permission to quote combined rail-ocean rates. Later, non-vessel-operating [[common carrier]]s won a long court battle with a US Supreme Court decision against contracts that attempted to require that union labor be used for stuffing and stripping containers at off-pier locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/854/854.F2d.1338.82-1347.87-1370.html |title=854 F.2d 1338, 129 L.R.R.M.

== Other uses for containers ==
[[File:Container wendy house.JPG|thumb|upright|A converted container used as an office at a building site]]

[[Shipping container architecture]] is the use of containers as the basis for housing and other functional buildings for people, either as temporary or a permanent housing, and either as a main building or as a cabin or as a workshop. Containers can also be used as sheds or storage areas in industry and commerce.

Tempo Housing in Amsterdam stacks containers for individual housing units.

Containers are also beginning to be used to house computer data centers, although these are normally specialized containers.

There is now a high demand for containers to be converted in the domestic market to serve specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.containexperts.ie/container-conversions/ |title=Container Conversions Containexperts |first=Container Conversions|last=Containexperts|website=containexperts.ie|access-date=25 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a number of container-specific accessories have become available for a variety of applications, such as racking for archiving, lining, heating, lighting, powerpoints to create purpose-built secure offices, canteens and drying rooms, condensation control for furniture storage, and ramps for storage of heavier objects. Containers are also converted to provide equipment enclosures, pop-up cafes, exhibition stands, security huts and more.

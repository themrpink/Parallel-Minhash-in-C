HVDC allows power transmission between [[Synchronization (alternating current)|unsynchronized]] AC transmission systems. Since the power flow through an HVDC link can be controlled independently of the phase angle between source and load, it can stabilize a network against disturbances due to rapid changes in power. HVDC also allows transfer of power between grid systems running at different frequencies, such as 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. This improves the stability and economy of each grid, by allowing exchange of power between incompatible networks.

The modern form of HVDC transmission uses technology developed extensively in the 1930s in [[Sweden]] ([[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]]) and in [[Germany]]. Early commercial installations included one in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1951 between [[Moscow]] and [[Kashira]], and a 100&amp;nbsp;kV, 20&amp;nbsp;MW system between [[Gotland]] and mainland Sweden in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=High-voltage DC transmission: a power electronics workhorse |year=1996|doi=10.1109/6.486634|last1=Hingorani|first1=N.G.|journal=IEEE Spectrum|volume=33|issue=4|pages=63–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Chinese project of 2019, the longest HVDC link in the world was the [[Rio Madeira HVDC system|Rio Madeira]] link in [[Brazil]], which consists of two bipoles of ±600&amp;nbsp;kV,  3150&amp;nbsp;MW each, connecting [[Porto Velho]] in the state of [[Rondônia]] to the [[São Paulo]] area.

Many of these HVDC lines transfer power from renewable sources such as hydro and wind. For names, see also the [[List of HVDC projects#Maps|annotated version.]]]]

== High voltage transmission ==
[[High voltage]] is used for [[electric power]] transmission to reduce the energy lost in the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wires. For a given quantity of power transmitted, doubling the voltage will deliver the same power at only half the current. Since the power lost as heat in the wires is directly proportional to the square of the current, doubling the voltage reduces the line losses  by a factor of 4. While power lost in transmission can also be reduced by increasing the conductor size, larger conductors are heavier and more expensive.

High voltage cannot readily be used for lighting or motors, so transmission-level voltages must be reduced for end-use equipment. [[Transformer]]s are used to change the voltage levels in [[alternating current]] (AC) transmission circuits.  Transformers made voltage changes practical, and AC generators were more efficient than those using DC. These advantages led to early low voltage DC transmission systems being supplanted by AC systems around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Thomas Parke (1993). Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-80182-873-7}}, pages 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical conversion of power between AC and DC became possible with the development of [[power electronics]] devices such as [[mercury-arc valve]]s and, starting in the 1970s, semiconductor devices as [[thyristor]]s, [[integrated gate-commutated thyristor]]s (IGCTs), [[MOS-controlled thyristor]]s (MCTs) and [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBT).&lt;ref name=&quot;John Wiley and Sons&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jos Arrillaga|author2=Yonghe H.

==History==

===Electromechanical (Thury) systems===

[[Image:HVDCPylons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pylons of the [[Baltic Cable]] HVDC in Sweden]]
The first long-distance transmission of electric power was demonstrated using direct current in 1882 at [[Miesbach-Munich Power Transmission]], but only 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW was transmitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;guarnieri 7-3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Alternating Evolution of DC Power Transmission|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60–63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2272238|s2cid=23610440|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early method of HVDC transmission was developed by the Swiss engineer [[René Thury]]&lt;ref&gt;Donald Beaty et al, &quot;Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Ed.&quot;, McGraw Hill, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and his method was put into practice by 1889 in [[Italy]] by the ''Acquedotto De Ferrari-Galliera'' company. This system used series-connected [[motor-generator]] sets to increase the voltage. Each set was insulated from [[electrical ground]] and driven by insulated shafts from a [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]]. The transmission line was operated in a 'constant current' mode, with up to 5,000 volts across each machine, some machines having double [[commutator (electric)|commutators]] to reduce the voltage on each commutator. This system transmitted 630&amp;nbsp;kW at 14&amp;nbsp;kV DC over a distance of 120&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myinsulators.com/acw/bookref/histsyscable/ ACW's Insulator Info – Book Reference Info – History of Electrical Systems and Cables]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Black ''The History of Electric Wires and Cables'', Peter Perigrinus, London 1983 {{ISBN|0-86341-001-4}} pages 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lyon–Moutiers DC transmission scheme|Moutiers–Lyon]] system transmitted 8,600&amp;nbsp;kW of hydroelectric power a distance of 200&amp;nbsp;km, including 10&amp;nbsp;km of underground cable. This system used eight series-connected generators with dual commutators for a total voltage of 150&amp;nbsp;kV between the positive and negative poles, and operated from c.1906 until 1936. Fifteen Thury systems were in operation by 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Still, ''Overhead Electric Power Transmission'', McGraw Hill, 1913 page 145, available from the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Thury systems operating at up to 100&amp;nbsp;kV DC worked into the 1930s, but the rotating machinery required high maintenance and had high energy loss. Various other [[Mechanical rectifier|electromechanical devices]] were tested during the first half of the 20th century with little commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050826155135/http://www.tema.liu.se/tema-t/sirp/PDF/322_5.pdf &quot;Shaping the Tools of Competitive Power&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One technique attempted for conversion of direct current from a high transmission voltage to lower utilization voltage was to charge series-connected [[rechargeable battery|batteries]], then reconnect the batteries in parallel to serve distribution loads.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Hughes, ''Networks of Power''&lt;/ref&gt; While at least two commercial installations were tried around the turn of the 20th century, the technique was not generally useful owing to the limited capacity of batteries, difficulties in switching between series and parallel connections, and the inherent energy inefficiency of a battery charge/discharge cycle. (A modern [[battery storage power station]] includes transformers and inverters to change energy from alternating current to direct current forms at appropriate voltages.)

===Mercury arc valves===
First proposed in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Rissik, H., Mercury-Arc Current Converters, Pitman. 1941, chapter IX.&lt;/ref&gt; the grid controlled [[mercury-arc valve]] became available for power transmission during the period 1920 to 1940. Starting in 1932, [[General Electric]] tested mercury-vapor valves and a 12&amp;nbsp;kV DC transmission line, which also served to convert 40&amp;nbsp;Hz generation to serve 60&amp;nbsp;Hz loads, at [[Mechanicville, New York]].  In 1941, a 60&amp;nbsp;MW, ±200&amp;nbsp;kV, 115&amp;nbsp;km buried cable link was designed for the city of [[Berlin]] using mercury arc valves ([[Elbe-Project]]), but owing to the collapse of the [[Nazi Germany|German government in 1945]] the project was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408011745/http://www.rmst.co.il/HVDC_Proven_Technology.pdf &quot;HVDC TransmissionF&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The nominal justification for the project was that, during wartime, a buried cable would be less conspicuous as a bombing target. The equipment was moved to the [[Soviet Union]] and was put into service there as the Moscow–Kashira HVDC system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/Che2004/DITTMANN.pdf IEEE – IEEE History Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306135751/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/Che2004/DITTMANN.pdf |date=March 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moscow–Kashira system and the 1954 connection by [[Uno Lamm]]'s group at [[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]]  between the mainland of Sweden and the island of Gotland marked the beginning of the modern era of HVDC transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;guarnieri 7-3&quot;/&gt;

Mercury arc valves require an external circuit to force the current to zero and thus turn off the valve. In HVDC applications, the AC power system itself provides the means of ''commutating'' the current to another valve in the converter.  Consequently, converters built with mercury arc valves are known as line-commutated converters (LCC).  LCCs require rotating synchronous machines in the AC systems to which they are connected, making power transmission into a passive load impossible.

Mercury arc valves were common in systems designed up to 1972, the last mercury arc HVDC system (the [[Nelson River DC Transmission System#Bipole 1|Nelson River Bipole 1 system]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada) having been put into service in stages between 1972 and 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Cogle, T.C.J, The Nelson River Project – Manitoba Hydro exploits sub-arctic hydro power resources, Electrical Review, 23 November 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, all mercury arc systems have been either shut down or converted to use solid state devices. The last HVDC system to use mercury arc valves was the [[HVDC Inter-Island|Inter-Island HVDC link]] between the North and South Islands of New Zealand, which used them on one of its two poles. The mercury arc valves were decommissioned on 1 August 2012, ahead of commissioning of replacement thyristor converters.

===Thyristor valves===
Since 1977, new HVDC systems have used only [[solid-state device]]s, in most cases [[thyristor]]s.  Like mercury arc valves, thyristors require connection to an external AC circuit in HVDC applications to turn them on and off. HVDC using thyristors is also known as Line-Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC.

Development of thyristor valves for HVDC began in the late 1960s.  The first complete HVDC scheme based on thyristor was the [[Eel River Converter Station|Eel River]] scheme in Canada, which was built by [[General Electric]] and went into service in 1972.

On March 15, 1979, a 1920&amp;nbsp;MW thyristor based direct current connection between [[Cahora Bassa (HVDC)|Cabora Bassa]] and [[Johannesburg]] (1,410&amp;nbsp;km) was energized. The conversion equipment was built in 1974 by [[AEG|Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft AG (AEG)]], and [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] (BBC) and [[Siemens]] were partners in the project.  Service interruptions of several years were a result of a [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2017/energymanagement/pr2017080410emen.htm&amp;content[]=EM ''Siemens overhauls 15 converter transformers at Cahora Bassa HVDC link in Mozambique'', retrieved 2019 Jan 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The transmission voltage of ±533&amp;nbsp;kV was the highest in the world at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;guarnieri 7-3&quot;/&gt;

===Capacitor-commutated converters (CCC)===
Line-commutated converters have some limitations in their use for HVDC systems. This results from requiring the AC circuit to turn off the thyristor current and the need for a short period of 'reverse' voltage to effect the turn-off (turn-off time).  An attempt to address these limitations is the ''capacitor-commutated converter'' (''CCC'') which has been used in a small number of HVDC systems.  The CCC differs from a conventional HVDC system in that it has series [[capacitor]]s inserted into the AC line connections, either on the primary or secondary side of the converter transformer.  The series capacitors partially offset the ''commutating inductance'' of the converter and help to reduce fault currents.  This also allows a smaller ''extinction angle'' to be used with a converter/inverter, reducing the need for [[reactive power]] support.

However, CCC has remained only a niche application because of the advent of voltage-source converters (VSC) which completely eliminate the need for an extinction (turn-off) time.

==={{anchor|Voltage source converter}}Voltage-source converters (VSC)===
Widely used in [[Adjustable-speed drive|motor drives]] since the 1980s, voltage-source converters started to appear in HVDC in 1997 with the experimental [[HVDC Hellsjön–Grängesberg|Hellsjön–Grängesberg]] project in Sweden.  By the end of 2011, this technology had captured a significant proportion of the HVDC market.

The development of higher rated [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs), [[gate turn-off thyristor]]s (GTOs) and [[integrated gate-commutated thyristor]]s (IGCTs), has made smaller HVDC systems economical.  The manufacturer [[ABB Group]] calls this concept ''HVDC Light'', while [[Siemens]] calls a similar concept ''HVDC PLUS'' (''Power Link Universal System'') and [[Alstom]] call their product based upon this technology ''HVDC MaxSine''. They have extended the use of HVDC down to blocks as small as a few tens of megawatts and overhead lines as short as a few dozen kilometers. There are several different variants of VSC technology: most installations built until 2012 use [[pulse-width modulation]] in a circuit that is effectively an ultrahigh-voltage motor drive. Current installations, including HVDC PLUS and HVDC MaxSine, are based on variants of a converter called a ''Modular Multilevel Converter'' (MMC).

Multilevel converters have the advantage that they allow [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] filtering equipment to be reduced or eliminated altogether. By way of comparison, AC harmonic filters of typical line-commutated converter stations cover nearly half of the converter station area.

With time, voltage-source converter systems will probably replace all installed simple thyristor-based systems, including the highest DC power transmission applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Wiley and Sons&quot;/&gt;

== Comparison with AC ==
===Advantages===
A long-distance, point-to-point HVDC transmission scheme generally has lower overall investment cost and lower losses than an equivalent AC transmission scheme. HVDC conversion equipment at the terminal stations is costly, but the total DC transmission-line costs over long distances are lower than for an AC line of the same distance. HVDC requires less conductor per unit distance than an AC line, as there is no need to support [[three-phase electric power|three phases]] and there is no [[skin effect]].

Depending on voltage level and construction details, HVDC transmission losses are quoted as less than 3% per 1,000&amp;nbsp;km, which are 30 to 40% less than with AC lines, at the same voltage levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/power-transmission/hvdc/hvdc-classic.htm#content=Low%20Losses Siemens AG – Ultra HVDC Transmission System]&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|reason=promotional page with rotating content|date=May 2020}}{{better citation needed|date=May 2020}} This is because direct current transfers only active power and thus causes lower losses than alternating current, which transfers both [[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|active and reactive power]].

HVDC transmission may also be selected for other technical benefits. HVDC can transfer power between separate AC networks. HVDC powerflow between separate AC systems can be automatically controlled to support either network during transient conditions, but without the risk that a major [[Power outage|power-system collapse]] in one network will lead to a collapse in the second. HVDC improves on system controllability, with at least one HVDC link embedded in an AC grid—in the deregulated environment, the controllability feature is particularly useful where control of energy trading is needed.

The combined economic and technical benefits of HVDC transmission can make it a suitable choice for connecting electricity sources that are located far away from the main users.

Specific applications where HVDC transmission technology provides benefits include:
* [[Submarine power cable|Undersea-cable]] transmission schemes (e.g., the 580&amp;nbsp;km [[NorNed]] cable between Norway and the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;Skog, J.E., van Asten, H., Worzyk, T., Andersrød, T.,  Norned – World’s longest power cable, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] session, Paris, 2010, paper reference B1-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's 420&amp;nbsp;km [[SAPEI]] cable between [[Sardinia]] and the mainland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://new.abb.com/systems/hvdc/references/sapei |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415005900/http://new.abb.com/systems/hvdc/references/sapei |archive-date=2017-04-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 290&amp;nbsp;km [[Basslink]] between the Australian mainland and [[Tasmania]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Basslink]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and the 250&amp;nbsp;km [[Baltic Cable]] between [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/hvdc ABB HVDC] website&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Endpoint-to-endpoint long-haul bulk power transmission without intermediate 'taps,' usually to connect a remote generating plant to the main grid, for example the [[Nelson River DC Transmission System]] in [[Canada]].
* Increasing the capacity of an existing [[power grid]] in situations where additional wires are difficult or expensive to install.
* Power transmission and stabilization between unsynchronized AC networks, with the extreme example being an ability to transfer power between countries that use AC at different frequencies. Since such transfer can occur in either direction, it increases the stability of both networks by allowing them to draw on each other in emergencies and failures.
* Stabilizing a predominantly AC power grid, without increasing fault levels ([[prospective short-circuit current]]).
* Integration of renewable resources such as wind into the main transmission grid. HVDC overhead lines for onshore wind integration projects and HVDC cables for offshore projects have been proposed in North America and Europe for both technical and economic reasons. DC grids with multiple voltage-source converters (VSCs) are one of the technical solutions for pooling offshore wind energy and transmitting it to load centers located far away onshore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/files/2012/11/10mpe06-adapa-2213011-x.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904045746/http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/files/2012/11/10mpe06-adapa-2213011-x.pdf |date=2015-09-04 }} website&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cable systems ====
Long undersea or underground [[high-voltage cable]]s have a high electrical [[capacitance]] compared with overhead transmission lines, since the live conductors within the cable are surrounded by a relatively thin layer of insulation (the [[dielectric]]), and a metal sheath.  The geometry is that of a long coaxial [[capacitor]]. The total capacitance increases with the length of the cable.  This capacitance is in a [[parallel circuit]] with the load.  Where alternating current is used for cable transmission, additional current must flow in the cable to charge this cable capacitance. This extra current flow causes added energy loss via dissipation of heat in the conductors of the cable, raising its temperature. Additional energy losses also occur as a result of [[dielectric]] losses in the cable insulation.

However, if direct current is used, the cable capacitance is charged only when the cable is first energized or if the voltage level changes; there is no additional current required. For a sufficiently long AC cable, the entire current-carrying ability of the conductor would be needed to supply the charging current alone. This cable [[capacitance]] issue limits the length and power-carrying ability of AC power cables.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}},  pages 15-57 and 15-58&lt;/ref&gt; DC powered cables are limited only by their temperature rise and [[Ohm's Law|Ohm's law]]. Although some leakage current flows ''through'' the dielectric [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]], this is small compared to the cable's rated current.

'''Christian Felix Klein''' ({{IPA-de|klaɪn|lang}}; 25 April 1849&amp;nbsp;– 22 June 1925) was a German mathematician and mathematics educator, known for his work with [[group theory]], [[complex analysis]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and on the associations between [[geometry]] and [[group theory]]. His 1872 [[Erlangen program]], classifying geometries by their basic [[symmetry group]]s, was an influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the time.

==Life==
[[File:Felix Klein, Leipzig years.png|thumb|upright|Klein during his Leipzig period.]]
Felix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in [[Düsseldorf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Snyder, Virgil|authorlink=Virgil Snyder|title=Klein's Collected Works|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.]]|year=1922|volume=28|issue=3|pages=125–129|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183425933|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1922-03510-0|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Prussia]]n parents; his father, Caspar Klein (1809–1889), was a Prussian government official's secretary stationed in the [[Rhine Province]]. Klein's mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, [[Name at birth|née]] Kayser).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rüdiger Thiele|title=Felix Klein in Leipzig: mit F. Kleins Antrittsrede, Leipzig 1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KznSxd-HcckC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2011|isbn=978-3-937219-47-9|pages=195|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Düsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Bonn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Halsted, George Bruce|authorlink=G. B. Halsted|title=Biography: Felix Klein|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|year=1894|volume=1|issue=12|pages=416–420|jstor=2969034|doi=10.2307/2969034}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1865–1866, intending to become a physicist. At that time, [[Julius Plücker]] had Bonn's professorship of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, during 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Plücker, from the University of Bonn during 1868.

Plücker died during 1868, leaving his book concerning the basis of [[line geometry]] incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Plücker's ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'', and thus became acquainted with [[Alfred Clebsch]], who had relocated to Göttingen during 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the next year, along with visits to [[Berlin]] and Paris. During July 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a brief time he served as a medical orderly in the [[Prussian army]] before being appointed lecturer at Göttingen during early 1871.

[[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] appointed Klein professor during 1872, when he was only 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA546|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this, he was endorsed by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the best mathematician of his time. Klein did not desire a school at Erlangen where there were few students, and so he was pleased to be offered a professorship at [[Munich]]'s Technische Hochschule during 1875. There he and [[Alexander von Brill]] taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], [[Walther von Dyck]], [[Karl Rohn]], [[Carl Runge]], [[Max Planck]], [[Luigi Bianchi]], and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]].

During 1875 Klein married Anne Hegel, the granddaughter of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Chislenko, Eugene; Tschinkel, Yuri. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200708/tx070800960p.pdf &quot;The Felix Klein Protocols&quot;], ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', August 2007, Volume 54, Number 8, pp. 960–970.&lt;/ref&gt;

After five years at the Technische Hochschule, Klein was appointed to a chair of [[geometry]] at [[Leipzig]]. There his colleagues included [[Walther von Dyck]], Rohn, [[Eduard Study]] and [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]]. Klein's years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. During 1882, his health collapsed; during 1883–1884, he was plagued by depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pTwBwAAQBAJ&amp;q=mental|title=Hilbert|last=Reid|first=Constance|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1996|isbn=9781461207399|location=New York|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions dates from around this period, being published during 1886 and 1888.

Klein accepted a professorship at the [[University of Göttingen]] during 1886. From then until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish Göttingen as the world's main mathematics research center. Yet he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to Göttingen his own primacy as a developer of [[geometry]]. At Göttingen, he taught a variety of courses, mainly concerning the interface between mathematics and physics, such as [[mechanics]] and [[potential theory]].

The research facility Klein established at Göttingen served as a model for the best such facilities throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. During 1895, Klein hired [[David Hilbert]] away from the [[University of Königsberg]]; this appointment proved fateful, because Hilbert continued Göttingen's good reputation until his own retirement during 1932.

With Klein's editorship, ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' became one of the best mathematics journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, only with Klein's management did it first rival then surpass ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' based in the [[University of Berlin]]. Klein established a small team of editors who met regularly, making democratic decisions. The journal specialized in [[complex analysis]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[invariant theory]] (at least until Hilbert ended the subject). It also provided an important outlet for [[real analysis]] and the new [[group theory]].

During 1893 in Chicago, Klein was a major speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held as part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Case, Bettye Anne|editor-link=Bettye Anne Case|title=A Century of Mathematical Meetings|chapter=''Come to the Fair: The Chicago Mathematical Congress of 1893'' by David E. Rowe and Karen Hunger Parshall|year=1996|publisher=American Mathematical Society|page=64|isbn=9780821804650|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnkYqxyWGz8C&amp;pg=PA64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due partly to Klein's efforts, Göttingen began admitting women during 1893. He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at Göttingen by a woman; she was [[Grace Chisholm Young]], an English student of [[Arthur Cayley]]'s, whom Klein admired. During 1897 Klein became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001270 |title=Felix C. Klein (1849–1925) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1900, Klein began to become interested in mathematical instruction in schools. During 1905, he was decisive in formulating a plan recommending that [[analytic geometry]], the rudiments of differential and integral [[calculus]], and the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] concept be taught in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Gary McCulloch|editor2=David Crook|title=The Routledge International Encyclopedia of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA373|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-85358-9|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Alexander Karp|editor2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA499|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|pages=499–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world. During 1908, Klein was elected president of the [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] at the Rome [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Alexander Karp|editor2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Felix%20Klein%20as%20its%20first%20president%22&amp;pg=PA503|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his guidance, the German part of the Commission published many volumes on the teaching of mathematics at all levels in Germany.

The [[London Mathematical Society]] awarded Klein its [[De Morgan Medal]] during 1893. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] during 1885, and was awarded its [[Copley Medal]] during 1912. He retired the next year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for some years more.

Klein was one of the 93 signatories of the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]], a document penned in support of the German invasion of Belgium in the early stages of [[World War I]].

Klein had the title of [[Geheimrat]] (trusted-advisor).

He died in Göttingen during 1925.

==Work==
Klein's dissertation, on [[line geometry]] and its applications to [[mechanics]], classified second degree line complexes using [[Weierstrass]]'s theory of elementary divisors.

Klein's first important mathematical discoveries were made during 1870. In collaboration with [[Sophus Lie]], he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the [[Kummer surface]]. They later investigated [[W-curve]]s, curves invariant under a group of [[projective transformation]]s. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to have a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from [[Camille Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Acme klein bottle.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A hand-blown Klein Bottle]]
Klein devised the &quot;[[Klein bottle]]&quot; named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the &quot;inside&quot;. It may be embedded in the Euclidean space of dimensions 4 and higher. The concept of a Klein Bottle was devised as a 3-Dimensional [[Möbius strip]], with one method of construction being the attachment of the edges of two [[Möbius strip]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=Klein Bottles – Numberphile|date=22 June 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAsICMPwGPY|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1890s, Klein began studying [[mathematical physics]] more intensively, writing on the [[gyroscope]] with [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Werner Burau]] and [[:de:Bruno Schoeneberg]] &quot;Klein, Christian Felix.&quot; ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography|Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''. 2008. Retrieved 4 December 2014 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830902326.html&lt;/ref&gt; During 1894, he initiated the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the [[Klein's Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences|''Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften'']]. This enterprise, which endured until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (2009) ''Routes of Learning: Highways, Pathways, Byways in the History of Mathematics'', pp 44, 45, 90,  [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], {{isbn|0-8018-9248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erlangen program===
{{main article|Erlangen program}}
During 1871, while at Göttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers ''On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry'' showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered [[metric space]]s determined by a [[Cayley-Klein metric]]. This insight had the corollary that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] was consistent if and only if [[Euclidean geometry]] was, giving the same status to geometries Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and ending all controversy about non-Euclidean geometry. [[Arthur Cayley]] never accepted Klein's argument, believing it to be circular.

Klein's synthesis of [[geometry]] as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given [[transformation group|group of transformations]], known as the ''[[Erlangen program]]'' (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was initiated by Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified system of geometry that has become the accepted modern method. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of [[transformation group|transformation]]s that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.

Presently the significance of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now considered strange or wrong. On the contrary, those contributions have become so much a part of our present mathematical thinking that it is difficult for us to appreciate their novelty, and the way in which they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries.

===Complex analysis===
Klein saw his work on [[complex analysis]] as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:
*The link between certain ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s and [[invariant theory]],
*[[Number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]];
*[[Group theory]];
*[[Geometry]] with more than 3 dimensions and [[differential equations]], especially equations he invented, namely [[elliptic modular function]]s and [[automorphic function]]s.

Klein showed that the [[modular group]] moves the fundamental region of the [[complex plane]] so as to [[tessellation|tessellate]] that plane. During 1879, he examined the action of [[PSL(2,7)]], considered as an image of the [[modular group]], and obtained an explicit representation of a [[Riemann surface]] now termed the [[Klein quartic]]. He showed that that surface was a curve in [[projective space]], that its equation was ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and that its group of [[symmetry group|symmetries]] was [[PSL(2,7)]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 168. His ''Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale'' (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting [[potential theory]] and [[conformal mapping]]s. This work drew on notions from [[fluid dynamics]].

Klein considered equations of degree &gt; 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on the methods of [[Charles Hermite]] and [[Leopold Kronecker]], he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and later completely solved the problem by means of the [[icosahedral group]]. This work enabled him to write a series of papers on [[elliptic modular function]]s.

In his 1884 book on the [[icosahedron]], Klein established a theory of [[automorphic function]]s, associating algebra and geometry. However [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions during 1881, which resulted in a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand [[uniformization theorem]] that would establish the new theory more completely. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in describing a strategy for proving it. But while doing this work his health decreased, as mentioned above.

Klein summarized his work on [[automorphic function|automorphic]] and [[elliptic modular function]]s in a four volume treatise, written with [[Robert Fricke]] during a period of about 20 years.

{{Group theory sidebar}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''group theory''' studies the [[algebraic structure]]s known as [[group (mathematics)|groups]].  
The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s and [[axiom]]s. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.

Various physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]]. Group theory is also central to [[public key cryptography]].

The early [[history of group theory]] dates from the 19th century. One of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Elwes|first=Richard|url=http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html|title=An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups|journal=[[Plus Magazine]]|issue=41|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980, that culminated in a complete [[classification of finite simple groups]].

==Main classes of groups==
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}

The range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from [[Finite set|finite]] [[permutation group]]s and special examples of [[matrix group]]s to abstract groups that may be specified through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and [[Binary relation|relations]].

===Permutation groups===
The first [[Class (set theory)|class]] of groups to undergo a systematic study was [[permutation group]]s. Given any set ''X'' and a collection ''G'' of [[bijection]]s of ''X'' into itself (known as ''permutations'') that is closed under compositions and inverses, ''G'' is a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on ''X''. If ''X'' consists of ''n'' elements and ''G'' consists of ''all'' permutations, ''G'' is the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; in general, any permutation group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group of ''X''. An early construction due to [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself ({{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''}}) by means of the left [[regular representation]].

In many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[simple group|simple]], i.e. does not admit any proper [[normal subgroup]]s. This fact plays a key role in the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}} in radicals]].

===Matrix groups===
The next important class of groups is given by ''matrix groups'', or [[linear group]]s. Here ''G'' is a set consisting of invertible [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of given order ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the ''n''-dimensional vector space ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by [[linear transformation]]s. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group ''G''.

===Transformation groups===
Permutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of [[transformation group]]s: groups that act on a certain space ''X'' preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, ''X'' is a set; for matrix groups, ''X'' is a [[vector space]]. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a [[symmetry group]]: transformation groups frequently consist of ''all'' transformations that preserve a certain structure.
  
The theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with [[differential geometry]]. A long line of research, originating with [[Sophus Lie|Lie]] and [[Felix Klein|Klein]], considers group actions on [[manifold]]s by [[homeomorphism]]s or [[diffeomorphism]]s. The groups themselves may be [[discrete group|discrete]] or [[continuous group|continuous]].

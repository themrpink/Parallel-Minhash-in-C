'''''Spelljammer''''' is a [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (2nd edition) [[role-playing game]], which features a [[fantasy|fantastic]] (as opposed to [[science|scientific]]) [[outer space]] environment.

''Spelljammer'' introduced into the ''AD&amp;D'' universe a comprehensive system of fantasy [[astrophysics]], including the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] concept of crystal spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using [[ships]] equipped with &quot;spelljamming helms&quot;. Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into [[space]].  With their own fields of [[gravity]] and [[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]s of [[science fiction]], but instead look more like [[galleon]]s, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes.

The ''Spelljammer'' setting is designed to allow the usual [[sword and sorcery]] adventures of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' to take place within the framework of outer space tropes.  Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space, visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects.

Like the [[Planescape]] setting, ''Spelljammer'' unifies most of the other AD&amp;D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting (such as [[Dragonlance]]) to travel to another (such as the [[Forgotten Realms]]).  However, unlike Planescape it keeps all of the action on the [[Prime Material Plane]] and uses the crystal spheres, and the [[Phlogiston theory|&quot;phlogiston&quot;]] between them, to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the [[cosmology]] is derived largely from the [[Ptolemaic system]] of [[astronomy]], many of the ideas owe much to the works of [[Jules Verne]] and his contemporaries, and to related games and fiction with a [[steampunk]] or [[planetary romance]] flavor.  A strong [[Age of Sail]] flavor is also present.

==Setting==

=== Spelljamming helms ===
''Spelljamming helms'' are the central setting concept which allow interplanetary and interstellar space travel for vessels which would otherwise not be spaceworthy, in the form of a [[Ship's wheel|helm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rolston| first = Ken| authorlink = Ken Rolston| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #154| pages = 59â€“63| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any spellcaster may sit on a spelljammer helm to move the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt; The mysterious race known as the Arcane is the sole manufacturer and distributor of spelljamming helms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt; Within the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' universe, they are a method of converting magical energy into motive power.

===Gravity and air===
All bodies of a sufficiently large size have [[gravity]].  This gravity usually (but not always) exerts a force equal to the standard gravitational attraction on the surface of an Earth-sized planetary body.  Gravity in the ''Spelljammer'' universe is also an exceptionally convenient force, and almost always works such that &quot;down&quot; orients itself in a manner most humanoids would find sensible.

All bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object.  Unlike real-world astrophysics, this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space.  These bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time, but 3 months is considered &quot;standard&quot;.

===Crystal spheres===
A crystal sphere (also known as a crystal shell) is a gigantic spherical shell which contains an entire [[planetary system]]. Each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that is farthest from the sun or planet at the center of the sphere (the system's primary).

The surface of the sphere is called the &quot;sphere wall&quot; and separates the void of &quot;wildspace&quot; (within the sphere) from the &quot;phlogiston&quot; (that surrounds and flows outside the sphere). The sphere wall has no gravity and appears to be impossible to damage by any normal or magical means. Openings in the sphere wall called &quot;portals&quot; allow spelljamming ships or wildspace creatures to pass through and enter or exit from a crystal sphere. Portals can spontaneously open and close anywhere on the sphere wall. Magical spells (or magical items that reproduce their effects) can allow a portal to be located. Other magic can open a new portal or collapse an existing one. Ships or creatures passing through a portal when it closes may be cut in two.

Note that unlike the [[Ptolemaic system]], the crystal spheres are not nested within each other.

===Wildspace===
Wildspace is similar to the outer space of science fiction, with planets, asteroids and stars, but with different physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt; Gravity is either none or the same as that of Earth, and is directed towards the center of planet-sized bodies; on large objects in space like spacecraft and enormous creatures gravity is directed towards a flat plane running through the object's long axis, allowing characters to stand on the decks of ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt;

===The Phlogiston===
The [[phlogiston]] is essentially a big ocean of a unique element that is neither air, fire, water, or earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt; The phlogiston (also known as &quot;the Flow&quot;) is a bright, extremely combustible gas-like medium that exists between the Crystal Spheres.  A signature property of the substance is that it does not exist within the boundaries of a crystal sphere, to the degree that it cannot be brought into a crystal sphere by any known means up to and including the direct will of deities. Every crystal sphere floats in the phlogiston, very slowly bobbing up and down over time.  Travel between Crystal Spheres is facilitated by the formation of &quot;Flow rivers&quot; &amp;mdash; sections of the phlogiston which have a [[wikt:current|current]] and greatly reduce travel time.  Travel through the &quot;slow flow&quot; (i.e. off the Flow rivers) is possible, but very dangerous.

===The ''Spelljammer''===
The ''Spelljammer'' is a legendary ship which looks like a gigantic [[manta ray]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon #154&quot;/&gt; and houses an entire city on its back.  All spacefarers (people who live in wildspace) have heard of the ''Spelljammer'' but very few have ever seen it themselves. It is this ship that gives its name to &quot;spelljamming&quot;, &quot;spelljamming helms&quot; and anything else connected with spelljamming. The ship has been reported to have been seen in countless spheres for as long as records go back. Even some groundlings (people who live on planets that have very little or no commerce with spelljamming communities) have legends about it. There are hundreds of conflicting legends about this ship, and a mythology has developed about the ship that is similar to the legends surrounding ''[[The Flying Dutchman]]''.

As a living thing (although it does not consume any matter, it does absorb heat and light through its ventral (or under) side and uses them to produce air and food for its inhabitants), the ''Spelljammer'' has a complex life cycle and means of procreation. Normally the ship has no captain and wanders the cosmos seemingly aimlessly. When the ''Spelljammer'' has a captain, obtained through another complex process, it will create Smalljammers (miniature versions of the ''Spelljammer'') that go forth as its spawn. Apparently there can only be one Spelljammer at any one time. One Smalljammer will mature into a full ''Spelljammer'' ship if its predecessor is ever destroyed.

===Races===
Alien races inhabiting the Spelljammer universe included [[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|humans]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], xenophobic [[Beholder (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|beholders]], rapacious [[neogi]], militant [[Giff (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|giff]] (humanoid [[Hippopotamus|hippopotami]]), centaurlike dracons, hubristic [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elf]] armadas, spacefaring orcs called &quot;scro&quot;, mysterious [[mercane|arcane]], the [[Thri-kreen]] insectoids, and bumbling tinker [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]]. [[Illithid]]s were another major race, but were presented as more mercantile and less overtly evil than in other D&amp;D settings. The ''Monstrous Compendium'' series added many more minor races.  The simian Hadozee were also introduced into the setting, and later incorporated into the 3.5 rules in the supplemental book ''[[Stormwrack]]''.

==Publication history==
Shannon Appelcline commented on Spelljammer's 1989 release as the first of TSR's new campaign settings: &quot;The first of these new settings was Jeff Grubbâ€™s innovative science fantasy Spelljammer (1989), which introduced a universe of magical starships traversing the â€˜crystal spheresâ€™ that contained all the earthbound AD&amp;D campaign worlds. It suggested a method to connect together all of TSR's settings and at the same time introduced fun new Jules Verne-esque technology that had never before been seen in the game. It was innovative and popular.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;designers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}  He added that &quot;Spelljammer (1989), which offered a way to connect every single ''D&amp;D'' fantasy world, was thus one of the first true crossovers&quot; in role-playing games.&lt;ref name=&quot;designers&quot;/&gt;{{rp|219}} Appelcline commented on the end of the setting: &quot; TSRâ€™s fifth second-edition campaign world, Planescape (1993), was released to replace Spelljammer, which had just then ended. TSR wanted a new world-spanning setting and Slade Henson came up with the answer by suggesting a new setting built on Jeff Grubb's first-edition ''Manual of the Planes'' (1987). [...] Unlike Spelljammer this new setting had a strong geographical centre, the City of Sigil, resolving a flaw in the Spelljammer setting that denied players a good home base.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;designers&quot;/&gt;{{rp|26}}

=== ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (2nd edition) ===
The ''[[Spelljammer: AD&amp;D Adventures in Space|Spelljammer]]'' space fantasy supplement was released in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924195557/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| url-status=dead| archivedate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s other campaign worlds had their own sections in the ''Spelljammer Boxed Set'' - ''Realmspace'' for the [[Forgotten Realms]], ''Krynnspace'' for [[Dragonlance]], and ''Greyspace'' for [[Greyhawk]].  Along with the new sphere - ''Clusterspace'' - they were known as the &quot;Big Three and Astromundi&quot;. [[Dark Sun]], [[Ravenloft]] and [[Mystara]] weren't included, as the first two did not fit with the setting and the Mystara only used the D&amp;D rules, not the AD&amp;D rules.

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of SpelljammerAdventuresInSpaceBox.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SpelljammerAdventuresInSpaceBox.jpg for rationale --&gt;
The core ''Spelljammer'' product line consisted of four boxed sets:

* ''[[Spelljammer: AD&amp;D Adventures in Space]]'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-762-9}}) introduced the setting and provided the basic rules for spelljamming travel
* ''The Legend of Spelljammer'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-083-4}}) expanded on the setting, in particular the ''Spelljammer'' itself
* The ''War Captain's Companion'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-343-4}}) provided more detailed ship-to-ship combat rules
* ''[[The Astromundi Cluster]]'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-632-8}}) provided a roleplaying campaign for the setting

The line was expanded by a number of accessories:

* ''[[Lost Ships]]'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-831-5}}) expanded the number of ships
* ''Practical Planetology'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-134-2}}) assisted DMs who wished to create their own spelljamming setting
* ''The Rock of Bral'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-345-0}}) provided a home base for adventuring parties
* ''[[Realmspace]]'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-052-4}}), ''[[Krynnspace]]'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-560-7}}) and ''[[Greyspace]]'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-348-5}}) gave information about the crystal spheres housing TSR's three main campaign worlds

TSR also published a DM's screen ({{ISBN|1-56076-053-2}}) and two ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]s'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-871-4}} and {{ISBN|1-56076-071-0}}).

A series of five connected adventures was released in the modules:

* ''[[Wildspace (module)|Wildspace]]'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-819-6}})
* ''[[Skull &amp; Crossbows]]'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-845-5}})
* ''[[Crystal Spheres]]'' ({{ISBN|0-88038-878-1}})
* ''Under the Dark Fist'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-131-8}}) 
* ''Goblins' Return'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-149-0}})

Also published was a longer campaign, ''Heart of the Enemy'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-342-6}}) and ''Space Lairs'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-609-3}}) contained short standalone adventures.

When TSR started to produce a line of handbooks in 1992, they added the ''Complete Spacefarer's Handbook'' ({{ISBN|1-56076-347-7}}) to cover spelljamming travel.

A full product list is given in the [[#External links|external links]].

=== ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (3rd edition) ===
The ''Spelljammer'' line of products was discontinued by TSR before they were acquired by [[Wizards of the Coast]].

In May 2002, [[Paizo]] published an article for Spelljammer in ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #92 titled &quot;Spelljammer: Shadow of the Spider Moon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Monsters of Spelljammer|Spelljammer monsters]] such as neogi and giff were not used. Instead, it featured creatures from the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' such as [[Drow (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|drow]], formians and yuan-ti.

In May 2005, [[Wizards of the Coast]] updated the [[Neogi]] to 3rd edition rules in hardcover supplement [[Lords of Madness]]. The book included a chapter with a sample map of a crashed Spelljamming vessel, cultural habits of the [[Neogi]], and the monster's stat blocks.

=== ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (4th edition) ===
''Spelljammer'' content appears in the 4th edition ''Manual of the Planes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; referencing Spelljammer ships as one method of traveling between planes (and providing information for in-game use for an example Spelljammer vessel).

=== ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (5th edition) ===
''Spelljammer'' content also appears in the 5th edition ''Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In the adventure, a Spelljammer ship and its Illithid crew appear stranded in level 19 of the titular dungeon.

== Spinoffs ==
As was common practice at TSR at the time, a number of tie-in products were produced for the ''Spelljammer'' line.

===Comics===
Fifteen comics set in the ''Spelljammer'' universe were published by [[DC Comics]] between September 1990 and November 1991 with the creative team of Barbara Kesel, Michael Collins and Dan Panosian. ''[[Spelljammer (comics)|Spelljammer]]'' comics also uses Jasmine, a winged human character originally introduced from [[Forgotten Realms (comic)|Forgotten Realms comics]], as one of the lead characters.

===Novels===
Six novels set in the ''Spelljammer'' universe were published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], before TSR was incorporated into [[Wizards of the Coast]].  The novels were interconnected and formed &quot;The Cloakmaster Cycle&quot;. The novels tell the story of Teldin Moore, a 'groundling' farmer on Krynn who has a powerful and apparently cursed magical cloak that was given to him. He then ends up on a quest, which takes him first into wildspace and then away from his home sphere to distant crystal spheres. The series showcases the wonders and perils of the Spelljammer universe. The novels are now out of print.

===Computer games===
Only one computer game set in the ''Spelljammer'' universe was ever produced. It was published by [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]] in 1992 and was called ''[[Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace]]''.

In 2002 a team of freelance game modification developers created &quot;The Arcane Space Tileset&quot; for  ''[[Neverwinter Nights (2002 video game)|Neverwinter Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/arcane-space-tileset &quot;The Arcane Space Tileset&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; This tileset included Spelljamming ships, space and atmospheric terrains, along with monsters and NPCs, all set within the Spelljammer Campaign setting.

==Reception==
In the January 1990 edition  of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 12), James Wallis was not a fan of the initial release, ''[[Spelljammer: AD&amp;D Adventures in Space]]'', finding inconsistencies in the combat rules, saying, &quot;The cumulative effect of these inconsistencies is to make space combat unplayable.&quot; He did find the background &quot;imaginative and consistent, but unfortunately there is little of it.&quot; Although he admired the production values of the components, he found the book disorganized to the point of &quot;disarray and confusion.&quot; He concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5, saying, &quot;''Spelljammer'' may score well physically but fails mentally [...] Scavenging ''[[AD&amp;D]]'' players who enjoy stripping tasty ideas from the carcasses of dying games may find it of interest, but I cannot recommend it to anyone else.&quot;&lt;ref name=gi&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wallis|first=James| date=January 1990 |title=Spelljammer|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=12|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baez's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on American popular music. She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace. [[Pete Seeger]], [[Odetta]], and decades-long friend [[Harry Belafonte]] were her early social justice advocate influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joan-baez-9195061|title=Joan Baez|website=Biography.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baez came to be considered the &quot;most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s&quot;.&lt;ref name = Baez1941&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3830.html Joan Baez].

===1970s and the end of Vanguard years===
[[File:Joan Baez Hamburg 1973 2811730005.jpg|thumb|left |Baez playing in Hamburg, 1973| alt=Joan Baez playing on stage in a Hamburg TV studio, 1973]]
After eleven years with Vanguard, Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since 1960. She delivered Vanguard one last success with the gold-selling album ''[[Blessed Are...]]'' (1971), which included a top-ten hit in &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, her cover of [[The Band]]'s signature song. With ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'' (1972), Baez switched to [[A&amp;M Records]], where she remained for four years and six albums.

Joan Baez wrote &quot;The Story of Bangladesh&quot; in 1971. This song was based on the Pakistani army crackdown on unarmed sleeping Bengali students at Dhaka University on March 25, 1971, which ignited the prolonged nine-month [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/joan_baez260306.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094644/http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/joan_baez260306.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 7, 2014|title=Joan Baez and our Liberation War Avijit Roy|date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was later entitled &quot;The Song of Bangladesh&quot; and released in a 1972 album from Chandos Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joanbaez.com/Lyrics/bangladesh.html Words and Music by Joan Baez, Song of Bangladesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210083940/http://www.joanbaez.com/Lyrics/bangladesh.html |date=February 10, 2012 }}, lyrics joanbaez.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period in late 1971, she reunited with composer [[Peter Schickele]] to record two tracks, &quot;Rejoice in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Silent Running&quot; for the [[science fiction|science-fiction]] film ''[[Silent Running]]''. The two songs were issued as a single on [[Decca Records|Decca]] (32890). In addition to this, another LP was released on Decca (DL 7-9188) and was later reissued by [[Varèse Sarabande]] on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998, a limited release on CD by the &quot;Valley Forge Record Groupe&quot; was released.

Baez's first album for A&amp;M, ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'', was recorded in Nashville, and included a number of more personal compositions, including &quot;Love Song to a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Myths&quot;, as well as work by Mimi Farina, John Lennon, and Anna Marly.

''[[Where Are You Now, My Son?]]'' (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the album. Half [[spoken word]] poem and half tape-recorded sounds, the song documented Baez's visit to [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]], in December 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long [[Christmas Bombings]] campaign over Hanoi and [[Haiphong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2002/12/26/joan_baez Democracy Now, December 26, 2002] (audio). Interview with Joan Baez by Amy Goodman.  ''[[Democracy Now]]''. Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See Vietnam War in [[Joan Baez#Civil Rights|Civil rights]] section below.)''

''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]'' (1974) (the title song written and first performed by Chilean folk singer [[Violeta Parra]]) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and Latin America. It included the song &quot;[[Cucurrucucú paloma]]&quot;. Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for ''[[Diamonds &amp; Rust]]'' (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track.

After ''[[Gulf Winds]]'' (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs and ''[[From Every Stage]]'' (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs &quot;from every stage&quot; of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] for ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) and ''[[Honest Lullaby]]'' (1979).

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Baez was given honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degrees by [[Antioch University]] and [[Rutgers University]] for her political activism and the &quot;universality of her music&quot;. In 1983, she appeared on the [[Grammy Awards]], performing Dylan's anthemic &quot;[[Blowin' in the Wind]]&quot;, a song she first performed twenty years earlier.

Santana in workman's shirt &amp; knit cap. | [[Bob Dylan]], Joan Baez, [[Carlos Santana]], performing in May 1984, [[Hamburg]]]]

Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert for African famine relief, opening the U.S. segment of the show in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including [[Amnesty International]]'s 1986 ''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' tour and a guest spot on their subsequent ''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' tour.

Baez found herself without an American label for the release of ''[[Live -Europe '83|Live Europe 83]]'' (1984), which was released in Europe and Canada but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album ''[[Recently (album)|Recently]]'' (1987) on [[Gold Castle Records]].

In 1987, Baez's second autobiography, called ''And a Voice to Sing With'', was published and became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]]. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].

In May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in [[communism|communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] called Bratislavská lýra. While there, she met future [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak president]] [[Václav Havel]], whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of [[Charter 77]], a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing ''[[a cappella]]'' for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's [[Velvet Revolution]], the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated Communist government there was overthrown.

Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle: ''[[Speaking of Dreams]]'', (1989) and ''[[Brothers in Arms (Joan Baez album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' (1991). She then landed a contract with a major label, [[Virgin Records]], recording ''[[Play Me Backwards]]'' (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by [[EMI]]. She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'' (1995), and a studio album, ''[[Gone from Danger]]'' (1997).

In 1993, at the invitation of [[Refugees International]] and sponsored by the [[Soros Foundation]], she traveled to the war-torn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] region of former-[[Yugoslavia]] in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in [[Sarajevo]] since the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav civil war]].

In October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on [[Alcatraz Island]] (a former [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. federal prison]]) in San Francisco, California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi's Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996.

===2000s===
Beginning in 2001, Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco's [[Teatro ZinZanni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaezSFChron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/12/DD231448.DTL |title= Now it's Countess Baez |first= Steve|last= Winn |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= October 12, 2001 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, Vanguard began re-releasing Baez's first 13 albums, which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971. The reissues, being released through Vanguard's Original Master Series, feature digitally restored sound, unreleased bonus songs, new and original artwork, and new [[liner notes|liner-note]] essays written by Arthur Levy. Likewise, her six A&amp;M albums were reissued in 2003.

In 2003, Baez was also a judge for the third annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2004.asp 3rd Annual Independent Music Awards&amp;nbsp;– Judges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112142917/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2004.asp |date=November 12, 2015 }} ''Independent Music Awards''; Music Resource Group, LLC, 2004.

On October 1, 2005, she performed at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival, at San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]]. Then, on January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of [[Lou Rawls]], where she led [[Jesse Jackson]], Sr., Wonder, and others in the singing of &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot;. On June 6, 2006, Baez joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem &quot;[[Pay Me My Money Down]]&quot;. In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot; to a [[Starbucks]]'s exclusive XM Artist Confidential album. In the new version, she changed the lyric &quot;here's to the dawn of their days&quot; to &quot;here's to the dawn of ''her'' days&quot;, as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969. Later on, October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the [[Forum 2000]] international conference in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. Her performance was kept secret from former [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic President]] Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work. During Baez's next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague's [[Lucerna Music Bar#Lucerna Palace|Lucerna Hall]], a building erected by Havel's grandfather. On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]]'s Christmas Concert at the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Oakland]], California. Her participation included versions of &quot;[[Songs of the Underground Railroad#Songs Associated with the Underground Railroad|Let Us Break Bread Together]]&quot; and &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot;. She also joined the choir in the finale of &quot;[[O Holy Night]]&quot;.[[File:Dresden 07 2008 135 (2684499251).jpg|thumb|left | alt=Baez plays outdoors in brown wide-leg pants, white top, brown waistcoat, blue pearls, and a long orange neck scarf.

In February 2007, [[Proper Records]] reissued her live album ''Ring Them Bells'' (1995), which featured duets with artists ranging from [[Dar Williams]] and Mimi Fariña to the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]. The reissue features a 16-page booklet and six unreleased live tracks from the original recording sessions, including &quot;[[Love Song To A Stranger]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]&quot;, &quot;[[Geordie (ballad)|Geordie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Gracias a la Vida]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Water Is Wide (song)|The Water Is Wide]]&quot; and &quot;[[Stones in the Road]]&quot;, bringing the total track listing to 21 songs (on two discs). In addition, Baez recorded a duet of &quot;Jim Crow&quot; with [[John Mellencamp]] which appears on his album ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' (2007). He has called the album a &quot;[[Woody Guthrie]] rock album&quot;. The recording was heavily influenced by albums from the 1960s, which is why he invited an [[wikt:icon|icon]] from that era to appear with him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Also in February 2007, she received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==Social and political involvement==
To reward her decades of dedicated activism, Baez was honoured with the Spirit of Americana/Free Speech award at the 2008 [[Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards]].

===1950s===
In 1956, Baez first heard [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], speak about nonviolence, civil rights and [[social change]] which brought tears to her eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Masters&quot; /&gt; Several years later, the two became friends,&lt;ref name=&quot;American Masters&quot; /&gt; with Baez participating in many of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] demonstrations that Dr. King helped organize.

===Civil rights===
The early years of Baez's career saw the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the U.S. become a prominent issue. Her performance of &quot;[[We Shall Overcome]]&quot;, the civil rights anthem written by [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Guy Carawan]], at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] permanently linked her to the song. Baez again sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; in [[Sproul Plaza]] during the mid-1960s [[Free Speech Movement]] demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Berkeley, California]], and at many other rallies and protests.

Her recording of the song &quot;[[Birmingham Sunday]]&quot; (1964), written by her brother-in-law, Richard Fariña, was used in the opening of ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary film about the four young victims killed in the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]].

In 1965, Baez announced that she would be opening a school to teach nonviolent protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanekamp|first=Joan|title=Diamonds &amp; Rust: a Bibliography and Discography on Joan Baez|year=1980|publisher=The Pierian Press|isbn=978-0-87650-113-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Vietnam War===
Highly visible in civil-rights marches, Baez became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War. In 1964, she publicly endorsed [[tax resistance|resisting taxes]] by withholding sixty percent of her 1963 income taxes. In 1964, she founded the [[Institute for the Study of Nonviolence]] (along with her mentor Sandperl) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts. The Institute for the Study of Nonviolence would later branch into the Resource Center for Nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joanbaez.com/links.html |title=The Joan Baez Web Pages |publisher=Joanbaez.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316164626/http://www.joanbaez.com/links.html |archive-date=March 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Baez's autobiography, ''Daybreak'', was released. It is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti-war position, dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanekamp|first=Joan|title=Diamonds &amp; Rust: a Bibliography and Discography on Joan Baez|year=1980|publisher=The Pierian Press|isbn=978-0-87650-113-9|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baez was arrested twice in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_2535000/2535301.stm | work=BBC News | title=1967: Joan Baez arrested in Vietnam protest | date=October 16, 1967 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland, California, and spent over a month in jail. ''(See also [[Joan Baez#David Harris|David Harris]] section below.)''

She was a frequent participant in anti-war marches and rallies, including:

* numerous protests in New York City organized by the [[Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee]], starting with the March 1966 Fifth Avenue Peace Parade;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Antiwar Protests Staged in U.S.; 15 Burn Discharge Papers Here; Hundreds Cheer at Union Square Rally Arrests Made Across the Country 5th Avenue Parade Set Today | author= Robinson, Douglas | work=The New York Times | format=$ |date=March 26, 1966|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/03/26/archives/antiwar-protests-staged-in-us-15-burn-discharge-papers-here.html |accessdate=February 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a conversation with then husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 1968 discussing the resistance to the draft during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3t1nc5mg/|title=UCLA Students.

*a free 1967 concert at the [[Washington Monument]] in Washington, D.C., that had been opposed by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] which attracted a crowd of 30,000 to hear her anti-war message;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=30,000 in Capital at Free Concert by Joan Baez; Folk Singer Chides D.A.R., Which Protested U.S. Site | author=B.

* the 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] protests.

There were many others, culminating in Phil Ochs's [[The War Is Over (Phil Ochs song)|The War Is Over]] celebration in New York City in May 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=End-of-War Rally Brings Out 50,000; Peace Rally Here Brings Out 50,000 | author= Montgomery, Paul L. | work=The New York Times | date=May 12, 1975 | author-link= Paul L. Montgomery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Christmas season 1972, Baez joined a peace delegation traveling to North Vietnam, both to address human rights in the region, and to deliver Christmas mail to American [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. During her time there, she was caught in the U.S. military's &quot;[[Operation Linebacker II|Christmas bombing]]&quot; of Hanoi, North Vietnam, during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days.

Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30, 1979, publication of a full-page advertisement (published in four major U.S. newspapers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joan Baez starts protest on repression by Hanoi | work=The New York Times | date=May 30, 1979 | page=A14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare. Her one-time anti-war ally, [[Jane Fonda]], refused to join in Baez's criticism of Hanoi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/01/archives/peace-activists-attack-vietnam-on-rights-a-painful-nightmare-heard.html|title=Peace Activists Attack Vietnam on Rights|date=June 1, 1979|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/11490|title=Joan Baez v.

===Human rights===
Baez was instrumental in founding the USA section of [[Amnesty International]] in the 1970s, and has remained an active supporter of the organization.

Baez's experiences regarding Vietnam's human-rights violations ultimately led her to found her own human-rights group in the late 1970s, Humanitas International, whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred, criticizing right and left-wing régimes equally.

In 1976, she was awarded the [[Thomas Merton Award]] for her ongoing activism.

She toured Chile, Brazil and Argentina in 1981, but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries, for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium. While there, she was kept under surveillance and subjected to death threats. A film of the ill-fated tour, ''[[There but for Fortune: Joan Baez in Latin America]]'', was shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1982.

In 1989, after the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989|Tiananmen Massacre]] in Beijing, Baez wrote and released the song &quot;China&quot; to condemn the Chinese government for its violent and bloody crackdown on thousands of student protesters who called for establishment of democratic republicanism.

In a second trip to Southeast Asia, Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia, and participated in a [[History of Cambodia|United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea]].

On July 17, 2006, Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the [[Legal Community Against Violence]]. At the annual dinner event, they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds.

In 2015, Baez received the [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]].

In 2016, Baez advocated for the [[Innocence Project]] and [[Innocence Network]]. At each concert, Baez informs the audience about the organizations' efforts to exhonerate the wrongfully convicted and reform the system to prevent such incidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====Opposing the death penalty====
In December 2005, Baez appeared and sang &quot;[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]&quot; at the California protest at the [[San Quentin State Prison]] against the execution of [[Tookie Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenifer Warren, Jenifer and Dolan, Maura (December 13, 2005).

Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously performed the same song at San Quentin at the 1992 vigil protesting the execution of [[Robert Alton Harris]], the first man to be executed in California after the death penalty was reinstated. She subsequently lent her prestige to the campaign opposing the execution of [[Troy Davis]] by the State of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Amnesty International |quote=&quot;Dear (Recipients)Any day now, an execution date could be set for Troy Davis.

Thousands of you have once again rallied to ward off the unthinkable. Music artists such as R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, the Indigo Girls, and rapper Big Boi (all Georgians), as well as Steve Earle, Joan Baez, State Radio and actor Tim Roth have joined us by signing the petition ...&quot;|author= Laura Moye – Director, Death Penalty Abolition Campaign |title=Open letter of May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/amnesty/joan-baez-amnesty-and-you/ |title=Joan Baez, Amnesty and You &amp;#124; Human Rights Now |publisher=Amnesty International USA Blog |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT rights====
Baez has also been prominent in the struggle for [[LGBT rights|gay and lesbian rights]]. In 1978, she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat the [[Briggs Initiative]], which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California. Later that same year, she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor, [[Harvey Milk]], who was openly gay.

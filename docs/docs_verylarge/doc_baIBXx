In 1982, Robert Howard came up with the idea to produce a small color printing system that used piezo's to spit drops of ink. He formed the company, R.H. (Robert Howard) Research (named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984), and developed the revolutionary technology that led to the Pixelmaster color printer with Solid ink.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Howard, 1923-2009|first=Robert|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/455879561|title=Connecting the dots : my life and inventions, from X-rays to death rays|date=2009|publisher=Welcome Rain|year=|isbn=978-1-56649-957-6|location=New York, NY|pages=196|oclc=455879561}}&lt;/ref&gt; using Thermojet Technology. This technology consists of a tubular single nozzle acoustical wave drop generator invented originally by Steven Zoltan in 1972 with a glass nozzle and improved by the Howtek inkjet engineer in 1984 with a Tefzel molded nozzle to remove unwanted fluid frequencies. This technology requires the DOD inkjet to operate above the piezo Curie temperature for 'preload' tension on the fluid chamber. The piezo must be forward biased to maintain molecular alignment and proper physical state. There are 6 physical states for piezo's, unpoled (forward and reversed biased, positive poling (forward and reversed biased) negative poling (forward and reversed biased). Howtek Thermojet uses positive poling with forward biased voltage that is removed and applied to produce a fluid &quot;fill&quot; before &quot;firing&quot; a drop. Each drop requires only one fill/fire pulse and no additional drops should be expelled if designed correctly. 

The emerging [[ink jet material deposition]] market also uses inkjet technologies, typically printheads using [[piezoelectric]] crystals, to deposit materials directly on substrates.

The technology has been extended and the 'ink' can now also comprise [[solder paste]] in [[PCB assembly]], or living cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faulkner, A. &amp; Shu, W.|title=Biological cell printing technologies|journal=Nanotechnology Perceptions|date=2012|volume=8|pages=35–57|doi=10.4024/N02FA12A.ntp.08.01|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; for creating [[biosensors]] and for [[tissue engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Reactive Inkjet Printing, Editors: Patrick J Smith, Aoife Morrin, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2018, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78801-051-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

Fluid surface tension naturally pulls a stream into droplets. Optimal drop sizes of 0.004 inch require an inkjet nozzle size of about 0.003 inches. Fluids with surface tension may be water based, wax or oil based and even melted metal alloys. Most drops can be electrically charged.   There are two main technologies in use in contemporary inkjet printers: continuous (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD). Continuous inkjet means the flow pressurized and in a continuous stream. Drop-On-Demand means the fluid is expelled from the jet nozzle one drop at a time. This can be done with a mechanical means with a push or some electrical method. A large electrical charge can pull drops out of a nozzle, sound waves can push fluid from a nozzle or a chamber volume expansion can expel a drop. Continuous streaming was investigated first many years ago. Drop-On-Demand was only discovered in the 1920s.

=== Continuous inkjet ===
&lt;!-- [[Continuous inkjet]] redirect here. If you change the section heading please update the redirect--&gt;
[[File:INKJET-PRINTER-INDUSTRI.gif|thumb|right| Schematic diagram of a continuous inkjet printing process]]
The '''continuous inkjet''' (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding of products and packages. In 1867, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] patented the [[syphon recorder]], which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical strip [[chart recorder]]s) were introduced in 1951 by [[Siemens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot; /&gt; using the patent US2566443 invented by Elmquist Rune  dated 9/4/1951.

In CIJ technology, a high-pressure pump directs liquid ink from a reservoir through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle (usually .003 inch diameter), creating a continuous stream of ink droplets via the [[Plateau-Rayleigh instability]]. A piezoelectric crystal  may be used to create an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes the stream of liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 droplets per second may be achieved.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The ink droplets are subjected to an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode or by a magnetic flux field as they form; the field varies according to the degree of drop deflection desired. This results in a controlled deflection by electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets may be separated by one or more uncharged &quot;guard droplets&quot; to minimize electrostatic repulsion between neighboring droplets.

The droplets pass through another electrostatic  or magnetic field and are directed (deflected) by electrostatic deflection plates or flux field to print on the receptor material (substrate), or allowed to continue on undeflected to a collection gutter for re-use. The more highly charged droplets are deflected to a greater degree. Only a small fraction of the droplets is used to print, the majority being recycled.

CIJ is one of the oldest (1951) ink jet technologies in use and is fairly mature. Drop-On-Demand was not invented until later. The major advantages of CIJ are the very high velocity (≈20&amp;nbsp;m/s) of the ink droplets, which allows for a relatively long distance between print head and substrate, and the very high drop ejection frequency, allowing for very high speed printing. Another advantage is freedom from nozzle clogging as the jet is always in use, therefore allowing [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] solvents such as [[ketones]] and alcohols to be employed, giving the ink the ability to &quot;bite&quot; into the substrate and dry quickly.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The ink system requires active solvent regulation to counter solvent evaporation during the time of flight (time between nozzle ejection and gutter recycling), and from the venting process whereby air that is drawn into the gutter along with the unused drops is vented from the reservoir. Viscosity is monitored and a solvent (or solvent blend) is added to counteract solvent loss.

In the later 1950s heated wax inks became popular with CIJ technologies. In 1971 Johannes F. Gottwald patent US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder used molten metal ink with a magnetic Flux field to fabricate formed symbols for signage. This may have been the first 3D metal object printed using magnetic core memory as data to produce each symbol.

=== Drop-on-demand ===
There are many ways to produce a Drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet. Common methods include thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD to speed up the frequency of drops. DOD may use a single nozzle or thousands of nozzles. One DOD process uses software that directs the heads to apply between zero and eight droplets of ink per dot, only where needed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Inkjet fluid materials have expanded to include pastes, epoxies, Hot-Melt materials, biological fluids, etc. DOD is very popular and has an interesting history. Mechanical DOD came first, followed by Electrical methods including Piezoelectric devices and then Thermal or heat expansion methods.

; [[File:Canon S520 ink jet printer - opened.jpg|thumb|A Canon inkjet with [[CMYK]] cartridges]]Thermal DOD{{anchor|Thermal}} printing:Most consumer inkjet printers, including those from [[Canon (company)|Canon]] (FINE Cartridge system, see photo), [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[Lexmark]], use the thermal inkjet process. The idea of using thermal excitation to move tiny drops of ink was developed independently by two groups at roughly the same time: John Vaught and a team at Hewlett-Packard's Corvallis Division, and Canon engineer Ichiro Endo. Initially, in 1977, Endo's team was trying to use the [[piezoelectric]] effect to move ink out of the nozzle but noticed that ink shot out of a syringe when it was accidentally heated with a soldering iron. Vaught's work started in late 1978 with a project to develop fast, low-cost printing. The team at HP found that thin-film resistors could produce enough heat to fire an ink droplet. Two years later the HP and Canon teams found out about each other's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spitting image | date=19 September 2002 | url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~scotch/innovation/inventing_injet.htm | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=History of ThinkJet Printhead Development | date=May 1985 | author=Niels J.

; :In the thermal inkjet process, the print cartridges consist of a series of tiny chambers, each containing a heater, all of which are constructed by [[photolithography]]. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the ink in the chamber and forming a bubble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeZSaigBj4 | title= How inkjet printer Work | work=Youtube | date=19 February 2017 | access-date=28 September 2019 | author=Atul, Pasare}}&lt;/ref&gt; which causes a large pressure increase, propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's [[trade name]] of ''Bubble Jet''). The ink's [[surface tension]], as well as the condensation and resultant contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of ink into the chamber through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are usually water-based and use either [[pigment]]s or [[dye]]s as the colorant. The inks must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies.

; [[File:EPSON Piezoelectric InkJet Print Nozzle.jpg|thumb|Piezoelectric printing nozzle of an EPSON C20 printer.]][[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] DOD printing:Piezo's are electrically polarized devices, just as a magnet is polarized. Most commercial and industrial inkjet printers and some consumer printers (those produced by [[Micro Piezo|Epson]] (see photo) and [[Brother Industries]]) use a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] in an ink-filled chamber behind each nozzle instead of a heating element. When a voltage is applied, the piezoelectric material changes shape, generating a pressure pulse in the fluid, which pushes a droplet of ink from the nozzle. Single nozzle tubular inkjets actually are fluid resonator chambers and the drops are expelled by sound waves. The 1972 patent called them squeeze tube inkjets but later it was discovered to be acoustical inkjets.  Piezoelectric (also called Piezo) inkjet allows a wider variety of inks than thermal inkjet as there is no requirement for a volatile component, and no issue with kogation (buildup of ink residue), but the print heads are more expensive to manufacture due to the use of piezoelectric material (usually PZT, [[lead zirconium titanate]]).

; :Piezo inkjet technology is often used on production lines to mark products. For instance, the &quot;use-before&quot; date is often applied to products with this technique; in this application the head is stationary and the product moves past. This application requires a relatively large gap between the print head and the substrate, but also yields a high speed, a long service life, and low [[operating cost]].

; [[Thermoplastic]]/[[3D printing]]:[[File:JetFluid.jpg|thumb|Howtek Style Inkjet Nozzle. (Tubular piezo not shown)]]In the 1970s, the first DOD inks were water-based and higher temperature use was not recommended. In the late 1970s wax and oil based inks were used in some DOD inkjets. In 1984 a small company, Howtek, Inc.,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  found that [[hot-melt adhesive]] materials (thermoplastics) could be jetted at 125C by maintaining the piezo poling charge while printing. In 1986 Howtek launched the Pixelmaster solid ink-jetting printer, which opened the door to printing three-dimensional plastic inks and led to a 1992 3D patent, US5136515A. This patent was licensed by the first 3 major [[3D printing|3D printer]] companies (Sanders Prototype, Inc, Stratasys and 3D Systems).

; :In the late 1980s, Howtek introduced the Braillemaster, a printer that used 4 layers of solid ink per character to create documents in Braille that could be read by people who were blind.

; :Solidscape, Inc., currently uses the Howtek-style thermoplastic materials and Howtek-style single nozzle inkjets (see illustration) very successfully. Ballistic Particle Manufacturing also used the Howtek style materials and inkjets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper, 1973-|first=Kenneth G.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45873626|title=Rapid prototyping technology : selection and application|date=2001|publisher=Marcel Dekker|year=|isbn=0-8247-0261-1|location=New York|pages=26–43|oclc=45873626}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inkjets can produce up to 16,000 drops per second and shoot drops at 9 feet per second. Originally designed to only print on standard letter-sized paper sheets they now can print 3D models requiring hundreds of layers.

; :The Thermoplastic inks are sometimes confused with the Thermal (heat expansion) Bubble-jet technology but they are completely different.

== Ink formulations ==

The earliest reference to a Continuous ink jet ink (CIJ) in the 1971 patent US3596285A states &quot; The preferred ink is characterized by viscosity and surface tension characteristics such that the liquid will be maintained over span under the force with which it is moving in bridge or stream. Implicit in such requirement is that the pressure applied to the ink in formation of said stream is sufficient to form a jet and to impart enough energy to carry the jet as a continuous liquid mass notwithstanding the defective forces which are or may be applied. Furthermore, the color of the ink and the color of the carrier should be such that good optical contrast is formed there between the following printing. The preferred ink is a &quot;hot melt type. That is to say it will assume a solid phase at the temperature of the carrier and liquid phase at some higher temperature. The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirement of the invention are not know at the present time. However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with a conductive metal alloy as ink. It is extremely hard at room temperature and adheres well to the surface of the carrier.

The basic problem with inkjet inks is the conflicting requirements for a coloring agent that will stay on the surface vs. rapid dispersement of the carrier fluid.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Desktop inkjet printers, as used in offices and homes, tend to use [[aqueous ink]]s based on a mixture of water, [[glycol]] and [[dye]]s or [[pigments]]. These inks are inexpensive to manufacture but difficult to control on the surface of media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing [[leather]]), nitrates and other compounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with thermal inkjet heads, as these heads require water to perform the ink-expelling function.

While aqueous inks often provide the broadest [[color gamut]] and most vivid color, most are not waterproof without specialized coating or [[lamination]] after printing. Most [[Dye]]-based inks, while usually the least expensive, are subject to rapid fading when exposed to light or ozone. [[Pigment]]-based aqueous inks are typically more costly but provide much better long-term durability and [[ultraviolet]] resistance. Inks marketed as &quot;[[Archival|Archival Quality]]&quot; are usually pigment-based.

Some professional wide format printers use aqueous inks, but the majority in professional use today employ a much wider range of inks, most of which require piezo inkjet heads and extensive maintenance:

; [[File:HT-1 Ink and Brochure 1985.jpg|thumb|Howtek Style Thermoplastic Ink]]Solvent inks: The main ingredient of these inks are [[volatile organic compound|volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]], organic chemical compounds that have high [[vapor pressure]]s. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks is that they are comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and [[ultraviolet]]-resistant ([[Industrial digital printer#High resolution|for outdoor use]]) without special over-coatings.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: ''hard solvent'' ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while ''Mild or &quot;Eco&quot; solvent'' inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.
; UV-curable inks: These inks consist mainly of acrylic [[monomer]]s with an initiator package. After printing, the ink is [[Photonic curing|cured]] by exposure to strong UV-light. Ink is exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid. Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED is used for the curing process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times (microseconds) allow curing inks on thermally sensitive substrates. UV inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the printer, which allows for high quality prints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-5&quot; /&gt; The advantage of UV-curable inks is that they &quot;dry&quot; as soon as they are cured, they can be applied to a wide range of uncoated substrates, and they produce a very robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require expensive curing modules in the printer, and the cured ink has a significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large &quot;flatbed&quot; printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern.
; Dye sublimation inks: These inks contain special [[dye sublimation|sublimation dyes]] and are used to print directly or indirectly on to fabrics which consist of a high percentage of [[polyester]] fibres. A heating step causes the dyes to sublimate into the fibers and create an image with strong color and good durability.
; Hot melt inks:These inks consist mainly of [[wax|waxy compounds]] which are heated past their melting point to enable printing, and which harden upon hitting the cooled substrate.  Hot melt inks are typically used for masking processes and are found in graphic printing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imaging.org/site/PDFS/Papers/1996/RP-0-66/2135.pdf|title=Applications in Commercial Printing for Hot Melt Ink Jets}}&lt;/ref&gt; :The earliest Hot melt type ink was patented in 1971 by Johannes F Gottwald, US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder was intended for printing. The patent states&quot; As used herein the term printing&quot; is not intended in a limited sense but includes writing or other symbol or pattern formulation with an ink. The term ink as used is intended to include not only dye or pigment-containing materials, but any flowable substance or composition suited for application to surface for forming symbols, characters or patterns of intelligence by marking. The materials employed in such process can be salvaged for reuse. Another object of the invention is to increase the size of characters.....in terms of material requirements for such large and continuous displays&quot;.

== Printing heads ==
[[File:Druckkopf.jpg|thumb|Inkjet heads: [[disposable product|disposable]] head (left) and fixed head (right) with ink cartridge (middle)]]

There are two main design philosophies in inkjet head design: ''fixed-head'' and ''disposable head''. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

=== Fixed head ===

The ''fixed-head'' philosophy provides an inbuilt print head (often referred to as a ''gaiter- head'') that is designed to last for the life of the printer. The idea is that because the head need not be replaced every time the ink runs out, consumable costs can be made lower and the head itself can be more precise than a cheap disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand, if a fixed head is damaged, obtaining a replacement head can become expensive, if removing and replacing the head is even possible. If the printer's head cannot be removed, the printer itself will then need to be replaced.

Fixed head designs are available in consumer products, but are more likely to be found on industrial high-end printers and large format plotters. In the consumer space, fixed-head printers are manufactured primarily by Epson and Canon; however, many more recent Hewlett-Packard models use a fixed-head, such as the Officejet Pro 8620 and HP's Pagewide series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGNV7o0VRp4 | title=HP OfficeJet Pro X Printers with PageWide | work=Youtube | date=23 February 2013 | access-date=1 February 2016 | author=Ludington, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disposable head ===
[[File:Ink-jet cartridges.jpg|thumb|Ink-jet cartridges]]

The ''disposable head'' philosophy uses a print head which is supplied as a part of a replaceable [[ink cartridge]]. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of [[consumables]] and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. [[Hewlett-Packard]] has traditionally favoured the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these would-be suppliers don't have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads.

An intermediate method does exist: a disposable ink tank connected to a disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by [[Kodak]], where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can be replaced by the user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.

=== Cleaning mechanisms ===
[[File:Epson Stylus S22 - covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap.webm|thumb|Video: covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap]]

The primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead's nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the printhead, can cause the printhead to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and over a period of several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.

To combat this drying, nearly all inkjet printers include a mechanism to reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across the printhead, and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.

Some printers use a supplemental air-suction pump, using the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently driven by the page feed [[stepper motor]]: it is connected to the end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes.

Professional solvent- and UV-curable ink wide-format inkjet printers generally include a &quot;manual clean&quot; mode that allows the operator to manually clean the print heads and capping mechanism and to replace the wiper blades and other parts used in the automated cleaning processes. The volume of ink used in these printers often leads to &quot;overspray&quot; and therefore buildup of dried ink in many places that automated processes are not capable of cleaning.

The ink consumed in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the [[inkjet spittoon|spittoon]], and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers several years old, it is common for the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full.

[[File:Labyrinth Air Channels on Epson Ink Tank.JPG|thumb|Labyrinth air vent tubes on the top of an Epson Stylus Photo 5-color ink tank. The long air channels are molded into the top of the tank and the blue label seals the channels into long tubes. The yellow label is removed prior to installation, and opens the tube ends to the atmosphere so that ink can be sprayed onto the paper. Removing the blue label would destroy the tubes and cause the moisture to quickly evaporate]]

There is a second type of ink drying that most printers are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm long, wrapping back and forth across the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.

The frequent cleaning conducted by some printers can consume quite a bit of ink and has a great impact on cost-per-page determinations.

Clogged nozzles can be detected by printing a standard test pattern on the page. Some software workaround methods are known for re-routing printing information from a clogged nozzle to a working nozzle.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

=== Ink Delivery Developments ===

Ink cartridges have been the traditional method for delivering ink to the printhead. [[Continuous ink system]] (CISS) inkjet printers connect the printhead either to high-capacity ink tanks or packs, or replenish the built-in cartridges via external tanks connected via tubes, typically a [[Continuous ink system#Limitations of retrofitting|retrofit configuration]]. [[Supertank printers]]–a subset of CISS printers–have high-capacity integrated ink tanks or ink packs, and are manually refilled via ink bottles. When supertank ink systems are paired with disposable printhead technology, replaceable cartridges are used to replace the exhausted print heads.

== Advantages ==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2010}}

Compared to earlier consumer-oriented color printers, inkjet printers have a number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]] or [[daisywheel printer]]s. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic-quality printing are widely available.

In comparison to technologies like [[thermal transfer printing|thermal wax]], [[Dye-sublimation printer|dye sublimation]], and [[laser printing]], inkjets have the advantage of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color.

[[György Ligeti]]'s concerto (1988) has a synthetic quality: it mixes complex rhythms, the composer's Hungarian roots and his experiments with micropolyphony from the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/piano-concerto-mc0002398389|title=Piano Concerto - Details - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witold Lutosławski]]'s piano concerto, completed in the same year, alternates between playfulness and mystery. It also displays a partial return to melody after the composer's aleatoric period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/piano-concerto-mc0002357500|title=Piano Concerto - Details - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian composer [[Rodion Shchedrin]] has written six piano concertos. Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] wrote three piano concertos, the third one dedicated to [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], who played and conducted the world première.

French composer [[Germaine Tailleferre]] and Czech composers [[Bohuslav Martinů]] and [[Vítězslava Kaprálová]] wrote piano concertos.

===Concertos for other instruments===
{{unsourced section|date=May 2020}}
The 20th century also witnessed a growth of the concertante repertoire of instruments, some of which had seldom or never been used in this capacity, and even a concerto for wordless coloratura soprano by [[Reinhold Glière]]. As a result, almost all classical instruments now have a concertante repertoire. Examples include:

*[[Accordion concerto]]: [[Alan Hovhaness|Hovhaness]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Kalevi Aho]]

Among the works of the prolific composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] may be noted ''Prayer of St. Gregory'' for trumpet and strings, though it is not a concerto in the usual sense of the term.

In the later 20th century the concerto tradition was continued by composers such as [[Peter Maxwell Davies|Maxwell Davies]], whose series of [[Strathclyde Concertos]] exploit some of the instruments less familiar as soloists.

'''Sonata'''  ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|ə}}; [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{IPA-it|soˈnaːta|}}, pl. ''sonate''; from Latin and Italian: ''sonare'' [archaic Italian; replaced in the modern language by ''suonare''], &quot;to sound&quot;), in [[music]], literally means a piece ''played'' as opposed to a [[cantata]] (Latin and Italian ''cantare'', &quot;to sing&quot;), a piece ''sung''.  The term evolved through the [[Music history|history of music]], designating a variety of forms until the [[Classical music era|Classical]] era,  when it took on increasing importance. Sonata is a vague term, with varying meanings depending on the context and time period. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works.  It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the [[fugue]]—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.

The term [[sonatina]], pl. ''sonatine'', the [[diminutive]] form of sonata, is often used for a short or technically easy sonata.

==Instrumentation==
In the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], a sonata was for one or more instruments almost always with [[figured bass#Basso_continuo|continuo]]. After the Baroque period most works designated as sonatas specifically are performed by a solo instrument, most often a keyboard instrument, or by a solo instrument accompanied by a keyboard instrument.

Sonatas for a solo instrument other than keyboard have been composed, as have sonatas for other combinations of instruments.

==History of usage==

In the works of [[Arcangelo Corelli]] and his contemporaries, two broad classes of sonata were established, and were first described by [[Sébastien de Brossard]] in his ''Dictionaire de musique'' (third edition, Amsterdam, ca. 1710): the [[sonata da chiesa]] (that is, suitable for use in church), which was the type &quot;rightly known as ''Sonatas''&quot;, and the [[sonata da camera]] (proper for use at court), which consists of a prelude followed by a succession of dances, all in the same key. Although the four, five, or six movements of the sonata da chiesa are also most often in one key, one or two of the internal movements are sometimes in a contrasting tonality {{harv|Newman|1972a|loc=23–24}}.

The sonata da chiesa, generally for one or more [[violin]]s and [[Bass (sound)|bass]], consisted normally of a slow introduction, a loosely fugued [[Allegro (music)|allegro]], a [[Wiktionary:cantabile|cantabile]] slow movement, and a lively finale in some [[binary form]] suggesting affinity with the dance-tunes of the [[suite (music)|suite]]. This scheme, however, was not very clearly defined, until the works of [[Arcangelo Corelli]] when it became the essential sonata and persisted as a tradition of Italian violin music.

The sonata da camera consisted almost entirely of idealized dance-tunes. On the other hand, the features of ''sonata da chiesa'' and ''sonata da camera'' then tended to be freely intermixed. Although nearly half of Bach's 1,100 surviving compositions, arrangements, and transcriptions are instrumental works, only about 4% are sonatas {{harv|Newman|1972a|loc=266}}.

The term ''sonata'' is also applied to the series of [[List of Solo Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|over 500 works]] for [[harpsichord]] solo, or sometimes for other keyboard instruments, by [[Domenico Scarlatti]], originally published under the name ''Essercizi per il gravicembalo'' (Exercises for the Harpsichord). Most of these pieces are in one binary-form movement only, with two parts that are in the same tempo and use the same thematic material, though occasionally there will be changes in tempo within the sections. They are frequently virtuosic, and use more distant harmonic transitions and modulations than were common for other works of the time. They were admired for their great variety and invention.

Both the solo and trio sonatas of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] show parallels with the concerti he was writing at the same time. He composed over 70 sonatas, the great majority of which are of the solo type; most of the rest are trio sonatas, and a very small number are of the multivoice type {{harv|Newman|1972a|loc=169–70}}.

The sonatas of [[Pietro Domenico Paradisi|Domenico Paradies]] are mild and elongated works with a graceful and melodious little second movement included.

===Classical period===
The practice of the [[Classical music era|Classical period]] would become decisive for the sonata; the term moved from being one of many terms indicating genres or forms, to designating the fundamental form of organization for large-scale works. This evolution stretched over fifty years. The term came to apply both to the structure of individual movements (see [[Sonata form]] and [[History of sonata form]]) and to the layout of the movements in a multi-movement work. In the transition to the Classical period there were several names given to multimovement works, including [[divertimento]], [[serenade]], and [[partita]], many of which are now regarded effectively as sonatas. The usage of ''sonata'' as the standard term for such works began somewhere in the 1770s. [[Haydn]] labels his first piano sonata as such in 1771, after which the term ''divertimento'' is used sparingly in his output. The term ''sonata'' was increasingly applied to either a work for keyboard alone (see [[piano sonata]]), or for keyboard and one other instrument, often the violin or cello. It was less and less frequently applied to works with more than two instrumentalists; for example, piano trios were not often labelled ''sonata for piano, violin, and cello.''

Initially the most common layout of movements was:

# Allegro, which at the time was understood to mean not only a tempo, but also some degree of &quot;working out&quot;, or development, of the theme. (See {{harvnb|Rosen|1988}} and {{harvnb|Rosen|1997}}.)
# A middle movement, most frequently a [[Slow movement (music)|slow movement]]: an [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], an [[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] or a [[Largo (music)|Largo]]; or less frequently a [[Minuet]] or [[Variation (music)|Theme and Variations]] form.
# A closing movement was generally an Allegro or a Presto, often labeled ''Finale''. The form was often a [[Rondo]] or Minuet.

However, two-movement layouts also occur, a practice Haydn uses as late as the 1790s. There was also in the early Classical period the possibility of using four movements, with a dance movement inserted before the slow movement, as in Haydn's Piano sonatas No. 6 and No. 8. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s sonatas were also primarily in three movements. Of the works that Haydn labelled ''piano sonata'', ''divertimento'', or ''partita'' in [[Hoboken-Verzeichnis|Hob XIV]], seven are in two movements, thirty-five are in three, and three are in four; and there are several in three or four movements whose authenticity is listed as &quot;doubtful.&quot; Composers such as [[Boccherini]] would publish sonatas for piano and obbligato instrument with an optional third movement—–in Boccherini's case, 28 cello sonatas.

But increasingly instrumental works were laid out in four, not three movements, a practice seen first in [[string quartet]]s and [[Symphony|symphonies]], and reaching the sonata proper in the early sonatas of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. However, two- and three-movement sonatas continued to be written throughout the Classical period: Beethoven's [[Cello Sonatas Nos. 4 and 5 (Beethoven)|opus 102 pair]] has a two-movement C major sonata and a three-movement D major sonata. Nevertheless, works with fewer or more than four movements were increasingly felt to be exceptions; they were labelled as having movements &quot;omitted,&quot; or as having &quot;extra&quot; movements.

Thus, the four-movement layout was by this point standard for the string quartet, and overwhelmingly the most common for the [[symphony]]. The usual order of the four movements was:

# An allegro, which by this point was in what is called [[sonata form]], complete with exposition, development, and recapitulation.
# A [[Slow movement (music)|slow movement]], an Andante, an Adagio or a Largo.
# A dance movement, frequently [[Minuet and trio]] or—especially later in the classical period—a [[scherzo|Scherzo and trio]].
# A finale in faster tempo, often in a [[Sonata rondo form|sonata–rondo form]].

When movements appeared out of this order they would be described as &quot;reversed&quot;, such as the scherzo coming before the slow movement in Beethoven's 9th Symphony. This usage would be noted by critics in the early 19th century, and it was codified into teaching soon thereafter.

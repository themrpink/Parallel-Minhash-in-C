[[File:US-NationalIceCenter-Seal.png|right|Seal of the National Ice Center]]

The '''National Ice Center''' ('''NIC''') is a tri-agency operational center whose mission is to provide worldwide navigational [[ice]] analyses for the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]] of the United States, allied nations, and [[Government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies.

It is represented by the [[United States Navy]] ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]); the [[US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] ([[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]); and the [[United States Coast Guard]] ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]). The National Ice Center is a subordinate command of the [[Naval Oceanographic Office]] (NAVOCEANO). Originally known as the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center, which was established on December 15, 1976 in a memorandum of agreement between the U.S. Navy and NOAA, the National Ice Center was formed in 1995 when the U.S. Coast Guard became a partner. The National Ice Center produces global sea ice charts and various cryospheric GIS products.  They also name and track Antarctic icebergs if greater than {{convert|10|nmi|km|-1}} on its longest axis.

Icebergs must be a minimum of 19&amp;nbsp;kilometers in length to be tracked by the NIC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ib34&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=85727&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=iotd_title |title=Iceberg B-34 Makes Its Debut off Antarctica |date=21 April 2015 |work=The Earth Observatory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=21 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stefano Benni 4698 C.jpg|thumb|Stefano Benni]]

'''Stefano Benni''' (born 12 August 1947) is an Italian [[satire|satirical]] writer, poet and journalist. His books have been translated into around 20 foreign languages and scored notable commercial success. 2.5 million copies of his books have been sold in Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Biography==
Benni has written many successful novels and anthologies, among which are ''Bar Sport, Elianto, Terra!, La compagnia dei celestini, Baol, Comici spaventati guerrieri, Saltatempo, Margherita Dolcevita'' and ''Il bar sotto il mare''.
He has also worked with the weekly magazines ''L'espresso'' and ''Panorama'', and with the satirical  ''Cuore'' and ''Tango'', the monthly magazines ''Linus'' and ''Il Mago'' (where he began and published in installments part of ''Bar Sport''), and the newspapers ''La Repubblica'' and ''il manifesto''.

He also wrote television sketches for [[Beppe Grillo]] at the beginning of Grillo's career, and one of these sketches – called &quot;Pietro Longo=P2&quot; – caused the [[Psdi]] to ask the RAI commission to remove Grillo from RAI TV; their request was denied.

In 1989, with Umberto Angelucci, Benni directed the film ''Musica per vecchi animali'', adapted from his book ''Comici spaventati guerrieri'', with the actors [[Dario Fo]], [[Paolo Rossi]], and Viola Simoncioni. Two years before that he was also the screenwriter of another film, ''Topo Galileo'' by Francesco Laudadio, starring his friend [[Beppe Grillo]] and with music by [[Fabrizio De André]] and [[Mauro Pagani]].

With the jazz musician [[Umberto Petrin]], he wrote ''Misterioso. Viaggio nel silenzio di Thelonius Monk''.

His novels contain, within imaginary worlds and situations, a strong satire of Italian society over the last few decades.  His writing style includes many puns, neologisms and parodies of other literary styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaturfestival.com/archive/participants/authors/2006/stefano-benni?set_language=en Stefano Benni biography], International Literature Festival Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January and February 2010, he presented the event ''Bennac'', a meeting between himself and the French writer [[Daniel Pennac]].

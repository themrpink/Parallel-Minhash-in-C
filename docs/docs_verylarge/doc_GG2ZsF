Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. There were a number of other styles in the past that are not as widely used today. For example, the [[Khevsureti]] region of Georgia has three different styles of wrestling. Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were [[polo]], and [[Lelo burti|Lelo]], a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Basketball]] was always one of the notable sports in Georgia, and Georgia had a few very famous [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union national team]] members, such as [[Otar Korkia]], [[Mikheil Korkia]], [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] and [[Levan Moseshvili]]. [[BC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] won the prestigious [[Euroleague]] competition in [[1961–62 FIBA European Champions Cup|1962]]. Georgia had five players in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]: [[Vladimir Stepania]], [[Jake Tsakalidis]], [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]], [[Tornike Shengelia]] and current [[Golden State Warriors]] center [[Zaza Pachulia]]. Other notable basketball players are two times Euroleague champion [[Giorgi Shermadini]] and Euroleague players [[Manuchar Markoishvili]] and [[Viktor Sanikidze]]. Sport is regaining its popularity in the country in recent years. [[Georgia national basketball team]] qualified to [[EuroBasket]] during the last three tournaments since 2011.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Image:Normans Bayeux.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Normans|Norman]] cavalry attacks the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[shield wall]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]] as depicted in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. The lances are held with a one-handed over-the-head grip.]]

A '''lance''' is a [[pole weapon]] designed to be used by a mounted warrior or [[cavalry]] soldier ([[lancer]]). During the periods of classical and medieval warfare, it evolved into being the leading weapon in [[cavalry charge]]s, and was unsuited for throwing or for repeated thrusting, unlike similar weapons of the [[javelin]]/[[pike (weapon)|pike]] family typically used by [[infantry]]. Lances were often equipped with a vamplate – a small circular plate to prevent the hand sliding up the shaft upon impact. Though best known as a military and sporting weapon carried by [[Europe]]an knights, the use of lances was widespread throughout Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa wherever suitable mounts were available. As a secondary weapon, lancers of the medieval period also bore [[sword]]s, [[battle axe|axe]]s, [[war hammer|hammers]], or [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]] for [[hand-to-hand combat]], since the lance was often a one-use-per-engagement weapon; assuming the lance survived the initial impact intact, it was (depending on the lance) usually too long, heavy, and slow to be effective against opponents in a [[melee]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Heath, page 33 &quot;Armies of Feudal Europe 1065-1300&quot;, Wargames Research Group 1978&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the word {{lang|la|[[lancea (weapon)|lancea]]}} - the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] auxiliaries' [[javelin]] or throwing spear; although according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]], the word may be of [[Iberian language|Iberian]] origin. Also compare {{lang|grc|λόγχη}} ({{transl|grc|lónkhē}}), a Greek term for &quot;spear&quot; or &quot;lance&quot;.

A lance in the original sense is a light throwing spear, or javelin. The English verb ''to launch'' &quot;fling, hurl, throw&quot; is derived from the term (via [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|lancier}}), as well as the rarer or poetic ''to lance''. The term from the 17th century came to refer specifically to spears not thrown, used for thrusting by [[heavy cavalry]], and especially in [[jousting]]. The longer types of thrusting spear used by infantry are usually referred to as [[pike (weapon)|pikes]].

==History of use==
===Middle Ages===
The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cavalry used lances (''[[Kontos (weapon)]]'' or ''kontarion'') almost exclusively, often in mixed [[lancer]] and [[mounted archer]] formations (''cursores et defensores''). The Byzantines used lances in both overarm and underarm grips, couched (held horizontally).

The best known usage of military lances was that of the full-gallop closed-ranks charge of a group of knights with underarm-couched lances, against lines of infantry, archery [[regiment]]s, defensive [[Earthworks (military)|embankments]], and opposition cavalry. Two variants on the couched lance charge developed, the French method, ''en haie'', with lancers in a double line and the German method, with lancers drawn up in a deeper formation which was often wedge-shaped. It is commonly believed that this became the dominant European cavalry tactic in the 11th century after the development of the cantled saddle and stirrups (the [[Great Stirrup Controversy]]), and of rowel [[spur]]s (which enabled better control of the mount). Cavalry thus outfitted and deployed had a tremendous collective force in their charge, and could shatter most contemporary infantry lines. Recent evidence has suggested, however, that the lance charge was effective without the benefit of stirrups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/shock.php |title=&quot;Saddle, Lance and Stirrup&quot; |access-date=10 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823054122/http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/shock.php |archive-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the extreme stopping power of a thrusting spear, it quickly became a popular weapon of infantry in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. These eventually led to the rise of the longest type of spears, the [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]. This adaptation of the cavalry lance to infantry use was largely tasked with stopping lance-armed cavalry charges. During the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, these weapons, both mounted and unmounted, were so effective that lancers and pikemen not only became a staple of every Western army, but also became highly sought-after mercenaries. (However, the pike had already been used by [[Philip II of Macedon]] in antiquity to great effect, in the form of the [[sarissa]].)

In Europe, a [[jousting]] lance was a variation of the knight's lance which was modified from its original war design. In jousting, the lance tips would usually be blunt, often spread out like a cup or furniture foot, to provide a wider impact surface designed to unseat the opposing rider without spearing him through. The centre of the shaft of such lances could be designed to be hollow, in order for it to break on impact, as a further safeguard against impalement. They were on average 3 meters (9.8 feet) long, and had hand guards built into the lance, often tapering for a considerable portion of the weapon's length. These are the versions that can most often be seen at [[medieval]] reenactment festivals. In war, lances were much more like stout spears, long and balanced for one-handed use, and with sharpened tips.

====Lance (unit organization)====
{{main|Lances fournies}}

As a small unit that surrounded a knight when he went into battle during the 14th and 15th centuries, a lance might have consisted of one or two squires, the knight himself, one to three men-at-arms, and possibly an archer. Lances were often combined under the banner of a higher-ranking nobleman to form companies of knights that would act as an ad hoc unit.

===17th and 18th century decline in Western Europe===
The advent of [[wheellock]] technology spelled the end of the heavy knightly lance in Western Europe, with newer types of heavy cavalry such as [[reiter]]s and [[cuirassier]]s spurning the old one-use weapon and increasingly supplanting the older [[gendarme]] type Medieval cavalry. While many [[Renaissance]] captains such as Sir [[Roger Williams (soldier)|Roger Williams]] continued to espouse the virtues of the lance, many such as [[François de la Noue]] openly encouraged its abandonment in the face of the pistol's greater armor piercing power, handiness and greater general utility. At the same time the adoption of [[pike and shot]] tactic by most infantry forces would neuter much of the power of the lancer's breakneck charge, making them a non-cost effective type of military unit due to their expensive horses in comparison to cuirassiers and reiters, who usually charging only at a trot could make do with lower quality mounts. After the success of pistol-armed [[Huguenot]] heavy horse against their Royalist counterparts during the [[French Wars of Religion]], most [[Western Europe]]an powers started rearming their lancers with pistols, initially as an adjunct weapon and eventually as a replacement, with the Spanish retaining the lance the longest.&lt;ref name=myarmoury&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frye|first1=Gordon|title=From Lance to Pistol: The Evolution of Mounted Soldiers from 1550 to 1600|url=http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_lancepistol.html|website=myArmoury.com|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with its far greater emphasis on cavalry warfare, large population of [[Szlachta]] nobility and general lower military technology level among its foes retained the lance to a considerable degree, with the famously winged [[Polish hussars]] having their glory period during the 17th and 18th centuries against a wide variety of enemy forces.&lt;ref name=myarmoury/&gt;

===19th century revival in Western Europe===
The mounted lancer experienced a renaissance in the 19th century. This followed on the demise of the [[pike (weapon)|pike]] and of body armor during the 17th century, with the reintroduction of lances coming from [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]]. In both countries formations of lance-armed cavalry had been retained when they disappeared elsewhere in Europe. Lancers became especially prevalent during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]: a period when almost all the major European powers reintroduced the lance into their respective cavalry arsenals. Formations of [[uhlan]]s and later other types of cavalry used lances between 2 and 3 meters (6.6 and 9.8 feet) in length as their primary weapons. The lance was usually employed in initial [[charge (warfare)|charge]]s in close formation, with sabers being used in the [[melee]] that followed.

===Twilight of use===
The [[Crimean War]] saw the use of the lance in the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. One of the four British regiments involved in the charge, plus the Russian [[Cossacks]] who counter-attacked, were armed with this weapon.

After the [[Western world|Western]] introduction of the horse to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the [[Plains Indians]] also took up the lance, probably independently, as American cavalry of the time were [[pistol]] and [[sabre]] armed, firing forward at full gallop.

The natural transition from the slender throwing spear to the stouter thrusting spear appears to be an evolutionary trend in the military use of the horse in mounted warfare.

During the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] (1864–70), the Paraguayan cavalry made effective use of locally manufactured lances, both of conventional design and of an antique pattern used by gauchos for cattle herding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gabriele|last=Esposito|pages=33 &amp; 44|title=Armies of the War of the Triple Alliance 1864-70|ISBN=978-1-4728-0725-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1860s saw ash, beech or pine wood lances, of varying lengths but each with iron points and butts, adopted by the uhlan regiments of the Saxon, Wurttemberg, Bavarian and Prussian armies. 

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 saw the extensive deployment of cavalry armed with lances on both sides. While the opportunities for using this weapon effectively proved infrequent during the actual conflict; the entire cavalry ([[hussar]]s, [[dragoon]]s, [[cuirassier]]s and [[uhlan]]s) of the post-war [[Imperial German Army]] subsequently adopted the lance as a primary weapon. After 1893 the standard German cavalry lance was made of drawn tubular steel, covered with clear lacquer and with a hemp hand-grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages=126-128|title=The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=3-902526-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|11|ft|9|in}} it was the longest version then in use.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Addition, Volume XVI, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Austrian cavalry had included regiments armed with lances since 1784. In 1884 the lance ceased to be carried either as an active service or parade weapon. However the eleven [[Uhlan]] regiments continued in existence until 1918, armed with the standard cavalry sabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Lucas|page=112|title=Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914|ISBN=0-946771-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Boer War]], British troops successfully used the lance on one occasion - against retreating [[Boer]]s at the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] (21 October 1899).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, pages 139-140, &quot;The Boer War&quot;, {{ISBN|0-7474-0976-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Boers made effective use of [[trench warfare]], rapid-fire [[field artillery]], and long-range [[rifle]]s from the beginning of the war. The combined effect was devastating, so much of the British cavalry was deployed as mounted infantry, dismounting to fight on foot. For some years after the Boer War, the six British lancer regiments officially carried the lance only for parades and other ceremonial duties. At the regimental level, training in the use of the lance continued, ostensibly to improve recruit riding skills. In 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marquess of|last=Anglesey|page=410|title=A History of British Cavalry Vol. 4|ISBN=978-0436273216}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} bamboo or ash weapon with a steel head, was reauthorized for general use on active service.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The Russian cavalry (except for the Cossacks) discarded the lance in the late 19th century, but in 1907, it was reissued for use by the front line of each squadron when charging in open formation. In its final form, the Russian lance was a long metal tube with a steel head and leather arm strap. It was intended as a shock weapon in the charge, to be dropped after impact and replaced by the sword for close combat in a melee. While demoralizing to an opponent, the lance was recognized as being an awkward encumbrance in forested regions.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Littauer, pp. 115-116, ''Russian Hussar'', {{ISBN|1-59048-256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative value of the lance and the sword as a principal weapon for mounted troops was an issue of dispute in the years immediately preceding World War I. Opponents of the lance argued that the weapon was clumsy, conspicuous, easily deflected, and of no use at close quarters in a melee. Arguments favoring the retention of the lance focused on the impact on morale of having charging cavalry preceded by &quot;a hedge of steel&quot; and on the effectiveness of the weapon against fleeing opponents.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===World War I and after===

Lances were still in use by the [[British Empire|British]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Spain|Spanish]], [[French Third Republic|French]], [[Belgium|Belgian]], [[Indian Army|Indian]], [[German Empire|German]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] armies at the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In initial cavalry skirmishes in [[France]] this antique weapon proved ineffective, German [[uhlan]]s being &quot;hampered by their long lances and a good many threw them away&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Tuchman, page 280, ''The Guns of August'', Four Square Edition 1964&lt;/ref&gt; A major action involving repeated charges by four regiments of German cavalry, all armed with lances, at [[Battle of Halen|Halen]] on 12 August 1914 was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Robinson, Francis Hendriks and Janet Robinson, ''The Last Great Cavalry Charge - The BattIndian]]le of the Silver Helmets Halen 12 August 1914'', {{ISBN|978-1-78155-183-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the Belgian defenders was one regiment of lancers who fought dismounted.

With the advent of trench warfare, lances and the cavalry that carried them ceased to play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;A British officer writing in 1917 referred to lancers as &quot;our marvellous medieval regiments&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian cavalry officer whose regiment carried lances throughout the war recorded only one instance where an opponent was killed by this weapon.

The [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919-22 saw an unexpected revival of lances amongst the cavalry of the Turkish National Army. During the successful Turkish offensives of the final stages of the war across the open plains of Asia Minor, Turkish mounted troops armed with bamboo lances from Ottoman stocks inflicted heavy losses on the retreating Greek forces.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Jowett, ''Armies of the Greek-Turkish War 1919-22'', p. 47, {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0684-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Those armies which still retained lances as a service weapon at the end of World War I generally discarded them for all but ceremonial occasions during the 1920s and 1930s. An exception was the [[Polish cavalry]], which retained the lance for combat use until either 1934&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Zaloga, page 5 &quot;The Polish Army 1939-45&quot; {{ISBN|0-85045-417-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Larsen &amp; Henry Yallop, ''The Cavalry Lance'', p. 76, {{ISBN|978-1-4728-1618-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but contrary to popular legend did not make use of it in [[World War II]]. The German cavalry retained the lance as a service weapon until October 3rd, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Richter, ''Weapons &amp; Equipment of the German Cavalry: 1935-1945'', p. 3, {{ISBN|978-0-8874-0816-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentine cavalry was photographed carrying lances as late as the 1940s but this appears to have been as part of recruit riding school training rather than serious preparation for active service.

==Use as flagstaff==
The [[United States Cavalry]] used a lance-like shaft as a [[wikt:Special:Search/flagstaff|flagstaff]].

==Mounted police use==
When the Canadian [[North-West Mounted Police]] was established, it was modeled after certain British cavalry units that used lances. It made limited use of this weapon in small detachments during the 1870s, intended to impress indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Ross|page=[https://archive.org/details/royalcanadianmou00ross_483/page/n24 24]|title=The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873-1987|year=1988|url=https://archive.org/details/royalcanadianmou00ross_483|url-access=limited|ISBN=-0-85045-834-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], the North-West Mounted Police's descendant, employs ceremonial, though functional, lances made of [[Dendrocalamus strictus|male bamboo]]. They feature a crimped swallowtail pennant, red above and white below, symbolic of the long plain cloth that was wrapped just below the sharp metal tip for absorbing blood fluid to keep it from running down the shaft and making the lance slippery to hold on to and control.

The [[New South Wales Police Force|New South Wales Mounted Police]], based at Redfern Barracks, Sydney, Australia, carry a lance with a navy blue and white pennant on ceremonial occasions.

==Other weapons==
&quot;Lance&quot; is also the name given by some anthropologists to the light flexible javelins (technically darts) thrown by [[atlatl]]s (spear-throwing sticks), but these are usually called &quot;atlatl javelins&quot;. Some were not much larger than arrows, and were typically feather-[[fletching|fletched]] like an arrow and unlike the vast majority of spears and javelins (one exception would be several instances of the many types of [[ballista]] bolt, a mechanically-thrown spear).

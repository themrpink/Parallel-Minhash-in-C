# No permanent financial bond between the members, each man's liability ending for the time being when he had paid his “score” after the meal.
# No permanent clubhouse, though each clique tended to make some particular coffee house or tavern their headquarters.

These coffee-house clubs soon became hotbeds of political scandal-mongering and intriguing, and in 1675 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] issued a proclamation which ran: “His Majesty hath thought fit and necessary that coffee houses be (for the future) put down and suppressed,” because “in such houses divers false, malitious and scandalous reports are devised and spread abroad to the Defamation of his Majesty’s Government and to the Disturbance of Peace and Quiet of the Realm.” So unpopular was this proclamation that it was almost instantly found necessary to withdraw it, and by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]’s reign the coffee-house club was a feature of England’s social life. See [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries]].

=== 18th and 19th century ===
The idea of the club developed in two directions.  One was of a permanent institution with a fixed [[wikt:clubhouse|clubhouse]]. The London coffeehouse clubs in increasing their members absorbed the whole accommodation of the coffeehouse or tavern where they held their meetings, and this became the clubhouse, often retaining the name of the original innkeeper, e.g. [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]]. These still exist today as the famous [[gentlemen's club]]s.

The peripatetic lifestyle of the 18th and 19th century middle classes also drove the development of more residential clubs, which had bedrooms and other facilities.  Military and naval officers, lawyers, judges, members of Parliament and government officials tended to have an irregular presence in the major cities of [[British Empire|the Empire]], particularly London, spending perhaps a few months there before moving on for a prolonged period and then returning.  Especially when this presence did not coincide with [[Season (society)|the Season]], a permanent establishment in the city (i.e., a house owned or rented, with the requisite staff), or the opening of a [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] (generally shuttered outside the Season) was inconvenient or uneconomic, while hotels were rare and socially ''déclassé''.  Clubbing with a number of like-minded friends to secure a large shared house with a manager was therefore a convenient solution.

The other sort of club meets occasionally or periodically and often has no clubhouse, but exists primarily for some specific object. Such are the many purely athletic, sports and pastimes clubs, the Alpine, chess, yacht and motor clubs. Also there are literary clubs (see [[writing circle]] and [[Book discussion club|book club]]), musical and art clubs, publishing clubs. The name of “club” has been annexed by a large group of associations which fall between the club proper and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]], of a purely periodic and temporary nature, such as slate, goose and [[Christmas club]]s, which do not need to be registered under the [[Friendly Societies Act]].

=== Worldwide ===

The institution of the gentleman's club has spread all over the [[English-speaking world]]. Many of those who energised the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] were members of the [[The Poker Club|Poker Club]] in [[Edinburgh]]. In the United States clubs were first established after the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]]. One of the first was the Hoboken Turtle Club (1797), which still survived as of 1911. In former [[British Empire]] colonies like India and Pakistan they are known as [[Gymkhana]].

The earliest clubs on the European continent were of a political nature. These in 1848 were repressed in [[Austria]] and Germany, and later clubs of [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] were mere replicas of their English prototypes. In France, where the term ''cercle'' is most usual, the first was Le Club Politique (1782), and during the [[French Revolution]] such associations proved important political forces (see [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]]s, [[Cordeliers]]). Of the purely social clubs in [[Paris]] the most notable were the [[Jockey-Club de Paris]] (1833), the Cercle de l'Union, the Traveller's and the Cercle Interallié..

==Types of clubs==

===Buying club===
{{main|Buyers club}}
Buyer's clubs or buying clubs are clubs organized to pool members' collective buying power, enabling them to make purchases at lower prices than are generally available, or purchase goods that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. There are many legitimate buying clubs – for example, food buying clubs – but many are unauthorized credit card billing scams, in which a customer is induced to enroll in a free trial of a buyer's club membership, and then unexpectedly billed when the trial ends.

===Country or sports club===
{{main|Country club|Sports club}}
[[File:The meeting of the Royal British Bowmen in the grounds of Erthig, Denbighshire.jpeg|thumb|A print of the 1822 meeting of the &quot;Royal British Bowmen&quot; [[archery]] club.]]

There are two types of athletic and sports clubs: those organized for sporting participants (which include athletic clubs and country clubs), and those primarily for spectator fans of a team.

'''Athletic and country clubs''' offer one or more recreational sports facilities to their members. Such clubs may also offer social activities and facilities, and some members may join primarily to take advantage of the social opportunities. [[Country club]]s offer a variety of recreational sports facilities to their members and are usually located in suburban or rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=country+club |title=country club - definition of country club by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most country clubs have [[golf]] facilities. [[Swimming pool]]s, [[tennis court]]s, [[polo]] grounds and exercise facilities are also common. Country clubs usually provide dining facilities to their members and guests, and frequently host special events like weddings. Similar clubs in urban areas are often called &quot;athletic clubs&quot;. These clubs often feature indoor sports, such as indoor tennis, [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[futsal]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[boxing]], and exercise facilities.

Members of '''sports clubs''' that support a team can be sports amateurs—groups who meet to practice a sport, as for example in most [[cycling club]]s—or professionals; [[Football team|football clubs]] consist of well-paid team members and thousands of supporters. A sports club can thus comprise participants (not necessarily competitors) or spectator fans, or both.

Some organizations exist with a mismatch between name and function. The [[Jockey Club]] is not a club for [[jockey]]s, but rather exists to regulate the sport of [[horseracing]]; the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] was until recently the regulatory body of [[cricket]]; and so on. Sports club should not be confused with [[gym]]s and health clubs, which also can be for members only.

===Fraternities and sororities===
[[Fraternities and sororities]] are social clubs of [[secondary school|secondary]] or [[higher education]] students. Membership in these organizations is generally by invitation only.

===Hobby club===
Hobbies are practiced for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward. Examples include [[science fiction clubs]], [[ham radio]], [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]], [[collecting]], creative and artistic pursuits, making, tinkering, sports, and adult education. Engaging in a hobby can lead to acquiring substantial skill, knowledge, and experience. However, personal fulfillment is the aim.

===Personal club===
Personal Clubs are similar to Hobby Clubs.  These clubs are run by a few close friends.  These friends or family members do things they like to do together.  They might even make a personal website for their club.

===Professional societies===
{{main|Professional body}}
These organizations are partly social, partly professional in nature and provide professionals with opportunities for advanced education, presentations on current research, business contacts, public advocacy for the profession and other advantages.  Examples of these groups include [[medical associations]], [[scientific societies]], [[autograph club]] and [[bar association]]s. Professional societies frequently have layers of organization, with regional, national and international levels.  The local chapters generally meet more often and often include advanced students unable to attend national meetings.

===School club===
{{main|Extracurricular activity}}
These are activities performed by students that fall outside the realm of classes.  Such clubs may fall outside the normal curriculum of school or university education or, as in the case of subject matter clubs (e.g. student chapters of [[professional body|professional societies]]), may supplement the curriculum through informal meetings and professional mentoring.

===Service club===
{{main|Service club}}
A service club is a type of [[voluntary organization]] where members meet regularly for social outings and to perform charitable works either by direct hands-on efforts or by raising money for other organizations.

===Social activities club===
[[File:Officers Club, Palakkad.jpg|thumbnail|Officers Club, [[Palakkad]], India.]]
Social activities clubs are a modern combination of several other types of clubs and reflect today's more eclectic and varied society. These clubs are centered around the activities available to the club members in the city or area in which the club is located. Because the purpose of these clubs is split between general social interaction and taking part in the events themselves, clubs tend to have more single members than married ones; some clubs restrict their membership to one of the other, and some are for gays and lesbians.

Membership can be limited or open to the general public, as can the events. Most clubs have a limited membership based upon specific criteria, and limit the events to members to increase the security of the members, thus creating an increased sense of camaraderie and belonging. Social activities clubs can be for profit or not for profit, and some are a mix of the two (a for-profit club with a non-profit charitable arm, for instance).  The [[Inter-Varsity Club (IVC)]] is the biggest British non-profit club.

===Social club===
{{main|Social club|Gentlemen's club}}
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730]]
Some social clubs are organized around competitive games, such as chess and bridge.  Other clubs are designed to encourage membership of certain social classes. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s social clubs were the precursor name of gangs like the infamous Hamburgs of Chicago. Latino immigrant adult and youth groups organized themselves as social clubs like: Black Eagles, Flaming Arrows, Paragons and Young Lords. Those made up of the elite are best known as [[gentlemen's club]]s (not to be confused with [[strip club]]s) and [[country clubs]] (though these also have an athletic function, [[Club (organization)#Sports or athletic clubs|see below]]). Membership to gentlemen's clubs require the ability to pay large fees as well as an invitation by existing members who seek new recruits who meet personal criteria such as lifestyle, moral base, etc. Less elitist, but still in some cases exclusive, are [[working men's club]]s. Clubs restricted to either officers or enlisted men exist on [[military bases]].

The modern Gentlemen's club is occasionally proprietary, i.e. owned by an individual or private syndicate and run on a for-profit basis, but more frequently owned by the members who delegate to a committee the management of its affairs, first reached its highest development in London, where the district of [[St. James's]] has long been known as &quot;Clubland&quot;. 

Current London proprietary clubs include [[Soho House]], which commenced business in 1995, and [[Soho]]'s [[Groucho Club]], which opened in 1985 as &quot;the antidote to the traditional club.&quot; In this spirit, the club was named for [[Groucho Marx]] because of his famous remark that he would not wish to join any club that would have him as a member.

'''Draco Lucius Malfoy'''&lt;!--DO NOT add his birthdate here. That is in-universe format. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)--&gt; is a character in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. He is a student in [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s year belonging in the [[Slytherin]] house. He is frequently accompanied by his two cronies, [[Crabbe and Goyle|Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle]], who act as [[henchman|henchmen]]. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; nevertheless, he is a cunning user of magic. He was played by [[Tom Felton]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].

==Character development==
Draco serves as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the hero, [[Harry Potter (Character)|Harry Potter]] and is loosely based on [[Bullying|bullies]] Rowling encountered during her school days.&lt;ref name=&quot;WBUR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Lyndon|last=Christopher|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm#p12|title=J.K.

Rowling at the Royal Albert Hall|publisher=MSN.com, on Accio Quote!|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet ''Mudbloods'', should be denied a magical education. Harry's first impression that the Wizarding community is a &quot;magical wonderland&quot; is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, &quot;[Harry] found out that many people in power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty as they are in our world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;royal&quot;/&gt;

Malfoy was originally named &quot;Draco Spungen&quot; in the earliest drafts of ''Philosopher's Stone.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-ps-draft1.html|title=HPL: Guide to jkrowling.com- Transcript: Very early draft of Philosophers Stone (Page 1)|publisher=The Harry Potter Lexicon|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Spungen&quot; also appeared on her pre-canon class list, but it was crossed out and replaced with the surname &quot;Spinks&quot;, while &quot;Malfoy&quot; was later added after the completion of the list. Philip Nel believes that ''Malfoy'' is derived from the French phrase ''mal foi'', meaning &quot;bad faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In an article published in 2002, Nilsen and Nilsen argue that &quot;Draco&quot; has connotations with ''draconian'', and that his name starts with &quot;mal&quot;, a French prefix for &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many of Draco's relatives on his mother's side of the family (the Blacks) are named for stars or constellations (e.g., [[Sirius Black]], [[Regulus Black]], Andromeda Black Tonks, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black Lestrange]], Cygnus Black, Orion Black). Another constellation is Draco (the Dragon). Draco Malfoy eventually named his son for yet another constellation, Scorpius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.decodedscience.org/harry-potter-character-names-derived-from-astronomy/1512|title=Harry Potter Character Names Derived From Astronomy|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530074803/https://www.decodedscience.org/harry-potter-character-names-derived-from-astronomy/1512|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''===
Draco Malfoy makes his first appearance in the series when he and Harry meet while being fitted for school robes at Madam Malkin's, a clothing shop in [[Diagon Alley]]. Not realising that the boy in the store is Harry Potter—a child whose parents were murdered when he was one year old by the powerful dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]]—Draco engages him in (for him) polite conversation. Harry, however, is alienated by the arrogance of Draco, who asks whether the orphan's parents are &quot;our kind&quot; ([[Pure-blood (Harry Potter)|pure-blood wizards]]). Draco then proclaims that &quot;the other sort&quot; ([[Muggle-born]]s) should not be allowed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], because &quot;they've never been brought up to know our ways&quot;. The two boys part without introductions, but meet again on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. After Draco ridicules [[Ron Weasley]]'s family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship, demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. According to Rowling, Malfoy originally makes an effort to be Harry's friend because &quot;it will be cool to turn up at the school being Harry Potter's friend, because Harry is so famous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WBUR&quot;/&gt; However, Harry did not want Malfoy as a friend because he &quot;has been so rude about [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and about Ron, who Harry likes so much&quot;. At the first years' Sorting Ceremony, the [[Sorting Hat]] places him into Slytherin (barely touching Draco's head), the house that has developed all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, [[Severus Snape]], so-called follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by tricking him into participating in a midnight wizard's duel after secretly informing [[Argus Filch]] in advance, but the plan fails when Harry evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory.

===''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''===
In ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', Draco becomes the new Seeker for the Slytherin [[Quidditch]] team after his father, [[Lucius Malfoy]], donates new, high-quality [[Nimbus 2001]] broomsticks. When [[Hermione Granger]] comments that the Gryffindor players made the team through talent and not bribery, Draco responds by calling her a [[Mudblood]]. This provokes an immediate, violent response from Ron Weasley. Because of Draco's contempt for Muggle-borns, Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that Draco is the Heir of Slytherin, who has recently reopened the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. Harry and Ron disguise themselves as Crabbe and Goyle with Polyjuice Potion and infiltrate the Slytherin common room in an attempt to collect additional information, whereupon they realise that their initial suspicion about Draco is incorrect.

===''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''===
During Hagrid's debut as [[Care of Magical Creatures]] instructor in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', the [[hippogriff]], Buckbeak, attacks Draco after he fails to observe proper protocol while approaching it and insults it. He exaggerates the extent of his injury, giving Slytherin a chance to postpone their Quidditch match against Gryffindor until later in the year and as an attempt to have Hagrid fired. Hermione punches Draco when he mocks Hagrid for crying over Buckbeak's death sentence. Draco, who implies that he is aware of how [[Sirius Black]] was supposedly involved in the deaths of Harry's parents, also taunts Harry about the impending threat of Black: ''&quot;If it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him down myself.&quot;''

===''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''===
After Harry is unexpectedly chosen as a Triwizard Tournament champion in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Draco shows off a &quot;Support [[Cedric Diggory]]&quot; badge to Harry, then presses it to replace that phrase with &quot;Potter Stinks.&quot; Draco also gives malicious and often false information about Harry and Hagrid to [[Muckraker|muckraking]] ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' journalist [[Rita Skeeter]]. When Draco attempts to curse Harry behind his back, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor [[Alastor Moody]] (actually [[Barty Crouch, Jr]] in disguise via Polyjuice Potion) humiliates Draco by transforming him into a [[ferret]] and repeatedly slamming him against the ground as well as dropping him down Goyle's pants.

===''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''===
In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]],'' Draco is named a Slytherin prefect along with [[Pansy Parkinson]]. He gets Harry and the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]] banned from the Gryffindor Quidditch team when they attack him during a postmatch brawl after Draco insults their families following Gryffindor's win over Slytherin. He later joins [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s Inquisitorial Squad, with whom he plays an important part in the exposure of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. As the D.A. flees the [[Room of Requirement]], Draco earns Slytherin fifty points after catching Harry, and helps hold several members captive in Umbridge's office, letting them free only after Ginny Weasley performs her famous Bat Bogey Hex. After his father and other [[Death Eater]]s are captured and sentenced to Azkaban following the events at the [[Department of Mysteries]], Draco twice attempts to get revenge on Harry, but Snape and [[Minerva McGonagall]] thwart his first effort, and while returning home on the Hogwarts Express, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle are transformed into giant slugs by a barrage of hexes cast by several D.A. members coming to Harry's defence.

===''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''===
Draco is drawn into Death-Eaters' activities more directly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. Because of Lucius' arrest and fall from Voldemort's favour, [[Narcissa Malfoy]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] visit Snape at his home to discuss a dangerous task that Voldemort has assigned Draco. Narcissa, deeply worried that her son will be killed in his attempt to complete it, begs Snape to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to aid Draco with this task and protect him at all costs, and if Draco fails to complete the mission, he will complete it himself; he agrees.

Under the [[Cloak of Invisibility (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow Draco to [[Borgin and Burkes]], a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley. Draco threatens Mr. Borgin about repairing one item and keeping another safe for him. Draco shows Mr. Borgin something on his arm that Harry believes to be the [[Dark Mark]], Voldemort's sign, though whether or not Harry is correct is never confirmed. (In the film version Draco Malfoy shows Dumbledore the Dark Mark on his arm.) On the Hogwarts Express, Harry invisibly spies on Draco and overhears him discussing Voldemort's task with several other Slytherins. Draco knows Harry is present and, once alone in the compartment, immobilises him and breaks his nose causing Harry to hate Draco even more. Harry is left stranded on the train until [[Nymphadora Tonks]] ([[Luna Lovegood]] in the film adaptation) rescues him. Harry spends much of the year trailing Draco's whereabouts on his [[Marauder's Map]], but loses track of him once Draco enters the Room of Requirement. When [[Katie Bell (Harry Potter)|Katie Bell]] is almost killed in Hogsmeade after handling a cursed necklace and Ron nearly dies by drinking poisoned [[mead]], Harry suspects Draco is behind both attacks.

In this book, Draco is, for the first time since being introduced in the series, portrayed as having considerable initiative, ingenuity, and perseverance. However, unlike Harry, who always relies on his friends' support and help, Draco mostly works alone in the Room of Requirement, refusing to confide in or involve his own circle of friends, whom he treats more as underlings. This, and the realisation of what he is ultimately expected to do, nearly drives him to a nervous breakdown. When Harry walks in on Malfoy crying in [[Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom, Draco attempts to cast the Cruciatus Curse. Harry is faster to the draw with an obscure ''Sectumsempra'' spell that he learned from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince's book. The spell cuts deep gashes into Malfoy's face and chest, resulting in severe blood loss. Snape, alerted by Myrtle's screams, swiftly arrives and heals Draco's cuts, then takes him to the hospital wing.

Near the conclusion, Draco ambushes and disarms a gravely weakened Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower. After Draco disarms him, Dumbledore calmly reasons with the frightened teenager and persuades him to reveal how he was, according to Voldemort's orders, to kill the headmaster through the cursed necklace and the poisoned mead. Malfoy reveals that he mended the broken [[Vanishing Cabinet]] in the Room of Requirement to act as a portal enabling Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts. Draco is hesitant to kill Dumbledore and he eventually lowers his wand. Snape arrives, dispatches Dumbledore himself and then flees Hogwarts with Draco in tow. As revealed during his confrontation with Dumbledore, Draco was an insecure boy incapable of committing cold-blooded murder and was forced to do Voldemort's bidding under the threat of his and his parents' deaths. Harry, who was horrified by the result of his duel with Draco in the bathroom incident, feels &quot;the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike&quot; for his old rival.

During an interview in 2005, Rowling revealed that she enjoyed writing Draco in this book, and that the character &quot;did a lot of growing up&quot; as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;accio-quote.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1 =Anelli, Melissa |author2 =Spartz, Emerson|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm|title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two|work=The Leaky Cauldron on Accio Quote!|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malfoys remain reluctant followers of Voldemort, who now uses their home as his headquarters; Draco passes out after witnessing Voldemort murder [[Muggle Studies]] professor [[Charity Burbage]]. Harry experiences occasional and disturbing visions of Draco being forced into performing Voldemort's bidding and feels &quot;sickened... by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.&quot; When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, Draco is asked to identify them, and though they are clearly recognisable, he only ambiguously replies &quot;It might be.&quot; During the successful escape from Malfoy Manor headed by [[Dobby the house elf|Dobby]], Harry overpowers Draco and captures his wand.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem|Ravenclaw's diadem]] in the Room of Requirement, Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle (Blaise Zabini in film version rather than Crabbe), attempts to capture Harry alive. However, Crabbe (Goyle in film version) defies Draco's orders and attempts to kill the trio by casting the deadly [[Fiendfyre]]; unable to control the spell, he dies in the blaze while the trio rescue Draco and Goyle (Zabini in film version). Draco, despite his often condescending and belittling attitude toward Crabbe and Goyle (as well as his other underlings), grieves for his lost friend. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco is seen pleading with a Death Eater who seems intent on killing him. He is once again saved by Harry and Ron, the latter of whom punches Draco in the face under the invisibility cloak for attempting to appease the Death Eater.

At about this time, it is revealed through the [[Pensieve]] that Dumbledore had known he was dying after being cursed by [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|Voldemort's ring]]. However, to spare Draco's soul from being forever tainted by committing murder, Dumbledore pre-arranged his own death with Snape. Voldemort intended Draco to die in the attempt to kill Dumbledore so that Lucius would be punished for his failure to retrieve the prophecy from the [[Ministry of Magic]].

Although Draco does not directly take part in Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort, he influences its outcome. After Harry is struck by the ''[[Avada Kedavra]]'' curse, Voldemort orders Narcissa to verify that Harry is actually dead. She detects his heartbeat, but she lies to Voldemort, knowing that she will be allowed to search for her son if the Death Eaters return to Hogwarts ''&quot;as part of the conquering army.&quot;'' A plot twist reveals that Draco had unwittingly become the [[Elder Wand]]'s master when he disarmed Dumbledore, even though Draco never actually possessed the wand. The wand's allegiance passes to whoever defeats its owner, so Harry, having taken Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, became its new master; this prevents Voldemort from using its full power. In the end, it is Narcissa's lie to Voldemort concerning Harry's death that enables the Malfoys to narrowly avoid imprisonment in Azkaban.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript|title=J.K.

====Epilogue====
In the epilogue, Draco has married and has a son, Scorpius Malfoy.  Draco's hairline has receded, making his face look even more pointed. Though they are not friends, Malfoy has somewhat decreased his animosity toward Harry, and, upon seeing them at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]], gives a brief and curt nod to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat&quot; /&gt;

In his style and presentation of English history, Lingard demonstrates the prevalent manner of Catholic scholarship – he gives, for example, no indication that he is a priest on the title page, and professes emphatically to be writing an impartial history. But in a curious turnaround, his ''History'' by its very impartiality is a Catholic apologetic, and Lingard's desire for impartiality is a reflection of the Catholic political and intellectual situation in the Emancipation era.

The Catholic position in the early nineteenth century, politically speaking, was that of a minority body, allied to the Whig-Radical-Dissenting political grouping, and seeking religious and political freedom. This alliance encouraged Old Catholic intellectuals to present their arguments in 'liberal' and 'reasonable' form – the argumentative advantage in this being that it presented Catholics as enlightened and tolerant, and their opposition as prejudiced and bigoted.

Lingard himself argued that one of his chief duties as an historian was:&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;to weigh with care the value of the authorities on which I rely, and to watch with jealousy the secret workings of my own personal feelings and prepossessions. Such vigilance is a matter of necessity to every writer of history ... Otherwise, he will be continually tempted to make an unfair use of the privilege of the historian; he will sacrifice the interests of truth to the interests of party, national, or religious, or political.&quot; (J. Lingard, &quot;History of England&quot;, vol 1, 6th edition, London: Charles Dolman, 1854, p. 6.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lingard adopted a non-controversial and sober approach to history with the emphasis on incontrovertible fact and using primary rather than secondary sources.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;John Lingard&quot;, B. Ward, Catholic Encyclopedia, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the '''''History''''', Lingard faces the task of convincing Protestants of the fundamental truths of the Catholic faith, while maintaining an unbiased presentation of historical truth. He possesses little sense of &quot;preaching to the converted&quot; (in a very literal sense), and aims his work more at influencing Protestants than placating his Ultramontane opposition. In a letter of 18 December 1819, Lingard wrote: &quot;... my only chance of being read by Protestants depends upon my having the reputation of a temperate writer. The good to be done is by writing a book which Protestants will read.&quot; (Lingard to Kirke, in Haile, Bonney, '''''Life and Letters of John Lingard''''', 1771–1851, London: 1912, pp 166–67).

Lingard's '''''History''''' is also an apt demonstration of the advantages a Catholic historian of the time may have had, in terms of impartiality. Lingard's religion had to a large extent isolated him from the mainstream nationalism which surrounded Protestant historians, as well as from the growing &quot;[[Providentialism|providentialist]]&quot; concept of history. Lingard's strength of argument, however, continued to be popular, and the influence of Protestant animosity for Catholic apologetic also led him to develop a keen critical judgement. He was devoted to absolute accuracy and detail and the '''''History''''' was a groundbreaking work in its use of primary sources. Lingard made extensive use of Vatican archives and French, Italian, Spanish and English dispatches, document collections and state papers – the first British historian to do so. The peripheral nature of English Catholicism put him in a position of &quot;outside observer&quot; to much of English intellectual culture, and this is reflected in his historical works. Despite this distancing effect, however, Lingard maintained an active interest in politics all his life and was a noted pamphleteer.

The edition that is usually seen is a 10 volume set, &quot;to the Accession of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in 1688.&quot; There is an enlarged 13 volume set published just before Lingard's death which was his final revision, &quot;to the Commencement of the Reign of William the Third.&quot; '''''The History''''' was abridged and revised adding material to bring its treatment up to the then present and used as a text in English Catholic schools during the nineteenth century.

Lesser known than Lingard's historical works is his anonymously published translation of the Four Gospels in 1836. The title page reads simply that the work is &quot;by a Catholic.&quot; Lingard departed from usual Catholic practice by using early Greek manuscripts rather than the Latin Vulgate as the principal basis for the translation. This resulted in such renderings as &quot;repent&quot; rather than &quot;do penance&quot; (Matt 3:2). His willingness to depart from Catholic custom contrasts with his contempt for the Protestant concept of &quot;private interpretation&quot; of Scripture. In a note to John 1:1, he states, &quot;Hence it happens that men of every persuasion find confirmation of their peculiar opinions in the sacred volumes: for, in fact, it is not the Scripture that informs them, but that they affix their own meaning to the language of Scripture.&quot;

Lingard's work influenced [[Francis Kenrick|Francis P. Kenrick]] (1796–1863), Roman Catholic Bishop of Philadelphia, and later Archbishop of Baltimore, who published his own translation of the Four Gospels in 1849. By 1851, Lingard felt sufficiently confident to publish a new edition of his Four Gospels in his own name.

[[William Cobbett]] used Lingard's history as an unbiased reference source for his own ''History of the Protestant Reformation'' in which he puts forward the argument that the reformation had disastrous consequences for the ordinary people of England. His work would in turn be influential in the passage of the Catholic emancipation bill by preparing the way for public acceptance and the minimisation of sectarian violence.&lt;ref&gt;William Cobbett, ''A History of the Protestant Reformation'', Fisher Press, 1994, {{ISBN|1-874037-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:LinguardUshawPortrait.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of John Lingard.|Lonsdale’s portrait of Lingard at Ushaw College, Durham.]] --&gt;

Lingard was accorded no recognition by the British intellectual establishment. ''History of England'' is a substantial scholarly work which gave full treatment to the [[history of England]]. From 1811 until his death in 1851 Lingard spent most of his life in the village of [[Hornby, Lancashire|Hornby]] near Lancaster, where he devoted himself to his study and writing. A quiet, gentle man, he was well liked by the residents. Lingard's popularity as an historian had its day, but his contribution to [[historical method]] came at a critical point in British intellectual history. That he was also a Catholic priest, in a turbulent time for the Church in England, makes that contribution all the more interesting.

In 1821 Pope Pius VII honoured Lingard with a triple doctorate – in theology, canon law and civil law – and a few years later Leo XII conferred upon him a gold medal generally only given to cardinals and princes. There is even strong evidence that he was made a cardinal ''in pectore'' (&quot;in the breast&quot;) in 1826. This meant that the Pope could have announced the appointment publicly at some future time.

'''Gruinard Island''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|ɪ|n|j|ər|d}} {{respell|GRIN|yərd}};&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Miller, ''BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names'' (London: Oxford UP, 1971), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang-gd|Eilean Ghruinneard}}) is a small, oval-shaped [[Scotland|Scottish]] island approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|frac=4|abbr=off}} long by {{convert|1|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} wide, located in [[Gruinard Bay]], about halfway between [[Gairloch]] and [[Ullapool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reopening Public Facilities After a Biological Attack: A Decision-Making Framework|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11324&amp;page=196|page=196|year=2005|author=United States National Research Council|authorlink=United States National Research Council|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|isbn=978-0-309-09661-4|doi=10.17226/11324}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its closest point to the mainland it is about {{convert|1|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} offshore. The island was dangerous for all mammals after experiments with the [[anthrax]] bacterium in 1942, until it was decontaminated in the late 20th century.

==Early history==
The island was mentioned by [[Donald Monro (priest)|Dean Munro]] who travelled the area in the mid-16th century. He wrote that it was [[Clan MacKenzie]] territory, was &quot;full of woods&quot;, (a striking comparison with its treelessness today) and that it was &quot;guid for fostering of thieves and rebellis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Monro (1549) &quot;Gruynorde&quot; no. 178&lt;/ref&gt; meaning good for fostering thieves and rebels.

The population was recorded as six in 1881, but Gruinard has been uninhabited since the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological warfare testing==
{{main|Operation Vegetarian}}
In 1942, during the Second World War, a [[biological warfare]] test was carried out on Gruinard by British military scientists from the Biology Department of [[Porton Down]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1457035.stm Britain's 'Anthrax Island'], 25 July 2001 ''news.bbc.co.uk'', accessed 5 March 2020&lt;/ref&gt; The British government was investigating the feasibility of a [[bioweapons]] attack using [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1643031.stm Living with anthrax island], BBC, 'In 1942 it became the focus of the UK's secret effort to find a weapon capable of defeating the Nazis.', '&quot;I understand Winston Churchill was very keen on using anthrax,&quot; says local historian Donald McIntyre. &quot;He didn't see why the devil should have all the best weapons.&quot;' 8 November 2001 ''news.bbc.co.uk'', accessed 5 March 2020&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised that tests would cause long-lasting contamination of the immediate area by anthrax spores, so a remote and uninhabited island was required. Gruinard was surveyed, deemed suitable, and requisitioned from its owners by the British Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;asanltr1990&quot;&gt;Pearson, Dr. Graham S. (October 1990) [http://www.asanltr.com/newsletter/01-5/articles/015c.htm &quot;Gruinard Island Returns to Civil Use &quot;] ''The ASA Newsletter''. Applied Science and Analysis. Inc. Retrieved 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Porton Down meteorologist Sir [[Oliver Graham Sutton]] was put in charge of a fifty-man team to conduct the trial, with [[David Willis Wilson Henderson|David Henderson]] in charge of the germ bomb. Biology Department head [[Paul Fildes]] made frequent visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biological Weapons|first= Jeanne|last=Guillemin|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthrax strain chosen was a highly [[virulent]] type called &quot;[[Vollum strain|Vollum 14578]]&quot;, named after R. L. Vollum, Professor of Bacteriology at the [[University of Oxford]], who supplied it.&lt;ref name=&quot;holl&quot;&gt;[http://deepblade.net/journal/Holland_JUNE2005.pdf United States exports of biological materials to Iraq: Compromising the credibility of international law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206055057/http://deepblade.net/journal/Holland_JUNE2005.pdf |date=6 February 2012 }}, Geoffrey Holland, University of Sussex, 'Anthrax was the weapon of choice and between 1942 and 1943 [Dr Paul Fildes'] team from Porton Down took over the remote Scottish island of Gruinard, where they detonated a series of anthrax-laden bombs, testing their killing efficiency using sheep', 'Dr Fildes obtained this anthrax from Prof R L Vollum – Professor of Bacteriology at Oxford University', ''&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty sheep were taken to the island and bombs filled with [[anthrax]] spores were exploded close to where selected groups were tethered. The sheep became infected with anthrax and began to die within days of exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;

Some of the experiments were recorded on [[16 mm]] colour movie film, which was [[Classified information|declassified]] in 1997. One sequence shows the detonation of an anthrax bomb fixed at the end of a tall pole supported with [[guy rope]]s. After the bomb explodes, a brownish [[atmospheric particulate matter|aerosol]] cloud drifts away towards the target animals. A later sequence shows anthrax-infected sheep carcasses being burned in incinerators at the end of the experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonicbomb.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.sonicbomb.com/iv1.php?vid=anthrax_island&amp;id=533&amp;w=400&amp;h=300&amp;ttitle=Anthrax%20Island Anthrax Island (video)] ''www.sonicbomb.com'', accessed 5 March 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

After the tests were completed, scientists concluded that a large release of anthrax spores would thoroughly pollute German cities, rendering them uninhabitable for decades afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; Those conclusions were supported by the inability to decontaminate the island after the experiment—the spores were sufficiently durable to resist any efforts at decontamination.

In 1945, when the island's owner sought its return, the Ministry of Supply recognised that the island was contaminated, and so could not be de-requisitioned until it was deemed safe. In 1946, the government agreed to acquire the island and to take responsibility for it. The owner or her heirs would be able to repurchase the island for £500 when it was declared &quot;fit for habitation by man and beast&quot;.

For many years, it was judged too hazardous and expensive to decontaminate the island sufficiently to allow public access, and Gruinard Island was [[quarantine]]d indefinitely. Visits to the island were prohibited, except for periodic checks by Porton Down personnel to determine the level of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives file WO 188/2783 &quot;Gruinard Island following contamination by anthrax: annual inspections; correspondence&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Dark Harvest==
In 1981 newspapers began receiving messages with the heading &quot;[[Dark Harvest Commando|Operation Dark Harvest]]&quot; which demanded that the government decontaminate the island, and reported that a &quot;team of microbiologists from two universities&quot; had landed on the island with the aid of local people and collected {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of soil.

The group threatened to leave samples of the soil &quot;at appropriate points that will ensure the rapid loss of indifference of the government and the equally rapid education of the general public&quot;. The same day a sealed package of soil was left outside the military research facility at [[Porton Down]]; tests revealed that it contained anthrax bacilli. A few days later another sealed package of soil was left in [[Blackpool]], where the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was holding its annual conference. The soil did not contain anthrax, but officials said that the soil was similar to that found on the island.&lt;ref name=darkharvest&gt;{{cite news|title=Dark Harvest|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922652,00.html|date=9 November 1981|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decontamination==
Starting in 1986 a determined effort was made to decontaminate the island: 280 tonnes of [[formaldehyde]] solution diluted in sea water was sprayed over all 196 hectares of the island and the worst-contaminated [[topsoil]] around the dispersal site was removed. A flock of sheep was then placed on the island and remained healthy.

On 24 April 1990, after 48 years of quarantine and four years after the solution was applied, junior defence minister [[Michael Neubert]] visited the island and announced its safety by removing the warning signs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; On 1 May 1990, the island was repurchased by the heirs of the original owner for the original sale price of £500.&lt;ref name=&quot;asanltr1990&quot;/&gt;

==Popular culture references==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The island is mentioned in the novels ''The Anthrax Mutation'' by Alan Scott (1971), ''[[The Enemy (Desmond Bagley novel)|The Enemy]]'' by [[Desmond Bagley]] (1977), ''[[Sea of Death]]'' by [[Richard P. Henrick]] (1992), ''[[The Fist of God]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]] (1994), ''Quantico'' by [[Greg Bear]] (2005), ''[[The Big Over Easy]]'' by [[Jasper Fforde]] (2005),  ''[[Forbidden Island]]'' by [[Malcolm Rose]] (2009), ''And then you die'' by [[Iris Johansen]] (1998), ''The Island'' by R J Price (better-known as the poet [[Richard Price (poet)|Richard Price]]) (2010) and ''[[The Impossible Dead]]'' by [[Ian Rankin]] (2011),''White Pines'' by [[Gemma Amor]] (2020). It also features as the principal setting for the novel ''El año de gracia'' by [[Cristina Fernández Cubas]], in which the protagonist spends a winter shipwrecked on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Cubas, Cristina. ''El año de gracia''. Originally published in 1985. Tusquets Editores, {{ISBN|978-8-47223-750-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issues 187–188 of the comic book ''[[Hellblazer]]'', in a story titled &quot;Bred in the Bone&quot;, the protagonist's niece finds herself on Gruinard surrounded by flesh-eating children. The issues were released in 2003 and were written by [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]] and illustrated by Doug Alexander Gregory.

An episode of the British wartime TV series ''[[Foyle's War]]'' entitled &quot;Bad Blood&quot; involved biological testing – a strong reference to the Gruinard testing.

The ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' episode &quot;Three Dead Cows at Makapu, Part 2&quot; featured a scientist played by [[Ed Flanders]] who threatened to unleash a deadly virus on the island of [[Oahu]]. When being interrogated, the scientist briefly mentions Gruinard Island and how it will be uninhabitable for a century due to anthrax experiments.

''[[Outlying Islands (play)|Outlying Islands]]'', a Fringe First winning play by Scottish dramatist [[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]], is a fictionalised account of two British scientists' visit to an island in Scotland where the government plans to test anthrax inspired by the story of Gruinard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theatreweekly.com/atticist-to-bring-outlying-islands-to-kings-head-theatre/|title=Atticist to Bring Outlying Islands to King’s Head Theatre|website=theatreweekly.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UK TV series ''[[Utopia (UK TV series)|Utopia]]'' describes the fictional outbreak of a new form of flu. During Episode 3, Dugdale visits the proposed origin of the virus at the, now quarantined, [[Fetlar|Island of Fetlar]]. On arrival, personnel at the Island, wearing orange overalls, carry one of numerous covered bodies past on a stretcher in a scene that is nearly identical to that seen in the original test footage from Gruinard Island. In the dramatisation however, the personnel at Fetlar are seen wearing dust masks as opposed to the gas masks seen in the Gruinard footage; likely due to budget constraints (much of Utopia was not filmed where it claims to be).&lt;ref name=&quot;sonicbomb.com&quot;/&gt;

The experiments are referred to in the storyline of '[[List of Silent Witness episodes#Series 16 (2013)|Trust]]', the third and fourth episodes of Series 16 of the BBC series ''[[Silent Witness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzqcm/episodes/guide | title=BBC One - Silent Witness, Series 16, Trust - Episode guide | access-date=20 August 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927051016/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzqcm/episodes/guide | archive-date=27 September 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Namibia}}
'''South West Africa''' ({{lang-af|Suidwes-Afrika}}; {{lang-de|Südwestafrika}}; {{lang-nl|Zuidwest-Afrika}}) was the name for modern-day [[Namibia]] when it was under [[South Africa]]n administration, from 1915 to 1990.

Previously the colony of [[German South West Africa]] from 1884–1915, it was made a [[League of Nations mandate]] of the [[British Empire|British-ruled]] [[Union of South Africa]] following [[German Empire|Germany’s]] defeat in [[World War I]]. Although the mandate was abolished by the UN in 1966, South African rule continued despite it being illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/pcw/98678.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233840/http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/pcw/98678.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=The End of Apartheid|date=2009|access-date=5 February 2009|work=Archive: Information released online prior to January 20, 2009|publisher=United States Department of State|quote=South Africa had illegally occupied neighboring Namibia at the end of World War II, and since the mid-1970s, Pretoria had used it as a base to fight the communist party in Angola.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory was administered directly by the South African government from 1915 to 1978, when the [[Turnhalle Constitutional Conference]] laid the groundwork for semi-autonomous rule. During an interim period between 1978 and 1985, South Africa gradually granted South West Africa a limited form of home rule, culminating in the formation of a [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Namibia)|Transitional Government of National Unity]].

In 1990, South West Africa was granted independence as the Republic of Namibia with the exception of [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]], which continued to remain under South African rule until 1994.

==German colony==
{{Main|German South West Africa}}

As a [[German colonial empire|German colony]] from 1884, it was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''). Germany had a difficult time administering the territory, which experienced many insurrections against the harsh German rule, especially those led by guerilla leader [[Jacob Morenga]]. The main port, [[Walvis Bay]], and the [[Penguin Islands]] were annexed by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] in 1878, becoming part of the [[Cape Colony]] in 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;receuil&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1GU1KXstegC&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;ots=l9xeWFz_oy&amp;dq=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;f=true Succession of States and Namibian territories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309074452/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1GU1KXstegC&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;ots=l9xeWFz_oy&amp;dq=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=%22South%20West%20Africa%20Affairs%20Act%20%22%201922&amp;f=true |date=2016-03-09 }}, Y.

As part of the [[Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty]] in 1890, a corridor of land taken from the northern border of [[Bechuanaland]], extending as far as the [[Zambezi river]], was added to the colony. It was named the [[Caprivi Strip]] (''Caprivizipfel'') after the [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|German Chancellor]] [[Leo von Caprivi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.org/travel/namibia/caprivi.htm Caprivi Strip | Namibia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930030935/http://namibian.org/travel/namibia/caprivi.htm |date=2010-09-30 }}.

==South African rule==
In 1915, during the [[South West Africa Campaign]] of [[World War I]], South Africa captured the German colony. After the war, it was declared a [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate#Class C mandates|Class C Mandate territory]] under the [[Treaty of Versailles]], with the Union of South Africa responsible for the administration of South West Africa. From 1922, this included Walvis Bay, which, under the South West Africa Affairs Act, was governed as if it were part of the mandated territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;geography&quot;&gt;Ieuan Griffiths,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40572467.pdf Walvis Bay: exclave no more] ''Geography'', Vol. 79, No. 4 (October 1994), page 354&lt;/ref&gt; South West Africa remained a League of Nations Mandate until [[World War II]] and  the collapse of the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&amp;pg=PA223|title=Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|year=2001|isbn=1560729678|location=Huntington, New York|page=223|access-date=2018-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718084139/https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&amp;pg=PA223|archive-date=2018-07-18|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandate was supposed to become a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] when League of Nations Mandates were transferred to the [[United Nations]] following World War II. The [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]], [[Jan Smuts]], objected to South West Africa coming under UN control and refused to allow the territory's transition to independence, instead seeking to make it South Africa's fifth province in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;

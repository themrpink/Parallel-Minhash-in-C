All licence fees were abolished in 1974 by the [[Australian Labor Party]] government led by [[Gough Whitlam]] on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;1974–75 Budget speech by the Hon Frank Crean, APH Hansard, 17 September 1974, p1290, introduced through the ''Broadcasting and Television Act 1974'' (Cth)&lt;/ref&gt; The ABC has since then been funded by government grants, now totalling around [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.13&amp;nbsp;billion a year, and its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.).

===Belgium===
====Flemish region and Brussels====
The [[Flemish region]] of [[Belgium]] and [[Brussels]] abolished its television licence in 2001. The [[Flemish people|Flemish]] broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] is now funded from general taxation.

==== Walloon region ====
As of 1 January 2018, the licence fee in the [[Wallonia|Walloon region]] has been abolished. All licences still in effect at this point will remain in effect and payable until the period is up, but will not be renewed after that period (for example, a licence starting 1 April 2017 will still need to be paid until 31 May 2018. After this point, you will not need to pay for a licence).&lt;ref name=&quot;Belgium2018&quot; /&gt;

The licence fee in Belgium's Walloon region (encompassing the French and German speaking communities) was €100.00 for a TV and €0.00 for a radio in a vehicle (Government of Wallonia decree of 1 December 2008, article 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie.be/cmsmedia/fr/autoradio_television_tout_savoir_sur_la_redevance_pdf.pdf?uri=8a838083007a58500100bd7b7b5a0eee |title=Autoradio Television Tout Savoir Sur la Redevance |accessdate=19 July 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509202223/http://www.wallonie.be/cmsmedia/fr/autoradio_television_tout_savoir_sur_la_redevance_pdf.pdf?uri=8a838083007a58500100bd7b7b5a0eee |archivedate=9 May 2006 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one licence was needed for each household with a functional TV receiver regardless of the number, but each car with a radio had to have a separate car radio licence. Household radios did not require a licence. The money raised by the fee was used to fund Belgium's French and German public broadcasters ([[RTBF]] and [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] respectively). The TV licence fee was paid by people with surnames beginning with a letter between A and J between 1 April and 31 May inclusive; those with surnames beginning with a letter between K to Z paid between 1 October and 30 November inclusive. People with certain disabilities were exempt from paying the television licence fee.  Hotels and similar lodging establishments paid an additional fee of €50.00 for each additional functional TV receiver and paid between 1 January and 1 March inclusive.

=== Bulgaria ===
Currently, the public broadcasters [[Bulgarian National Television]] (BNT) and [[Bulgarian National Radio]] (BNR) are almost entirely financed by the [[Economy of Bulgaria|national budget of Bulgaria]]. After the fall of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communism]] and introduction of democracy in the 1990s, the topic of financing public television and radio broadcasting was widely discussed. One of the methods to raise funding was by collecting a users fee from every [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Bulgaria. [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)|Parliament]] approved and included the fee in the Radio and Television Law; however, the [[President of Bulgaria|president]] imposed a veto on the law and a public discussion on the fairness of the decision started. Critics said that this is unacceptable, as many people will be paying for a service they may not be using. The parliament decided to keep the resolution in the law but imposed a temporary regime of financing the broadcasters through the national budget. The law has not been changed to this day; however, the temporary regime is still in effect and has been constantly prolonged. As a result, there is no fee to pay and the funding comes from the national budget.

===Canada===

[[File:Special Private Receiving Station License 1948-49.jpg|thumb|right|From 1922 to 1953 individual members of the public were required to pay for annual Private Receiving Station licences to legally receive broadcasting stations.]]
Canada eliminated its broadcasting receiver licence in 1953, replacing it with TV equipment excise taxes, shortly after the introduction of a television service.&lt;ref name=&quot;eliminated&quot;&gt;[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/fin/F1-23-1-1953-eng.pdf#page=21 &quot;Budget Speech Delivered by Hon. D. C. Abbott, Minister of Finance, in the House of Commons, Thursday, February 19, 1953&quot;], page 21 (gc.ca)&lt;/ref&gt; The Radiotelegraph Act of 6 June 1913 established the initial Canadian policies for radio communication. Similar to the law in force in Britain, this act required that operation of &quot;any radiotelegraph apparatus&quot; required a licence, issued by the Minister of the Naval Service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015064554697&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=211 &quot;Laws and Regulations—Canada&quot;], ''The Year-Book of Wireless Telegraphy &amp; Telephony'' (1914 edition), pages 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This included members of the general public who only possessed a radio receiver and were not making transmissions, who were required to hold an &quot;Amateur Experimental Station&quot; licence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2605161&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1508 &quot;Regulations: 18. Amateur Experimental Licenses&quot;],''The Canadian Gazette'', 27 June 1914, page 4546.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as pass the exam needed to receive an &quot;Amateur Experimental Certificate of Proficiency&quot;, which required the ability to send and receive Morse code at five words a minute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2605161&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1512 &quot;Regulations: 97. Amateur Experimental Certificate&quot;],''The Canadian Gazette'', 27 June 1914, page 4550.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1922 the government lowered the barrier for individuals merely interested in receiving broadcasts, by introducing a new licence category, Private Receiving Station, that removed the need to qualify for an amateur radio licence.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Vipond, ''Listening In: The First Decade of Canadian Broadcasting 1922–1932'', McGill-Queen's University Press, 1992, pages 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu06812988&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1371 Radiotelegraph Regulations: License to Operate a Radio Receiving Equipment&quot;], ''The Canada Gazette'', 23 September 1922, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The receiving station licences initially cost $1 and had to be renewed yearly. 

The licence fee eventually rose to $2.50 per year to provide revenue for both radio and television broadcasts by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, however, it was eliminated effective 1 April 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;eliminated&quot;/&gt; This action exempted broadcast-only receivers from licensing, and the Department of Transport (DOT) was given authority to exempt other receiver types from licensing as it saw fit. DOT exempted all &quot;home-type&quot; receivers capable of receiving any radio communications other than &quot;public correspondence&quot; (defined as &quot;radio transmissions not intended to be received by just anyone but rather by a member of the public who has paid for the message&quot; – examples include ship-to-shore radiotelephone calls or car-phone transmissions). After 1952, licences were required in Canada only for general coverage shortwave receivers with single-sideband capability, and VHF/UHF scanners which could tune to the maritime or land mobile radiotelephone bands.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Beginning in 1982, in response to a Canadian court's finding that all unscrambled radio signals imply a forfeiture of the right to privacy, the DOC (Department of Communications) required receiver licensing only in cases where it was necessary to ensure technical compatibility with the transmitter.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Regulation SOR-89-253 (published in the 4 February 1989 issue of the ''Canada Gazette'', pages 498–502) removed the licence requirement for all radio and TV receivers.

The responsibility for regulating radio spectrum affairs in Canada has devolved to a number of federal departments and agencies. It was under the oversight of the Department of Naval Service from 1913 until 1 July 1922, when it was transferred to civilian control under the Department of Marine and Fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112044283692&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=105 &quot;5. Radiotelegraph Service&quot;], ''Report of the Department of the Naval Service for the Fiscal Year Ending 31 March 1922'' (30 June 1922), page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Department of Transport (from 1935 to 1969), Department of Communications (1969 to 1996) and most recently to Industry Canada (since 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Gregory|date=20 February 2013|title=Oil in the Ether: A Critical History of Spectrum Auctions in Canada|url=https://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2600|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|volume=38|issue=1|doi=10.22230/cjc.2013v38n1a2600|issn=1499-6642|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyprus ===
[[Cyprus]] used to have an indirect but obligatory tax for [[CyBC]], its state-run public broadcasting service. The tax was added to electricity bills, and the amount paid depended on the size of the home. By the late 1990s, it was abolished due to pressure from private commercial radio and TV broadcasters. CyBC is currently funded by advertising and government grants.

=== Finland ===
On 1 January 2013, [[Finland]] replaced its television licence with a direct unconditional income ''[[Yle tax|public broadcasting tax]]'' ({{lang-fi|yleisradiovero}}, {{lang-sv|rundradioskatt}}) for individual taxpayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;End of the road for TV license fees&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-maksu.fi/en/index/tietoa/uutiset/2012/P_63.html|title=Tämä domain on varattu asiakkaallemme |website=Tv-maksu.fi|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-maksu.fi/en/index.html|title=Tämä domain on varattu asiakkaallemme |website=Tv-maksu.fi|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous fee, this tax is progressive, meaning that people will pay up to €163 depending on income. The lowest income recipients, persons under the age of eighteen years, and residents in the autonomous [[Åland Islands]] are exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/information_and_material_on_taxatio/public_broadcasting_tax/ |title=Article in ''Finnish Public Broadcasting Tax for individual taxpayers'' |access-date=6 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191205/https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/information_and_material_on_taxatio/public_broadcasting_tax/ |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the introduction of the Yle tax, the television fee in [[Finland]] used to be between €244.90 and €253.80 (depending on the interval of payments) per annum for a household with TV (as of 2011). It was the primary source of funding for [[Yleisradio]] (Yle), a role which has now been taken over by the Yle tax.

===Gibraltar===
It was announced in [[Gibraltar]]'s [[budget]] speech of 23 June 2006 that Gibraltar would abolish its TV licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2006/CM_Speech.pdf Chief Minister's Budget Speech] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007054329/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2006/CM_Speech.pdf |date=7 October 2006}}, Government of Gibraltar Information Services, 28 June 2006.

However, the majority of the GBC's funding came in the form of a grant from the government.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]] the licence fees nominally exist, but since 2002 the government has decided to pay them out of the state budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively this means that funding for [[Magyar Televízió]] and [[Duna TV]] now comes from the government through taxation.

As of spring 2007 commercial units (hotels, bars etc.) have to pay television licence fees again, on a per TV set basis.

Since the parliament decides on the amount of public broadcasters' income, during the [[Late-2000s recession|2009 crisis]] it was possible for it to decide to cut their funding by more than 30%. This move was publicly condemned by the EBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong had a radio and television licence fee imposed by [[RTHK|Radio Hong Kong (RHK)]] and [[Rediffusion Television]]. The licence cost $36 [[Hong Kong dollar]]s per year. Over-the-air radio and television terrestrial broadcasts were always free of charge since 1967, no matter whether they are analogue or digital.

There were public television programmes produced by [[RTHK|Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK)]]. RTHK is funded by the [[Hong Kong Government]], before having its TV channel, it used commercial television channels to broadcast its programmes, and each of the traditional four terrestrial commercial TV channels in Hong Kong ([[TVB Jade]] and [[ATV Home]], which carried Cantonese-language broadcasts, and [[TVB Pearl]] and [[ATV World]], which carried English-language broadcasts), were required to broadcast 2.5&amp;nbsp;hours of public television per week. However, there is no such requirement for newer digital channels.

As of 2017, RTHK has three digital television channels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rthk.hk/about/dtt/intro_e.htm|title=RTHK Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting|publisher=RTHK|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTHK 31, RTHK 32 and RTHK 33. RTHK's own programmes will return to RTHK's channels in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/693608/rthk-lays-out-plan-four-digital-tv-channels|title=RTHK lays out plan for four digital TV channels|author=Joshua But|date=3 April 2012|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The TV licence fee for [[Iceland]]'s state broadcaster [[RÚV]] was abolished in 2007. Instead a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] of 17,200 [[Icelandic króna|kr.]] is collected from all people who pay income tax, regardless of whether they use television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruv.is/um-ruv/afnotadeild |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005203314/http://ruv.is/um-ruv/afnotadeild |archivedate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]] introduced a radio receiver licence system in 1928, for [[All India Radio]] Aakaashavani. With the advent of television broadcasting in 1956–57, television was also licensed. With the spurt in television stations beginning 1971–72, a separate broadcasting company, [[Doordarshan]], was formed. The radio and television licences in question needed to be renewed at the post offices yearly. The annual premium for radio was Rs 15 in the 1970s and 1980s. Radio licence stamps were issued for this purpose. License fees for TV were Rs 50. The wireless license inspector from the post office was authorized to check every house/shop for a WLB (Wireless License Book) and penalize and even seize the radio or TV. In 1984, the licensing system was withdrawn with both of the Indian national public broadcasters, AIR and Doordarshan, funded instead by the Government of India and by advertising.

===Indonesia===
The radio tax to supplement [[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]] funding was introduced in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Home/Details/25253/uu-no-12-tahun-1947| title = Undang-undang (UU) No. 12 Tahun 1947 Menetapkan &quot;Pajak Radio&quot; atas Semua Pesawat Penerimaan Radio| website = [[Audit Board of Indonesia|Financial Audit Board of Indonesia]]| accessdate = 27 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; about two years after its foundation and in height of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], initially set at [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]5 per month. The tax was abolished sometime in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Possibly shortly after [[TVRI]] begun broadcasting in 1962, the television fee later was also introduced. Originally the TVRI Foundation (''Yayasan TVRI'') was assigned to collect the fee, but in 1990 President [[Suharto]] enacted a presidential statement to gave fee collecting authority to Mekatama Raya, a private company run by his son Sigit Harjojudanto and Suharto's cronies, in the name of the foundation starting in 1991. The problems surrounding the fee collection and the public protests making the company no longer collecting the fee a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Kitley, P. (2000). ''Television, Nation, and Culture in Indonesia''. [[Ohio University]] Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; The television fee then slowly disappeared, though in some places such as [[Bandung]] the fee still exist as of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.kompasiana.com/djuliantosusantio/57ba4715b67a61190b16fe36/pajak-radio-dan-pajak-televisi-hilang-ditelan-modernisasi| title = Pajak Radio dan Pajak Televisi Hilang Ditelan Modernisasi| author = Djulianto Susantio| website = Kompasiana.com| date = 22 August 2016| accessdate = 27 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Act No. 32 of 2002 on Broadcasting, the newly-transformed RRI and TVRI funding comes from several sources, one of them is the so-called &quot;broadcasting fee&quot; ({{lang-id|iuran penyiaran}}). However, as of today the fee is yet to be implemented. Currently the funding of the two comes primarily from the annual state budget and &quot;non-tax state revenue&quot;, either by advertising or other sources regulated in government regulations.

===Israel===
Israel's television tax was abolished in September 2015, retroactively to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/iba-workers-cry-foul-over-ban-on-expressing-political-opinions/|title=State broadcast journalists condemn ban on expressing political opinions|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television licence for 2014 in Israel for every household was [[Israeli new shekel|₪]] 345 (€73) and the radio licence (for car owners only) was [[Israeli new shekel|₪]] 136 (€29). The licence fee was the primary source of revenue for the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]], the state broadcaster, which was closed down and replaced by the [[Israeli Broadcasting Corporation]] in May 2017; however, its radio stations carry full advertising and some TV programmes are sponsored by commercial entities and the radio licence (for car owners only) for 2020 is [[Israeli new shekel|₪]] 164 (€41).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.il/he/Departments/Guides/vehicles_licences?chapterIndex=5|title=gov|website=gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liechtenstein ===
To help fund a national cable broadcasting network between 1978 and 1998 under the Law on Radio and television, [[Liechtenstein]] demanded an annual household broadcasting licence for households that had broadcasting receiving equipment. The annual fee which was last requested in 1998, came to [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 180.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welcome.li/artikel-202.html|title=Welcome.li – Branchenbuch für Liechtenstein|last=reg.|first=IDT Internet Directories Trust|website=welcome.li|language=de|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, this provided an income of 2.7&amp;nbsp;million francs of which 1.1&amp;nbsp;million went the [[Swisscom|PTT]] and CHF 250,000 to the Swiss national broadcaster [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|SRG]]. Since then, the government replaced this with an annual government grant for public media of CHF 1.5&amp;nbsp;million which is administrated under the supervision of the Mediakommision.

The sole radio station of the principality [[:de:Radio Liechtenstein|Radio Liechtenstein]], was founded as a private commercial music station in 1995. In 2004, it was nationalised by the government under the ownership of [[:de:Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk|Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk]], to create a domestic [[public broadcasting]] station broadcasting news and music. The station is funded by commercials and the public broadcasting grant. A commercial television station, [[1FLTV]], was launched in August 2008.

There have been suggestions of reintroducing a public broadcasting fee in Liechtenstein, and in the 2014–2017 government, budget outlined such as a proposal. However, this was rejected in 2015. One possible reason is that two-thirds of the listenership of Radio Liechtenstein is Swiss and they wouldn't pay such a fee.

===Malaysia===
Until it was discontinued in April 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Chun Wah|editor2-last=Goonasekera|editor2-first=Anura|editor3-last=Venkatraman|editor3-first=S.|title=Asian Communication Handbook|date=2003|publisher=Asian Mass Communication Research and Information Centre|isbn=9971-905-97-3|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ua4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; television licence in [[Malaysia]] was paid on an annual basis of MYR 24 (MYR 2 per month), one of the lowest fees for television service in the world. Now, [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]] is funded by government tax and advertising, whilst Media Prima owned another four more private broadcasting channels of TV3, NTV7, 8TV and TV9. The other two, [[TV Alhijrah]] and [[Worldview Broadcasting Channel|WBC]] are smaller broadcasters. [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] is a paid television service, so they operate by the monthly fees given to them by customers, and it is the same thing for [[HyppTV]] and [[ABNXcess]].

===Malta===
The licence fee in [[Malta]] was €34.90.&lt;ref name=&quot;ero&quot;&gt;(May 2006) [http://www.ero.dk/documentation/docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCREP084.PDF Analysis of Responses on Fees for Broadcasting and Fees for Non-Commercial and Passive Services] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615191909/http://www.ero.dk/documentation/docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCREP084.PDF |date=15 June 2007}}, Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)
within the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to fund the television ([[Television Malta|TVM]]) and radio channels (Radio Malta and Radju Parliament) run by [[Public Broadcasting Services]]. Approximately two-thirds of TVM's funding came from the licence fee, with much of the remainder coming from commercials.&lt;ref&gt;(May 2002) [http://www.circom-regional.org/crdocs/european-benchmarking2002.pdf European Benchmarking: Public Service Broadcasters in the Digital Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009131525/http://www.circom-regional.org/crdocs/european-benchmarking2002.pdf |date=9 October 2009}}, Circom Regional (European Association of Regional Television). Retrieved 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Malta's television licence was abolished in 2011 when the [[free-to-air]] system was discontinued.

=== Netherlands ===
Since 1967, advertising has been introduced on public television and radio, but this was only allowed as a small segment before and after news broadcasts. It wasn't until the late 1980s so-called &quot;floating commercial breaks&quot; were introduced, these breaks are usually segments of multiple commercials with a total duration of 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;minutes and are placed in-between programmes, to allow programmes themselves to run uninterrupted. At the time, advertising on Sundays still wasn't yet allowed, mainly in part due to the heavy influence of the churches. In 1991 advertising on Sundays slowly began to take place.

With the plan to abolish the licence fee in 2000 due to the excessive collection costs&lt;ref name=&quot;ero&quot; /&gt; and to pay for public television from government funds, [[income tax]] was increased&lt;ref name=&quot;ero&quot; /&gt; in the late 1990s and maximum run time of commercial breaks was extended to 5 and 7&amp;nbsp;minutes. The [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] is now funded by government subsidy and advertising. The amount of time used by commercial breaks may not exceed 15% of the daily available broadcasting time and 10% of the total yearly available time.

===New Zealand===
Licence fees were first used in New Zealand to fund the radio services of what was to become the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]]. Television was introduced in 1960 and with it the television licence fee, later known as the public broadcasting fee. This was capped at [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]100 a year in the 1970s, and the country's two television channels, while still publicly owned, became increasingly reliant on advertising. From 1989, it was collected and disbursed by the Broadcasting Commission ([[NZ On Air]]) on a contestable basis to support local content production. The public broadcasting fee was abolished in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/1999/pdfs/exec-sum99.pdf Investing in the Next Generation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216134431/http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/1999/pdfs/exec-sum99.pdf |date=16 February 2016 }}, Economic and Fiscal Forecast Summary, [[New Zealand Treasury]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; NZ On Air was then funded by a direct appropriation from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

=== North Macedonia ===
As of 19 January 2017, the licence fee was abolished.

The licence fee in the [[Republic of North Macedonia]] was around €26 per year.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2005 it was collected monthly as part of the electricity bill. The Law on Broadcasting Activity, which was adopted in November 2005, reads that the Public Broadcasting Service – Macedonian Radio and Television (MRT) shall collect the broadcast fee.
The funds collected from the broadcasting fee are allocated in the following manner:

* 72% for MRT for covering costs for creating and broadcasting programmes;
* 4.5% for MRT for technical and technological development;
* 16% for MRD (Makedonska Radiodifuzija – Public operator of the transmission networks of the Public Broadcasting Service) for maintenance and use of the public broadcasting network;
* 3.5% for MRD for public broadcasting network development and
* 4% for the Broadcasting Council for regulating and development of the broadcasting activity in the Republic of North Macedonia.

The MRT shall keep 0.5% of the collected funds from the broadcasting fee as a commission fee.

However, MRT still has not found an effective mechanism for collection of the broadcast tax, so it has suffered a severe underfunding in recent years.

The Macedonian Government decided to update the Law on Broadcasting authorizing the Public Revenue Office to be in charge of the collection of the broadcast fee.

In addition to broadcast fee funding, [[Macedonian Radio-Television]] (MRT) also takes advertising and sponsorship.

The broadcasting fee is paid by hotels and motels are charged one broadcasting fee for every five rooms, legal persons and office space owners are obliged to pay one broadcasting fee to every 20 employees or other persons that use the office space, owners of catering and other public facilities possessing a radio receiver or TV set must pay one broadcasting fee for each receiver/set.

The Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, upon a proposal of the Broadcasting Council, shall determine which broadcasting fee payers in populated areas that are not covered by the broadcasting signal shall be exempt from payment of the broadcasting fee.
The households with a blind person whose vision is impaired over 90% or families with a person whose hearing is impaired with an intensity of over 60 decibels, as determined in compliance with the regulations on disability insurance, where exempt from the duty to pay the broadcasting fee for the household where the family of the person lives.

As of 19 January 2017, the licence fee was abolished, citizens are exempt from paying this fee. Macedonian Radio and television, Macedonian Broadcasting and the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services will be financed directly from the Budget of the Republic of North Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mrt.com.mk/node/43078 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811032301/http://www.mrt.com.mk/node/43078 |archive-date=11 August 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===

The licence fee in [[Norway]] was abolished in January 2020. Before that there was a mandatory fee for every household with a TV. The fee was {{circa}} 3000 [[Norwegian krone|kr]] (c. €305) per annum in 2019. The fee was mandatory for any owner of a TV set, and was the primary source of income for [[Norsk Rikskringkasting]] (NRK).&lt;ref name=&quot;NRK&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/lisens/1.2843183 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231145341/http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/lisens/1.2843183 |archivedate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence fee was charged on a per household basis; therefore, addresses with more than one television receiver generally only required a single licence. An exception was made if the household includes persons living at home who no longer was provided for by the parents, e.g. students living at home. If people not in parental care own a separate television they had to pay the normal fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/lisens/1.8037531 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618123300/http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/lisens/1.8037531 |archivedate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
The license fee in [[Romania]] was abolished in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurotopics.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotopics.net/de/168977/rumaeniens-parlament-kippt-rundfunkgebuehr|title=Rumäniens Parlament kippt Rundfunkgebühr|website=eurotopics.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the licence fee in [[Romania]] for a household was 48 [[Romanian lei|RON]] (€10.857) per year.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Small businesses paid about €45 and large businesses about €150. The licence fee was collected as part of the electricity bill. The licence fee makes up part of [[Televiziunea Română]]'s funding, with the rest coming from advertising and government grants. However, some people allege that it is paid twice (both to the electricity bill and the cable or satellite operator indirectly, although cable and satellite providers are claiming they are not). In Romania, people must prove that they don't own a TV receiver in order not to pay the licence fee, but if they own a computer, they will have to pay, as they can watch TVR content online. Some people have criticized this, because, in the last years, TVR lost a lot of their supervisors, and also because with the analogue switch-off on 17 June 2015, it is still not widely available on digital terrestrial, and it is encrypted on satellite TV (a decryption card and a satellite receiver with card reader must be bought). Also, TVR will shift to DVB-T2, and with many sets only being sold with DVB-T, TVR will become unavailable to some users without a digital terrestrial receiver.
The fee couldn't be avoided, however, as it was to be part of the electricity bill.

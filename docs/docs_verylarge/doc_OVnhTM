====Belgian and German roots====
The first green parties in Europe were founded in the late 1970s, following the rise of [[environmental awareness]] and the development of [[new social movement]]s. Green parties in Belgium first made a breakthrough.  Belgium had Green members of parliament elected first in the 1970s, and with seats on the local council, held the balance of power in the city of Liege, so were the first to go into coalition with the ruling party on that council. In 1979 political campaigns and dissident groups feeling underrepresented in west German politics formed a coalition to contest the 1979 elections to the European Parliament.

Although they did not win any seats, the groups in this association formally agreed to become a party and won a breakthrough in the German national elections of 1983. They were not the first Green Party in Europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been, because they attracted the most media attention.  This was partly due to their charismatic leader [[Petra Kelly]], a German who was of interest to the American media because she had an American step-father. Since its foundation in 1980 and merger with [[Alliance 90]] after the German reunification, Kelly's party, now named [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], has become one of Europe's most important Green parties. It played an important role in the formation of national-level Green parties in other countries [[Confederation of The Greens|such as Spain]] as well. The forerunner of the Green Party in the [[United Kingdom]] was the [[PEOPLE Party]], formed in [[Coventry]] in 1972. It changed its name to the Ecology Party in 1973 and the Green Party in 1985.

====1984–1989: A new political force====
In 1984 Greens agreed a common platform for the European Parliament Elections and the first Green Members of the European Parliament were elected here. Germany, a stronghold of the Green movement, elected seven MEPs; two more came from Belgium and two from the Netherlands. As those eleven MEPs did not entitle the Greens to form a parliamentary group on their own, they concluded an alliance with MEPs from Italy, Denmark, and regionalists from Flanders and Ireland to form the GRAEL (Green Alternative European Link) group, also known as the [[Rainbow Group (1984–89)|Rainbow Group]]. Politically they engaged in the fight against environmental pollution, nuclear energy (1986 saw the Chernobyl disaster), the promotion of animal protection and the campaign against the demolition of Brussels by speculation fuelled by the presence of the European institutions.

====Since the 1990s ====
[[File:Flickr - Saeima - 9.Saeimas deputāts Indulis Emsis.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.70|[[Indulis Emsis]] of the [[Latvian Green Party]] became [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] in 2004, and the world's first green [[head of government]].]]

After years of co-operation between the national Green parties, they formed a pan-European alliance that unites most European Green parties. The Greens are a party within the European parliament with 46 seats, as of June 2009. It has a long-standing alliance with the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), an alliance of &quot;stateless nations&quot;, such as the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Scottish National Party]]. Together European Green Party/EFA have 58 seats and they are the fourth largest party in the European Parliament.

While on many issues European Greens practice the same policies, one issue divides European Green parties: the European Union. Some Green parties, like the Dutch [[GreenLeft]], [[Green Party of England and Wales|the Green Party of England and Wales]], the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Swiss Green Party]], the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Irish Green Party]] and the German Alliance '90/The Greens, are [[pro-European]] while some, like the Green party in [[Green Party (Sweden)|Sweden]], are moderately [[eurosceptic]].

Some Green parties have been part of governing coalitions. The first one was the Finnish [[Green League]] that entered government in 1995. The Italian [[Federation of the Greens]], the [[The Greens (France)|French Greens]], the German Alliance '90/The Greens and both Belgian Green parties, the French-speaking [[Ecolo]] and the Dutch-speaking [[Agalev]] were part of government during the late 1990s. Most successful was the [[Latvian Green Party]], who supplied the [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] in 2004. The Swedish [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] was a long term supporter of the social-democratic minority government until the election 2006 when the social-democratic party lost. The Irish [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] is currently [[Government of the 33rd Dáil|in government]], having entered a coalition with [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]] in June 2020, with three cabinet positions. It was previously in a [[Government of the 30th Dáil|coalition government]] with Fianna Fáil from [[2007 Irish general election|2007]] until January 2011 when the party withdrew their support for the ruling coalition.

In Scandinavia, left-wing socialist parties have formed the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]]. These parties have the same ideals as European Greens. However, they do not cooperate with the [[Global Greens]] or European Greens, but instead form a combined parliamentary group with the [[Party of the European Left]], which unites communists and post-communists. There is one exception, in 2004 the MEP for Danish [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] has left the Nordic Green Left parliamentary group and has joined the Green parliamentary group in the European parliament. The Socialist People's Party is currently an observer at the [[European Green Party]] and the Global Greens. Outside of Scandinavia, in 2004, [[Latvia]] became the first country in the world to have a Green politician become Head of Government, but in 2006 the Green Party received only 16.71 percent of the vote. In the [[Estonia]] [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]], the [[Estonian Greens]] won 7.1 percent of the vote, and a mandate for six seats in the country's parliament, the [[Riigikogu]]. Other significant electoral results for European green parties include Germany's [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] in the [[2002 German federal election|2002 federal election]] and France's [[Europe Ecology – The Greens]] in the [[2012 French legislative election|2012 legislative election]], in which they both won more seats than any other [[Third party (politics)|third party]].
[[File:Caroline Lucas 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|British MP [[Caroline Lucas]] is the UK's first green politician elected under the [[first-past-the-post]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7693262/General-Election-2010-first-Green-MP-hails-victory-for-the-politics-of-hope.html|title=General Election 2010: first Green MP edges out Labour|date=7 May 2010|access-date=6 December 2016|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|author=Louise Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In some countries Greens have found it difficult to win any representation in the national parliament. Three reasons can be found for this. It includes countries with a first past the post electoral system, such as the United Kingdom. However, despite the [[first past the post]] system in the United Kingdom, the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] won their first seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] when [[Caroline Lucas]] won the seat of [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]] in 2010.  The [[Scottish Green Party]] has had success in the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] and the Irish [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]] has had success in the devolved [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[local elections]] where the first-past-the-post system is not used. In countries where a party with similar ideals is stronger, such as [[Green Party (Norway)|Norway]] and Denmark, Green parties tend to perform worse. In some [[Eastern European]] countries, like [[Ecologist Party of Romania|Romania]] and [[The Greens (Poland)|Poland]], Green parties are still in the process of formation and have therefore not gained enough support. The [[Green Party of Bulgaria]] is a part of the [[left-wing]] [[Coalition for Bulgaria]], currently in opposition. It has no parliamentary representation but it did supply one Deputy Minister in the government of Prime Minister [[Sergey Stanishev]] from 2005 to 2009.

The [[European Green Party]] has worked to support weak Green parties in European countries. Until recently, they were giving support to Green parties in the Mediterranean countries. These Green parties are now making electoral gains, e.g. in Spain, [[Ecologists Greens|Greece]] and [[Ecological and Environmental Movement|Republic of Cyprus]], or getting organized to do so, e.g. in [[Democratic Alternative (Malta)|Malta]]. Therefore, the EGP is now turning its attention to Eastern Europe – all these countries have Green parties, but in materially poor Eastern Europe the success of Green Parties is patchy except for Hungary, where the local Green party, [[Politics Can Be Different]] (LMP), has been elected to parliament and many city councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenparty.org.uk/international/international/81/gewd.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030110112650/http://www.greenparty.org.uk/international/international/81/gewd.htm|url-status=dead|title=Text about the Green East-West Dialogue|archive-date=January 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeangreens.org/peopleandparties/networks/gewd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030113181805/http://europeangreens.org/peopleandparties/networks/gewd.html|url-status=dead|title=The Green East-West Dialogue|archive-date=January 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====

Greens and the Left Party of the Future is a left-libertarian and green party in Turkey. It was founded on 25 November 2012 as a merger of the Greens Party and the Equality and Democracy Party.

Prominent members include Murat Belge, left-liberal political author and columnist for ''Taraf''; Kutluğ Ataman, filmmaker and contemporary artist; and Ufuk Uras, former Istanbul deputy and president of the Freedom and Solidarity Party.

The party is one of the participants in the Peoples' Democratic Congress, a political initiative instrumental in founding the Peoples' Democratic Party in 2012.

The Greens, along with feminists, left YSGP en masse in 2016, citing its lack of democratic decision making practices. They and a new generation of activists reestablished the [[Green Party (Turkey)|Green Party]] (Yeşiller) in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://yesiller.org.tr/2020/09/21/greens-in-turkey-launch-green-party/&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
As of the [[2011 Canadian federal election|41st general election]] in Canada, held on May 2, 2011, there was only one federally elected member of the [[Green Party of Canada]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], its leader [[Elizabeth May]]. However, at the dissolution of the [[41st Canadian Parliament|41st Parliament]] on August 2, 2015, the [[Green Party of Canada]] held two seats in the House of Commons, the second seat belonging to formerly Independent MP [[Bruce Hyer]] who was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] in 2011. Only May won [[2015 Canadian federal election|re-election]] to the [[42nd Canadian Parliament|42nd parliament]]. There remains no federal representation by the [[Green Party of the United States]] in the U.S. Congress. Accordingly, in these countries, Green parties focus on [[electoral reform]]. In Mexico, however, the ''[[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico|Partido Verde Ecologista]],'' often abbreviated as PVEM, has 17 [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|deputies]] and four [[Senate of Mexico|senators]] in [[Congress of Mexico|Congress]] as a result of the 2006 elections. Nevertheless, some of its political practices such as plead in favor of the death penalty in Mexico, led to the [[European Green Party]]'s withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.

====Canada====
The first Green parties in Canada (both federal and provincial) were founded in 1983. The strongest provincial Green parties are the [[Green Party of British Columbia]], the [[Green Party of Ontario]], the [[Green Party of New Brunswick]], and the [[Green Party of Prince Edward Island]] which was elected the [[Official Opposition]] in the 2019 election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/seven-things-to-know-about-the-p-e-i-election-results-1.4392161 &quot;Seven things to know about the P.E.I. election results&quot;].

[[CBC News]], May 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a Green MLA was elected to the New Brunswick legislature, in 2015 a Green MLA was elected to the Prince Edward Island Legislature, and in 2018 [[Mike Schreiner]] became the first Green MPP elected to the Ontario provincial legislature. Federally, the [[Green Party of Canada]] received 6.49% of the popular vote and a record three seats in Parliament during the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]], breaking ground in [[Atlantic Canada]] with the election of [[Jenica Atwin]] as the first federal Green from outside of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalnews.ca/news/6023150/live-canada-election-results-2019-real-time-results-in-the-federal-election/ &quot;Canada election 2019: Results from the federal election&quot;].

Although [[Elizabeth May]] (the leader of the GPC from 2006-2019) was the first elected Member of Parliament, the first seat was gained in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] on August 30, 2008 when sitting Independent MP [[Blair Wilson]] joined the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/4545--liberal-mp-blair-wilson-goes-green-giving-the-party-its-first-seat-on-parliament-hill |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145949/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/4545--liberal-mp-blair-wilson-goes-green-giving-the-party-its-first-seat-on-parliament-hill |archive-date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2020, May continues to sit as a Member of Parliament for [[Saanich-Gulf Islands]] and has exerted a considerable amount of legislative influence on a number of issues ranging from denying unanimous consent for military intervention in Libya, playing a central role in exposing changes to environmental legislation hidden in the omnibus Budget Bill C-38, to introducing a [[private member's bill]] to develop a national strategy on [[Lyme disease]].

In the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election]], Stuart Mackinnon, a member of the Vancouver Green Party, was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. Since that time former [[Green Party of British Columbia]] leader, and deputy-leader of the federal Green party, [[Adriane Carr]] won the Greens' first seat on Vancouver City Council, in 2011 municipal elections.

====United States====
In the United States, Greens first ran for public office in 1985. Since then, the [[Green Party of the United States]] has claimed electoral victories at the municipal, county and [[U.S. state|state]] levels.  The first U.S. Greens to be elected were [[David Conley (politician)|David Conley]] and Frank Koehn in Wisconsin 1986. Each was elected to a position on the County Board of Supervisors in Douglas and Bayfield counties respectively. [[Keiko Bonk]] was first elected in 1992 in Hawaii County, becoming Official Chairwoman in 1995.  The first Green Party mayor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/elections/Green-Mayors/ |title=Green Party Officeholders 2016 :: Mayors |publisher=Gp.org |access-date=2013-08-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922175818/http://www.gp.org/elections/Green-Mayors/ |archive-date=2013-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was Kelly Weaverling, elected in [[Cordova, AK]] in 1991.

As of April 2018, 156 Greens held elective office across the US in 19 states. The states with the largest numbers of Green elected officials are California (68), Connecticut (15), and Pennsylvania (15). Titles of offices held include: Alderman, Auditor, Board of Appeals, Board of Finance, Board of Selectmen, Borough Council, Budget Committee, Circuit Court Judge, City Council, Common Council, Community College District Board of Trustees, Community Service Board,  Conservation Congress, Constable, County Board of Supervisors, County Supervisor, Fire Commission, Fire District Board, Inspector of Elections, Judge of Elections, Mayor, Neighborhood Council Board, Park District, Parks and Recreation District Board, Library Board, Planning Board, Public Housing Authority Resident Advisory Board, Public Service District,  Rent Stabilization Board, Sanitary District Board,  School Board, Soil and Water Conservation Board, State Representative, Town Council, Transit District Board, Village Trustee, Water District Board, and Zoning Board of Appeals  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/officeholders|title=2018 Officeholders}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2016, 100 Greens held elected office across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/officeholders|title=2016 Officeholders}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US Green elected to a state legislature was [[Audie Bock]] in 1999, to the [[California State Assembly]], followed by [[John Eder]] to the [[Maine House of Representatives]] in 2002 and 2004 and [[Richard Carroll (politician)|Richard Carroll]] to the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]] in 2008. While in office in 2003 in the [[New Jersey General Assembly]], incumbent [[Matt Ahearn]] made a [[Party switching in the United States|party switch]] to Green for the remainder of his term.

The Green Party has contested six U.S.A. presidential elections: in 1996 and 2000 with [[Ralph Nader]] for president and [[Winona LaDuke]] as vice president, in 2004 with [[David Cobb (activist)|David Cobb]] for president and [[Pat LaMarche]] for vice president, and in 2008 with [[Cynthia McKinney]] for president and [[Rosa Clemente]] for vice president. In 2000, Nader received more votes for president than any Green Party candidate before or since. [[Jill Stein]] ran for president on the Green ticket in 2012 and 2016; the vice-presidential candidates were [[Cheri Honkala]] in 2012 and [[Ajamu Baraka]] in 2016. Stein, who received over one million votes in the 2016 race, led unsuccessful attempts toward [[2016 United States presidential election recounts|2016 election recounts]] in three states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

===South America===

====Brazil====
The Brazilian [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party]] was constituted after the military dictatorship period and, like other Green Parties around the world, is committed to establishing a set of policies on ensuring social-equity and sustainable development. One of the party's founding members was the journalist and former anti-dictatorship revolutionary Fernando Gabeira, Alfredo Sirkis and Carlos Minc. Among the main items on the Green Party's agenda are federalism, environmentalism, human rights, a form of direct democracy, parliamentarism, welfare, civil liberties, pacifism and marijuana legalization under specific conditions.

Green Party's candidate [[Marina Silva]] won 19.33% of the vote in the first round of the [[2010 Brazilian presidential election]] (more than any other third party), taking enough votes from [[Dilma Rousseff]] of the incumbent [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] to prevent her from achieving the majority of the vote needed to avoid a second round. Success in the legislature amounted to winning 2 more seats for a total of 15 in the Chamber of Deputies and the loss of their only senate seat.

Marina Silva left the party the following year.

In the [[2014 Brazilian general election|2014 presidential election]] the Green Party's candidate [[Eduardo Jorge]] received 0,61% of the vote. He garnered attention for campaigning on a progressive platform supporting policies such as cannabis legalization and the decriminalization of abortion. Because of his perceived eccentricity and spontaneity while participating in the televised debates, Jorge became the subject of several memes on the internet. The party elected 6 federal deputies and 1 senator.

In 2016, the Greens in Congress voted in favour of the impeachment of Dilma Roussef. The party later went on to support president Michel Temer who succeeded her.

For the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 presidential election]] the party formed the coalition ''United to transform Brazil'' with the [[Sustainability Network|Sustainability Network (REDE)]], in support of the candidacy of Marina Silva in her third run for the presidency. Eduardo Jorge was chosen as her running mate. Despite faring well in the initial polls, Silva ultimately received 1% of the vote. The party elected 4 federal deputies.

====Colombia====
In the 1990s, the [[Oxygen Green Party]] was created under the leadership of [[Ingrid Betancourt]] but dissolved after her infamous kidnapping. Later, the Visionaries Party was created by  [[Antanas Mockus]] whose ideals earned him the Bogotá Mayoral Office twice.
In the [[2010 Colombian presidential election]] a green party has been created under the name [[Green Party (Colombia)|Colombian Green Party]], with former [[Bogotá]] mayor Antanas Mockus being the leader.

{{refimprove|date=March 2015}}

The '''barber paradox''' is a [[puzzle]] derived from [[Russell's paradox]]. It was used by [[Bertrand Russell]] himself as an illustration of the [[paradox]], though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him.&lt;ref name=atomism&gt;''The Philosophy of Logical Atomism'', reprinted in ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, 1914-19'', Vol 8., p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself.

== Paradox ==
&lt;!-- Please don't add supposed resolutions of the paradox here; when properly phrased, the only solution is that no such barber can exist. Otherwise, see the &quot;Non-paradoxical variations&quot; section. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Why not?  &quot;Non-paradoxical variations&quot; suggest that Barber paradox without variations is really a paradox, which it is not. --&gt;

The barber is the &quot;one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves&quot;. The question is, does the barber shave himself?&lt;ref name=atomism/&gt;

Answering this question results in a contradiction. The barber cannot shave himself as he only shaves those who do not shave themselves. Thus, if he shaves himself he ceases to be the barber. Conversely, if the barber does not shave himself, then he fits into the group of people who would be shaved by the barber, and thus, as the barber, he must shave himself.

A barber is one who shaves those who do not shave themselves. So, can a barber shave himself?

* If he &lt;u&gt;does&lt;/u&gt;, he cannot be a barber, since a barber does not shave himself.
* If he &lt;u&gt;doesn't&lt;/u&gt;, he falls in the category of those who do not shave themselves, and so, cannot be a barber.

== History ==

This paradox is often incorrectly attributed to [[Bertrand Russell]] (e.g., by [[Martin Gardner]] in ''Aha!''). It was suggested to Gardner as an alternative form of [[Russell's paradox]],&lt;ref name=atomism/&gt; which Russell had devised to show that [[set theory]] as it was used by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] contained contradictions. However, Russell denied that the Barber's paradox was an instance of his own:

{{Quotation|That contradiction [Russell's paradox] is extremely interesting. You can modify its form; some forms of modification are valid and some are not. I once had a form suggested to me which was not valid, namely the question whether the barber shaves himself or not. You can define the barber as &quot;one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves&quot;. The question is, does the barber shave himself? In this form the contradiction is not very difficult to solve. But in our previous form I think it is clear that you can only get around it by observing that the whole question whether a class is or is not a member of itself is nonsense, i.e. that no class either is or is not a member of itself, and that it is not even true to say that, because the whole form of words is just noise without meaning.|Bertrand Russell, ''The Philosophy of Logical Atomism''}}

This point is elaborated further under [[Russell's paradox#Applied versions|Applied versions of Russell's paradox]].

== In first-order logic ==

: &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{person}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{person}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;

This sentence is unsatisfiable (a contradiction) because of the [[Universal quantification|universal quantifier]] &lt;math&gt;(\forall)&lt;/math&gt;. The universal quantifier y will include every single element in the domain, including our infamous barber x. So when the value x is assigned to y, the sentence can be rewritten to &lt;math&gt; \text{shaves}(x,x)\leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is an instance of the contradiction &lt;math&gt;a \leftrightarrow \neg a&lt;/math&gt;.

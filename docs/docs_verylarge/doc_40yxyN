In the meantime, the second and larger sea-borne invasion had started. An enormous coalition of &quot;Scythians&quot;—actually consisting of Goths ([[Greuthungi]] and [[Thervingi]]), [[Gepids]], and [[Peuce Island|Peucini]], led again by the [[Heruli]]—assembled at the mouth of river Tyras ([[Dniester]]).&lt;ref&gt;The ''Historia Augusta'' mentions Scythians, Greuthungi, Tervingi, Gepids, Peucini, Celts and Heruli. Zosimus names Scythians, Heruli, Peucini and Goths.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Augustan History'' and [[Zosimus]] claim a total number of 2,000&amp;ndash;6,000 ships and 325,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;''Scriptores Historiae Augustae'', ''Vita Divi Claudii'', 6.4&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably a gross exaggeration but remains indicative of the scale of the invasion. After failing to storm some towns on the coasts of the western [[Black Sea]] and the [[Danube]] ([[Constanța|Tomis]], [[Marcianopolis]]), the invaders attacked [[Byzantium]] and [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]]. Part of their fleet was wrecked, either because of Gothic inexperience in sailing through the violent currents of the [[Propontis]]&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1.42&lt;/ref&gt; or because it was defeated by the Roman navy. They then entered the [[Aegean Sea]] and a detachment ravaged the Aegean islands as far as [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]]. While their main force had constructed siege works and was close to taking the cities of [[Thessalonica]] and [[Cassandreia]], it retreated to the Balkan interior at the news that the emperor was advancing. On their way, they plundered Doberus ([[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paionia]]?) and [[Pelagonia]].

==The Battle==
The Goths were engaged near Naissus by a Roman army advancing from the north. The battle most likely took place in 269, and was fiercely contested. Large numbers on both sides were killed but, at the critical point, the Romans tricked the Goths into an ambush by pretended flight. Some 50,000 Goths were allegedly killed or taken captive.&lt;ref name=Zosimus&gt;Zosimus, 1.43&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Aurelian, who was in charge of all Roman cavalry during reign of Claudius, led the decisive attack in the battle.

==Aftermath==
A large number of Goths managed to escape towards Macedonia, initially defending themselves behind their [[laager]]. Soon, many of them and their pack animals, distressed as they were by the harassment of the Roman cavalry and the lack of provisions, died of hunger. The Roman army methodically pursued and surrounded the survivors at [[Balkan Mountains|Mount Haemus]] where an epidemic affected the entrapped Goths.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 1.45&lt;/ref&gt; After a bloody but inconclusive battle, they escaped but were pursued again until they surrendered. Prisoners were admitted to the army or given land to cultivate and become [[Colonus (person)|coloni]]. The members of the pirate fleet, after the failed attacks on Crete and Rhodes, retreated and many of them suffered a similar end.&lt;ref&gt;John Bray, p.282. See Zosimus, 1.46&lt;/ref&gt; However the plague also affected the pursuing Romans and Emperor Claudius, who died from it in 270.&lt;ref&gt;G. Syncellus, p.720&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological impact of this victory was so strong that Claudius became known to posterity as Claudius II ''Gothicus Maximus'' (&quot;conqueror of the Goths&quot;). However devastating the defeat, the battle did not entirely break the military strength of the Gothic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Alaric Watson, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the troubles with [[Zenobia]] in the East and the breakaway [[Gallic Empire]] in the West were so urgent that the victory at Naissus could only serve as a temporary relief for the troubled Empire. In 271, after Aurelian repelled another Gothic invasion, he abandoned the province of [[Dacia]] north of the Danube in order to rationalize the defense of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Potter, p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Cyclic structure that goes through several levels in a hierarchical system.}}
A '''strange loop''' is a [[wikt:cyclic|cyclic]] structure that goes through several levels in a  [[hierarchical]] system. It arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through the system, one finds oneself back where one started.
Strange loops may involve [[self-reference]] and [[paradox]]. The concept of a strange loop was proposed and extensively discussed by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', and is further elaborated in Hofstadter's book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'', published in 2007.

A '''tangled hierarchy''' is a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] consciousness system in which a strange loop appears.

== Definitions ==
A strange loop is a hierarchy of levels, each of which is linked to at least one other by some type of relationship.  A strange loop hierarchy is &quot;tangled&quot; (Hofstadter refers to this as a &quot;[[heterarchy]]&quot;), in that there is no well defined highest or lowest level; moving through the levels, one eventually returns to the starting point, i.e., the original level.  Examples of strange loops that Hofstadter offers include: many of the works of [[M. C. Escher]], the ''Canon 5. a 2'' from Bach's Musical Offering, the information flow network between [[DNA]] and [[enzymes]] through [[protein synthesis]] and [[DNA replication]], and [[self-reference|self-referential]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödelian statements]] in [[formal system]]s.

In ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'', Hofstadter defines strange loops as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And yet when I say &quot;strange loop&quot;, I have something else in mind — a less concrete, more elusive notion. What I mean by &quot;strange loop&quot; is — here goes a first stab, anyway — not a physical circuit but an abstract loop in which, in the series of stages that constitute the cycling-around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction (or structure) to another, which feels like an upwards movement in an hierarchy, and yet somehow the successive &quot;upward&quot; shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle. That is, despite one's sense of departing ever further from one's origin, one winds up, to one's shock, exactly where one had started out. In short, a strange loop is a paradoxical level-crossing [[feedback loop]]. (pp.&amp;nbsp;101-102)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In cognitive science ==
Strange loops take form in human consciousness as the complexity of active symbols in the brain inevitably leads to the same kind of self-reference which [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] proved was inherent in any complex logical or arithmetical system in his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=George|title=A New Journey into Hofstadter's Mind|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2007|volume=296|issue=3|pages=98–102|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0307-98|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-journey-into-hofsta|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel showed that mathematics and logic contain strange loops: propositions that not only refer to [[logical truth|mathematical and logical truths]], but also to the symbol systems expressing those truths. This leads to the sort of paradoxes seen in statements such as &quot;[[This statement is false]],&quot; wherein the sentence's basis of truth is found in referring to itself and its assertion, causing a logical paradox.&lt;ref name=&quot;oreilly&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Reilly|first=Scott|title=I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter|journal=Philosophy Now|year=2010|url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue78/I_Am_A_Strange_Loop_by_Douglas_Hofstadter|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter argues that the psychological self arises out of a similar kind of paradox. We are not born with an &quot;I&quot; – the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] emerges only gradually as experience shapes our dense web of active symbols into a tapestry rich and complex enough to begin [[Self-reference|twisting back upon itself]]. According to this view the psychological &quot;I&quot; is a narrative fiction, something created only from intake of symbolic data and its own ability to create stories about itself from that data.  The consequence is that a perspective (a mind) is a culmination of a unique pattern of symbolic activity in our nervous systems, which suggests that the pattern of symbolic activity that makes identity, that constitutes subjectivity, can be replicated within the brains of others, and perhaps even in artificial brains.&lt;ref name=&quot;oreilly&quot; /&gt;

== Strangeness ==
The &quot;strangeness&quot; of a strange loop comes from our way of perception, because we categorize our input in a small number of &quot;symbols&quot; (by which Hofstadter means groups of neurons standing for one thing in the outside world). So the difference between the video-feedback loop and our strange loops, our &quot;I&quot;s, is that while the former converts light to the same pattern on a screen, the latter categorizes a pattern and outputs its essence, so that as we get closer and closer to our essence, we get further down our strange loop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstadter&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am A Strange Loop|year=2007|isbn=978-0-465-03078-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iamstrangeloop00hofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Downward causality ==
Hofstadter thinks our minds appear to us to determine the world by way of &quot;downward [[causality]]&quot;, which refers to a situation where a cause-and-effect relationship in a system gets flipped upside-down.  Hofstadter says this happens in the proof of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Merely from knowing the formula's meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically &quot;upwards&quot; from the axioms.  This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing.  Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture ''says'' and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false. (pp. 169-170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hofstadter claims a similar &quot;flipping around of causality&quot; appears to happen in minds possessing [[self-consciousness]].  The mind perceives itself as the cause of certain feelings (&quot;I&quot; am the source of my desires), while according to popular scientific models, feelings and desires are strictly caused by the interactions of [[neurons]].

== Examples ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
Hofstadter points to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Canon per Tonos'', [[M. C. Escher]]'s drawings ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'', ''[[Drawing Hands]]'', ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'', and the [[liar paradox]] as examples that illustrate the idea of strange loops, which is expressed fully in the proof of [[Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]].

The &quot;[[chicken or the egg]]&quot; paradox is perhaps the best-known strange loop problem.

The &quot;[[ouroboros]]&quot;, which depicts a dragon eating its own tail, is perhaps one of the most ancient and universal symbolic representations of the reflexive loop concept.

A [[Shepard tone]] is another illustrative example of a strange loop. Named after [[Roger Shepard]], it is a [[sound]] consisting of a superposition of tones separated by [[octave]]s. When played with the base [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the tone moving upwards or downwards, it is referred to as the ''Shepard scale''. This creates the [[auditory illusion]] of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower. In a similar way a sound with seemingly ever increasing tempo can be constructed, as was demonstrated by [[Jean-Claude Risset]].
{{listen|filename=DescenteInfinie.ogg|title=A Shepard–Risset glissando|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Visual illusions depicting strange loops include the [[Penrose stairs]] and the [[Barberpole illusion]].

A [[quine (computing)|quine]] in software programming is a program that produces a new version of itself without any input from the outside. A similar concept is [[metamorphic code]].

[[Nontransitive dice#Efron's dice|Efron's dice]] are four dice that are [[intransitivity|intransitive]] under gambler's preference. I.e., the dice are ordered A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; A, where ''x'' &gt; ''y'' means &quot;a gambler prefers ''x'' to ''y''&quot;.

The liar paradox and [[Russell's paradox]] also involve strange loops, as does [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]''.

The mathematical phenomenon of [[polysemy]] has been observed to be a strange loop.  At the denotational level, the term refers to situations where a single entity can be seen to ''mean'' more than one mathematical object. See Tanenbaum (1999).

''[[The Stonecutter]]'' is an old Japanese [[fairy tale]] with a story that explains social and natural hierarchies as a strange loop.

'''Paul Atreides''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|t|r|eɪ|d|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Dune: Creating the Audiobooks|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Audio]]|date=December 23, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL9kkQ6Hw2s|time=4:04|medium=Official promotional video, includes images of Frank Herbert's pronunciation notes for some terms|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; later known as '''Paul Muad'Dib''') is a fictional character in the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. Paul is a prominent character in the first two novels in the series, ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965) and ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), and returns in ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976). The character is brought back as two different [[ghola]]s in the [[Brian Herbert]]/[[Kevin J. Anderson]] novels which conclude the original series, ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007), and appears in the [[prequel]]s ''[[Paul of Dune]]'' (2008) and ''[[The Winds of Dune]]'' (2009). According to [[Brian Herbert]], Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House [[Atreus]].

A primary theme of ''Dune'' and its [[sequel]]s is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to &quot;give over every decision-making capacity&quot; to a charismatic leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Touponce 12&quot;/&gt; He said in 1979, &quot;The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clareson&quot;/&gt; Paul rises to leadership through military strategy and political maneuvering, but his [[superhuman]] powers and ability to fit himself into pre-existing religious infrastructure allow him to force himself upon mankind as their [[messiah]]. As &quot;Muad'Dib&quot;, Paul becomes the central figure of a new religion, and reluctantly unleashes a bloody [[jihad]] in his name across the universe; Paul struggles with the potential idea of seizing divine control over his newly minted empire, only to finally escape from the burden of his destiny by placing it on his sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] and his children [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

Paul was portrayed by [[Kyle MacLachlan]] in [[David Lynch]]'s [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film adaptation]], and by [[Alec Newman]] in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 ''Dune'' miniseries]] and its [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|2003 sequel]]. The character will be played by [[Timothée Chalamet]] in the 2021 [[Denis Villeneuve]] film ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]''.

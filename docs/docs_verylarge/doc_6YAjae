Five dozen ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts from before December 1943 have lapsed into the [[public domain]] and are thus freely distributed through various unofficial releases.

== Racial stereotypes ==
A handful of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts are no longer aired on American television, nor are they available for sale by Warner Bros., because of racial and ethnic [[stereotype]]s of [[black people]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], [[Asians]] such as Japanese (especially during WWII, as in ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'' and ''[[Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips]]''), [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Germans]], [[Italians]] and [[Mexicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-way.com/warner.html |title=&quot;The Warner Brothers: Albert, Harry, Jack, and Sam Warner&quot;. |accessdate=January 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018170049/http://www.germanhollywood.com/warner.html |archivedate=October 18, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven cartoons were withdrawn from distribution in 1968 that prominently featured stereotypical black characters (and a few passing jokes about Japanese people, as in ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Jungle Jitters]]'') and are known as the [[Censored Eleven]].

In 1999, all [[Speedy Gonzales]] cartoons were removed from airing on Cartoon Network because of their stereotyping of Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,48872,00.html Speedy Gonzales Caged by Cartoon Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116073419/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,48872,00.html |date=January 16, 2012 }}, www.foxnews.com, March 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Hispanics]] protested that they were not offended, and fondly remembered Speedy Gonzales cartoons as a representation of their youth and nation's individuality; these shorts were made available for broadcast again in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=070aAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6719,566640&amp;dq=speedy+gonzalez+cartoon+network&amp;hl=en |title=Cartoon Network putting Mexican mouse back in the lineup |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |last=Emling |first=Shelly |date=June 21, 2002 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these notorious cartoons, many Warner Bros. cartoons contain fleeting or sometimes extended gags that make reference to racial or ethnic stereotypes. The release of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3]]'' includes a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD in the volume given by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] which explains that the cartoons are products of their time and contain racial and ethnic stereotypes that &quot;were wrong then and they are wrong today&quot;, but the cartoons are presented on the DVD uncut and uncensored because &quot;editing them would be the same as denying that the stereotypes existed.&quot;

A written disclaimer similar to the words spoken by Goldberg in Volume 3 is shown at the beginning of each DVD in the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5|Volume 5]]'', and ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|Volume 6]]'' sets, as well as the Daffy Duck and [[Foghorn Leghorn]] ''[[Looney Tunes Super Stars]]'' sets and the [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection]]:

{{quotation|The cartoons you are about to see are products of their time. They may depict some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that were commonplace in the U.S society. These depictions were wrong then and they are wrong today. While the following does not represent the Warner Bros. view of today's society, these cartoons are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming that these prejudices never existed.}}

[[File:Otton2.JPG|{{Largethumb}}|right|[[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] is crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].]]
Year '''973''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CMLXXIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]].

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring &amp;ndash; The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] army, led by General [[Melias (Domestic of the Schools)|Melias]] ([[Domestic of the Schools]] in the East), continues the operations in [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. 
* [[July]]: Melias moves against [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]] (modern [[Turkey]]). He defeats the [[Arabs]] outside the walls, and begins to lay [[siege]] to the city. After a few days, a violent wind and a thick dust spreads over the Byzantine camp. Covered by the dust, the Arabs attack and route the Byzantines. Many of them are slaughtered and some, including Melias, are taken prisoner. Previous Byzantine gains in the area are lost. The wounded Melias dies later in captivity.

==== Europe ====
* [[May 7]] &amp;ndash; Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] ('''the Great''') dies at [[Memleben]] in [[Thuringia]] (modern [[Germany]]) after a 37-year reign. He is succeeded by his 18-year-old son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] ('''the Red'''), who becomes [[Autocracy|absolute ruler]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His mother [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]] will exert great influence on Otto, although her lavish [[Philanthropy|philanthropies]] will be a source of contention. Otto's succession leads to conflicts in the south German duchies and in [[Lotharingia]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (1999). ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III'', p. 254. {{ISBN|978-0-521-36447-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== England ====
* [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar I]] ('''the Peaceful''') is crowned king during a royal [[ceremony]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] by Archbishop [[Dunstan]]. In a [[King Edgar's council at Chester|council at Chester]], [[Lothian]] (a region of the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]) is ceded to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], in return for [[fealty]] from King [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]].
* Edgar I marches with his army north to [[Chester]]. His navy meets him there via the [[Irish Sea]]. This show of strength persuades the 'Northern Kings' to submit to his [[overlord]]ship (approximate date).

==== Africa ====

[[File:SMP - Symmetric Multiprocessor System.svg|thumb|upright=2|Diagram of a symmetric multiprocessing system]]
'''Symmetric multiprocessing''' ('''SMP''') involves a [[multiprocessor]] computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared [[main memory]], have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of [[multi-core processor]]s, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

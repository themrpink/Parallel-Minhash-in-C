'''East Anglia''' is a geographical area in the [[East of England]]. The area included has varied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36130219 |title=Jade Goody and the many faces of East Anglia |work=BBC News  |date=15 May 2016 |access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the legally defined [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS 2]] statistical unit comprises the counties of [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Cambridgeshire]], including the City of [[Peterborough]] unitary authority area.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUTS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=East of England|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/other/nomenclature-of-units-for-territorial-statistics/east-of-england/index.html|website=Office for National Statistics|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=26 November 2017|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160108070746/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/other/nomenclature-of-units-for-territorial-statistics/east-of-england/index.html|archive-date=8 January 2016|language=en|date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdom]] of the [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Angles]], a tribe whose name originated in [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]], in what is now northern [[Germany]].

==Area==
Definitions of what constitutes East Anglia vary. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], established in the 6th century, originally consisted of the modern counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] and expanded west into at least part of [[Cambridgeshire]]. The modern [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS 2]] statistical unit of East Anglia comprises Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire (including the [[City of Peterborough]] unitary authority).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUTS&quot;/&gt; Those three counties have formed the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia]] since 1976, and were the subject of a possible government devolution package in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridgeshire and Peterborough devolution deal|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambridgeshire-and-peterborough-devolution-deal|website=GOV.UK|access-date=26 November 2017|language=en|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamy |first=Joel |url=http://www.fenlandcitizen.co.uk/news/latest-news/east-anglia-devolution-deal-could-be-just-days-away-with-talks-over-geography-and-elected-mayor-ongoing-1-7398286 |title=East Anglia devolution deal could be just days away with talks over geography and elected mayor ongoing |publisher=Fenland Citizen |date=24 May 2016 |access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Essex]] has sometimes been included in definitions of East Anglia, including by the London Society of East Anglians.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The First World War memorial at Liverpool Street Station, erected by the London Society of East Anglians, is &quot;to the men of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Kingdom of Essex]] to the south, was a separate element of the [[Heptarchy]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] and did not identify as [[Angles]] but [[Saxons]]. The county of Essex by itself forms a NUTS 2 statistical unit in the [[East of England]] [[Regions of England|region]].
[[File:Anglo-Saxon England 2.svg|thumb|Great Britain around the year 800 showing the East Angles]]
 
[[File:England RedcliffeMaud Provinces.png|frame|Redcliffe-Maud proposed provinces; East Anglia is marked 7]]
Other definitions of the area have been used or proposed over the years. For example, the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969, which followed the [[Royal Commission]] on the Reform of Local Government, recommended the creation of eight provinces in England. The proposed East Anglia province would have included northern Essex, southern [[Lincolnshire]] and a small part of [[Northamptonshire]] as well as Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.

==History==
{{Further|Kingdom of East Anglia}}
The kingdom of East Anglia initially consisted of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], but the [[Isle of Ely]] also became part of it upon the marriage of East Anglian princess [[Etheldreda]]. It was formed around 520 by merging the North and South Folk, Angles who had settled in the former lands of the [[Iceni]] during the previous century, and it was one of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] heptarchy kingdoms as defined in the 12th century writings of [[Henry of Huntingdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry of Huntingdon|author-link=Henry of Huntingdon|translator-last=Greenway|translator-first=Diana|translator-link=Diana Greenway|title=Historia Anglorum: The History of the English People|date=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198222248|edition=Reprinted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6U5BTD0-rYC&amp;q=heptarchy+historiography&amp;pg=PR61|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} East Anglia has been cited by a number of scholars as being a region where settlement of continental Germanic speakers was particularly early and dense,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hills, ''The Anglo-Saxon Migration to Britain: An Archaeological Perspective'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coates|first=Richard|title=Celtic whispers: revisiting the problems of the relation between Brittonic and Old English|url=https://ul.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A31804/attachment/ATT-0/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby F. Martin, ''The Cruciform Brooch and Anglo-Saxon England'', Boydell and Brewer Press (2015), pp. 174-178&lt;/ref&gt; possibly following a depopulation in the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dark|first=Ken R.|title=Large-scale population movements into and from Britain south of Hadrian's Wall in the fourth to sixth centuries AD|year=2003|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2003-03_K._R._Dark,_Large-scale_population_movements_into_and_from_Britan_south_of_Hadrian's_Wall_in_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries_AD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found that modern East Anglians share a strong genetic affinity with Anglo-Saxon era skeletons, but differ substantially from Iron Age and Roman era ones, which are more similar to the Welsh. This was taken to support a major influence of the Anglo-Saxon migrations on the genetic makeup of East Anglia.&lt;ref&gt;Martiniano, R., Caffell, A., Holst, M. et al. Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons. Nat Commun 7, 10326 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10326&lt;/ref&gt;

East Anglia was the most powerful of the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England for a brief period following a victory over the rival kingdom of [[Northumbria]] around 616, and its King [[Raedwald of East Anglia|Raedwald]] was [[Bretwalda]] (overlord of the Anglo-Saxons kingdoms). However, this did not last; the [[Mercia]]ns defeated it twice over the next 40 years, and East Anglia continued to weaken in relation to the other kingdoms. [[Offa of Mercia]] finally had king [[Æthelberht II of East Anglia|Æthelberht]] killed in 794 and took control of the kingdom himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Michelle P.|last2=Farr|first2=Carol A.|title=Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe|date=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=9780826477651|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence was temporarily restored by rebellion in 825, but the Danes killed [[Edmund of East Anglia|King Edmund]] on 20 November 869 and captured the kingdom. [[Edward the Elder]] incorporated East Anglia into the Kingdom of England, and it later became an [[Earl of East Anglia|earldom]].

Parts of East Anglia remained marshland until the 17th century drainage of the Fens, despite some earlier engineering work during the Roman Occupation. The [[alluvial]] land was converted into wide swaths of productive [[arable land]] by a series of systematic drainage projects, mainly using drains and river diversions along the lines of Dutch practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the 1630s, thousands of [[Puritan]] families from East Anglia [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–40)|emigrated to New England]] in America, taking much East Anglian culture with them that can still be traced today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=David Hackett|author-link=David Hackett Fischer|title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195069051|edition=Reissue|title-link=Albion's Seed}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} East Anglia based much of its earnings on wool, textiles, and arable farming and was a rich area of England until the [[Industrial Revolution]] caused a manufacturing and development shift to [[English Midlands|the Midlands]] and the North.

During the [[Second World War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Force]] constructed many airbases in East Anglia for the heavy bomber fleets of the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] against [[Nazi]]-occupied Europe. East Anglia was ideally suited to airfield construction, as it includes large areas of open, level terrain and is close to mainland Europe. Many of the airfields can still be seen today, particularly from aerial photographs, and a few remain in use, the most prominent being [[Norwich International Airport]]. [[Pillbox (military)|Pillboxes]] were erected in 1940 to help defend the nation against invasion, and they can also be found throughout the area at strategic points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pillboxesuk.co.uk/ |title=UK Pillbox, Pillboxes, Bunkers, Anti-tank traps and other Anti-Invasion Defences built in World War 2 |publisher=Pillboxesuk.co.uk |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Streetphotography, downtown Norwich, Norfolk (13540828433).jpg|alt=|thumb|Norwich, with an urban population of 210,000, is the largest city in East Anglia]]
East Anglia is bordered to the north and east by the [[North Sea]], to the south by the estuary of the [[River Thames]] and shares an undefined land border to the west with the rest of England. Much of northern East Anglia is flat, low-lying and marshy (such as [[the Fens]] of [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Norfolk]]), although the extensive drainage projects of the past centuries actually make this one of the driest areas in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Inland much of the rest of Suffolk and Norfolk is gently undulating, with glacial moraine ridges providing some areas of steeper areas relief. The supposed flatness of the Norfolk landscape is noted in literature, such as [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Private Lives]]'' – &quot;Very flat, Norfolk&quot;.{{citequote}}

On the north-west corner East Anglia is bordered by a bay known as [[The Wash]], where owing to deposits of sediment and [[land reclamation]], the coastline has altered markedly within historical times; several towns once on the coast of the Wash (notably King's Lynn) are now some distance inland. Conversely, over to the east on the coast exposed to the North Sea the coastline is subject to rapid erosion and has shifted inland significantly since historic times.{{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}

Major rivers include Suffolk's [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour]], running through country beloved of the painter [[John Constable]], and the [[River Nene]]. The [[River Cam]] is a tributary of the [[Great Ouse]] and gives its name to Cambridge, whilst Norwich sits on the [[River Yare]] and [[River Wensum]]. The [[River Orwell]] flows through Ipswich and has its mouth, along with the  Stour at [[Felixstowe]]. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads form a network of [[waterway]]s between Norwich and the coast and are popular for recreational boating. The Ouse flows into the Wash at King's Lynn.

Major urban areas in East Anglia include the cities of [[Norwich]], [[Cambridge]] and [[Peterborough]], and the town of [[Ipswich]]. Smaller towns and cities include [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Lowestoft]], [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[King's Lynn]]. Much of the area is still rural in nature with many villages surrounded by a mixture of [[breckland]], [[The Fens|fens]], [[The Broads|broads]] and agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/historic-farmsteads-preliminary-character-statement-east-of-england/historic-farmsteads-east-england-part1/|title=Historic Farmsteads Preliminary Character Statement: East of England Region|last=Landscape Access Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of East Anglia}}

The climate of East Anglia is generally dry and mild. Temperatures range from an average of 1–10&amp;nbsp;°C in the winter to 12–22&amp;nbsp;°C in the summer, although it is not uncommon for daily temperatures to fall and rise significantly outside these averages. Although water plays a significant role in the [[The Fens|Fenland]] and [[Broadland]] landscapes, the area is among the driest in the United Kingdom and during the summer months, tinder-dry conditions are frequently experienced, occasionally resulting in field and heath fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/heathland-fire-emergency-foxhall-road-1-6264859|title=Heathland fire prompts huge emergency response in Ipswich|last=Jefford|first=Will|website=Ipswich Star|language=en|access-date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas receive less than 700mm of rainfall a year and this is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Sunshine totals tend to be higher towards the coastal areas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Transport==
[[File:Felixstowe port.JPG|thumb|right|[[Port of Felixstowe]] – Landguard Terminal in the foreground with Trinity Terminal in the background]]
{{main|Transport in East Anglia|Roads in the United Kingdom}}
Transport in East Anglia consists of an extensive road and rail network. Main A roads, such as the [[A12 road (England)|A12]] and [[A47 road|A47]] link the area to the rest of the UK, and the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] links the Midlands to the [[Port of Felixstowe]]. This is the busiest container port in the UK, dealing with over 40% of UK container traffic and is a major gateway port into the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} There is very little motorway within East Anglia.

Rail links include the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] from [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]] to [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and the [[West Anglia Main Line]] connecting [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] to London. Sections of the [[East Coast Main Line]] run through the area and [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] is an important interchange on this line. The area is linked to the Midlands and north-west England by rail and has a number of local rail services, such as the [[Bittern Line]] from Norwich to [[Sheringham railway station|Sheringham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports |title=Top 50 World Container Ports |publisher=World Shipping Council |access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Anglia is ideal for cycling and [[National Cycle Route 1]] passes through it. Cambridge has the largest proportion of its residents in the UK cycling to work with 25% commuting by bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Mark|title=Cambridge Announced As National Cycling Town|url=http://www2.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/db/pressrel.nsf/cac74a2aba838b5d80256b56004e53ab/8ec01df74e10d3968025746d0049e5cf?OpenDocument|website=Cambridge County Council|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=27 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717010429/http://www2.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/db/pressrel.nsf/cac74a2aba838b5d80256b56004e53ab/8ec01df74e10d3968025746d0049e5cf?OpenDocument|archive-date=17 July 2011|date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also home to the [[Cambridgeshire guided busway]], which at 13.3 miles (21.4&amp;nbsp;km) was the longest stretch of guided bus-way in the world when it opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-14401265 |title=Cambridgeshire guided busway opens to passengers |work=BBC News |date=7 August 2011 |access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only major commercial airport is [[Norwich Airport]], although [[London Stansted Airport]], the fourth busiest passenger airport in the UK, lies just south of Cambridge in north-west Essex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Norwich Airport |url=https://www.norwichairport.co.uk/about-norwich-airport/ |website=norwichairport.co.uk |access-date=2 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
The [[University of Cambridge]], established at the start of the 13th century and in the town of the same name, is East Anglia's best-known institution of higher learning, and is among the oldest and most famous universities in the world. Other institutions include the [[University of East Anglia]] (in [[Norwich]]), [[University of Essex]], [[Norwich University of the Arts]], [[Anglia Ruskin University]] (based in Cambridge), [[University of Suffolk]] (based in Ipswich) and [[University Centre Peterborough]].

==Enterprise zones==
Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone, an [[enterprise zone]] initiated by New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership,&lt;ref name=Pullinger&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/business/energy_jobs_boom_fuelled_by_great_yarmouth_and_lowestoft_enterprise_zone_1_3783992 |title=Energy jobs boom fuelled by Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone |last=Pullinger |first=Stephen |work=EDP24 |publisher=[[Eastern Daily Press]] |date=25 September 2014 |access-date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced in 2011 and launched in April 2012.&lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/business/great_yarmouth_and_lowestoft_enterprise_zone_interest_from_around_the_world_1_1174961 |title=Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft enterprise zone interest from around the world |last=Dickson |first=Annabelle |work=EDP24 |publisher=[[Eastern Daily Press]] |date=12 January 2012 |access-date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes six sites with a total area of {{convert|121|ha}}, which have attracted a number of energy-related businesses.&lt;ref name=Pullinger/&gt; The sites are Beacon Park and South Denes in Great Yarmouth, Mobbs Way, Riverside Road and South Lowestoft Industrial Estate in Lowestoft and Ellough Business Park in [[Ellough]] near Beccles.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; There is also an enterprise zone in Cambridgeshire, [[Alconbury Enterprise Campus]] in [[Huntingdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Alconbury-Weald-Project/story-22802676-detail/story.html |title=The Alconbury Weald Project |newspaper=[[Cambridge News]] |date=24 June 2014 |access-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718070008/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Alconbury-Weald-Project/story-22802676-detail/story.html |archive-date=18 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols and culture==
[[File:Three crowns emblem.jpg|thumb|Three crowns emblem at Saxmundham's parish church]]
[[File:Memorial to East Anglians who died during The Great War - geograph.org.uk - 628576.jpg|thumb|Memorial to East Anglians who died during the First World War in [[Liverpool Street Station]]. The memorial, erected by the London Society of East Anglians, displays the flag]]
A shield of [[Three Crowns|three golden crowns]], placed two above one, on a blue background has been used as a symbol of East Anglia for centuries. The [[coat of arms]] was ascribed by medieval heralds to the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the [[Wuffingas]] dynasty which ruled it. The arms are effectively identical to the [[coat of arms of Sweden]].

The three crowns appear, carved in stone, on the [[baptismal font]] (c.1400) in the parish church of [[Saxmundham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saxmundham.org/aboutsax/parishchurch.html |title=The Parish Church |publisher=Saxmundham |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the 15th century porch of [[Woolpit]] church, both in Suffolk. They also appear in local heraldry and form part of the arms of the [[diocese of Ely]] and the arms of the borough of [[Bury St Edmunds]], where the crowns are shown pierced with arrows to represent the martyrdom of [[Edmund the Martyr]], the last king of East Anglia. Other users of the arms include the former [[Isle of Ely County Council]], the [[Borough of Colchester]] and the [[University of East Anglia]]. The flag of Cambridgeshire (adopted in 2015) includes the three gold crowns on a blue field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cambridgeshire |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/flags/cambridgeshire/ |website=Flaginstitute.org/ |publisher=Flag Institute |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Anglian flag as it is known today was proposed by George Henry Langham and adopted in 1902 by the London Society of East Anglians (established in 1896). It superimposes the three crowns in a blue shield on a [[St George's cross]].

East Anglia features heavily in English literature, notably in [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[Private Lives]]'' and the history of its waterways and drainage forms the backdrop to [[Graham Swift]]'s novel ''[[Waterland (novel)|Waterland]]''. The area also figures in works by [[L.P. Hartley]], [[Arthur Ransome]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], among many others.

&quot;Suffolk pink&quot; and similar pastel colours of [[whitewash]] are commonly seen on houses in Suffolk, Norfolk and their neighbouring counties.

==Tourism==
East Anglia has a wide range of holiday resorts that range from the traditional coastal towns of [[Felixstowe]] and [[Lowestoft]] in Suffolk and Great Yarmouth and [[Hunstanton]] in Norfolk, to small fishing villages like [[Aldeburgh]] and [[Southwold]] in Suffolk. Other tourist attractions include historic towns and cities like Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge and Ely as well as areas such as [[Constable Country]], [[the Broads]] and the [[North Norfolk]] coast.

'''Coaxial cable''', or '''coax''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|.|æ|k|s|}}) is a type of [[electrical cable]] consisting of an inner [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] surrounded by a concentric conducting [[Electromagnetic shielding|shield]], with the two separated by a [[dielectric]] ([[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] material); many coaxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket. The term &quot;[[coaxial]]&quot; refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. 

Coaxial cable is a type of [[transmission line]], used to carry high-frequency [[electrical signal]]s with low losses.  It is used in such applications as telephone trunklines, [[Internet access|broadband internet]] networking cables, high-speed computer [[bus (computer)|data busses]], [[cable television]] signals, and connecting [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receiver]]s to their [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s. It differs from other [[shielded cable]]s because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.

Coaxial cable was used in the first (1858) and following [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] installations, but its theory wasn't described until 1880 by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician [[Oliver Heaviside]], who patented the design in that year (British patent No. 1,407).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-6909-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Coaxial cable is used as a [[transmission line]] for radio frequency signals. Its applications include [[feedline]]s connecting [[radio transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] to their antennas, computer network (e.g., [[Ethernet]]) connections, [[digital audio]] ([[S/PDIF]]), and distribution of [[cable television]] signals. One advantage of coaxial over other types of radio [[transmission line]] is that in an ideal coaxial cable the [[electromagnetic field]] carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s. This allows coaxial cable runs to be installed next to metal objects such as gutters without the power losses that occur in other types of transmission lines. Coaxial cable also provides protection of the signal from external [[electromagnetic interference]].

==Description==
[[File:Coaxial cable cutaway.svg|thumb|right|300px|Coaxial cable cutaway (not to scale)]]
Coaxial cable conducts electrical signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) surrounded by an insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the outside of the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage is applied to the center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that with differential mode, equal push-pull currents on the inner conductor, and inside of the outer conductor, the signal's electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the [[dielectric]], with little [[Crosstalk (electronics)|leakage]] outside the shield. Further, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable, if unequal currents are filtered out at the receiving end of the line. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice both for carrying weak signals, that cannot tolerate interference from the environment, and for stronger electrical signals, that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hdbk87_20&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 20: Transmission Lines |title=The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications |edition=87th |publisher=[[ARRL|The American Radio Relay League]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-87259-144-8 |editor1=Silver, H. Ward N0AX |editor2=Wilson, Mark J. K1RO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage.

Common applications of coaxial cable include video and [[CATV]] distribution, RF and microwave transmission, and computer and instrumentation data connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belden.com/pdfs/Techpprs/CoaxialCablesandApplications.pdf |title=Coaxial Cables and Applications |author=van der Burgt, Martin J. |publisher=Belden |accessdate=11 July 2011 |page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728162909/http://www.belden.com/pdfs/Techpprs/CoaxialCablesandApplications.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-28 |df=dmy-all |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[characteristic impedance]] of the cable (&lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the [[dielectric constant]] of the inner insulator and the radii of the inner and outer conductors. In radio frequency systems, where the cable length is comparable to the wavelength of the signals transmitted, a uniform cable characteristic impedance is important  to minimize loss. The [[Impedance matching|source and load impedances]] are chosen to match  the impedance of the cable to ensure [[Maximum power transfer theorem|maximum power transfer]] and minimum [[standing wave ratio]]. Other important properties of coaxial cable include attenuation as a function of frequency, voltage handling capability, and shield quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hdbk87_20&quot;/&gt;

==Construction==
Coaxial cable design choices affect physical size, frequency performance, attenuation, power handling capabilities, flexibility, strength, and cost. The inner conductor might be solid or stranded; stranded is more flexible. To get better high-frequency performance, the inner conductor may be silver-plated. Copper-plated steel wire is often used as an inner conductor for cable used in the cable TV industry.&lt;ref name=UHFMAN90&gt;''The ARRL UHF/Microwave Experimenter's Manual'', American Radio Relay League, Newington CT USA,1990 {{ISBN|0-87259-312-6}}, Chapter 5 ''Transmission Media'' pages 5.19 through 5.21&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{VSWR} = \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; always falls in the range [0,1], the SWR is always greater than or equal to unity. Note that the ''phase'' of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; vary along the transmission line in opposite directions to each other. Therefore, the complex-valued reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; varies as well, but only in phase. With the SWR dependent ''only'' on the complex magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it can be seen that the SWR measured at ''any'' point along the transmission line (neglecting transmission line losses) obtains an identical reading.

Since the power of the forward and reflected waves are proportional to the square of the voltage components due to each wave, SWR can be expressed in terms of forward and reflected power:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}{1 - \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}.&lt;/math&gt;

By sampling the complex voltage and current at the point of insertion, an SWR meter is able to compute the effective forward and reflected voltages on the transmission line for the characteristic impedance for which the SWR meter has been designed. Since the forward and reflected power is related to the square of the forward and reflected voltages, some SWR meters also display the forward and reflected power.

In the special case of a load ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is purely resistive but unequal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', the SWR is given simply by their ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \left(\frac{R_\text{L}}{Z_\text{0}}\right)^{\pm 1}&lt;/math&gt;

with the ±1 chosen to obtain a value greater than unity.

==The standing wave pattern==
Using [[phasor|complex]] notation for the voltage amplitudes, for a signal at frequency &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt;, the actual (real) voltages V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of time ''t'' are understood to relate to the complex voltages according to:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\text{actual} = \Re (e^{i 2 \pi \nu t} V) &lt;/math&gt; .

Thus taking the real part of the complex quantity inside the parenthesis, the actual voltage consists of a [[sine wave]] at frequency ν with a peak amplitude equal to the complex magnitude of V, and with a phase given by the phase of the complex V. Then with the position along a transmission line given by x, with the line ending in a load located at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the complex amplitudes of the forward and reverse waves would be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_f(x) &amp;= e^{-i k(x-x_0)} A \\
  V_r(x) &amp;= \Gamma e^{i k(x-x_0)} A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for some complex amplitude A (corresponding to the forward wave at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Here ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]] due to the guided wavelength along the transmission line. Note that some treatments use phasors where the time dependence is according to &lt;math&gt;e^{-i 2 \pi \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; and spatial dependence (for a wave in the +x direction) of &lt;math&gt;e^{+i k(x - x_0)}&lt;/math&gt;. Either convention obtains the same result for V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the [[superposition principle]] the net voltage present at any point x on the transmission line is equal to the sum of the voltages due to the forward and reflected waves:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_\text{net}(x) &amp;= V_f(x) + V_r(x) \\
                  &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left( 1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right ) A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are interested in the variations of the ''magnitude'' of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; along the line (as a function of x), we shall solve instead for the squared magnitude of that quantity, which simplifies the mathematics. To obtain the squared magnitude we multiply the above quantity by its complex conjugate:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{net}(x)|^2 &amp;= V_\text{net}(x)  V^*_\text{net}(x) \\
                 &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A \,  e^{+i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma^* e^{-i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A^* \\
                 &amp;= \left[1 + |\Gamma|^2 + 2 \Re (\Gamma  e^{i 2k(x - x_0)})\right] |A|^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the phase of the third term, the maximum and minimum values of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; (the square root of the quantity in the equations) are (1 + |Γ|)|A| and (1 − |Γ|)|A| respectively, for a standing wave ratio of:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{SWR} =  \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|}  = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}&lt;/math&gt;

as earlier asserted. Along the line, the above expression for &lt;math&gt; |V_\text{net}(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is seen to oscillate sinusoidally between &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{min}|^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{max}|^2&lt;/math&gt; with a period of 2π/2k. This is ''half'' of the guided wavelength λ = 2π/k for the frequency ν. That can be seen as due to interference between two waves of that frequency which are travelling in ''opposite'' directions.

For example, at a frequency ν=20&amp;nbsp;MHz (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose [[velocity factor]] is 2/3, the guided wavelength (distance between voltage peaks of the forward wave alone) would be λ = 10 m. At instances when the forward wave at x = 0 is at zero phase (peak voltage) then at x = 10 m it would also be at zero phase, but at x = 5 m it would be at 180° phase (peak ''negative'' voltage). On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only λ/2 = 5 m. Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 1.3 m. Then there would be another peak found where  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;|=V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 6.3 m, whereas it would find minima of the standing wave  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;| = V&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 3.8 m, 8.8 m, etc.

==Practical implications of SWR==
[[File:VSWR Return Loss.jpg|thumb|Example of estimated bandwidth of antenna according to the schedule VSWR by the help of the ANSYS [[HFSS]]&lt;ref&gt; I. Sliusar, V. Slyusar, S. Voloshko, A. Zinchenko, Y. Utkin.

The most common case for measuring and examining SWR is when installing and tuning transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  When a transmitter is connected to an antenna by a [[feed line]], the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|driving point impedance]] of the antenna must match the characteristic impedance of the feed line in order for the transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).

The impedance of a particular antenna design can vary due to a number of factors that cannot always be clearly identified. This includes the transmitter frequency (as compared to the antenna's design or [[Antenna (radio)#Resonant frequency|resonant]] frequency), the antenna's height above and quality of the ground, proximity to large metal structures, and variations in the exact size of the conductors used to construct the antenna.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL20.2&quot;&gt;{{cite book

When an antenna and feed line do not have matching impedances, the transmitter sees an unexpected impedance, where it might not be able to produce its full power, and can even damage the transmitter in some cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL19.4&quot;&gt;{{cite book

It is the interaction of these reflected waves with forward waves which causes standing wave patterns,&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL19.4&quot; /&gt; with the negative repercussions we have noted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL19.13&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Matching the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of the feed line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an [[antenna tuner]], an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the feed line and the antenna allows for the feed line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the feed line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the feed line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the feed line still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased feed line losses unmitigated.

The magnitude of those losses are dependent on the type of transmission line, and its length. They always increase with frequency. For example, a certain antenna used well away from its resonant frequency may have an SWR of 6:1. For a frequency of 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, with that antenna fed through 75 meters of RG-8A coax, the loss due to standing waves would be 2.2&amp;nbsp;dB. However the same 6:1 mismatch through 75 meters of RG-8A coax would incur 10.8&amp;nbsp;dB of loss at 146&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL19.4&quot; /&gt; Thus, a better match of the antenna to the feed line, that is, a lower SWR, becomes increasingly important with increasing frequency, even if the transmitter is able to accommodate the impedance seen (or an antenna tuner is used between the transmitter and feed line).

Certain types of transmissions can suffer other negative effects from reflected waves on a transmission line.  Analog TV can experience &quot;ghosts&quot; from delayed signals bouncing back and forth on a long line.  FM stereo can also be affected and digital signals can experience delayed pulses leading to bit errors. Whenever the delay times for a signal going back down and then again up the line are comparable to the modulation time constants, effects occur.  For this reason, these types of transmissions require a low SWR on the feedline, even if SWR induced loss might be acceptable and matching is done at the transmitter.

==Methods of measuring standing wave ratio==
[[File:Slotted_line.png|200px|thumb|Slotted line. The probe moves along the line to measure the variable voltage. SWR is the maximum divided by the minimum voltage]]Many different methods can be used to measure standing wave ratio.  The most intuitive method uses a [[slotted line]] which is a section of transmission line with an open slot which allows a probe to detect the actual voltage at various points along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick E. Terman, ''Electronic Measurements'', McGraw Hill, 1952 Library of Congress Catalog Number: 51-12650 p.135ff&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the maximum and minimum values can be compared directly. This method is used at VHF and higher frequencies. At lower frequencies, such lines are impractically long.

[[Power dividers and directional couplers|Directional couplers]] can be used at HF through microwave frequencies. Some are a quarter wave or more long, which restricts their use to the higher frequencies. Other types of directional couplers sample the current and voltage at a single point in the transmission path and mathematically combine them in such a way as to represent the power flowing in one direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulz&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/9778/how-does-an-swr-meter-really-work/9779#9779|title=How Does an SWR Meter Really Work|work=Glenn B. Schulz W9IQ |date= January 24, 2018|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The common type of  SWR/power meter used in amateur operation may contain a dual directional coupler. Other types use a single coupler which can be rotated 180 degrees to sample power flowing in either direction. Unidirectional couplers of this type are available for many frequency ranges  and  power levels and with appropriate coupling values for the analog meter used.[[File:Bird 43 RF power meter.jpg|300px|thumb|A directional wattmeter using a rotatable directional coupler element]] The forward and reflected power measured by directional couplers can be used to calculate SWR.  The computations can be done mathematically in analog or digital form or by using graphical methods built into the meter as an additional scale or by reading from the crossing point between two needles on the same meter. 
The above measuring instruments can be used &quot;in line&quot; that is, the full power of the transmitter can pass through the measuring device so as to allow continuous monitoring of SWR.  Other instruments, such as network analyzers, low power directional couplers and antenna bridges use low power for the measurement and must be connected in place of the transmitter.  Bridge circuits can be used to directly measure the real and imaginary parts of a load impedance and to use those values to derive SWR. These methods can provide more information than just SWR or forward and reflected power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nautel.com/press-releases/nautel-adds-two-models-to-nx-series/ |title=Nautel Adds Two Models to NX Series |work=[[Nautel]] |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone antenna analyzers use various measuring methods and can display SWR and other parameters plotted against frequency.  By using directional couplers and a bridge in combination, it is possible to make an in line instrument that reads directly in complex impedance or in SWR. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deltaelectronics.com/data/oib1&amp;3.htm|title=Delta Electronics, Inc. Model OIB-1 and OIB-3|website=www.deltaelectronics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone [[antenna analyzer]]s also are available that measure multiple parameters.

==Power standing wave ratio==

The term ''power standing wave ratio'' (PSWR) is sometimes referred to, and defined as, the square of the voltage standing wave ratio. The term is widely cited as &quot;misleading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Wolff, [http://www.radartutorial.eu/03.linetheory/tl06.en.html &quot;Standing Wave Ratio&quot;], radartutorial.eu&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Gridley:&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Gridley, ''Principles of Electrical Transmission Lines in Power and Communication'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=geNbAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA265 p. 265], Elsevier, 2014 {{ISBN|1483186032}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The expression &quot;power standing-wave ratio&quot;, which may sometimes be encountered is even more misleading, for the power distribution along a loss-free line is constant.....|J. H. Gridley}}

However it does correspond to one type of measurement of SWR using what was formerly a standard measuring instrument at microwave frequencies, the [[slotted line]]. The slotted line is a [[waveguide]] (or air-filled coaxial line) in which a small sensing antenna which is part of a ''crystal detector'' or ''detector'' is placed in the electric field in the line. The voltage induced in the antenna is rectified by either a [[diode#Semiconductor diodes|point contact diode (crystal rectifier)]] or a [[Schottky barrier diode]] that is incorporated in the detector.  These detectors have a square law output for low levels of input.  Readings therefore corresponded to the square of the electric field along the slot, ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), with maximum and minimum readings of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; found  as the probe is moved along the slot. The ratio of these yields the ''square'' of the SWR, the so-called PSWR.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vincent Rollin, ''An Introduction to Electronics'', p. 209, Clarendon Press, 1964 {{OCLC|1148924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

This technique of rationalization of terms is fraught with problems.{{clarify|date=January 2019}} The [[square-law detector|square law]] behavior of the detector diode is only exhibited when the voltage across the diode is below the knee of the diode. Once the detected voltage exceeds the knee, the response of the diode becomes nearly linear. In this mode the diode and its associated filtering capacitor produce a voltage that is proportional to the peak of the sampled voltage. The operator of such a detector would not have a ready indication as to the mode in which the detector diode is operating and therefore differentiating the results between SWR or so called PSWR is not practical. Perhaps even worse, is the common case where the minimum detected voltage is below the knee and the maximum voltage is above the knee. In this case, the computed results are largely meaningless. Thus the terms PSWR and Power Standing Wave Ratio are deprecated and should only be considered from a legacy measurement perspective.

==Implications of SWR on medical applications==

SWR can also have a detrimental impact upon the performance of microwave-based medical applications. In microwave electrosurgery an antenna that is placed directly into tissue may not always have an optimal match with the feedline resulting in an SWR. The presence of SWR can affect monitoring components used to measure power levels impacting the reliability of such measurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARRL19.5&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/problems-with-vswr-in-medical-applications|title=Problems with VSWR in Medical Applications|work=microwaves101.com|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1671" xml:space="preserve">A '''star coupler''' is a device that takes in an input [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] and splits it into several output signals.

In [[fiber optics]], and especially in [[telecommunications]], a star coupler is a passive optical device, used in [[telecommunications network|network]] applications. An optical signal introduced into any input port is distributed to all output ports. Because of the way a passive star coupler is constructed, the number of ports is usually a power of 2; ''i.e.'', two input ports and two output ports (a &quot;two-port&quot; coupler, customarily called a ''[[directional coupler]],'' or ''splitter'' ); four input ports and four output ports (a &quot;four-port&quot; coupler); eight input ports and eight output ports (an &quot;eight-port&quot; coupler), ''etc''.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]) of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]] sold a star coupler which interconnected links to computers via coaxial cable rather than optical fibres, but the function was essentially the same. The signal that was distributed was 70 [[megabit|Mb]]/s computer interconnect (CI) data and the star coupler provided two [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] paths of either 8 or 16 ports each. Digital's star coupler was developed for use with the [[VAX]]- and later [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]-based computers running Digital's [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] operating system, to provide a passive, highly reliable interconnect for Digital's [[Computer cluster|cluster]] technology.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''start signal''' is a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] that prepares a device to receive [[data]] or to perform a function. 

In [[asynchronous serial communication]], start signals are used at the beginning of a [[character (computing)|character]] that prepares the receiving device for the reception of the [[code]] elements. 

A start signal is limited to one [[signal element]] usually having the duration of a [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]].

In the latter film's soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by [[Ania Dorfmann]], who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music's [[tempo]], giving a convincing impression that it is Stanwyck playing the piano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&amp;id=518184%7C518056&amp;name=The-Other-Love &quot;Overview: 'The Other Love' (1947).&quot;] ''Turner Classic movies''.

[[Pauline Kael]], a longtime film critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', admired the natural appearance of Stanwyck's acting style on screen, noting that she &quot;seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael&quot;&gt;Kael, Pauline.

Many of her roles involve strong characters, yet Stanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of their wives and children. [[Frank Capra]] said of Stanwyck: &quot;She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.

[[William Holden]] and Stanwyck were longtime friends and when Stanwyck and Holden were presenting the [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound Oscar]] for [[50th Academy Awards|1977]], he paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for ''[[Golden Boy (1939 film)|Golden Boy]]'' (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: &quot;A few years ago, I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Capua 2009, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==
As Stanwyck's film career declined during the 1950s, she moved to television. In 1958 she guest-starred in &quot;Trail to Nowhere&quot;, an episode of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]'', portraying a wife who pursues, overpowers, and kills the man who murdered her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=swlieO1Z2Ps &quot;Trail to Nowhere&quot;], full episode of ''Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre'' guest-starring Barbara Stanwyck, S03E01, originally broadcast October 2, 1958.

The western television series, ''[[The Big Valley]]'', which was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1965 to 1969, made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prono241&quot;/&gt; She was billed in the series' opening credits as &quot;Miss Barbara Stanwyck&quot; for her role as Victoria, the widowed [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] of the wealthy Barkley family. In 1965, the plot of her 1940 movie ''[[Remember the Night]]'' was adapted and used to develop the [[teleplay]] for ''The Big Valley'' episode &quot;Judgement in Heaven&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In 1983, Stanwyck earned her third Emmy for ''[[The Thorn Birds (miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prono241&quot; /&gt; In 1985 she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series, ''[[The Colbys]]'', in which she starred alongside [[Charlton Heston]], [[Stephanie Beacham]] and [[Katharine Ross]].

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===
[[File:Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck in 1941.jpg|right|thumb|With [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] in 1941]]
While playing in ''The Noose'', Stanwyck reportedly fell in love with her married co-star, [[Rex Cherryman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madsen 1994, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Cherryman had become ill early in 1928 and his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage to Paris where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While still at sea, he died of [[sepsis|septic poisoning]] at the age of 31.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen 1994, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her ''Burlesque'' co-star, [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]]. She and Fay later claimed they disliked each other at first, but became close after Cherryman's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nas&quot;/&gt; A botched abortion at the age of 15 had resulted in complications which left Stanwyck unable to have children, according to her biographer.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2013, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a ten-month-old son on December 5, 1932. They named him Dion, later amending the name to Anthony Dion, nicknamed &quot;Tony&quot;. The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to his young wife, especially when he was inebriated.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2009, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callahan 2012, pp. 36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that this union was the basis for dialogue written by [[William A.

Stanwyck won custody of their son, whom she raised with a strict authoritarian hand and demanding expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan 2012, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanwyck and her son were estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. The child whom she had adopted in infancy &quot;resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively, orphans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Corliss, Richard. &quot;That Old Feelin': Ruby in the Rough.&quot; ''Time magazine'', August 12, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son died in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153811054/anthony-dion-fay|title=Anthony Dion Fay Memorial|last=|first=|date=|website=Find a Grave|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=October 16, 2015|access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, while making the film ''[[His Brother's Wife]]'' (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career, and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports about the two. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage. However, their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], a common practice in Hollywood's [[Golden Age of Hollywood|golden age]]. [[Louis B. Mayer]] had insisted on the two stars marrying and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan 2012, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2009, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage, and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, Los Angeles]], is still referred to by the locals as the old &quot;Robert Taylor ranch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2005/10/06/cx_sc_1007homeslide_5.html &quot;The 10 most expensive homes in the US: 2005.&quot;] ''Forbes'' (2005); retrieved November 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanwyck and Taylor mutually decided in 1950 to divorce, and after his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2009, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after [[World War II]] Taylor attempted to create a life away from the entertainment industry, and Stanwyck did not share that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan 2012, pp. 87, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor allegedly had extramarital affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they remained friendly and acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (1964). She never remarried. According to her friend and ''Big Valley'' co-star [[Linda Evans]], Stanwyck cited Taylor as the love of her life. She took his death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan 2012, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanwyck was one of the best-liked actresses in Hollywood and was friends with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including [[Joel McCrea]] and his wife [[Frances Dee]], [[George Brent]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Henry Fonda]] (who had a lifelong crush on her&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dametown.com/what-would-barbara-stanwyck-do/|title=What Would Barbara Stanwyck Do? |website=www.dametown.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classicforareason.com/2017/03/28/the-lady-eve/|title=The Lady Eve|date=2017-03-28|work=Classic for a Reason|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[James Stewart]], [[Linda Evans]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Jack Benny]] and his wife [[Mary Livingstone]], [[William Holden]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Fred MacMurray]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne 2009, pp. 146, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Stanwyck opposed the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to prosper without government intervention or assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonVictoria&quot;&gt;Wilson 2013, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; For Stanwyck, &quot;hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way&quot;. Stanwyck became an early member of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]] (MPA) after its founding in 1944. The mission of this group was to &quot;...&amp;nbsp;combat&amp;nbsp;... subversive methods [used in the industry] to undermine and change the American way of life.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ross 2011, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2013, p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt; It opposed both communist and fascist influences in Hollywood. She publicly supported the investigations of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], her husband Robert Taylor appearing to testify as a friendly witness.&lt;ref&gt;Frost 2011, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanwyck shared conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] affiliation with such contemporaries as: [[Mary Pickford]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]], [[Ward Bond]], [[William Holden]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[George Murphy]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[John Wayne]], [[Walter Brennan]], [[Shirley Temple]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Helen Hayes]], director [[Frank Capra]], and her ''Double Indemnity'' co-star, [[Fred MacMurray]].&lt;ref&gt;Diorio 1984, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzger 1989, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Stanwyck was originally a [[Protestant]], and was [[baptized]] in June 1916 by [[the Reverend]] J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson [https://books.google.com/books?id=z43kS7QQOMkC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Barbara+Stanwyck+Protestant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZB_xm97652&amp;sig=62ezfuU9soQ81FMlPl9JPYh2Iqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3xvNVIGMEcqwyASsqIGgDQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Barbara%20Stanwyck%20Protestant&amp;f=false 2013, p. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt; She later converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] when she married her first husband, Frank Fay.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2013, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brother===

He appeared mostly in supporting roles, often uncredited, and according to [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]], he has 466 film and TV credits.&lt;ref name=BertIMDb&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0828260/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm Bert Stevens] (Stanwyck's brother) at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in two films that starred Stanwyck: ''[[The File on Thelma Jordon]]'' and ''[[No Man of Her Own]]'', both released in 1950. In 1934, he married actress [[Caryl Lincoln]], remaining together until his death from a heart attack. They had one son, Brian.

==Later years and death==
Stanwyck's retirement years were active, with charity work outside the limelight. In 1981, she was awakened in the middle of the night, inside her home in the exclusive Trousdale section of [[Beverly Hills]], by an intruder, who first hit her on the head with his flashlight, then forced her into a closet while he robbed her of $40,000 in jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-ball-of-fire-barbara-stanwyck-vol-24-no-22/ | title=Ball of Fire: Barbara Stanwyck | first=John | last=Stark | magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date=November 25, 1985 | accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, in 1982, while filming ''[[The Thorn Birds (miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'', the inhalation of special-effects smoke on the set may have caused her to contract [[bronchitis]], which was compounded by her cigarette habit; she was a smoker from the age of nine until four years before her death.&lt;ref name=People020590&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://people.com/archive/barbara-stanwyck-a-stand-up-dame-vol-33-no-5/ | title=Barbara Stanwyck, 'A Stand-Up Dame' | first=John | last=Stark | magazine=People.com | date=February 5, 1990 | accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

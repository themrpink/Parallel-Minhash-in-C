[[File:Yr.Hen.Ogledd.550.650.Koch.jpg|thumb|The Old North {{circa|550}} – {{circa|650}}.]]
The '''Gododdin''' ({{IPA-cy|ɡɔˈdɔðɪn}}) were a [[P-Celtic]]-speaking [[Britons (historical)|Brittonic]] people of north-eastern [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], the area known as the [[Hen Ogledd]] or Old North (modern south-east [[Scotland]] and north-east England), in the [[sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman]] period.  Descendants of the [[Votadini]], they are best known as the subject of the 6th-century [[Welsh language|Welsh]] poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', which memorialises the [[Battle of Catraeth]] and is attributed to [[Aneirin]].

The name ''Gododdin'' is the [[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]] form, but the name appeared in [[Old Welsh]] as ''Guotodin'' and derived from the tribal name ''[[Votadini]]'' recorded in Classical sources, such as in [[Greek language|Greek]] texts from the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Ptolemaeus]], &quot;''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]''&quot; (ca. 2nd century)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kingdom==
It is not known exactly how far the kingdom of the Gododdin extended, possibly from the [[Stirling]] area to the kingdom of ''[[Bernicia|Bryneich]]'' (Bernicia), and including what are now the [[Lothian]] and [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] regions of eastern [[Scotland]]. It was bounded to the west by the Brittonic [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], and to the north by the [[Picts]]. Those living around [[Clackmannanshire]] were known as the [[Manaw Gododdin]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 1926 {{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1969 {{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, local kings of this period lived at both [[Traprain Law]] and [[Din Eidyn]] ([[Edinburgh]], whose English name is ultimately a [[calque]], with the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|-[[burh]]}}'' corresponding to the Welsh ''{{lang|xcb|[[dun|din]]}}''; in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] it is still known as ''{{lang|gd|Dùn Éideann}}''), and probably also at ''{{lang|xcb|Din Baer}}'' ([[Dunbar]], Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|Dùn Bàrr}}''). Gododdin included districts such as [[Manaw Gododdin]] and [[Eidyn]] south of the [[Firth of Forth]].

[[Cunedda]], legendary founder of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in north [[Wales]], is supposed to have been a Manaw Gododdin warlord who migrated southwest during the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nennius-full.html ''Historia Britonum''], retrieved 4 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittonic names lie mostly to the north of the [[Lammermuir Hills|Lammermuir]] and [[Moorfoot Hills]] and may reflect the territory of the Gododdin.&lt;ref&gt;Map by Alaric Hall, first published [http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/placenames/frames.htm here] as part of Bethany Fox, '[http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland]', ''The Heroic Age'', 10 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 6th century, Bryneich was invaded by the [[Angles]] and became known as [[Bernicia]]. The Angles continued to press north. In around 600 the Gododdin raised a force of about 300 men to assault the Angle stronghold of [[Catraeth]], perhaps [[Catterick, North Yorkshire]]. The battle, which ended disastrously for the Britons, was memorialised in the poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]''.

In 638, Eidyn, modern Edinburgh, was under siege and fell to the Angles, for the Gododdin seem to have come under the rule of Bernicia around this time. To what extent the native population was replaced or assimilated is unknown. Bernicia became part of [[Northumbria]]. Shortly afterwards this came under a unified England, then in 1018 [[Malcolm II]] brought the region as far as the [[River Tweed]] under Scottish rule.

'''Prudence''' ({{lang-la|prudentia}}, [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] from {{lang|la|providentia}} meaning &quot;seeing ahead, sagacity&quot;) is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (31 August 2012). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is classically considered to be a [[virtue]], and in particular one of the four [[Cardinal virtues]] (which are, with the three [[theological virtues]], part of the [[seven virtues]]). '''Prudentia''' is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with [[Justitia]], the Roman goddess of Justice.

The word derives from the 14th-century [[Old French]] word ''prudence'', which, in turn, derives from the Latin ''prudentia'' meaning &quot;foresight, sagacity&quot;. It is often associated with [[wisdom]], [[insight]], and [[knowledge]].  In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are [[courage]]ous, as opposed to [[Recklessness (psychology)|reckless]] or [[Cowardice|cowardly]], is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.

In modern [[English language|English]], the word has become increasingly [[synonym]]ous with cautiousness.  In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the [[vice]] of cowardice.

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] gives a lengthy account of the virtue [[phronesis]] ({{lang-grc|ϕρόνησις}}), traditionally translated as &quot;prudence&quot;, although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as &quot;[[Phronesis|practical wisdom]]&quot;, &quot;practical judgment&quot; or &quot;rational choice&quot;.

== As the &quot;mother&quot; of all virtues ==
[[File:DSCN2047.JPG|thumb|Allegory of Prudence on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] The female face depicts Francis' daughter [[Anne of Brittany]].]]

Prudence was considered by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and later on by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]], most notably [[Thomas Aquinas]], as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the ''auriga virtutum'' or the charioteer of the virtues.

It is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the &quot;perfected ability&quot; of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having [[intelligence]] and [[free will]]), achieve their &quot;perfection&quot; only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings.

The function of prudence is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, free self-expression and kindness into censure, humility into degradation and arrogance, selflessness into corruption, and temperance into fanaticism. Culture and disciplined actions should be about the beneficial action. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term &quot;medium rationis&quot;. So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.&lt;ref name=&quot;delany&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12517b.htm Delany, Joseph. &quot;Prudence.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. &quot;The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence.&quot; ([[Josef Pieper]]) For instance, a [[stockbroker]] using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's &quot;goodness&quot; is measured against that original decision made through prudence.&lt;ref&gt;Although Aristotle himself would have considered this way of making money contemptible: &quot;[T]hose who ply sordid trades...and those who lend small sums and at high rates...take more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to them is evidently sordid love of gain...[A]ll such forms of taking are mean.&quot; (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1121b31)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek and Scholastic philosophy, &quot;form&quot; is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence.

== Versus imprudence, cunning and false prudence ==

In Christian understanding, the difference between prudence and cunning lies in the intent with which the decision of the context of an action is made. The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of [[God]], the [[natural law]] and [[Morality|moral]] implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be [[martyr]]ed rather than deny their faith is considered prudent.

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]], judgments using reasons for evil ends or using evil means are considered to be made through &quot;cunning&quot; and &quot;false prudence&quot; and not through prudence.&lt;ref name=&quot;delany&quot;/&gt; However &quot;imprudence&quot; was not be considered a sin since it was not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;St Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section) 1602065578 2013 - p 1409 &quot;It would seem that imprudence is not a sin. For every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine;* whereas imprudence is not voluntary, since no man wishes to be imprudent. Therefore imprudence is not a sin&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greek term for prudence is synonymous with &quot;forethought&quot;. People, the Ancient Greeks believed, must have enough prudence to prepare for worshiping the Olympian gods.

Prudence is the application of universal principles to particular situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmanaman&quot;&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/the-virtue-of-prudence.html McManaman, Douglas. &quot;The Virtue of Prudence&quot;, Catholic Education Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Integral parts&quot; of virtues, in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]], are the elements that must be present for any complete or perfect act of the virtue. The following are the integral parts of prudence:
* ''[[Memoria]]'' : accurate memory; that is, memory that is true to reality; an ability to learn from experience;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmanaman&quot;/&gt;
* ''Docilitas'' : an open-mindedness that recognizes variety and is able to seek and make use of the experience and authority of others;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmanaman&quot;/&gt;
* ''Intelligentia'' : the understanding of [[first principle]]s;
* ''Sollertia'' : shrewdness or quick-wittedness, i.e. the ability to evaluate a situation quickly;
* ''[[Ratio]]'' : Discursive reasoning and the ability to research and compare alternatives;
* ''[[Providentia]]'' : foresight&amp;nbsp;– i.e. the capacity to estimate whether particular actions can realize goals;
* ''Circumspection'' : the ability to take all relevant circumstances into account;
* ''[[:wikt:caution|Caution]]'' : the ability to mitigate risk.

== Prudential judgment ==
{{more citations needed section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Titian - Allegorie der Zeit.jpg|thumb|''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' by [[Titian]]. To Titian, prudence was preparation, foresight and judgement from experience and human history. The three faces in the painting represent the passing of human generations, with the young facing the light while the oldest fade into shadow; the faint inscription above their heads may be translated as &quot;From the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoils future action&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Summers (1987), ''The Judgment of Sense: Renaissance Naturalism and the Rise of Aesthetics'', Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-521-32675-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ethics, a &quot;prudential judgment&quot; is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the correct action.  Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and ''ethically'' come to different conclusions.

For instance, in the theory of [[just war]], the government of a nation must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to war against another nation that is harming them; the decision whether to go to war is therefore a prudential judgment.

In another case, a patient who has a terminal illness with no conventional treatment may hear of an experimental treatment.  To decide whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible pain, disability, and hastened death, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.

[[Phronesis]], or practical wisdom, holds an important place in [[Rhetoric|rhetorical theory]] as a central aspect of judgment and practice. [[Aristotle]]'s notion of phronesis fits with his notes on rhetoric because neither, in his estimation, could be reduced to an ''[[episteme]]'' or a ''[[techne]]'', and both deal with the ability to deliberate about contingent, variable, or indeterminate matters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Cicero]] defined ''prudentia'' as a rhetorical norm in ''[[De Oratore]]'', ''[[De officiis]]'', ''[[De Inventione]]'', and ''[[De re publica]]''. He contrasts the term with ''imprudens'', young men failing to consider the consequences before they act. The ''prudens'', or those who had prudence, knew when to speak and when to stay silent. Cicero maintained that prudence was gained only through experience, and while it was applied in everyday conversation, in public discourse it was subordinated to the broader term for wisdom, ''sapientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Prudence: classical virtue, postmodern practice |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press |year=2003 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary era, rhetorical scholars have tried to recover a robust meaning for the term. They have maintained consistency with the ancient orators, contending that prudence is an embodied persuasive resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasinski&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasinski |first=James |year=2001 |title=Sourcebook on Rhetoric |publisher=Sage Publications |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sets of principles or rules can be constructed in a particular culture, scholars agree that prudence cannot be derived from a set of timeless principles. Instead, through gauging the situation and through reasoned deliberation, a speaker should determine the set of values and morals by which to base his or her actions. Furthermore, scholars suggest the capacity to take into account the particularities of the situation as vital to prudential practice. For example, as rhetorical scholar Lois Self explains, &quot;both rhetoric and phronesis are normative processes in that they involve rational principles of choice-making; both have general applicability but always require careful analysis of particulars in determining the best response to each specific situation; both ideally take into account the wholeness of human nature; and finally, both have social utility and responsibility in that both treat matter of the public good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Self |chapter=Rhetoric and Phronesis: The Aristotelian Ideal |title=Philosophy and Rhetoric |publisher=Penn State University Press |year=1979 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hariman]], in his examination of [[Malcolm X]], adds that &quot;aesthetic sensibility, imitation of a performative ideal, and improvisation upon conventions of presentation&quot; are also components of practical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hariman |first=Robert |title=Theory without Modernity |year=1991 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences emerge between rhetorical scholars regarding definitions of the term and methods of analysis. [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] asserted that prudence materializes through the application of principles and can be evaluated accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadamer|first=Hans-George |title=Truth and Method |journal=Crossroad |year=1982 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s speech to the Catholic Church of Notre Dame, James Jasinski contends that prudence cannot {{clarify span|be calculated by formal matters like consequences|date=February 2015}} as it is not a ''episteme'' or ''techne''; instead, it is judged according to embodied rhetorical performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasinski&quot;/&gt; Thus, while Gadamer would judge prudence based on the execution of contingent principles, Jasinski would examine the artistry of communication in its cultural milieu between accommodation ([[compromise]]) and audacity ([[courage]]).{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

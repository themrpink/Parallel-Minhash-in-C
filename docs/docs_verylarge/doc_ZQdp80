'''''Dragonflight''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by the American-Irish author [[Anne McCaffrey]]. It is the first book in the ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series. ''Dragonflight'' was first published by [[Ballantine Books]] in July 1968.{{efn|name=first-publication}} It is a [[fix-up]] of [[novella]]s, including two which made McCaffrey the first woman writer to win a [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt;

In 1987, ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus: The magazine of the science fiction &amp; fantasy field]]'' ranked ''Dragonflight'' at number nine among the 33 &quot;All-Time Best Fantasy Novels&quot;, based on a poll of subscribers.&lt;ref name=&quot;locus-atp&quot;/&gt;

== Origins ==
Two components of ''Dragonflight'' were award-winning novellas published by ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' science fiction magazine. The first segment, &quot;Weyr Search&quot;, illustrated by [[John Schoenherr]], had been the cover story for the October 1967 issue.{{sfn|&quot;Weyr Search&quot;, ISFDB}} The second segment, &quot;Dragonrider&quot;, appeared in two parts, beginning in December 1967, and was also a cover story illustrated by Schoenherr.{{sfn|&quot;Dragonrider&quot;, ISFDB}}

&quot;Weyr Search&quot; features a young woman named Lessa being recruited to establish a telepathic bond with a queen dragon at its hatching, thus becoming a dragonrider, and the leader of a Weyr community on the fictional planet [[Pern]]. &quot;Dragonrider&quot; features the growth of Lessa's queen dragon, Ramoth, and their training together. ''Analog'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] asked &quot;to see dragons fighting Thread&quot;, Pern's menace from space, and he also suggested time travel. In response, McCaffrey wrote a third story titled &quot;Crack Dust, Black Dust&quot;, which was not published separately, but provided crucial material for the novel.&lt;!-- Todd McCaffrey's account is confusing about the published stories and unpublished work, perhaps including one story or segment called &quot;Dragonflight&quot;. That would make four titles, if not stories, one becoming the overall title. It's plausible to me that the original &quot;Dragonflight&quot; is the climactic short back and forth in time. --&gt;{{sfn|''Dragonholder''|1999|p=49}}

== Plot introduction ==
''Dragonflight'' takes place in the far future on [[Pern]], a planet colonized by humans. The colonists had originally intended to gradually adopt a low-technology agrarian lifestyle, but were forced to move more quickly after they encountered the deadly [[Thread (Pern)|Thread]] raining down from the sky. By harnessing and riding the indigenous, flying, fire-breathing dragons (with genetic alterations to make them larger and telepathic), the colonists destroyed the Thread in the skies over Pern, creating pockets of safety over its surface, before it was able to burrow into the land and breed. Humanity finally managed to find equilibrium and began to create a thriving culture, society, and economy, eventually expanding right across Pern's northern continent.  However, when this narrative begins, an unusually long interval between Thread attacks has caused the general population to dismiss the threat as myth and gradually withdraw support from the Weyrs where dragons are bred and trained. By the time of this narrative, only one Weyr remains (the other five having mysteriously disappeared at the same time in the last quiet interval), maintaining a precarious existence.

Dragons are telepathic and are capable of forming a lifelong bond with one particular human in a process called ''Impression''. Tradition, established thousands of years before the narrative, dictates that selected young humans with empathetic and telepathic talents are taken to the Hatching Grounds as candidates for Impression. The dragons come in several colors which generally correlate with their sizes;  blue males, green females, brown males, bronze males, and golden females&amp;nbsp;– queens. Bronzes, the largest males, are by tradition the only ones who compete to win the queens in their mating flights. The green females are banned from breeding as they produce only small, less talented dragons. The golden queens are not only the largest dragons, they also hold a subtle control over their dragon communities Weyrs. The Queen sets out on a Mating Flight, pursued by several bronze males; the one who wins and mates with her assumes a leading position among the dragons, and his rider automatically becomes the leader of the human dragon riders. And the passion of the male dragon and queen mating up in the air can telepathically transfer itself to their male and female human partners, inducing them to a passionate human lovemaking (at least, that is how it happens in the case described in the book).

== Plot summary ==
''Dragonflight'' is the story of [[Lessa (Dragonrider)|Lessa]], the sole survivor of the noble ruling family of Ruatha Hold on the northern continent of Pern. When the rest of her family is killed by a cruel usurper, [[Fax (Pern)|Fax]], she survives by disguising herself as a drudge (a menial servant), partly through simply adopting a slovenly appearance, but also by using her hereditary telepathic abilities to make others see her as far older and less attractive than she actually is. Her only friend is a watch-wher, a somewhat telepathic animal related to dragons, that guards the Hold. Lessa psychically influences other Hold workers to do less than their best work, or to become clumsy or inefficient, in order to sabotage Ruatha as part of her strategy to make it economically unproductive, so that Fax will renounce it and she can retake her Hold.

[[Characters in Dragonriders of Pern#F'lar|F'lar]], wingleader at Benden Weyr, and rider of the bronze dragon Mnementh, finds Lessa while searching for candidates to impress a new queen dragon. The current queen has a batch of eggs due to hatch shortly, including a crucial golden egg. After killing Fax in single combat, following the rules of the Pernese [[code duello]], he realises that she manipulated him emotionally to kill Fax and engineered Fax's renouncement. F'lar recognizes that Lessa possesses both unusually strong psychic abilities and great strength of will. He recognizes her potential to be the strongest Weyrwoman in recent history, and the path to his own leadership at Benden Weyr. F'lar convinces a reluctant Lessa to give up her birthright as Lord Holder of Ruatha Hold for the larger domain of the dragonweyr and she agrees to pass the title on to [[Jaxom|Fax's newborn son]] (who later features in ''[[The White Dragon (novel)|The White Dragon]]''). F'lar takes Lessa to Benden Weyr, where she Impresses the queen hatchling Ramoth and becomes the Weyrwoman, the new co-leader of the last active Weyr.  On Ramoth's first mating flight, Mnementh catches her, and by Weyr tradition, this makes F'lar the Weyrleader.
 
One Weyr by itself is not enough to defend the planet; there had been six, but the other five Weyrs are now empty, deserted since the last Pass centuries before. In a desperate attempt to increase their numbers, a new queen, Prideth, and her rider, Kylara, are sent back ''between'' times (a recently rediscovered skill) ten turns, to allow Prideth time to mature and reproduce.  Lessa travels four hundred turns into the past to bring the five 'missing' Weyrs forward to her present. This is a huge strain for both her and Ramoth.  She convinces the dragonriders of the five Weyrs to go with her to their future, and they use the Red Star as a guide to make smaller, less strenuous hops forward in time.  This not only provides much needed skilled reinforcements in the battle against Thread, but explains how and why the five Weyrs were abandoned: they came forward in time.

== Awards ==
''Dragonflight'' includes the novellas &quot;Weyr Search&quot;, which won the 1968 [[Hugo Award for Best Novella]] (voted by members of the annual [[World Science Fiction Convention]])&lt;ref name=&quot;hugo-list&quot;/&gt; and &quot;Dragonrider&quot;, which won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]] (voted annually by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]) in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;nebula-list&quot;/&gt; McCaffrey was the first woman writer to win either award.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, the [[American Library Association]] cited the two early Pern trilogies (''Dragonriders'' and ''[[The Harper Hall Trilogy|Harper Hall]]''), along with ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'', when McCaffrey received the annual [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] for her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALA-Edwards&quot;/&gt;

== Notes ==
{{notelist |notes=
&lt;!-- {{efn |name=cover |1=
{{harvnb|''Dragonflight'', ISFDB}} lists cover artists for most editions except the paperback original, including Michael Whelan (see image) for most of the three dozen editions published November 1978 and later. Whelan painted for new Del Rey (US) ''Dragonflight'' and ''Dragonquest'' editions in conjunction with his cover for first publication of ''[[The White Dragon]]'', which completed the original trilogy. Gino d'Achille painted for a new Del Rey ''Dragonflight'' edition in conjunction with his cover for first publication of ''[[Dragonquest]]'' (1971). ISFDB names at least six beside the four named here. For US and UK hardcover and paperback first editions, July 1968 (Ballantine US paperback) to sometime 1970 (Corgi UK paperback), there were four publishers and four cover paintings.

[[File:Shinkansen N700 with Mount Fuji.jpg|thumb|The [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] high-speed line in Japan, with [[Mount Fuji]] in the background. The Tokaido Shinkansen was the world's first high-speed rail line.]]
'''High-speed rail''' ('''HSR''') is a type of rail transport that runs significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized [[rolling stock]] and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of {{convert|250|km/h}} and existing lines in excess of {{convert|200|km/h}} are widely considered to be high-speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;UIC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uic.org/highspeed#General-definitions-of-highspeed | title=General Definitions of Highspeed | publisher=International Union of Railways (UIC) | accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first high-speed rail system, the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]], began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the '''bullet train'''. High-speed trains mostly operate on [[standard gauge]] tracks of [[continuously welded rail]] on [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] that incorporates a large [[Minimum railway curve radius|turning radius]] in its design, however certain regions with wider legacy railways, such as Russia have sought to develop a high speed railway network in [[Broad-gauge railway|broad gauge]].

Several countries have built and developed high-speed rail infrastructure to connect major cities, including [[High-speed rail in Belgium|Belgium]], [[High-speed rail in China|China]], [[High-speed rail in Denmark|Denmark]], [[High-speed rail in France|France]], [[High-speed rail in Germany|Germany]], [[High-speed rail in Italy|Italy]], [[Shinkansen|Japan]], [[High-speed rail in Morocco|Morocco]], [[High-speed rail in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Sapsan|Russia]], [[Haramain high-speed railway|Saudi Arabia]], [[Korea Train Express|South Korea]], [[AVE|Spain]], [[High-speed rail in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|Taiwan]], [[High-speed rail in Turkey|Turkey]], the [[High-speed rail in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the [[High-speed rail in the United States|United States]] and [[High-speed rail in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]]. Only in Europe does high-speed rail cross international borders. China had built over {{convert|29000|km||abbr=}} of high-speed rail as of December 2018, accounting for two-thirds of the world's total.&lt;ref name=&quot;Length_CN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2180562/full-speed-ahead-chinas-high-speed-rail-network-2019-bid-boost|title=Full speed ahead for China's high-speed rail network in 2019|date=24 January 2019|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-speed rail is the fastest ground-based commercial transportation. The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], opened in 2004, is the fastest commercial passenger maglev in operation at 430 km/h. The [[Euroduplex]] [[TGV]] trains broke a record of 574.8 km/h making it the fastest conventional wheeled train. The [[Chuo Shinkansen]] in Japan is a maglev line under construction from Tokyo to Osaka at commercial speeds of 500 km/h with operations starting in 2027. 
{{toclimit|3}}

==Definitions==
{{train topics}}
{{See also|Passenger rail terminology}}
Multiple definitions for high-speed rail are in use worldwide.

The [[Directive (European Union)|European Union Directive]] 96/48/EC, Annex 1 (see also [[Trans-European high-speed rail network]]) defines high-speed rail in terms of:
:# '''Infrastructure:''' track built specially for high-speed travel or specially upgraded for high-speed travel.
:# '''Minimum Speed Limit:''' Minimum speed of {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on lines specially built for high speed ''and'' of about {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on existing lines which have been specially upgraded. This must apply to at least one section of the line. Rolling stock must be able to reach a speed of at least {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}} to be considered high speed.
:# '''Operating conditions:''' Rolling stock must be designed alongside its infrastructure for complete compatibility, safety and quality of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeneralDefinition-EU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Union of Railways]] |url=http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article971 |title=General definitions of highspeed |accessdate=13 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720214528/http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article971 |archive-date=20 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC) identifies three categories of high-speed rail:&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyrgidis|first=Christos N.|title=Railway Transportation Systems: Design, Construction and Operation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=e5ymCwAAQBAJ}}|date=21 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-6216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''Category I''' – New tracks specially constructed for high speeds, allowing a maximum running speed of at least {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.
: '''Category II''' – Existing tracks specially upgraded for high speeds, allowing a maximum running speed of at least {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.
: '''Category III''' – Existing tracks specially upgraded for high speeds, allowing a maximum running speed of at least {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, but with some sections having a lower allowable speed (for example due to topographic constraints, or passage through urban areas).

A third definition of high-speed and very high-speed rail (Demiridis &amp; Pyrgidis 2012) requires simultaneous fulfilment of the following two conditions:&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis/&gt;
:#Maximum achievable running speed in excess of {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for very high-speed,
:#Average running speed across the corridor in excess of {{convert|150|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for very high-speed.

The UIC prefers to use &quot;definitions&quot; (plural) because they consider that there is no single standard definition of high-speed rail, nor even standard usage of the terms (&quot;high speed&quot;, or &quot;very high speed&quot;). They make use of the European EC Directive 96/48, stating that high speed is a combination of all the elements which constitute the system: infrastructure, rolling stock and operating conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeneralDefinition-EU&quot;/&gt;
The [[International Union of Railways]] states that high-speed rail is a set of unique features, not merely a train travelling above a particular speed. Many conventionally hauled trains are able to reach {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=off}} in commercial service but are not considered to be high-speed trains. These include the French [[SNCF]] [[Intercités]] and German [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|IC]].

The criterion of {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=off}} is selected for several reasons; above this speed, the impacts of geometric defects are intensified, track adhesion is decreased, aerodynamic resistance is greatly increased, pressure fluctuations within tunnels cause passenger discomfort, and it becomes difficult for drivers to identify trackside signalling.&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis/&gt; Standard signaling equipment is often limited to speeds below 200&amp;nbsp;km/h with the traditional limits of {{cvt|79|mph}} in the US, {{cvt|160|km/h}} in Germany and {{cvt|125|mph}} in Britain. Above those speeds [[positive train control]] or the [[European Train Control System]] becomes necessary or legally mandatory.

National domestic standards may vary from the international ones.

==History==
Railways were the first form of rapid land transportation and had an effective monopoly on long-distance passenger traffic until the development of the [[automobile|motor car]] and [[airliners]] in the early-mid 20th century. Speed had always been an important factor for railroads and they constantly tried to achieve higher speeds and decrease journey times. Rail transportation in the late 19th century was not much slower than non-high-speed trains today, and many railroads regularly operated relatively fast ''express'' trains which averaged speeds of around {{cvt|100|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Guide of the Railways]], [http://cprr.org/Museum/Books/I_ACCEPT_the_User_Agreement/Official_Rail_Guide_1910.pdf 1910: The Official Guide of the Railways and Steam Navigation Lines of the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Cuba], Rand McNally &amp; Company Publishing, 1910,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early research===

====First experiments====
High-speed rail development began in Germany in 1899 when the [[Prussian state railways|Prussian state railway]] joined with ten electrical and engineering firms and electrified {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} of military owned railway between [[Marienfelde]] and [[Zossen]]. The line used [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase current]] at [[Volt|10 kilovolts]] and [[Hertz|45 Hz]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Van der Zypen &amp; Charlier company of [[Deutz, Cologne]] built two railcars, one fitted with electrical equipment from [[Siemens &amp; Halske|Siemens-Halske]], the second with equipment from ''[[AEG|Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft]]'' (AEG), that were tested on the [[Marienfelde]]–[[Zossen]] line during 1902 and 1903.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 23 October 1903, the S&amp;H-equipped railcar achieved a speed of {{convert|206.7|km/h|abbr=on}} and on 27 October the AEG-equipped railcar achieved {{convert|210.2|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrf_sith&quot;&gt;Sith Sastrasinh, &quot;[http://www.worldrailfans.info/forum/index.php?/topic/2292-electrical-train-marienfelde-zossen-in-1901/?p=18578 Electrical Train Marienfelde–Zossen in 1901] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911101535/http://www.worldrailfans.info/forum/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F2292-electrical-train-marienfelde-zossen-in-1901%2F%3Fp=18578 |date=11 September 2016 }}&quot;, 21 January 2000, WorldRailFans. Accessed 23 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These trains demonstrated the feasibility of electric high-speed rail; however, regularly scheduled electric high-speed rail travel was still more than 30 years away.

====High-speed aspirations====
After the breakthrough of electric railroads, it was clearly the infrastructure – especially the cost of it – which hampered the introduction of high-speed rail. Several disasters happened – derailments, head-on collisions on single-track lines, collisions with road traffic at grade crossings, etc. The physical laws were well-known, i.e. if the speed was doubled, the curve radius should be quadrupled; the same was true for the acceleration and braking distances.

In 1891 the engineer [[Károly Zipernowsky]] proposed a high-speed line Vienna–Budapest, bound for electric railcars at {{convert|250|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Krettek|1075|p= 47}} In 1893 Dr. Wellington Adams proposed an [[air-line railroad|air-line]] from Chicago to St. Louis of {{convert|252|mi}}.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=27}} At a speed of only {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}, he was more modest than Zipernowsky – and more realistic, according to General Electric.

Alexander C. Miller had greater ambitions. In 1906, he launched the ''[[Chicago-New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]'' project to reduce the running time between the two big cities to ten hours by using electric {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} locomotives. After seven years of effort, however, less than {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of arrow-straight track was finished.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=27}} A part of the line is still used as one of the last interurbans in the US.

====High-speed interurbans====
In the US, some of the [[interurban]]s (i.e. trams or [[streetcar]]s which run from city to city) of the early 20th century were very high-speed for their time (also Europe had and still does have some interurbans). Several high-speed rail technologies have their origin in the interurban field.

In 1903 – 30 years before the conventional railways started to streamline their trains – the officials of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition organized the Electric Railway Test Commission to conduct a series of tests to develop a carbody design that would reduce wind resistance at high speeds. A long series of tests was carried.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=68}} In 1905, [[St. Louis Car Company]] built a railcar for the traction magnate [[Henry E. Huntington]], capable of speeds approaching {{cvt|100|mph|order=flip}}. Once it ran {{cvt|20|mi|order=flip}} between Los Angeles and Long Beach in 15 minutes, an average speed of {{cvt|80|mph|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=60}} However, it was too heavy for much of the tracks, so [[Cincinnati Car Company]], [[J. G. Brill Company|J. G. Brill]] and others pioneered lightweight constructions, use of aluminium alloys, and low-level [[bogie]]s which could operate smoothly at extremely high speeds on rough interurban tracks. [[Westinghouse Licensing Corporation|Westinghouse]] and [[General Electric]] designed motors compact enough to be mounted on the bogies. From 1930 on, the [[Red Devil (interurban)|Red Devils]] from Cincinnati Car Company and a some other interurban railcars reached about {{convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}} in commercial traffic. The Red Devils weighed only 22 tons though they could seat 44 passengers.

Extensive [[wind tunnel]] research – the first in the railway industry – was done before J. G. Brill in 1931 built the [[Bullet (interurban)|Bullet]] cars for [[Philadelphia and Western Railroad]] (P&amp;W). They were capable of running at {{cvt|92|mph|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=72}} Some of them were almost 60 years in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ruins.wordpress.com/2007/04/05/built-to-last-jg-brills-bullets/ |title=Built to Last: J.G. Brill's &quot;Bullets&quot; |date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; P&amp;W's [[Norristown High Speed Line]] is still in use, almost 110 years after P&amp;W in 1907 opened their double-track Upper Darby–Strafford line without a single grade crossing with roads or other railways. The entire line was governed by an absolute block signal system.{{sfn|Middleton|1968|p=10}}

====Early German high-speed network====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14151, &quot;Fliegender Hamburger&quot;, DRG 778.jpg|thumb|The German Fliegender Hamburger]]
On 15 May 1933, the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn|Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft]] company introduced the diesel-powered &quot;[[DRG Class SVT 877|Fliegender Hamburger]]&quot; in regular service between [[Berlin–Hamburg Railway|Hamburg and Berlin]] ({{convert|286|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}), thereby achieving a new top speed for a regular service, with a top speed of {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}. This train was a streamlined multi-powered unit, albeit diesel, and used [[Jakobs bogie]]s.

Following the success of the Hamburg line, the steam-powered [[Henschel-Wegmann Train]] was developed and introduced in June 1936 for service from [[Berlin]] to [[Dresden]], with a regular top speed of {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}. Incidentally no train service since the cancelation of this express train in 1939 has traveled between the two cities in a faster time {{As of|2018|lc=y}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In August 2019, the travel time between [[Dresden-Neustadt station|Dresden-Neustadt]] and [[Berlin-Südkreuz]] was 102 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/traininfo.exe/dn/185376/364783/130852/3634/80?ld=43181&amp;protocol=https:&amp;seqnr=5&amp;ident=2a.026610181.1565204730&amp;date=08.08.19&amp;station_evaId=8010085&amp;station_type=dep&amp;currentReferrer=tp&amp;rt=1&amp;rtMode=DB-HYBRID&amp;&amp;time=14:46&amp;currentJourneyClass=2&amp;|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190807190812/https://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/traininfo.exe/dn/185376/364783/130852/3634/80?ld=43181&amp;protocol=https:&amp;seqnr=5&amp;ident=2a.026610181.1565204730&amp;date=08.08.19&amp;station_evaId=8010085&amp;station_type=dep&amp;currentReferrer=tp&amp;rt=1&amp;rtMode=DB-HYBRID&amp;&amp;time=14:46&amp;currentJourneyClass=2&amp;|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 August 2019|title=Timetable for EuroCity 378|publisher=Deutsche Bahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Berlin–Dresden railway]].

Further development allowed the usage of these &quot;Fliegenden Züge&quot; (flying trains) on a rail network across Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Datei:Vorkriegseinsatz1.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;Diesel-Schnelltriebwagen-Netz&quot; (diesel high-speed-vehicle network) had been in the planning since 1934 but it never reached its envisaged size.

All high-speed service stopped in August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=de |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YPmMUHzFVqwC |page=218 }} |title=Geschichte und Zukunft des Verkehrs.: Verkehrskonzepte von der Frόhen ... |accessdate=26 March 2013|isbn=9783593357669 |year=1997 |last1=Dienel |first1=Hans-Liudger |last2=Trischler |first2=Helmuth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Physical Graffiti''''' is the sixth studio album by the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was released as a [[double album]] on 24 February 1975 by the group's new record label, [[Swan Song Records]].

The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at [[Headley Grange]], a country house in [[Hampshire]], which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered just under three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the earlier albums ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'', ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' and ''[[Houses of the Holy]]''. The album covered a range of styles including [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[folk music|folk]]. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of year release. Its release was delayed because the [[Peter Corriston]]-designed [[die-cut]] album cover proved difficult to manufacture.

''Physical Graffiti'' was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the US.&lt;ref&gt;

The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. ''Physical Graffiti'' was later certified [[RIAA certification|16x platinum]] in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies.

==Recording==
The first attempt by Led Zeppelin to record songs for ''Physical Graffiti'' took place in November 1973 at [[Headley Grange]] in [[Hampshire]], England, where they had previously recorded their [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]]. The recording equipment consisted of [[Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio]]. Guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] and drummer [[John Bonham]] recorded an instrumental which was later reworked as &quot;Kashmir&quot; during this visit. However, these sessions came to a halt quickly and the studio time was turned over to [[Bad Company]], who used it to record songs for [[Bad Company (album)|their eponymous debut album]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17,89}} The press reported that bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] was ill and unable to record.&lt;ref name=cameroncrowe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |title=Cameron Crowe interview Led Zeppelin |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=18 March 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124033/http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_eyesandears_journalism_led.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he became disillusioned with the group and fed up with touring, and told manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] he was considering quitting.{{efn|Jones later joked that he had considered becoming the choirmaster at [[Winchester Cathedral]] had he left Led Zeppelin in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/20-things-you-didnt-know-john-paul-jones-did-227646/ |title=20 Things You Didn't Know John Paul Jones Did |first=Corbin |last=Reiff |journal=Rolling Stone |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Grant asked him to reconsider and take the rest of the year off to recuperate.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=17}}

The group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by [[Ron Nevison]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=17–18}} Lead singer [[Robert Plant]] later referred to these eight tracks as &quot;the belters&quot;, including &quot;off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice&quot;.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=18}} As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}}

The eight songs extended beyond the length of a conventional album, almost spanning three sides of an LP, so the group decided to create a [[double album]], adding material they had recorded for previous albums but never issued. This included various jam sessions such as &quot;Boogie With Stu&quot;, which Page thought would be unsuitable as a track on a single album.&lt;ref name=Schulps&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dave |last=Schulps |url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp |title=Interview with Jimmy Page |journal=[[Trouser Press]] |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional overdubs were laid down, and the final mixing of the album was performed in July 1974 by [[Keith Harwood]] at [[Olympic Studios]], London. The title &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was coined by Page to illustrate the whole physical and written energy that had gone into producing the set.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}

==Songs==

The album spanned several years of recording and covered a range of musical styles, including hard rock (&quot;Custard Pie&quot;, &quot;[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Wanton Song]]&quot;, &quot;[[Sick Again]]&quot;, &quot;[[Houses of the Holy (song)|Houses of the Holy]]&quot;), eastern-influenced orchestral rock (&quot;[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]&quot;), progressive rock (&quot;[[In the Light]]&quot;), driving funk (&quot;[[Trampled Under Foot]]&quot;), acoustic rock and roll (&quot;Boogie with Stu&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;), love ballad (&quot;[[Ten Years Gone]]&quot;), blues rock (&quot;[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]&quot;), soft rock (&quot;Down by the Seaside&quot;), country rock romp (&quot;Night Flight&quot;), and acoustic guitar instrumental (&quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot;).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=54–56}}&lt;ref name=AMG&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11465|pure_url=yes}} Review at Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone Magazine 2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti|title=Physical Graffiti|journal=Rolling Stone|date=27 March 1975|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306030326/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/albums/album/158693/review/5944206/physical_graffiti%3B|archivedate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several tracks from the album became live staples at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]]. In particular, &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;, &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;, and &quot;Sick Again&quot; became regular components of the band's live concert [[set list]]s following the release of the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=114}}

===Side one===
&quot;Custard Pie&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. The first take was played at a faster tempo than the finished version, with various improvised vocals. After a basic run-through, the group then discussed possibilities for rearranging it.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=21}} Page played the guitar solo through an ARP synthesiser, while Jones overdubbed a [[Hohner Clavinet]] part and Plant played harmonica.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}

&quot;[[The Rover (Led Zeppelin song)|The Rover]]&quot; was written in 1970 at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a cottage near [[Machynlleth]], [[Wales]]. It was first recorded at Headley Grange in May 1970 as an acoustic number for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''. It was reworked as an electric number in 1972 for ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', which formed the basis for the backing track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=19}} Page subsequently added guitar overdubs in 1974 with Keith Harwood engineering.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}{{efn|The original sleeve features the credit &quot;Guitar lost by Nevison, salvaged by the grace of Harwood&quot; and refers to the various recording sessions for the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}}}

&quot;[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]&quot; is based on a traditional song that [[Bob Dylan]] recorded on his [[Bob Dylan (album)|debut album]] in 1962.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} The track was recorded live, with Page later adding further [[slide guitar]] overdubs. The arranging and structuring was led by Bonham, who worked out where the various stop / start sections in the track should be, and how the group would know where to come back in. The very end of the song features his off-mic cough, causing the rest of the group to break down at that point. Bonham subsequently shouted &quot;That's got to be the one, hasn't it?&quot;, feeling it was the best take.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=22,55}} It was left on the album to show fans that Led Zeppelin were a working band that took care in their recordings.{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=234}}

===Side two===
&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; was recorded as the title track for the album of the same name in June 1972 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] with [[Eddie Kramer]] engineering. It was left off that album because of its similarity to other tracks such as &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, which were felt to be better. Unlike some of the other older material on ''Physical Graffiti'', it required no further overdubbing or remixing.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}}

&quot;[[Trampled Under Foot]]&quot; developed from a jam session driven by Jones at the Clavinet. The song went through several arrangement changes before arriving at the version heard on the album, with the group rehearsing various different ideas and arguing about the overall style. Bonham decided the track was too &quot;souly&quot; and rearranged it into a funk style, suggesting that Page should play a guitar riff throughout in place of chords.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21–22}} The lyrics are a series of [[double entendres]] around driving and cars. The song quickly became a popular live piece that was played at every live show from 1975 onwards, and was later revived by Plant for his solo tours.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=55}} It was released as a single in the US on 2 April (with &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; as the B-side) and was a top 40 hit.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=95}}

&quot;[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]&quot; was an idea from Page and Bonham, and was first attempted as an instrumental demo in late 1973. Plant wrote the lyrics while on holiday in Morocco. Jones played [[Mellotron]] on the track, and arranged strings and brass parts that were played by session musicians. The song was one of the most critically acclaimed on the album, and was played at every gig from 1975 onwards.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=55–56}} Page and Plant played it on their 1994 tour,{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=342}} and it was reworked in 1998 by [[Sean Combs|Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs]] for his single &quot;[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come With Me]]&quot; which featured Page on guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dancing with the Devil: How Puff Burned the Bad Boys of Hip-hop|first=Mark|last=Curry|page=101|publisher=NewMark Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-615-27650-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In the Light&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in early 1974. It was initially called &quot;In the Morning&quot; and went through several rehearsals and takes to work out a basic structure. A drone / chant introduction was later added to the piece.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=21,56}}

&quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; was a solo acoustic piece by Page, named after the cottage where he had composed and arranged much of ''Led Zeppelin III'' with Plant. It was recorded at Island Studios in mid-1970. The track was later used as background music in the group's film ''The Song Remains the Same''.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}

&quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; was originally written as an acoustic track at Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, and was influenced by [[Neil Young]]. It was reworked as an electric track during sessions for the fourth album the following year. Page and Bonham led the arranging, changing tempo from the slow to fast section and then back again.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}

&quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; was mostly composed by Plant about an old love affair, and was combined with an instrumental piece from Page, featuring overdubbed electric and acoustic guitar parts. When the track was performed live, Jones played a triple-neck guitar featuring mandolin, six- and twelve-string guitars, in order to try to reproduce the various guitar overdubs on the studio recording.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}

&quot;Night Flight&quot; was recorded at Headley Grange in 1971 for the fourth album. Jones plays [[Hammond organ]] on the track, and Page plays guitar through a [[Leslie speaker]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}} Plant wrote the lyrics after reading a news headline entitled &quot;Nuclear Damage Test Threat&quot; and wondered why there seemed to be little peace and love in the world.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=85}}

&quot;The Wanton Song&quot; was built around a Page guitar riff. Unlike some of the other tracks recorded at the 1974 Headley Grange sessions, it was straightforward to arrange, with the group building the song around the riffs.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=56}}

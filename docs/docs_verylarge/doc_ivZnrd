In [[South India]], the [[Wodeyar dynasty]] (1399–1947) of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] used mail service for espionage purposes thereby acquiring knowledge related to matters that took place at great distances.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyangar 2004: 302&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, a postal system in India was in operation.  Later this system underwent complete modernization when the [[British Raj]] established its control over most of India. The ''Post Office Act XVII'' of 1837 provided that the Governor-General of India in Council had the exclusive right of conveying letters by post for hire within the territories of the East India Company. The mails were available to certain officials without charge, which became a controversial privilege as the years passed. On this basis the Indian Post Office was established on October 1, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe 1951: 134&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rome ===
{{main|cursus publicus}}
The first well-documented postal service was that of [[Rome]]. Organized at the time of [[Augustus Caesar]] (62 BCE – 14 CE), the service was called ''[[cursus publicus]]'' and was provided with light carriages (''rhedæ'') pulled by fast horses. By the time of [[Diocletian]], a parallel service was established with two-wheeled carts (''birotæ'') pulled by [[oxen]]. This service was reserved for government correspondence. Yet another service for citizens was later added.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{dubious|date=October 2013}}

{{Main|Postal history of China}}
[[File:Stamp China 1949 4c on 100 silver ovpt.jpg|thumb|[[China]] 4-cent on 100-dollar silver overprint of 1949]]
Some Chinese sources claim mail or postal systems dating back to the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] or [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], which would be the oldest mailing service in the world. The earliest credible system of couriers was initiated by the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE), who had relay stations every 30 [[li (unit)|li]] along major routes.

The [[Tang dynasty]] (618 to 907 AD) operated recorded 1,639 posthouses, including maritime offices, employing around 20,000 people. The system was administered by the Ministry of War and private correspondence was forbidden from the network. The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368 to 1644) sought a postal system to deliver mail quickly, securely, and cheaply. Adequate speed was always a problem, because of the slow overland transportation system, and underfunding. Its network had 1,936 posthouses every 60 li along major routes, with fresh horses available every 10 li between them.&lt;ref&gt;Chelsea Zi Wang, &quot;More Haste, Less Speed: Sources of Friction in the Ming Postal System&quot;. ''Late Imperial China'' 40.2 (2019): 89-140.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] operated 1,785 posthouses throughout their lands. More efficient, however, was the system linking the international settlements, centered around Shanghai and the Treaty ports. It was the main communication system for China's international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lane J. Harris, &quot;Stumbling towards empire: the Shanghai Local Post Office, the transnational British community and informal empire in China, 1863–97&quot;. ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 46.3 (2018): 418-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongol Empire ===
{{main|Örtöö}}
[[Genghis Khan]] installed an empire-wide messenger and postal station system named ''[[Örtöö]]'' within the [[Mongol Empire]]. During the [[Yuan Dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]], this system also covered the territory of China. Postal stations were used not only for the transmission and delivery of [[official mail]] but were also available for travelling officials, military men, and foreign dignitaries. These stations aided and facilitated the transport of foreign and domestic tribute specifically and the conduct of trade in general.

By the end of Kublai Khan's rule, there were more than 1400 postal stations in China alone, which in turn had at their disposal about 50,000 horses, 1,400 oxen, 6,700 mules, 400 carts, 6,000 boats, more than 200 dogs, and 1,150 sheep.&lt;ref name=Mote/&gt;

The stations were {{convert|25|to|65|km|abbr=on}} apart and had reliable attendants working for the mail service. Foreign observers, such as [[Marco Polo]], have attested to the efficiency of this early postal system.&lt;ref name=Mote&gt;Mote 1978: 450&lt;/ref&gt;

Each station was maintained by up to twenty five families. Work for postal service counted as military service. The system was still operational in 18th century when 64 stations were required for a message to cross Mongolia from the [[Altai Mountains]] to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan===
The modern Japanese system was developed in the mid-19th century, closely copying European models. Japan was highly innovative in developing the world's largest and most successful  postal savings system and later a postal life insurance system as well. Postmasters play a key role in linking the Japanese political system to local politics.  The postmasters are high prestige, and are often hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia L. Maclachlan, ''The people’s post office: The history and politics of the Japanese postal system, 1871–2010'' (Brill, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  To a large extent, the postal system generated the enormous funding necessary to rapidly industrialize Japan in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Garon, ''Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the World Saves'' (2012) pp 143-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important postal service was created in the [[Islam]]ic world by the ''[[caliph]]'' Mu'awiyya; the service was called ''[[Barid (caliphate)|barid]]'', for the name of the towers built to protect the roads by which couriers travelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = Post, or Barid | first = Adam | last = Silverstein | encyclopedia = Medieval Islamic Civilization, An Encyclopedia, Volume 2: L-Z, Index | editor-first = Josef W. | editor-last = Meri | publisher = Routledge | location = Leiden and New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-415-96692-2 | pages = 631–632 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA631 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3000 BC, Egypt was using  [[homing pigeon]]s for [[pigeon post]], taking advantage of a singular quality of this bird, which when taken far from its nest is able to find its way home due to a particularly developed sense of orientation. Messages were then tied around the legs of the pigeon, which was freed and could reach its original nest. By the 19th century homing pigeons were used extensively for military communications.&lt;ref&gt;Carter W. Clarke, &quot;Signal Corps Pigeons&quot;. ''The Military Engineer'' 25.140 (1933): 133-138 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44563742 Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlemagne]] extended to the whole territory of his empire the system used by [[Franks]] in northern [[Gaul]] and connected this service with that of [[missus dominicus|''missi dominici'']].&lt;ref&gt;François L. Ganshof, &quot;The impact of Charlemagne on the institutions of the Frankish realm&quot;.

In the mid-11th century, flax traders known as the [[Cairo Geniza]] Merchants from [[Fustat]], Egypt wrote about using a postal service known as the ''kutubi.'' The ''kutubi'' system managed routes between the cities of Jerusalem, Ramla, Tyre, Ascalon, Damascus, Aleppo, and Fustat with year-round, regular mail delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jessica, &quot;Trade and Institutions in the Medieval Mediterranean : The Geniza Merchants and Their Business World&quot;. ''Cambridge University Press'', (2012): 189-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious orders had a private mail service. Notably, the [[Cistercians]] had one which connected more than 6,000 [[abbey]]s, [[monastery|monasteries]], and churches. The best organization, however, was created by the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;Marco Mostert,  &quot;New approaches to medieval communication?&quot; in ''New approaches to medieval communication'' (1999) pp. 15-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1505, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] established a postal system in the Empire, appointing Franz von Taxis to run it. The [[Thurn und Taxis]] family, then known as Tassis, had operated postal services between Italian city-states from 1290 onward. Following the abolition of the Empire in 1806, the [[Thurn-und-Taxis Post]] system continued as a private organization into the postage stamp era before being absorbed into the postal system of the new German Empire after 1871.

In 1716 Correos y Telégrafos was established in Spain as public mail service, available to all citizens. Delivery postmen were first employed in 1756 and post boxes were installed firstly in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Escribano,  Patricia González, and Julio Lasheras. &quot;Evolution and Analysis of the Market Structure of Postal Services in Spain&quot; in ''Competitive Transformation of the Postal and Delivery Sector'' (Springer, 2003) pp. 287-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postal reforms ===
{{see also|Uniform Fourpenny Post|Uniform Penny Post}}
[[File:Penny black.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The [[Penny Black]], the world's first postage stamp]]
In the United Kingdom, prior to 1840 letters were paid for by the recipient and the cost was determined by the distance from sender to recipient and the number of sheets of paper rather than by a countrywide flat rate with weight restrictions. [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Sir Rowland Hill]] reformed the postal system based on the concepts of [[Uniform Penny Post|penny postage]] and prepayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://postalheritage.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/rowland-hill%E2%80%99s-postal-reforms/ |title=Rowland Hill's Postal Reforms |work=The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive |access-date=27 December 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224185335/http://postalheritage.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/rowland-hill%e2%80%99s-postal-reforms/ |archive-date=24 December 2014 |date=2009-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed [[Mulready stationery|envelopes]] and adhesive [[postage stamp]]s as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the [[Penny Black]].

=== Modern transport and technology ===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R36070, Luftpost.jpg|thumb|The first airmail flight in Germany, 1912.]]
The postal system was important in the development of modern transportation. Railways carried [[railway post office]]s. During the 20th century, [[air mail]] became the transport of choice for inter-continental mail. Postmen started to utilize [[mail truck]]s. The handling of mail became increasingly automated.

The [[Internet]] came to change the conditions for physical mail. Email (and in recent years [[social networking]] sites) became a fierce competitor to physical mail systems, but [[online auction]]s and Internet shopping opened new business opportunities as people often get items bought online through the mail.

== Modern mail ==

Modern mail is organized by national and privatized services, which are reciprocally connected by international regulations, organizations and international agreements. Paper letters and parcels can be sent to almost any country in the world relatively easily and cheaply. The Internet has made the process of sending letter-like messages nearly instantaneous, and in many cases and situations correspondents use email where they previously would have used letters. The volume of paper mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service has declined by more than 15% since its peak at 213&amp;nbsp;billion pieces per annum in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.usps.com/future-postal-service/gcg-narrative.pdf USPS volume report by The Boston Consulting Group on USPS public website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-1926-2010.pdf First Class Mail Volume, 1926–2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114113728/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-1926-2010.pdf |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization ===

Some countries have organized their mail services as public limited liability corporations without a [[legal monopoly]].

The worldwide postal system constituting the individual national postal systems of the world's self-governing states is coordinated by the [[Universal Postal Union]], which among other things sets international postage rates, defines standards for [[postage stamp]]s and operates the system of [[international reply coupon]]s.

In most countries a system of codes has been created (referred to as ''[[ZIP code]]s'' in the United States, ''postcodes'' in the United Kingdom and Australia, and ''[[postal code]]s'' in most other countries) in order to facilitate the automation of operations. This also includes placing additional marks on the address portion of the letter or mailed object, called &quot;bar coding&quot;. Bar coding of mail for delivery is usually expressed either by a series of vertical bars, usually called [[POSTNET]] coding or a block of dots as a [[Barcode#2D barcodes|two-dimensional barcode]]. The &quot;block of dots&quot; method allows for the encoding of proof of payment of postage, exact routing for delivery, and other features.

[[Image:APC 77598 Webster Texas.jpg|thumb|right|An automated postal machine]]

The ordinary mail service was improved in the 20th century with the use of planes for a quicker delivery. The world's first scheduled [[airmail]] post service took place in the United Kingdom between the London suburbs of [[Hendon]] and [[Windsor, Berkshire]], on 9 September 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. C. (1960), p. 5, ''Fifty Years of British Air Mails'', Francis J.Field Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Some methods of airmail proved ineffective, however, including the United States Postal Service's experiment with [[rocket mail]].

Receipt services were made available in order to grant the sender a confirmation of effective delivery.

=== Payment ===

Worldwide, the most common method of prepaying postage is by buying an adhesive [[postage stamp]] to be applied to the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid [[envelope]]. [[Franking]] is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large mail programs, such as [[bank]]s and [[direct mail]] companies.

In 1998, the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] authorised the first tests of a secure system of sending digital franks via the [[Internet]] to be printed out on a PC printer, obviating the necessity to license a dedicated franking machine and allowing companies with smaller mail programs to make use of the option; this was later expanded to test the use of personalized postage. The service provided by the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 allows the franks to be printed out on special adhesive-backed labels.

In 2004 the [[Royal Mail]] in the United Kingdom introduced its ''SmartStamp'' Internet-based system, allowing printing on ordinary adhesive labels or envelopes. Similar systems are being considered by postal administrations around the world.

When the pre-paid envelope or package is accepted into the mail by an agent of the postal service, the agent usually indicates by means of a [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]] that it is no longer valid for pre-payment of postage. The exceptions are when the agent forgets or neglects to cancel the mailpiece, for stamps that are pre-cancelled and thus do not require cancellation and for, in most cases, metered mail.  (The &quot;personalized stamps&quot; authorized by the USPS and manufactured by Zazzle and other companies are in fact a form of meter label and thus do not need to be cancelled.)

=== Privacy and censorship ===

Documents should generally not be read by anyone other than the addressee; for example, in the United States of America it is a violation of federal law for anyone other than the addressee and the government to open mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1702.html |title=United States Code: Title 18, 1702.

The privacy of correspondence is guaranteed by the constitutions of [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico]], [[Constitution of Colombia|Colombia]] and [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazil]], and is alluded to in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 8(1): Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. {{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf |title=European Convention on Human Rights }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(179&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deccan&quot;/&gt; The control of the contents inside private citizens' mail is [[censorship]] and concerns social, political, and legal aspects of [[civil rights]].

The mail service may be allowed to open the mail if neither addressee nor sender can be located, in order to attempt to locate either. Mail service may also open the mail to inspect if it contains materials that are hazardous to transport or violate local laws.

While in most cases [[Postal censorship|mail censorship]] is exceptional, [[military mail]] to and from soldiers on active deployment is often subject to surveillance. In active fighting, censorship may be especially strict to hide tactical secrets, prevent low morale from bad news, etc.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Rise of electronic correspondence ===

Modern alternatives, such as the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[telex]], [[fax|facsimile]], and [[email]], have reduced the attractiveness of paper mail for many applications. These modern alternatives have some advantages: in addition to their speed, they may be more secure, e.g., because the general public cannot learn the address of the sender or recipient from the envelope, and occasionally traditional items of mail may fail to arrive, e.g. due to vandalism to mailboxes, unfriendly pets, and adverse weather conditions. Mail carriers due to perceived hazards or inconveniences, may refuse, officially or otherwise, to deliver mail to a particular address (for instance, if there is no clear path to the door or mailbox). On the other hand, traditional mail avoids the possibility of computer malfunctions and [[malware]], and the recipient does not need to print it out if they wish to have a paper copy, though scanning is required to make a digital copy.

Physical mail is still widely used in business and personal communications for such reasons as legal requirements for [[signature]]s, requirements of etiquette, and the requirement to enclose small physical objects.

Since the advent of [[email]], which is almost always much faster, the postal system has come to be referred to in [[Internet slang]] by the [[retronym]] &quot;[[Snail Mail (disambiguation)|snail mail]]&quot;. Occasionally, the term &quot;white mail&quot; or &quot;the PaperNet&quot; has also been used as a neutral term for postal mail.

Mainly during the 20th century, experimentation with [[hybrid mail]] has combined electronic and paper delivery. Electronic mechanisms include [[telegram]], [[teleprinter|telex]], facsimile ([[fax]]), [[email]], and short message service ([[Short Message Service|SMS]]). There have been methods which have combined mail and some of these newer methods, such as temporary emails, that combine facsimile transmission with overnight delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Significant Years in U.S. Postal History |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |year=2015 |url=https://about.usps.com/publications/pub100/pub100_076.htm |access-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227063650/http://about.usps.com/publications/pub100/pub100_076.htm |archive-date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaties |work=Postal Matters |publisher=United States Embassy, Bulgaria |date=25 June 1990 |url=http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/postalmatters.html |access-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919081040/http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/postalmatters.html |archive-date=19 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These vehicles commonly use a mechanical or electro-mechanical standardised writing (typing), that on the one hand makes for more efficient communication, while on the other hand makes impossible characteristics and practices that traditionally were in conventional mail, such as [[calligraphy]].

This epoch{{when|date=June 2013}} is undoubtedly mainly dominated by mechanical writing, with a general use of no more of half a dozen standard typographic [[typeface|fonts]] from standard keyboards. However, the increased use of typewritten or computer-printed letters for personal communication and the advent of email have sparked renewed interest in calligraphy, as a letter has become more of a &quot;special event&quot;. Long before email and computer-printed letters, however, decorated envelopes, [[rubber stamp]]s and [[artistamp]]s formed part of the medium of [[mail art]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In the 2000s (decade) with the advent of [[eBay]] and other online [[auction sites]] and [[online store]]s, postal services in industrialized nations have seen a major shift to item shipping. This has been seen as a boost to the system's usage in the wake of lower paper mail volume due to the accessibility of email.

[[Online post office]]s have emerged to give recipients a means of receiving traditional correspondence mail in a scanned electronic format.

=== Collecting ===
[[File:François Barraud - Le Philateliste.jpg|thumb|''Le Philateliste'' by [[François Barraud]] (1929).]]
[[Postage stamp]]s are also object of a particular form of [[collecting]]. [[Stamp collecting]] has been a very popular [[hobby]]. In some cases, when demand greatly exceeds supply, their commercial value on this specific market may become enormously greater than face value, even after use. For some postal services the sale of stamps to collectors who will never use them is a significant source of revenue; for example, stamps from Tokelau, South Georgia &amp; South Sandwich Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Niuafo´ou and many others. Stamp collecting is commonly known as [[philately]], although strictly the latter term refers to the study of stamps.

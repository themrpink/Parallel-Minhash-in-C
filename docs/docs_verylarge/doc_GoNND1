==Examples==

=== Government on primary markets ===
[[File:Barclays HQ.jpg|thumb|[[One Churchill Place]], Barclays headquarters in [[Canary Wharf]], London. Barclays is a major player in the world's primary and secondary bond markets.]]

When a government wants to raise long-term finance it will often sell bonds in the capital markets. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, many governments would use [[investment bank]]s to organize the sale of their bonds. The leading bank would underwrite the bonds, and would often head up a syndicate of brokers, some of whom might be based in other investment banks. The syndicate would then sell to various investors. For developing countries, a [[multilateral development bank]] would sometimes provide an additional layer of [[underwriting]], resulting in risk being shared between the investment bank(s), the multilateral organization, and the end investors. However, since 1997 it has been increasingly common for governments of the larger nations to bypass investment banks by making their bonds directly available for purchase online. Many governments now sell most of their bonds by computerized auction. Typically, large volumes are put up for sale in one go; a government may only hold a small number of auctions each year. Some governments will also sell a continuous stream of bonds through other channels. The biggest single seller of debt is the U.S. government; there are usually several transactions for such sales every second,{{efn|Even if there is no activity from big players, U.S. citizens might be making small investments through channels like ''Treasury Direct''.}} which corresponds to the continuous updating of the U.S. real-time debt clock.&lt;ref name = &quot;IntCM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdebtclock.org |title=U.S. National Debt Clock : Real Time|work=usdebtclock.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bond&quot;&gt;

===Company on primary markets===
When a company wants to raise money for long-term investment, one of its first decisions is whether to do so by issuing bonds or shares. If it chooses shares, it avoids increasing its debt, and in some cases the new shareholders may also provide non-monetary help, such as expertise or useful contacts. On the other hand, a new issue of shares will dilute the ownership rights of the existing shareholders, and if they gain a controlling interest, the new shareholders may even replace senior managers. From an investor's point of view, shares offer the potential for higher returns and capital gains if the company does well. Conversely, bonds are safer if the company does poorly, as they are less prone to severe falls in price, and in the event of bankruptcy, bond owners may be paid something, while shareholders will receive nothing.

When a company raises finance from the primary market, the process is more likely to involve face-to-face meetings than other capital market transactions. Whether they choose to issue bonds or shares,{{efn|Sometimes the company will consult with the investment bank for advice before they make this decision.}} companies will typically enlist the services of an investment bank to mediate between themselves and the market. A team from the investment bank often meets with the company's senior managers to ensure their plans are sound. The bank then acts as an [[securities underwriting|underwriter]], and will arrange for a network of [[Broker-dealer|brokers]] to sell the bonds or shares to investors. This second stage is usually done mostly through computerized systems, though brokers will often phone up their favored clients to advise them of the opportunity. Companies can avoid paying fees to investment banks by using a [[direct public offering]], though this is not a common practice as it incurs other legal costs and can take up considerable management time.&lt;ref name = &quot;IntCM&quot;&gt;''An Introduction to International Capital Markets: Products, Strategies, Participants'' , Andrew M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary market trading===
[[File:Deutsche-boerse-parkett-ffm008.jpg|thumb|right|An [[electronic trading platform]] being used at the [[Deutsche Börse]]. Most 21st century capital market transactions are executed electronically; sometimes a human operator is involved, and sometimes unattended computer systems execute the transactions, as happens in [[algorithmic trading]].]]

Most capital market transactions take place on the secondary market. On the primary market, each security can be sold only once, and the process to create batches of new shares or bonds is often lengthy due to regulatory requirements. On the secondary markets, there is no limit to the number of times a security can be traded, and the process is usually very quick. With the rise of strategies such as [[high-frequency trading]], a single security could in theory be traded thousands of times within a single hour.{{efn|This is far more likely to occur with shares, as exchanges that allow the automated trading of bonds are not as common, and bonds are generally traded less frequently.}} Transactions on the secondary market do not directly raise finance, but they do make it easier for companies and governments to raise finance on the primary market, as investors know that if they want to get their money back quickly, they will usually be easily able to re-sell their securities. Sometimes, however, secondary capital market transactions can have a negative effect on the primary borrowers: for example, if a large proportion of investors try to sell their bonds, this can push up the yields for future issues from the same entity. An extreme example occurred shortly after [[Bill Clinton]] began his first term as President of the United States; Clinton was forced to abandon some of the spending increases he had promised in his election campaign due to pressure from the bond markets [source?]. In the 21st century, several governments have tried to lock in as much as possible of their borrowing into long-dated bonds, so they are less vulnerable to pressure from the markets. Following the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], the introduction of [[quantitative easing]] further reduced the ability of private actors to push up the yields of government bonds, at least for countries with a [[central bank]] able to engage in substantial [[open market operation]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;IntCM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bond&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;shares&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of different players are active in the secondary markets. Individual investors account for a small proportion of trading, though their share has slightly increased; in the 20th century it was mostly only a few wealthy individuals who could afford an account with a broker, but accounts are now much cheaper and accessible over the internet. There are now numerous small [[Trader (finance)|traders]] who can buy and sell on the secondary markets using platforms provided by brokers which are accessible via web browsers. When such an individual trades on the capital markets, it will often involve a two-stage transaction. First they place an order with their broker, then the broker executes the trade. If the trade can be done on an exchange, the process will often be fully automated. If a dealer needs to manually intervene, this will often mean a larger fee. Traders in investment banks will often make deals on their bank's behalf, as well as executing trades for their clients. Investment banks will often have a division (or department) called &quot;capital markets&quot;: staff in this division try to keep aware of the various opportunities in both the primary and secondary markets, and will advise major clients accordingly. [[Pension fund|Pension]] and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s tend to have the largest holdings, though they tend to buy only the highest grade (safest) types of bonds and shares, and some of them do not trade all that frequently. According to a 2012 ''Financial Times'' article, hedge funds are increasingly making most of the short-term trades in large sections of the capital market (like the UK and US stock exchanges), which is making it harder for them to maintain their historically high returns, as they are increasingly finding themselves trading with each other rather than with less sophisticated investors.&lt;ref name = &quot;IntCM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bond&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;shares&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways to invest in the secondary market without directly buying shares or bonds. A common method is to invest in [[mutual fund]]s{{efn|A mutual fund itself will sometimes purchase securities from the primary markets as well as the secondary.}} or [[exchange-traded fund]]s. It is also possible to buy and sell derivatives that are based on the secondary market; one of the most common type of these is [[contract for difference|contracts for difference]] – these can provide rapid profits, but can also cause buyers to lose more money than they originally invested.&lt;ref name = &quot;IntCM&quot;/&gt;

==Size==
All figures given are in billions of [[US Dollar|US$]] and are sourced to the [[IMF]]. There is no universally recognized standard for measuring all of these figures, so other estimates may vary. A [[GDP]] column is included as a comparison.

===Forecasting and analyses===
A great deal of work goes into analysing capital markets and predicting their future movements. This includes academic study; work from within the financial industry for the purposes of making money and reducing risk; and work by governments and multilateral institutions for the purposes of regulation and understanding the impact of capital markets on the wider economy. Methods range from the gut instincts of experienced traders, to various forms of [[stochastic calculus]] and algorithms such as [[Stratonovich-Kalman-Bucy]] filtering algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Capital controls==
{{Main article|Capital control}}
Capital controls are measures imposed by a state's government aimed at managing [[capital account]] transactions – in other words, capital market transactions where one of the counter-parties{{efn|i.e., either the buyer or the seller.}} involved is in a foreign country. Whereas domestic regulatory authorities try to ensure that capital market participants trade fairly with each other, and sometimes to ensure institutions like banks do not take excessive risks, capital controls aim to ensure that the [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] effects of the capital markets do not have a negative impact. Most advanced nations like to use capital controls sparingly if at all, as in theory allowing markets freedom is a win-win situation for all involved: investors are free to seek maximum returns, and countries can benefit from investments that will develop their industry and infrastructure. However, sometimes capital market transactions can have a net negative effect: for example, in a [[financial crisis]], there can be a mass withdrawal of capital, leaving a nation without sufficient [[foreign-exchange reserves]] to pay for needed imports. On the other hand, if too much capital is flowing into a country, it can increase [[inflation]] and the value of the nation's currency, making its exports uncompetitive. Countries like [[India]] employ capital controls to ensure that their citizens' money is invested at home rather than abroad.&lt;ref name = &quot;differentBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The '''primary market''' is the part of the [[capital market]] that deals with the issuance and sale of equity-backed securities to investors directly by the issuer. Investors buy securities that were never traded before. Primary markets create long term instruments through which corporate entities raise funds from the capital market.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp|title=Primary Market|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the New Issue Market (NIM).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/primary-market/|title=Primary Market - How New Securities are Issued to the Public|work=Corporate Finance Institute|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
In a primary market, companies, governments or public sector institutions can raise funds through [[bond issue]]s and corporations can raise capital through the sale of new [[stock]] through an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). This is often done through an [[investment bank]] or [[syndicate#Finance syndicates|finance syndicate]] of securities dealers. The process of selling new shares to investors is called [[underwriting]]. Dealers earn a commission that is built into the price of the security offering, though it can be found in the [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

IPO's are not the only way new shares are issued. Publicly traded companies can issue new shares in what is called a ''primary issue'' of debt or stock, which involves the issue by a corporation of its own debt or new stock directly to institutional investors like [[pension funds]], or to private investors and shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eiiff.com/primary-market/|title=What is Primary Market ? - Definition and Meaning|work=World Finance|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Corporate Finance'', McGraw Hill 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the securities are issued directly by the company to its investors, the company receives the money and issues new security certificates to the investors. The primary market play the crucial function of facilitating the capital formation within the economy. The securities issued at the primary market can be issued in ''face value'', ''premium value,'' and ''at par value.'' 

Once issued, the securities typically trade on a [[secondary market]] such as a [[stock exchange]], [[bond market]] or [[derivatives exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Raising Funds ==
Corporate entities raise funds from the primary market in three ways:&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

# Public Issue - a stock exchange lists the securities and the corporation raises funds through [[initial public offering]] (IPO).
# Rights Issue - existing shareholders are offered more shares at a discounted price and on a pro-rata basis. 
# Preferential Allotment - a corporate issues shares at a price which may or may not be related to the current market price of the same security.

A '''financial market''' is a [[market (economics)|market]] in which people [[trade]] financial [[Security (finance)|securities]] and derivatives at low [[transaction cost]]s. Some of the securities include [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], raw materials and precious metals, which are known in the financial markets as commodities.

The term &quot;market&quot; is sometimes used for what are more strictly ''exchanges'', organizations that facilitate the trade in financial securities, e.g., a [[stock exchange]] or [[commodities exchange|commodity exchange]]. This may be a physical location (such as the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]], [[London Stock Exchange|LSE]], [[JSE Limited|JSE]], [[Bombay Stock Exchange|BSE]]) or an electronic system (such as [[NASDAQ]]). Much trading of stocks takes place on an exchange; still, [[corporate action]]s (merger, spinoff) are outside an exchange, while any two companies or people, for whatever reason, may agree to sell stock from the one to the other without using an exchange.

Trading of [[Foreign exchange market|currencies]] and [[Bond market|bonds]] is largely on a bilateral basis, although some bonds trade on a stock exchange, and people are building electronic systems for these as well,  to stock exchanges. There are also global initiatives such as the United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 10]] which has a target to improve regulation and monitoring of global financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Goal 10 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-23|website=UNDP|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of financial markets==
Within the financial sector, the term &quot;financial markets&quot; is often used to refer just to the markets that are used to raise finance. For long term finance, the ''Capital markets''; for short term finance, the ''Money markets''. Another common use of the term is as a catchall for all the markets in the financial sector, as per examples in the breakdown below.

The [[capital market]]s may also be divided into [[primary market]]s and [[secondary market]]s. Newly formed (issued) securities are bought or sold in primary markets, such as during [[initial public offering]]s. Secondary markets allow investors to buy and sell existing securities. The transactions in primary markets exist between issuers and investors, while secondary market transactions exist among investors.

Liquidity is a crucial aspect of securities that are traded in secondary markets. [[Liquidity]] refers to the ease with which a security can be sold without a loss of value. Securities with an active secondary market mean that there are many buyers and sellers at a given point in time. Investors benefit from [[market liquidity|liquid securities]] because they can sell their assets whenever they want; an illiquid security may force the seller to get rid of their asset at a large discount.

==Raising capital==
Financial markets attract funds from investors and channel them to corporations—they thus allow corporations to finance their operations and achieve growth. Money markets allow firms to borrow funds on a short term basis, while capital markets allow corporations to gain long-term funding to support expansion (known as maturity transformation).

Without financial markets, borrowers would have difficulty finding lenders themselves. Intermediaries such as [[bank]]s, [[investment banking|Investment Banks]], and [[boutique investment bank|Boutique Investment Banks]] can help in this process. Banks take deposits from those who have [[money]] to save. They can then lend money from this pool of deposited money to those who seek to borrow. Banks popularly lend money in the form of [[loan]]s and [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s.

More complex transactions than a simple bank deposit require markets where lenders and their agents can meet borrowers and their agents, and where existing borrowing or lending commitments can be sold on to other parties. A good example of a financial market is a [[stock exchange]]. A company can raise money by selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] to [[investor]]s and its existing shares can be bought or sold.

The following table illustrates where financial markets fit in the relationship between lenders and borrowers:

===Lenders===
The lender temporarily gives money to somebody else, on the condition of getting back the principal amount together with some interest or profit or charge.

====Individuals and doubles====
Many individuals are not aware that they are lenders, but almost everybody does lend money in many ways. A person lends money when he or she:

* Puts money in a savings account at a bank
* Contributes to a pension plan
* Pays premiums to an insurance company
* Invests in government bonds

====Companies====
''[[Company (law)|Companies]]'' tend to be lenders of capital. When companies have surplus cash that is not needed for a short period of time, they may seek to make money from their cash surplus by lending it via short term markets called [[money market]]s. Alternatively, such companies may decide to return the cash surplus to their shareholders (e.g. via a [[share repurchase]] or [[dividend]] payment).

====Banks====
[[Bankers|Banks]] can be lenders themselves as they are able to [[Money creation|create new debt money]] in the form of deposits.

===Borrowers===

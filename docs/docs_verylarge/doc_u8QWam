==Activities==

===Visiting Artists Program===
Founded in 1868, the '''Visiting Artists Program (VAP)''' is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It showcases work in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/visiting-artists-program/|title=Visiting Artists Program|access-date=20 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Recent visiting artists have included [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andi Zeisler]], [[Aaron Koblin]], [[Jean Shin]], [[Sam Lipsyte]], [[Ben Marcus]], [[Marilyn Minter]], [[Pearl Fryar]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Bill Fontana]], [[Wolfgang Laib]], [[Suzanne Lee]], and [[Amar Kanwar]] among others.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Additionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Recent alumni speakers include [[Tania Bruguera]], Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, [[Maria Martinez-Cañas]], [[Saya Woolfalk]], [[Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba]], and [[Sanford Biggers]] to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/visiting-artists-program/past-events|title=Past Events &amp; Podcasts|access-date=20 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Galleries===
*'''Sullivan Galleries'''- Located to the 7th floor of the Sullivan Center at 33 S. State Street. With shows and projects often led by faculty or student curators, it is a teaching gallery.
*'''SITE Galleries (formerly Student Union Galleries)''' - Founded in 1994, SITE, once known as the Student Union Galleries (SUGs), is a ''student-run'' organization at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) for the exhibition of ''student work''. They have two locations: The SITE Sharp of the 37 South Wabash Avenue building; and SITE Columbus of the 280 South Columbus Drive building. The two locations allow the galleries to cycle two shows simultaneously.

===Student organizations===

==== ExTV ====
ExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building. 

====''F Newsmagazine''====

====Student government====
The student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution requires four officers holding equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.

The student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.

== Controversy ==

=== ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' ===
{{Main|Mirth &amp; Girth}}
On May 11,&amp;nbsp;1988, a student painting depicting [[Harold Washington]], the first black mayor of Chicago, was taken down by three of the city's African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]] based on its content.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnor&quot;/&gt; The painting by David Nelson, titled ''Mirth &amp; Girth'', was of Washington clad only in women's underwear and holding a pencil.&lt;ref name=&quot;sneed_19880704&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE58EA8BDAC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Sneed, Michael |title=Untitled |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1988-07-04 |access-date=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had died suddenly less than six months earlier, on November 25,&amp;nbsp;1987.

After the aldermen held the painting hostage, Police Superintendent [[LeRoy Martin]] ordered officers to take it into custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnor&quot;/&gt; Art students protested. The painting was returned after a day. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights. A 1992 federal court affirmed his constitutional rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubin 1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven | title = Arresting Images, Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | url = https://archive.org/details/arrestingimagesi00dubi | url-access = registration | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the city agreed to a settlement to end litigation; the money would go toward attorneys' fees for the ACLU. The three aldermen agreed not to appeal the 1992 ruling, and the Police Department established procedures over seizure of materials protected by the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnor&quot;&gt;[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-09-21-9409210076-story.html Matt O'Connor, &quot; Suit Ended on Picture of Washington&quot;], ''Chicago Tribune'', 21 September 1994; accessed 19 December 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' ===

In February&amp;nbsp;1989, a student named [[Dread Scott|&quot;Dread&quot; Scott Tyler]] spread a [[Flag of the United States]] on the floor of the Institute&lt;!-- United States Flag Code --&gt; as part of a piece entitled ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' The piece consisted of a podium, set upon the flag, and containing a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag, which is a violation of customary practice and code. While the exhibit faced protests from veterans and bomb threats, the school stood by the student's art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubin 1992&quot;/&gt; That year, the school's state funding was cut from $70,000 to $1, and the piece was publicly condemned by [[George H.W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Adrianna |title=Banner Year: At a Time of Heated Race Relations in America, Dread Scott Wades Into the Fray |url=https://www.artnews.com/art-news/artists/banner-year-at-a-time-of-heated-race-relations-in-america-dread-scott-wades-into-the-fray-7554/ |website=ARTnews |access-date=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott would go on to be one of the defendants in ''[[United States v. Eichman]]'', a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case in which it was eventually decided that federal laws banning flag desecration were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=Alina |title=It’s Legal to Burn the American Flag.

===Academic freedom controversy===
In 2017, a controversy arose after Michael Bonesteel, an [[Professors in the United States#Adjunct professor|adjunct professor]] specializing in [[outsider art]],  and comics, resigned after actions taken by the Institute following two [[Title IX]] complaints by transgender students being filed against him in which each criticized his comments and class discussion. The Institute initiated an investigation and took certain actions. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a &quot;Kafkaesque trial&quot;, in which he was never shown copies of the complaints. He claimed he was assumed to be &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; and that SAIC &quot;feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued&quot;.&lt;ref name=TensionsintheArtClassroom&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/debate-over-art-teaching-and-prejudice-school-art-institute-chicago |title=Tensions in the Art Classroom |last=Roll |first=Nick |date=July 24, 2017 |website=Inside Higher Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Kipnis]], author of [[Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus|a book]] on Title IX cases in which she argues that universities follow reckless and capricious approaches, argued that SAIC was displaying &quot;jawdropping cowardice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkel&quot;/&gt; She said, &quot;The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor’s opinions or thinking is appalling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;finkel&quot;&gt;[https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/art-school-under-fire-for-bowing-to-transgender-student-complaints Jori Finkel, &quot;Art school under fire for bowing to transgender student complaints&quot;], ''The Art Newspaper'', 18 August 2017; accessed 19 December 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bartlett, &quot;The Offender&quot;, ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', August 10, 2017. Available online to subscribers only.&lt;/ref&gt;  The School said the claims made against it were &quot;problematic&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;, and that it supports [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TensionsintheArtClassroom&quot; /&gt;

The '''Werra''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvɛʁa}}), a river in central [[Germany]], is the [[bank(geography)|right-bank]] [[headwater]] of the [[Weser]]. Weser is a synonym in an old dialect of German. The Werra has its source near [[Eisfeld]] in southern [[Thuringia]]. After {{convert|293|km|mi}} the Werra joins the river [[Fulda (river)|Fulda]] in the town of [[Hann. Münden]], forming the Weser.

Its valley, the {{lang|de|Werratal}}, has many tributaries and is a relative lull between the [[Rhön Mountains]] and the [[Thuringian Forest]].

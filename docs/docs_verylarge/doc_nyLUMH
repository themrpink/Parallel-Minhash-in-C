===Colour blindness===
In 1794, shortly after his arrival in Manchester, Dalton was elected a member of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]], the &quot;Lit &amp; Phil&quot;, and a few weeks later he communicated his first paper on &quot;Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours&quot;, in which he postulated that shortage in colour perception was caused by discoloration of the liquid medium of the eyeball. As both he and his brother were [[Color blindness|colour blind]], he recognised that the condition must be hereditary.&lt;ref name=&quot;daltoncb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Life and work of John Dalton – Colour Blindness |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/sci_nat_the_life_and_work_of_john_dalton_(1766_1844)/html/4.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dalton's theory lost credence in his lifetime, the thorough and methodical nature of his research into his visual problem was so broadly recognised that Daltonism became a common term for colour blindness.{{efn |Dalton believed that his vitreous humour possessed an abnormal blue tint, causing his anomalous colour perception, and he gave instructions for his eyes to be examined on his death, to test this hypothesis. His wishes were duly carried out, but no blue colouration was found, and Dalton's hypothesis was refuted. The shrivelled remains of one eye have survived to this day, and now belong to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjo.82.2.203d |title=John Dalton's Colour Vision Legacy |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=203d |year=1998 |last1=Regan |first1=B.|pmc=1722488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Examination of his preserved eyeball in 1995 demonstrated that Dalton had a less common kind of colour blindness, [[deuteranopia|deuteroanopia]], in which medium wavelength sensitive cones are missing (rather than functioning with a mutated form of pigment, as in the most common type of colour blindness, [[deuteranomaly|deuteroanomaly]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;daltoncb&quot;/&gt; Besides the blue and purple of the optical spectrum he was only able to recognise one colour, yellow, or, as he said in a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours: with observations |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |year=1798 |volume=5 |pages=28–45 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011812155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800, Dalton became secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and in the following year he presented an important series of lectures, entitled &quot;Experimental Essays&quot; on the constitution of mixed gases; the [[pressure (physics)|pressure]] of steam and other [[vapour]]s at different temperatures in a [[vacuum]] and in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]; on [[evaporation]]; and on the [[thermal expansion]] of gases. The four essays, presented between 2 and 30 October 1801, were published in the ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'' in 1802.

The second essay opens with the remark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Essay II. On the Force of Steam or Vapour from Water and Various other Liquids, both is a Vacuum and in Air |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1802|volume= 5 |pages=550–551 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There can scarcely be a doubt entertained respecting the reducibility of all elastic fluids of whatever kind, into liquids; and we ought not to despair of effecting it in [[cryogenics|low temperatures]] and by strong pressures exerted upon the unmixed gases further.}}

After describing experiments to ascertain the pressure of steam at various points between 0 and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (32 and 212&amp;nbsp;°F), Dalton concluded from observations of the [[vapour pressure]] of six different liquids, that the variation of vapour pressure for all liquids is equivalent, for the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any given pressure.

In the fourth essay he remarks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA600 |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Essay IV. On the Expansion of Elastic Fluids by Heat |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1802 |volume= 5 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I see no sufficient reason why we may not conclude, that all elastic fluids under the same pressure expand equally by heat—and that for any given expansion of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], the corresponding expansion of air is proportionally something less, the higher the temperature. ... It seems, therefore, that general laws respecting the absolute quantity and the nature of heat, are more likely to be derived from elastic fluids than from other substances.}}

He enunciated [[Gay-Lussac's law]], published in 1802 by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] (Gay-Lussac credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by [[Jacques Charles]]). In the two or three years following the lectures, Dalton published several papers on similar topics. &quot;On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids&quot; (read as a lecture on 21 October 1803, first published in 1805)&lt;ref name=Dalton1805&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Pg5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271 |last=Dalton |first=John |title=On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1805 |volume= 6 |pages=271–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained his law of partial pressures now known as [[Dalton's law]].

===Atomic theory===
The most important of all Dalton's investigations are concerned with the [[atomic theory]] in chemistry. While his name is inseparably associated with this theory, the origin of Dalton's atomic theory is not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/350077 |title=The Origin of Dalton's Chemical Atomic Theory: Daltonian Doubts Resolved |journal=Isis |volume=57 |pages=35–55 |year=1966 |last1=Thackray |first1=Arnold W.|s2cid=144818988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;In Search of El Dorado: John Dalton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=40972005 |last1=Rocke |first1=Alan J. |title=In Search of El Dorado: John Dalton and the Origins of the Atomic Theory |journal=Social Research |year=2005 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=125–158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory may have been suggested to him either by researches on [[ethylene]] (''olefiant gas'') and [[methane]] (''carburetted hydrogen'') or by analysis of [[nitrous oxide]] (''protoxide of azote'') and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (''deutoxide of azote''), both views resting on the authority of [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=Thomas |title=The Elements of Chemistry |date=1810 |publisher=J. &amp; A.Y. Humphreys |page=480 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZsIAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Thomas%20Thomson%20element%20of%20chemistry&amp;pg=PA483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1814 to 1819, Irish chemist [[William Higgins (chemist)|William Higgins]] claimed that Dalton had plagiarised his ideas, but Higgins' theory did not address relative atomic mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The life and work of William Higgins, chemist, 1763-1825 including reprints of &quot;A comparative view of the phlogistic and antiphlogistic theories&quot; and &quot;Observations on the atomic theory and electrical phenomena&quot; by William Higgins|last1=Wheeler |first1=T. S |last2=Partington |first2=J. R.|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0020 |title=William Higgins at the Dublin Society, 1810-20: The loss of a professorship and a claim to the atomic theory |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=417–434 |year=2010 |last1=Grossman |first1=M. I.|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent evidence suggests that Dalton's development of thought may have been influenced by the ideas of another Irish chemist [[Bryan Higgins]], who was William's uncle. Bryan believed that an atom was a heavy central particle surrounded by an atmosphere of [[Caloric theory|caloric]], the supposed substance of heat at the time. The size of the atom was determined by the diameter of the caloric atmosphere. Based on the evidence, Dalton was aware of Bryan's theory and adopted very similar ideas and language, but he never acknowledged Bryan's anticipation of his caloric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2014.0025 |title=John Dalton and the London atomists: William and Bryan Higgins, William Austin, and new Daltonian doubts about the origin of the atomic theory |journal= Notes and Records |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=339–356 |year=2014 |last1=Grossman |first1=M.

A study of Dalton's laboratory notebooks, discovered in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896}} concluded that so far from Dalton being led by his search for an explanation of the [[law of multiple proportions]] to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight, the idea of atoms arose in his mind as a purely physical concept, forced on him by study of the physical properties of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and other gases. The first published indications of this idea are to be found at the end of his paper &quot;On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids&quot;&lt;ref name=Dalton1805/&gt; already mentioned. There he says:

{{quote|Why does not water admit its bulk of every kind of gas alike? This question I have duly considered, and though I am not able to satisfy myself completely I am nearly persuaded that the circumstance depends on the weight and number of the ultimate particles of the several gases.}}

He then proposes relative weights for the atoms of a few elements, without going into further detail.

The main points of Dalton's atomic theory, as it eventually developed, are:
# Elements are made of extremely small particles called [[atom]]s.
# Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and other properties; atoms of different elements differ in size, mass and other properties.
# Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed.
# Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form [[chemical compounds]].
# In [[chemical reactions]], atoms are combined, separated or rearranged.

In his first extended published discussion of the atomic theory (1808), Dalton proposed an additional (and controversial) &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot;.  This rule could not be independently confirmed, but some such assumption was necessary in order to propose formulas for a few simple molecules, upon which the calculation of atomic weights depended.  This rule dictated that if the atoms of two different elements were known to form only a single compound, like hydrogen and oxygen forming water or hydrogen and nitrogen forming ammonia, the molecules of that compound shall be assumed to consist of one atom of each element.  For elements that combined in multiple ratios, such as the then-known two oxides of carbon or the three oxides of nitrogen, their combinations were assumed to be the simplest ones possible.  For example, if two such combinations are known, one must consist of an atom of each element, and the other must consist of one atom of one element and two atoms of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transforming Matter: A History of Chemistry from Alchemy to the Buckyball|last = Levere|first = Trevor|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-8018-6610-4|location = Baltimore, Maryland|pages = 84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature. No evidence was then available to scientists to deduce how many atoms of each element combine to form molecules. But this or some other such rule was absolutely necessary to any incipient theory, since one needed an assumed molecular formula in order to calculate relative atomic weights. Dalton's &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot; caused him to assume that the formula for water was OH and [[ammonia]] was NH, quite different from our modern understanding (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). On the other hand, his simplicity rule led him to propose the correct modern formulas for the two oxides of carbon (CO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Despite the uncertainty at the heart of Dalton's atomic theory, the principles of the theory survived.

===Atomic weights===
[[Image:A New System of Chemical Philosophy fp.jpg|right|thumb|Various atoms and [[molecule]]s as depicted in John Dalton's ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]
Dalton published his first table of relative [[atomic weight]]s containing six elements (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur and phosphorus), relative to the weight of an atom of hydrogen conventionally taken as 1.&lt;ref name=Dalton1805/&gt; Since these were only relative weights, they do not have a unit of weight attached to them. Dalton provided no indication in this paper how he had arrived at these numbers, but in his laboratory notebook, dated 6 September 1803,{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896|page=83}} is a list in which he set out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, [[carbon dioxide]], etc. by chemists of the time.

The extension of this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the [[law of multiple proportions]], and the comparison with experiment brilliantly confirmed his deduction.{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896|pages=50–51}} In the paper &quot;On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere&quot;, read by him in November 1802, the law of multiple proportions appears to be anticipated in the words:

{{quote|The elements of oxygen may combine with a certain portion of nitrous gas or with twice that portion, but with no intermediate quantity.}}

But there is reason to suspect that this sentence may have been added some time after the reading of the paper, which was not published until 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1805 |volume= 6 |pages=244–258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Pg5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds were listed as binary, ternary, quaternary, etc. (molecules composed of two, three, four, etc. atoms) in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' depending on the number of atoms a compound had in its simplest, empirical form.

Dalton hypothesised the structure of compounds can be represented in whole number ratios. So, one atom of element X combining with one atom of element Y is a binary compound. Furthermore, one atom of element X combining with two atoms of element Y or vice versa, is a ternary compound.  Many of the first compounds listed in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' correspond to modern views, although many others do not.

Dalton used his own symbols to visually represent the atomic structure of compounds. They were depicted in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'', where he listed 21 elements and 17 simple molecules.

===Other investigations===
Dalton published papers on such diverse topics as rain and dew and the origin of springs (hydrosphere); on heat, the colour of the sky, steam and the [[Specular reflection|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of light; and on the grammatical subjects of the [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[participle]]s of the English language.

===Experimental approach===
As an investigator, Dalton was often content with rough and [[accuracy and precision|inaccurate]] instruments, even though better ones were obtainable. Sir [[Humphry Davy]] described him as &quot;a very coarse experimenter&quot;, who &quot;almost always found the results he required, trusting to his head rather than his hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Dalton (1911 Encyclopedia Britannica) |url=https://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/bri/j/john-dalton.html |access-date=2020-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, historians who have replicated some of his crucial experiments have confirmed Dalton's skill and precision.

In the preface to the second part of Volume I of his ''New System'', he says he had so often been misled by taking for granted the results of others that he determined to write &quot;as little as possible but what I can attest by my own experience&quot;, but this independence he carried so far that it sometimes resembled lack of receptivity. Thus he distrusted, and probably never fully accepted, [[Gay-Lussac]]'s conclusions as to the combining volumes of gases.

He held unconventional views on [[chlorine]]. Even after its elementary character had been settled by Davy, he persisted in using the atomic weights he himself had adopted, even when they had been superseded by the more accurate determinations of other chemists.

He always objected to the chemical notation devised by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], although most thought that it was much simpler and more convenient than his own cumbersome system of circular symbols.

==Other publications==
For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' Dalton contributed articles on Chemistry and Meteorology, but the topics are not known.

He contributed 117 ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'' from 1817 until his death in 1844 while president of that organisation. Of these the earlier are the most important. In one of them, read in 1814, he explains the principles of [[volumetric analysis]], in which he was one of the earliest researchers. In 1840 a paper on [[phosphate]]s and [[arsenic|arsenate]]s, often regarded as a weaker work, was refused by the [[Royal Society]], and he was so incensed that he published it himself. He took the same course soon afterwards with four other papers, two of which (&quot;On the quantity of [[acid]]s, [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s and salts in different varieties of salts&quot; and &quot;On a new and easy method of analysing sugar&quot;) contain his discovery, regarded by him as second in importance only to atomic theory, that certain [[anhydrate]]s, when dissolved in water, cause no increase in its volume, his inference being that the salt enters into the pores of the water.

==Public life==
Even before he had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had attained a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective in the treatment of his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration.

In 1810, Sir Humphry Davy asked him to offer himself as a candidate for the [[fellowship of the Royal Society]], but Dalton declined, possibly for financial reasons. In 1822 he was proposed without his knowledge, and on election paid the usual fee. Six years previously he had been made a corresponding member of the French [[Académie des Sciences]], and in 1830 he was elected as one of its eight foreign associates in place of Davy. In 1833, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s government conferred on him a pension of [[GBP|£]]150, raised in 1836 to £300. Dalton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1834.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A young [[James Prescott Joule]], who later studied and published (1843) on the nature of heat and its relationship to mechanical work, was a pupil of Dalton in his last years.

==Personal life==
[[File:John Dalton by Thomas Phillips, 1835.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dalton in later life by [[Thomas Phillips]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] (1835).]]
Dalton never married and had only a few close friends. As a Quaker, he lived a modest and unassuming personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHF&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=John Dalton |website=Science History Institute |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/john-dalton |access-date=20 March 2018|date=June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 26 years prior to his death, Dalton lived in a room in the home of the Rev W. Johns, a published botanist, and his wife, in George Street, Manchester. Dalton and Johns died in the same year (1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert Angus|title=Memoir of John Dalton and History of the Atomic Theory up to his time|journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester|date=1856|volume=13|pages=298|series=Second|language=English|format=hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalton's daily round of laboratory work and [[tutoring]] in Manchester was broken only by annual excursions to the Lake District and occasional visits to London. In 1822 he paid a short visit to [[Paris]], where he met many distinguished resident men of science. He attended several of the earlier meetings of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] at [[York]], [[Oxford]], [[Dublin]] and [[Bristol]].

==Disability and death==
Dalton suffered a minor stroke in 1837, and a second in 1838 left him with a speech impairment, although he remained able to perform experiments. In May 1844 he had another stroke; on 26 July he recorded with trembling hand his last meteorological observation. On 27 July, in Manchester, Dalton fell from his bed and was found lifeless by his attendant.

Dalton was accorded a civic funeral with full honours. His body lay in state in [[Manchester Town Hall]] for four days and more than 40,000 people filed past his coffin. The funeral procession included representatives of the city's major civic, commercial, and scientific bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |title=Dalton, John |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/john-dalton |access-date=8 August 2017 |year=2008 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcbio&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Science celebrates 'father of nanotech' |last=King |first=Kristine |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3178890.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 October 2003 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Manchester in [[Ardwick#History|Ardwick Cemetery]]; the cemetery is now a playing field, but pictures of the original grave may be found in published materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = Elizabeth C. | title = John Dalton and the Atomic Theory | url = https://archive.org/details/johndaltonatomi00patt | url-access = registration | publisher=Doubleday | location = Garden City, New York | year = 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elliott, T.

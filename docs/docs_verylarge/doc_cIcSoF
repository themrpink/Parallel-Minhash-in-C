There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online games===
In 1999, [[Daybreak Game Company|Sony Online Entertainment]] licensed ''Trivial Pursuit'' from [[Hasbro Interactive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/1998/12/trivial-pursuit-going-online/|title=Trivial Pursuit Going Online|date=1998-12-14|website=WIRED|access-date=2020-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to release a downloadable online game on The Station@Sony (home to [[EverQuest|Everquest]] at the time), where up to three auto-matched players could chat with each other live while they played.

In [[sport]], '''racing''' is a [[competition]] of [[speed]], against an objective criterion, usually a [[clock]] or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of [[time]]. Typically this involves [[:wikt:traverse|traversing]] some [[distance]], but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.

A race may be run continuously  to finish or may be made of several segments called heats, [[Race stage|stage]]s or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a [[Individual time trial|time trial]].

Early records of races are evident on [[pottery]] from [[ancient Greece]], which depicted running men vying for first place. A [[chariot racing|chariot race]] is described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''.

==Etymology==
The word ''race'' comes from a [[Old Norse|Norse]] word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Norse word arrived in [[France]] during the invading of [[Normandy]] and gave the word ''raz'' which means &quot;swift water&quot; in [[Brittany]], as in a [[mill race]]; it can be found in &quot;[[Pointe du Raz]]&quot; (the most western point of France, in Brittany), and &quot;''raz-de-marée''&quot; ([[tsunami]]). The word race to mean a &quot;contest of speed&quot; was first recorded in the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Race|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A race&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Racing Apk - The Best Racing Mod Apk|url=https://theracingapk.com/|access-date=2020-11-08|website=The Racing Apk|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its name are often associated with the place of origin, the means of transport and the distance of the race. As a couple of examples, see the [[Dakar Rally]] or the [[Athens Marathon]].

==Forms==
{{Further|List of forms of racing}}
[[File:Russia 4 x 400 m Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|Russian women's team pose after winning 4 × 400 m relay race at [[2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships]].]]
[[Running]] a distance is the most basic form of racing, but races may be conducted in [[vehicle]]s, such as [[Boat racing|boats]], [[Auto racing|car]]s, [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycles]], [[Bicycle racing|bicycles]] and [[Air racing|aircraft]]; or with [[animal]]s such as [[Horse racing|horses]] or [[Dog racing|dogs]]. Races may also be conducted with other modes of transport such as [[ski racing (disambiguation)|skis]], [[Sledding|sleds]], [[Speed skating|skates]] or [[Wheelchair racing|wheelchair]]; or other forms of movement such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] or [[Racewalking|walking]]. In a [[relay race]] members of a [[team]] take turns in racing parts of a circuit or performing a certain racing form.

[[Orienteering|Orienteering races]] add an additional task of using a map and [[compass]] to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain.

A race can also involve any other type of goal like [[eating]]. A common [[Competitive eating|speed eating]] challenge is a [[hot dog]] eating race, where contestants try to eat more hot dogs than the other racers.

[[Race game|Racing board games]] and [[racing video game]]s are also competitions of speed.

Racing can also be done in more humoristic and entertaining ways such as the [[Sausage Race]], the [[Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix]] and [[wok racing]]. Racing can be entertained from around the world.

== Sprint finishes ==
A sprint finish is a racing tactic used in many forms of racing where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race. This tactic is mostly associated with long-distance forms of [[running]] and [[cycling (sport)|cycling]], which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race – this slower [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] racing allows for the subsequent [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity required for sprinting.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J Maughan, &amp; Michael Gleeson (20 May 2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xT6cAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;ots=OOMScgHaWA&amp;dq=%22anaerobic%22%20%22sprint%20finish%22&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anaerobic%22%20%22sprint%20finish%22&amp;f=false &quot;Energy Supply&quot; &lt;span id=&quot;atom_broken_id_2&quot; class=&quot;atom_response&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;]. ''The Biochemical Basis of Sports Performance'' (pg. 129). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199208289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic relies upon keeping greater [[Energy balance (biology)|energy reserves]] than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first. It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal [[Pace (speed)|pace]] throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency (see [[running economy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Roy. [http://www.multibriefs.com/briefs/exclusive/developing_a_fast_finish.html#.U1AWms73Gt8 Developing a fast finish for your road races &lt;span id=&quot;atom_broken_id_1&quot; class=&quot;atom_response&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;]. Multi Briefs. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[track and field]], distances from [[1500 metres]] upwards often feature sprint finishes. They can also be found in [[cross country running|cross country]] and [[road running]] events, even up to the [[marathon]] distance. A runner's ability to sprint at the end of a race is also known as their finishing [[Kick (running)|kick]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Matt (2013-11-18). [http://running.competitor.com/2013/11/training/kick-your-way-to-better-race-times_31618 Kick Your Way To Better Race Times]. Competitor. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multisport race]]s, such as the [[triathlon]], often have running as the final section and sprint finish tactics are applied as they are in running-only events.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Roy (2013-07-13). [http://www.triathlonmag.com.au/training/run/7136-developing-a-fast-finish Developing a fast finish &lt;span id=&quot;atom_broken_id_3&quot; class=&quot;atom_response&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;]. ''Triathlon &amp; Multisport Magazine''. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cycling, sprint finishes are an integral part of the sport and are used in both [[track cycling]] and [[road cycling]]. [[Sprint (cycling)|Cycling sprints]] are often highly tactical, particularly on the track, with cyclists occasionally coming to a near halt at points before reaching a high speed finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/get_involved/4261874.stm The individual sprint] . [[BBC Sport|BBC Sport &lt;span id=&quot;atom_broken_id_4&quot; class=&quot;atom_response&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;]]. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The longer track races such as [[scratch race]]s often feature sprint finishes, as maintaining a steady pace within the [[peloton]] allows opponents to conserve energy through [[drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingcalendar.com/scratch-race.html Scratch Race]. Cycling Calendar. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2016}} Road races are similar in this respect, in both short [[criterium]] races and long-distance races. Sprint tactics also form a major part of [[points classification]]s in road events, where [[cycling sprinter]]s specialise in reaching an intermediate point first, thus gaining extra points and resulting prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Gitz, Jarred (2014-04-05). [http://www.jarredscycling.com/2014/04/the-points-classification.html The Points Classification] . Jareds Cycling. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;&gt;Smith, Mark (2008-05-01). [http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/technique-sprint-finishing-1044/ Technique: Sprint finishing]. Bike Radar. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprint finish tactics are also used in [[speedskating]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[long-distance swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mastersswimmingqld.org.au/Coaching/Open-Water-Swimming Open Water Swimming]. Masters Swimming. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[horse racing]] and other [[animal racing]] sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onefasthorse.com/minella-best-in-sprint-finish/108643/ Minella best in sprint finish &lt;span id=&quot;atom_broken_id_0&quot; class=&quot;atom_response&quot;&gt;503&lt;/span&gt;].

Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The finishes of races which are outright sprinting events in themselves, such as the [[100 metres]] track race, are not normally referred to as sprint finishes, as all competitors are already sprinting by default (thus it is not a racing tactic).

The '''Tlingit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ᵻ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|l|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|ᵻ|t}}; also spelled '''Tlinkit'''; {{lang-ru|Тлинкиты}}) are [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Their language is the [[Tlingit language]] (natively {{lang|tli|Lingít}}, pronounced {{IPA-ath|ɬɪ̀nkɪ́tʰ|}}),&lt;ref name=lingit&gt;[http://www.tlingitlanguage.org/ &quot;Lingít Yoo X'atángi: The Tlingit Language.&quot;] ''Sealaska Heritage Institute.'' (retrieved 3 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the name means &quot;People of the Tides&quot;.&lt;ref name=p208&gt;Pritzker, 208&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian language|Russian]] name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Koloshi}}'' ({{lang|ru|Колоши}}, from a [[Alutiiq language|Sugpiaq-Alutiiq]] term ''{{lang|ems|kulut'ruaq}}'' for the [[labret]] worn by women) or the related [[German language|German]] name '''''{{lang|de|Koulischen}}''''' may be encountered referring to the people in older historical literature, such as [[Grigory Shelikhov|Shelikhov]]'s 1796 map of [[Russian America]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigory Shelikhov|Shelikhov, Gregorii Ivanovich]] and Richard A. Pierce. ''A Voyage to America 1783–1786.'' Kingston: Limestone Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tlingit have a [[matrilineal]] [[kinship system]], with children considered born into the mother's [[clan]], and property and hereditary roles passing through the mother's line.&lt;ref name=p210&gt;Pritzker, 210&lt;/ref&gt; Their culture and society developed in the [[temperate rainforest]] of the southeast [[Alaska]] coast and the [[Alexander Archipelago]]. The Tlingit maintained a complex [[hunter-gatherer]] culture based on semi-sedentary management of fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 27&lt;/ref&gt; An inland group, known as the Inland Tlingit, inhabits the far northwestern part of the province of [[British Columbia]] and the southern [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] in [[Canada]].

==Territory==
[[File:Tlingit-map.png|thumb|Tlingit and neighboring peoples]]

The greatest territory historically occupied by the Tlingit extended from the [[Portland Canal]] along the present border between [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]], north to the coast just southeast of the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] delta in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;de Laguna, 203-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tlingit occupied almost all of the [[Alexander Archipelago]], except the southernmost end of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] and its surroundings, where the Kaigani [[Haida people|Haida]] moved just before the first encounters with European explorers.

The Coastal Tlingit tribes controlled one of the mountain passes into the Yukon interior; they were divided into three tribes: the Chilkat Tlingit (Jilḵáat Ḵwáan) along the [[Chilkat River]] and on [[Chilkat Peninsula]], the Chilkoot Tlingit (Jilḵoot Ḵwáan) and the [[Taku people|Taku Tlingit]] (Tʼaaḵu Ḵwáan:) along the [[Taku River]].

Inland, the Tlingit occupied areas along the major rivers that pierce the [[Coast Mountains]] and [[Saint Elias Mountains]] and flow into the [[Pacific]], including the [[Alsek River|Alsek]], [[Tatshenshini River|Tatshenshini]], [[Chilkat River|Chilkat]], [[Taku River|Taku]], and [[Stikine River|Stikine]] rivers. With regular travel up these rivers, the Tlingit developed extensive trade networks with [[Athabascan]] tribes of the interior, and commonly intermarried with them. From this regular travel and trade, a few relatively large populations of Tlingit settled around [[Atlin Lake|Atlin]], [[Teslin Lake|Teslin]], and [[Tagish Lake]]s, whose headwaters flow from areas near the headwaters of the Taku River.

Delineating the modern territory of the Tlingit is complicated because they are spread across the border between the United States and Canada, they lack designated reservations, other complex legal and political concerns make the situation confusing, and there is a relatively high level of mobility among the population. They also overlap in territory with various [[Athabascan|Athabascan peoples]], such as the [[Tahltan]], [[Kaska]] and [[Tagish]]. In Canada, the modern communities of [[Atlin, British Columbia]] (Taku River Tlingit),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trtfn.com/ Taku River Tlingit]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teslin, Yukon]] ([[Teslin Tlingit Council]]), and [[Carcross, Yukon]] ([[Carcross/Tagish First Nation]]) have [[Indian reserve|reserves]] and are the representative Interior Tlingit populations.&lt;ref name=lingit/&gt;

The territory occupied by the modern Tlingit people in Alaska is not restricted to particular [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s, unlike most tribes in the lower contiguous 48 states. This is the result of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA), which established regional corporations throughout Alaska with complex portfolios of land ownership rather than bounded reservations administered by tribal governments. The corporation in the Tlingit region is [[Sealaska Corporation]], which serves the Tlingit as well as the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Tsimshian]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealaska.com/page/home|title=Sealaska Corporation|website=sealaska.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tlingit people as a whole participate in the commercial economy of Alaska. As a consequence, they live in typically American nuclear family households with private ownership of housing and land. Many also possess land allotments from Sealaska or from earlier distributions predating ANCSA. Despite the legal and political complexities, the territory historically occupied by the Tlingit can be reasonably designated as their modern homeland. Tlingit people today consider the land from around [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]] south through the [[Alaskan Panhandle]], and including the lakes in the Canadian interior, as being ''Lingít Aaní'', the Land of the Tlingit.

[[File:Hoonah.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoonah, Alaska]], a traditional Tlingit village near [[Glacier Bay]], home of the ''Xúnaa Kháawu'']]
The extant Tlingit territory can be roughly divided into four major sections, paralleling ecological, linguistic, and cultural divisions:

*The Southern Tlingit occupy the region south of [[Frederick Sound]], and live in the northernmost reaches of the [[Western Red cedar]] forest. 
*Northern Tinglit live north of Frederick Sound to Cape Spencer, and including [[Glacier Bay]] and the [[Lynn Canal]]; they occupy the warmest and richest of the [[Sitka Spruce]] and [[Western Hemlock]] forests. 
*The Inland Tlingit live along large interior lakes and the drainage of the Taku River as well as in the southern [[Yukon]], and subsist in a manner similar to their Athabascan neighbors in the mixed [[spruce]] [[taiga]]. 
*The Gulf Coast Tlingit live along a narrow strip of coastline backed by steep mountains and extensive glaciers, north of Cape Spencer, and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] to [[Controller Bay]] and [[Kayak Island]]. Their territory can be battered by Pacific storms.

The trade and cultural interactions between each of these Tlingit groups and their disparate neighbors, the differences in food harvest practices, and dialectical differences in language contribute to these identifications. These academic classifications are supported by similar self-identification among the Tlingit.

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of the Tlingit}}
The Tlingit culture is multifaceted and complex, a characteristic of Northwest Pacific Coast people with access to easily exploited rich resources. In Tlingit culture a heavy emphasis is placed upon family and kinship, and on a rich tradition of oratory. Wealth and economic power are important indicators of rank, but so is generosity and proper behavior, all signs of &quot;good breeding&quot; and ties to aristocracy. Art and spirituality are incorporated in nearly all areas of Tlingit culture, with even everyday objects such as spoons and storage boxes decorated and imbued with spiritual power and historical beliefs of the Tlingits.

Tlingit society is divided into two [[Moiety (kinship)|moieties]], the Raven and the Eagle. These in turn are divided into numerous [[clans]], which are subdivided into lineages or house groups. They have a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance passed through the mother's line. These groups have heraldic crests, which are displayed on [[totem pole]]s, [[canoe]]s, feast dishes, house posts, weavings, jewelry, and other art forms.&lt;ref name=p210/&gt; The Tlingits pass down at.oow(s) or blankets that represented trust. Only a Tlingit can inherit one but they can also pass it down to someone they trust, who becomes responsible for caring for it but does not rightfully own it.

==Philosophy and religion==

[[File:Box drum kóok gaaw NMNH.jpg|thumb| ''Kóok gaaw,'' box drum, late 19th century. Image is of a sea wolf ([[orca]]).]]

Tlingit thought and belief, although never formally codified, was historically a fairly well organized philosophical and religious system whose basic axioms shaped the way Tlingit people viewed and interacted with the world around them. Tlingits were traditionally [[animist]]s, and hunters ritually purified themselves before hunting animals. [[Shaman]]s, primarily men, cured diseases, influenced weather, aided in hunting, predicted the future, and protected people against witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker, 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1886 and 1895, in the face of their shamans' inability to treat Old World diseases including [[smallpox]], many Tlingit people converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, 241&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] missionaries had translated their liturgy into the Tlingit language. It has been argued that they saw [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] as a way of resisting assimilation to the &quot;American way of life,&quot; which was associated with [[Presbyterianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kan, Sergei. 1999. Memory eternal: Tlingit culture and Russian Orthodox Christianity through two centuries. P.xix-xxii&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of [[Christianity]], the Tlingit belief system began to erode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memory Eternal: Tlingit Culture and Russian Orthodox Christianity through Two Centuries|last=Kan|first=Sergei|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1999|isbn=9780295805344|location=Seattle|pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some young Tlingits look back towards their traditional tribal religions and worldview for inspiration, security, and a sense of identity. While many elders converted to Christianity, contemporary Tlingit &quot;reconcile Christianity and the 'traditional culture.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WIKITONGUES- Lgeik'i and Naakil.aan speaking Lingít.webm|thumb|Two Tlingit speakers, recorded in the [[United States]].]]
The Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada speak the [[Tlingit language]] (Lingít {{IPA-ath|ɬiŋkít|}}),&lt;ref name=lingit/&gt; which is a branch of the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené language family]]. Lingít has a complex [[grammar]] and sound system and also uses certain [[phonemes]] unheard in almost any other language.

Tlingit has an estimated 200 to 400 native speakers in the United States and 100 speakers in Canada.&lt;ref name=lingit/&gt; The speakers are bilingual or near-bilingual in English. Tribes, institutions, and linguists are expending extensive effort into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and its culture. [[Sealaska]] Heritage Institute, [[Goldbelt Heritage Institute]] and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]] have Tlingit language programs, and community classes are held in [[Klukwan]] and [[Angoon]].&lt;ref name=lingit/&gt;

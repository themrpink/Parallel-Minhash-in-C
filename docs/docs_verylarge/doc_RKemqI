===Origin and popularity===
[[File:Polka (NYPL b12147626-5094855).jpg|thumb|Polka, c. 1840]]
The beginning of the propagation of dance and accompanying music called polka is generally attributed to a young woman, Anna Slezáková (born Anna Chadimová). The music teacher Josef Neruda noticed her dancing in an unusual way to accompany a local folk song called &quot;Strýček Nimra koupil šimla&quot;, or &quot;Uncle Nimra Bought a White Horse&quot;, in 1830. She is said to have called the dance ''Maděra'' because of its liveliness. The dance was further propagated by Neruda, who  put the tune to paper and taught other young men to dance it.&lt;ref name=zibrt/&gt; [[Čeněk Zíbrt]] notices that a common claim that the events happened in [[Týnec nad Labem]], [[Bohemia]], in 1834 is incorrect. Zibrt writes that when he published this traditional story in 1894 in ''[[Narodni Listy]]'' newspaper, he received a good deal of feedback from eyewitnesses. In particular, he wrote that according to further witness, the originating event actually happened in 1830, in [[Kostelec nad Labem]], where she worked as a housemaid. Zíbrt writes that he published the first version of the story (with incorrect place name) in ''Bohemia'' (June 5, 1844), from where it was reprinted all over Europe and in the United States.&lt;ref name=zibrt/&gt; Zíbrt also wrote that simple Czech folk said they knew and danced polka long before the nobles got hold of it, i.e., it is a truly folk Czech dance.&lt;ref name=zibrt/&gt;

By 1835, this dance had spread to the ballrooms of [[Prague]]. From there, it spread to Vienna by 1839,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutdanceschools.com/dance/education/history/polka.asp |title=History of polka |publisher=www.com |accessdate=24 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218232019/http://www.aboutdanceschools.com/dance/education/history/polka.asp |archive-date=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1840 was introduced in Paris by Raab, a Prague dance instructor.

It was so well received by both dancers and dance masters in Paris that its popularity was referred to as &quot;polkamania.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Polkamania ... has raged very fiercely amongst us, indeed all over London this year.&quot; Letter by E.J.Knox,14 August 1844: quoted in A. E. Blake, ''Memoirs of a Vanished Generation ...'', London (1909) viii, 217&lt;/ref&gt; The dance soon spread to London and was introduced to America in 1844. It remained a popular ballroom dance until the late 19th century, when it gave way to the two-step and new ragtime dances.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Polka dancing enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after World War II, when many Polish refugees moved to the US, adopting this Bohemian style as a cultural dance. Polka dances are still held on a weekly basis across many parts of the US with significant populations of central European origin. It was also found in parts of South America.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Styles==
{{refimprove-section|date=January 2018}}
[[Image:Polka dance pattern.png|thumb|right|240px|Polka [[rhythm]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Blatter&quot;&gt;Blatter, Alfred (2007). ''Revisiting music theory: a guide to the practice'', p.28. {{ISBN|0-415-97440-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are various styles of contemporary polka besides the original Czech dance, which is still the chief dance at any formal or countryside ball in the Czech Republic.

One of the types found in the United States is the North American &quot;Polish-style polka,&quot; which has roots in [[Chicago]], with large Czech and Polish minorities; two sub-styles are &quot;The Chicago [[Honky]]&quot; (using [[clarinet]] and one [[trumpet]]) and &quot;Chicago Push&quot; featuring the [[accordion]], [[Chemnitzer concertina|Chemnitzer]] and Star concertinas, upright bass or [[bass guitar]], drums, and (almost always) two trumpets.  North American &quot;[[Slovenian-style polka]]&quot; is fast and features piano [[accordion]], chromatic accordion, and/or diatonic button box accordion; it is associated with [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. North American &quot;Dutchmen-style&quot; features an [[oom-pah]] sound often with a [[tuba]] and [[banjo]], and has roots in the American [[Midwest]].  &quot;[[Conjunto]]-style&quot; polkas have roots in northern [[Mexico]] and [[Texas]], and are also called &quot;[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]]&quot;. Traditional dances from this region reflect the influence of polka-dancing European immigrants. In the 1980s and 1990s, several American bands began to combine polka with various [[rock and roll|rock]] styles (sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Punk rock|punk]] polka&quot;), &quot;[[alternative rock|alternative]] polka&quot;, or &quot;[[San Francisco]]-style&quot;.

There also exist [[Curaçao]]an polkas, Peruvian polkas (becoming very popular in [[Lima]]). In the [[pampas]] of Argentina, the &quot;polca&quot; has a very fast beat with a {{music|time|3|4}} time signature. Instruments used are: acoustic guitar (usually six strings, but sometimes seven strings), electric or acoustic bass (sometimes fretless), accordion (sometimes piano accordion, sometimes button accordion), and sometimes some percussion is used. The lyrics always praise the [[gaucho]] warriors from the past or tell about the life of the [[gaucho]] campeiros (provincial gauchos who keep the common way). The polka was very popular in South and Southwest of Brazil, where it was mixed with other European and African styles to create the [[Choro]].
The polka (''polca'' in the [[Irish language]]) is also one of the most popular traditional folk dances in [[Ireland]], particularly in [[Sliabh Luachra]], a district that spans the borders of counties [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comhaltas.ie/glossary|title=Comhaltas: Glossary|author=Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the figures of Irish [[set dance]]s, which developed from Continental [[quadrilles]], are danced to polkas. Introduced to Ireland in the late 19th century, there are today hundreds of Irish polka tunes, which are most frequently played on the fiddle or button accordion. The Irish polka is dance music form in {{music|time|2|4}}, typically 32 bars in length and subdivided into four parts, each 8 bars in length and played AABB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtune.info/rhythm/|title=irishtune.info Rhythm Definitions - Irish Traditional Music Tune Index|author=Alan Ng|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vallely, F. (1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music.

Bowing Styles in Irish Fiddle Playing. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish polkas are typically played fast, at over 130 bpm, and are typically played with an off-beat accent.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, P. (1995).

Music Sales Corporation: New York, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The polka also migrated to the Nordic countries where it is known by a variety of names in Denmark (galopp, hopsa), Estonia (polka), Finland (pariisipolkka, polkka), Iceland, Norway (galopp, hamborgar, hopsa/hopsar, parisarpolka, polka, polkett, skotsk) and Sweden (polka). The beats are not as heavy as those from Central Europe and the dance steps and holds also have variations not found further south. The polka is considered a part of the [[gammeldans]] tradition of music and dance. While it is nowhere near as old as the older Nordic dance and music traditions, there are still hundreds of polka tunes in each of the Nordic countries. They are played by solo instrumentalists or by bands/ensembles, most frequently with lead instruments such as [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], diatonic accordion, [[hardingfele]] and [[nyckelharpa]].

==The polka in the classical repertoire==
{{refimprove-section|date=September 2020}}
[[File:Polka 1848.jpg|thumb|240px|Polka]]

[[Bedřich Smetana]] incorporated the polka in his opera ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' ({{lang-cz|Prodaná nevěsta}}) and in particular, Act 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.operanorth.co.uk/blogs/the-bartered-bride-five-fascinating-facts|title=The Bartered Bride: Five fascinating facts|website=Opera North|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/07/22/bartered-bride|title=Smetana's 'Bartered Bride' Gives A Taste Of The Czech Countryside (In Boston)|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the polka is Bohemian in origin, most dance music composers in [[Vienna]] (the capital of the vast [[Habsburg]] [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which was the cultural centre for music from all over the empire) composed polkas and included the dance in their repertoire at some point in their careers. The [[Strauss]] family in Vienna, for example, while better-known for their [[waltz]]es, also composed polkas that have survived. [[Josef Lanner]] and other Viennese composers in the 19th century also wrote polkas to satisfy the demands of the dance-music-loving Viennese. In [[France]], another dance-music composer, [[Emile Waldteufel]], wrote polkas in addition to waltzes.

The polka evolved during the same period into different styles and tempi. In principle, the polka written in the 19th century has a four-theme structure; themes 1A and 1B as well as a 'Trio' section of a further two themes. The 'Trio' usually has an 'Intrada' to form a break between the two sections. The feminine and graceful 'French polka' (polka française) is slower in tempo and is more measured in its gaiety. Johann Strauss II's Annen Polka op. 114, [[Demolirer]] polka op. 269, the [[Im Krapfenwald'l]] op. 336 and the [[Bitte schön!]] polka op. 372 are examples of this type of polka. The [[polka-mazurka]] is also another variation of the polka, being in the tempo of a [[mazurka]] but danced in a similar manner as the polka. The final category of the polka form around that time is the ''polka schnell'', which is a fast polka or ''[[galop]]''. [[Eduard Strauss]] is better known for this last category, as he penned the 'Bahn Frei' polka op. 45 and other examples. Earlier, [[Johann Strauss I]] and Josef Lanner wrote polkas designated as a ''galop'' (quick tempo) or as a regular polka that may not fall into any of the categories above.

The polka was a further source of inspiration for the Strauss family in Vienna when Johann II and Josef Strauss wrote one for plucked string instruments ([[pizzicato]]) only, the &quot;Pizzicato Polka&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/pizzicato-polka-for-orchestra-op-234-mc0002362796|title=Pizzicato Polka for orchestra, Op. {{!}} Details {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johann II later wrote a &quot;New Pizzicato Polka&quot; (Neu pizzicato-polka), opus 449, culled from music of his [[operetta]] ''Fürstin Ninetta''. Much earlier, he also wrote a &quot;joke-polka&quot; ([[German language|German]] ''scherz-polka'') entitled &quot;Champagne Polka&quot;, opus 211, which evokes the uncorking of champagne bottles.

Other composers who wrote music in the style of the polka were [[Jaromír Weinberger]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

[[Cleveland International Records]] had another polka Grammy winner with [[Brave Combo]]'s ''[[Polkasonic]]'' in 1999. Other polka [[Grammy]] nominees included [[Frankie Yankovic]]'s ''America's Favorites'' (1986), ''Songs of the Polka King Vol. I'', ''Songs of the Polka King Vol. II'' (1997), and Brave Combo's ''Kick Ass Polkas'' (2000). [[Jimmy Sturr]] &amp; His Orchestra is one of the most popular polka bands in America, having won 18 of the 24 awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Polka Album]].

''Polka Varieties'' was an hour-long television program of polka music originating from [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The show, which aired in several U.S. cities, ran from 1956 until 1983. At that time, it was the only television program for this type of music in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/about_us/paul-wilcox,-host-of-'polka-varieties'-in-cleveland,-dies-at-age-of-85|title=Paul Wilcox, host of 'Polka Varieties' in Cleveland, dies at age of 85|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728050626/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/about_us/paul-wilcox,-host-of-'polka-varieties'-in-cleveland,-dies-at-age-of-85|archive-date=28 July 2010|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of polka shows originated from the [[Buffalo Niagara Region]] in the 1960s, including [[WKBW-TV]]'s ''Polka Time'', which was hosted for its first half-year on air by Frankie Yankovic, and cross-border station [[CHCH-TV]]'s ''Polka Party'', hosted by [[Walter Ostanek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenbuffalo.com/forgottenbuffalomedia/poloniamedia.html Forgotten Buffalo featuring Polonia Media].

An '''actuary''' is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of [[risk]] and uncertainty.{{sfn|BeAnActuary|2011a}} The name of the corresponding field is [[actuarial science]]. These risks can affect both sides of the [[balance sheet]] and require [[investment management|asset management]], [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]] management, and valuation skills.{{sfn|BeAnActuary|2011b}} Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms.{{sfn|Trowbridge|1989|p=7}}

While the concept of insurance dates to antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}}, {{harvnb|Loan|1992}}, {{harvnb|Lewin|2007|loc=pp. 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities.{{sfn|Heywood|1985}} Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk.{{sfn|BeAnActuary|2011c}} The [[Actuarial credentialing and exams|actual steps]] needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific; however, almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldblum|2001|p=6}}, {{harvnb|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable.{{sfn|Riley|2013}} In various studies, being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|2012}}, {{harvnb|Weber|2013}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the top 20 for most of the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CareerCast|2014}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2016}}, {{harvnb|CNN Money|2017}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: start --&gt;Actuaries use skills primarily in mathematics, particularly [[calculus]]-based [[probability]] and [[mathematical statistics]], but also [[economics]], [[computer science]], finance, and business. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance and reinsurance industries, either as staff employees or as consultants; to other businesses, including sponsors of pension plans; and to government agencies such as the [[Government Actuary's Department]] in the United Kingdom or the [[Social Security Administration]] in the United States of America. Actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner that will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}, {{harvnb|Government Actuary's Department|2015}})&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: end --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disciplines===
Most traditional actuarial disciplines fall into two main categories: life and non-life.

Life actuaries, which include health and [[pension]] actuaries, primarily deal with [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk, [[morbidity]] risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include [[life insurance]], [[Life annuity|annuities]], pensions, short and long term [[disability insurance]], health insurance, [[Medical savings account|health savings accounts]], and [[long-term care]] insurance.{{sfn|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}} In addition to these risks, social insurance programs are influenced by public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing [[demographics]], and other factors such as [[medical technology]], [[inflation]], and [[Cost-of-living index|cost of living]] considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GAO|1980}}, {{harvnb|GAO|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: start--&gt;Non-life actuaries, also known as property and casualty or general insurance actuaries, deal with both physical and legal risks that affect people or their property. Products prominent in their work include [[auto insurance]], [[home insurance|homeowners insurance]], commercial property insurance, [[workers' compensation]], [[malpractice]] insurance, [[Product liability|product liability insurance]], [[marine insurance]], [[terrorism insurance]], and other types of [[liability insurance]].{{sfn|AIA|2014}}&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: end--&gt;.

Actuaries are also called upon for their expertise in [[enterprise risk management]].{{sfn|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}} This can involve [[dynamic financial analysis]], [[Stress test (financial)|stress testing]], the formulation of corporate risk policy, and the setting up and running of corporate risk departments.{{sfn|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2011b}} Actuaries are also involved in other areas of the [[financial services]] industry, such as analysing [[securities offering]]s or [[market research]].{{sfn|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}

===Traditional employment===
On both the life and casualty sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and [[Insurance#Indemnification|reserves]] for insurance policies covering various risks.{{sfn|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014|pp. = 12–14}} On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying the probability of a loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity [[frequency distribution|distributions]] and the [[parameter]]s of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side.{{sfn|Tolley|Hickman|Lew|2012}}

Actuaries do not always attempt to predict aggregate future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called [[Retrocession (Insurance)|retrospective reinsurance]], or the development or re-pricing of new products.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Actuaries also design and maintain products and systems. They are involved in financial reporting of companies' assets and liabilities. They must communicate complex concepts to clients who may not share their language or depth of knowledge. Actuaries work under a code of ethics that covers their communications and work products.{{sfn|ASB|2013}}

===Non-traditional employment===
As an outgrowth of their more traditional roles, actuaries also work in the fields of risk management and [[enterprise risk management]] for both financial and non-financial corporations.{{sfn|D'Arcy|2005}} Actuaries in traditional roles study and use the tools and data previously in the domain of finance.{{sfn|Feldblum|2001|p=8}} The [[Basel II]] accord for financial institutions (2004), and its analogue, the [[Solvency II]] accord for insurance companies (in force since 2016), require institutions to account for [[operational risk]] separately, and in addition to, [[credit risk|credit]], [[Actuarial reserves|reserve]], [[asset]], and [[insolvency]] risk. Actuarial skills are well suited to this environment because of their training in analyzing various forms of risk, and judging the potential for upside gain, as well as downside loss associated with these forms of risk.{{sfn|D'Arcy|2005}}

&lt;!-- First two are from Mungan, last two are from Stefan --&gt;Actuaries are also involved in [[investment]] advice and [[asset management]], and can be general business managers and [[chief financial officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mungan|2002}}, {{harvnb|Stefan|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyze business prospects with their financial skills in valuing or discounting risky future cash flows, and apply their pricing expertise from insurance to other lines of business. For example, insurance [[securitization]] requires both actuarial and finance skills.{{sfn|Krutov|2006}} Actuaries also act as [[expert witness]]es by applying their analysis in court trials to estimate the economic value of losses such as lost profits or lost wages.{{sfn|Wagner|2006}}

==History==
[[File:Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838), American mathematician and actuary.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white picture of Nathaniel Bowditch, an eighteenth century American actuary|Mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]] was one of America's first insurance actuaries.]]

===Need for insurance===
The basic requirements of communal interests gave rise to risk sharing since the dawn of civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After [[barter (economics)|barter]] came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, which exposed them to [[financial risk]]. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society.{{sfn|Lewin|2007|p=3}}

===Early attempts===
In the ancient world there was not always room for the sick, suffering, disabled, aged, or the poor—these were often not part of the [[Collective consciousness|cultural consciousness]] of societies.{{sfn|Perkins|1995}} Early methods of protection, aside from the normal support of the extended family, involved charity; religious organizations or neighbors would collect for the destitute and needy. By the middle of the 3rd century, charitable operations in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] supported 1,500 suffering people.{{sfn|Perkins|1995}} Charitable protection remains an active form of support in the modern era,{{sfn|GivingUSA|2009}} but receiving charity is uncertain and often accompanied by [[social stigma]].{{sfn|Lewin|2007|p=3}}

Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions did arise in antiquity.{{sfn|Thucydides}} Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund.{{sfn|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}} Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and [[Life insurance|assurance]] pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society.{{sfn|Loan|1992}}

Non-life insurance started as a hedge against loss of cargo during sea travel. Anecdotal reports of such guarantees occur in the writings of [[Demosthenes]], who lived in the 4th century BCE.{{sfn|Lewin|2007|pp=3–4}} The earliest records of an official non-life insurance policy come from [[Sicily]], where there is record of a 14th-century contract to insure a shipment of wheat.{{sfn|Sweeting|2011|p=14}} In 1350, Lenardo Cattaneo assumed &quot;all risks from act of God, or of man, and from perils of the sea&quot; that may occur to a shipment of wheat from Sicily to Tunis up to a maximum of 300 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s. For this he was paid a premium of 18%.{{sfn|Lewin|2007|p=4}}

The U.S. began stockpile reductions in the 1980s with the removal of outdated munitions and destroying its entire stock of [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate]] (BZ or Agent 15) at the beginning of 1988. In June 1990 the [[Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System]] began destruction of chemical agents stored on the [[Johnston Atoll]] in the Pacific, seven years before the Chemical Weapons Treaty came into effect. In 1986 President Ronald Reagan made an agreement with the Chancellor, Helmut Kohl to remove the U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons from Germany. In 1990, as part of [[Operation Steel Box]], two ships were loaded with over 100,000 shells containing [[Sarin]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] were taken from the U.S. Army weapons storage depots such as Miesau and then-classified FSTS (Forward Storage / Transportation Sites) and transported from Bremerhaven, Germany to Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, a 46-day nonstop journey.&lt;ref&gt;The Oceans and Environmental Security: Shared U.S. and Russian Perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1991, President [[George H. W. Bush]] committed the United States to destroying all of its chemical weapons and renounced the right to chemical weapon retaliation. In 1993, the United States signed the Chemical Weapons Treaty, which required the destruction of all chemical weapon agents, dispersal systems, and production facilities by April 2012. The U.S. prohibition on the transport of chemical weapons has meant that destruction facilities had to be constructed at each of the U.S.'s nine storage facilities. The U.S. met the first three of the four deadlines set out in the treaty, destroying 45% of its stockpile of chemical weapons by 2007. Due to the destruction of chemical weapons, under the United States policy of Proportional Response, an attack upon the United States or its Allies would trigger a force-equivalent counter-attack. Since the United States only maintains nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction, it is the stated policy that the United States will regard all WMD attacks (Biological, chemical, or nuclear) as a nuclear attack and will respond to such an attack with a nuclear strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html |title=Not with Impunity: Assessing US Policy for Retaliating to a Chemical or Biological Attack |publisher=Airpower.maxwell.af.mil |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203201729/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, stockpiles have been eliminated at 7 of the 9 chemical weapons depots and 89.75% of the 1997 stockpile has been destroyed by the treaty deadline of April 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Complete&quot;&gt;[http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?DocID=003683880 Army Agency Completes Mission to Destroy Chemical Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915082045/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?DocID=003683880 |date=September 15, 2012 }}, USCMA, January 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Destruction will not begin at the two remaining depots until after the treaty deadline and will use neutralization, instead of incineration.

{{Musical instruments sidebar}}

'''String instruments''', '''stringed instruments''', or '''chordophones''' are [[musical instrument]]s that produce sound from [[vibrating strings]] when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner.

Musicians play some string instruments by plucking the [[String (music)|strings]] with their fingers or a [[plectrum]]—and others by hitting the strings with a light wooden hammer or by rubbing the strings with a [[bow (music)|bow]]. In some [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments, such as the [[harpsichord]], the musician presses a key that plucks the string.

With bowed instruments, the player pulls a rosined horsehair bow across the strings, causing them to vibrate. With a [[hurdy-gurdy]], the musician cranks a wheel whose rosined edge touches the strings. 

Bowed instruments include the [[string section]] instruments of the [[Classical music]] [[orchestra]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]]) and a number of other instruments (e.g., [[viol]]s and [[Viol|gambas]] used in [[early music]] from the [[Baroque music]] era and [[fiddle]]s used in many types of [[folk music]]). All of the bowed string instruments can also be plucked with the fingers, a technique called &quot;[[pizzicato]]&quot;. A wide variety of techniques are used to sound notes on the [[electric guitar]], including plucking with the fingernails or a plectrum, strumming and even &quot;[[tapping]]&quot; on the fingerboard and using [[feedback (guitar)|feedback]] from a loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[guitar amplifier]] to produce a sustained sound. Some types of string instrument are mainly plucked, such as the [[harp]] and the [[electric bass]]. In the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] scheme of [[musical instrument classification]], used in [[organology]], string instruments are called [[chordophone]]s. Other examples include the [[sitar]], [[rebab]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], and [[bouzouki]].

In most string instruments, the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the instrument, which often incorporates some sort of hollow or enclosed area. The body of the instrument also vibrates, along with the air inside it. The vibration of the body of the instrument and the enclosed hollow or chamber make the vibration of the string more audible to the performer and audience. The body of most string instruments is hollow. Some, however—such as [[electric guitar]] and other instruments that rely on electronic amplification—may have a solid wood body.

Dating to around c. 13,000–BC, a cave painting in the [[Trois Frères]] cave in France depicts what some believe is a [[musical bow]], a hunting bow used as a single-stringed musical instrument.&lt;ref name=vanCampen&gt;{{cite web | last1= Campen | first1= Ank van | title= The music-bow from prehistory till today | url= http://www.harphistory.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=17&amp;lang=en | website= HarpHistory.info | access-date= March 26, 2015 | quote= A cave-painting in the &quot;Trois Frères&quot; cave in France dating from about 15,000 years ago.

Another innovation occurred when the bow harp was straightened out and a [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] used to lift the strings off the [[Neck (music)|stick-neck]], creating the lute.&lt;ref name=Dumbrillp308&gt;{{harvnb|Dumbrill|1998|pp=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This picture of musical bow to harp bow is theory and has been contested. In 1965 Franz Jahnel wrote his criticism stating that the early ancestors of plucked instruments are not currently known.&lt;ref name=Jahnel&gt;{{cite book |last=Jahnel |first=Franz |date=1965 |title=Manual of Guitar Technology: The History and Technology of Plucked String Instruments (Fachbuchreihe Das Musikinstrument, Bd. 37)  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QTfTINjQtUC&amp;q=balkan%20mandolin&amp;pg=PA15 |location= |publisher= |page=15 |isbn=0-933224-99-0|quote=There have been some uncertain presumptions concerning the &quot;invention&quot; of the bowed harp...The &quot;musical bow&quot; conjectured by many music scholars is not definitely recognizable in any cave paintings. The fact that some African negroes held the end of their bow-shaped harp in their mouths in order to improve the tone...should not be taken as proof that the first European bowmen were also conversant with the musical bow. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that the harp bow was a long cry from the sophistication of the civilizations of western Asia in 4000 BC that took the primitive technology and created &quot;technically and artistically well-made harps, lyres, citharas, and lutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jahnel/&gt;
 
Archaeological digs have identified some of the earliest stringed instruments in  [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n sites, like the [[lyres of Ur]], which include artifacts over three thousand years old. The development of [[lyre]] instruments required the [[music technology (mechanical)|technology]] to create a tuning mechanism to tighten and loosen the string tension. Lyres with wooden bodies and strings used for plucking or playing with a bow represent key instruments that point towards later harps and violin-type instruments; moreover, Indian instruments from 500 BC have been discovered with anything from 7 to 21 strings.

Musicologists have put forth examples of that 4th-century BC technology, looking at engraved images that have survived.

During the [[medieval era]], instrument development varied in different regions of the world. Middle Eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs in terms of shape and strings, with a half a pear shape using three strings. Early versions of the violin and fiddle, by comparison, emerged in Europe through instruments such as the [[gittern]], a four-stringed precursor to the guitar, and basic [[lute]]s. These instruments typically used catgut (animal intestine) and other materials, including silk, for their strings.

[[File:Viol, fidel and rebec.jpg|thumb|Viol, [[vielle|fidel]] and rebec (from left to right) on display at ''Amakusa Korejiyokan'' in Amakusa, Kumamoto, Japan]]
String instrument design refined during the [[Renaissance]] and into the [[Baroque period]] (1600–1750) of musical history. [[Violins]] and [[guitars]] became more consistent in design and were roughly similar to acoustic guitars of the 2000s. The violins of the [[Renaissance]] featured intricate woodwork and stringing, while more elaborate bass instruments such as the bandora were produced alongside quill-plucked [[cittern]]s, and Spanish body guitars.

In the 19th century, string instruments were made more widely available through mass production, with wood string instruments a key part of orchestras – cellos, violas, and upright basses, for example, were now standard instruments for chamber ensembles and smaller orchestras. At the same time, the 19th-century guitar became more typically associated with six string models, rather than traditional five string versions.

Major changes to string instruments in the 20th century primarily involved innovations in electronic [[instrument amplification]] and electronic music – electric violins were available by the 1920s, and were an important part of emerging jazz music trends in the United States. The [[acoustic guitar]] was widely used in [[blues]] and [[jazz]], but as an acoustic instrument, it was not loud enough to be a solo instrument, so these genres mostly used it as an [[accompaniment]] [[rhythm section]] instrument. In [[big band]]s of the 1920s, the [[acoustic guitar]] played backing chords, but it was not loud enough to play solos like the [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]]. The development of guitar amplifiers, which contained a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]] in a [[speaker enclosure|wooden cabinet]], let [[jazz guitar]]ists play solos and be heard over a big band. The development of the [[electric guitar]] provided guitarists with an instrument that was built to connect to guitar amplifiers. Electric guitars have [[magnetic pickup]]s, [[potentiometer|volume control knob]]s and an output jack.

In the 1960s, larger, more powerful guitar amplifiers were developed, called &quot;stacks&quot;. These powerful amplifiers enabled guitarists to perform in rock bands that played in large venues such as stadiums and outdoor music festivals (e.g., [[Woodstock Music Festival]]). Along with the development of guitar amplifiers, a large range of electronic [[effects unit]]s, many in small [[stompbox]] pedals were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[fuzz pedal]]s, [[flanger]]s, and [[Phaser (effect)|phasers]]  enabling performers to create unique new sounds during the [[psychedelic rock]] era. Breakthroughs in electric guitar and basses technologies and playing styles enabled major breakthroughs in pop and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. The distinctive sound of the amplified [[electric guitar]] was the centerpiece of new genres of music such as [[blues rock]] and [[Jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]]. The sonic power of the loudly amplified, highly [[distortion (music)|distorted]] electric guitar was to key element of the early [[heavy metal music]], with the distorted guitar being used in [[lead guitar]] roles, and with [[power chord]]s as a [[rhythm guitar]].

The ongoing use of electronic amplification and effects units in string instruments, ranging from traditional instruments like the violin to the new electric guitar, added variety to [[contemporary classical music]] performances, and enabled experimentation in the dynamic and timbre (tone colour) range of orchestras, bands, and solo performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;mp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Chanan|title=Musica Practica: The Social Practice of Western Music from Gregorian Chant to Postmodernism|year=1994|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-005-4|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

String instruments can be divided in three groups
;[[Lute]]s : Instruments that support the strings via a [[Neck (music)|neck]] and a '''bout''' (&quot;'''gourd'''&quot;), for instance a guitar, a violin, or a [[baglama|saz]]
;[[Harp]]s : Instruments that contain the strings within a frame
;[[Zither]]s : Instruments that have the strings mounted on a body, frame or tube, such as a [[guqin]], a [[cimbalom]], an [[autoharp]], [[harpsichord]], a [[piano]], or a [[valiha]]

It is also possible to divide the instruments into categories focused on how the instrument is played.

===Playing techniques===

All string instruments produce sound from one or more [[vibrating string]]s, transferred to the air by the body of the instrument (or by a pickup in the case of electronically amplified instruments). They are usually categorised by the  technique used to make the strings vibrate (or by the primary technique, in the case of instruments where more than one may apply.) The three most common techniques are plucking, bowing, and striking. An important difference between bowing and plucking is that in the former the phenomenon is periodic so that the overtones are kept in a strictly harmonic relationship to the fundamental.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== Plucking ====
{{main|Plucked string instrument}}

Plucking is a method of playing on instruments such as the [[veena]], banjo, [[ukulele]], guitar, harp, [[lute]], [[mandolin]], [[oud]], and [[sitar]], using either a finger, thumb, or quills (now plastic plectra) to pluck the strings.

Instruments normally played by bowing (see below) may also be plucked, a technique referred to by the Italian term ''[[pizzicato]]''.

==== Bowing ====
{{main|Bowed string instrument}}

[[Bowing (music)|Bowing]] (Italian: ''arco'') is a method used in some string instruments, including the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and the [[double bass]] (of the [[violin family]]), and the old [[viol]] family. The [[bow (music)|bow]] consists of a stick with a &quot;ribbon&quot; of parallel horse tail hairs stretched between its ends. The hair is coated with [[rosin]] so it can grip the string; moving the hair across a string causes a [[stick-slip phenomenon]], making the string [[vibration|vibrate]], and prompting the instrument to emit sound. Darker grades of rosin grip well in cool, dry climates, but may be too sticky in warmer, more humid weather. Violin and viola players generally use harder, lighter-colored rosin than players of lower-pitched instruments, who tend to favor darker, softer rosin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Heather K. |last=Scott |title=The Differences Between Dark and Amber Rosin |url=http://stringsmagazine.com/the-differences-between-dark-and-amber-rosin/ |magazine=Strings Magazine |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=February 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ravanahatha]] is one of the oldest string instruments. Ancestors of the modern bowed string instruments are the [[rebab]] of the Islamic Empires, the Persian [[kamanche]] and the [[Byzantine lira]]. Other bowed instruments are the [[rebec]], [[hardingfele]], [[nyckelharpa]], [[kokyū]], [[erhu]], [[igil]], [[sarangi]], [[morin khuur]], and [[K'ni]]. The [[hurdy-gurdy]] is bowed by a wheel. Rarely, the [[bowed guitar|guitar has been played with a bow]] (rather than plucked) for unique effects.

==== Striking ====
The third common method of sound production in stringed instruments is to strike the string. The piano and [[hammered dulcimer]] use this method of sound production. Even though the piano strikes the strings, the use of felt hammers means that the sound that is produced can nevertheless be mellow and rounded, in contrast to the sharp attack produced when a very hard hammer strikes the strings.

Violin family string instrument players are occasionally instructed to strike the string with the stick of the bow, a technique called ''[[col legno]]''. This yields a percussive sound along with the pitch of the note. A well-known use of ''col legno'' for orchestral strings is [[Gustav Holst]]'s &quot;Mars&quot; movement from ''[[The Planets]]'' suite.

==== Other methods ====
The [[aeolian harp]] employs a very unusual method of sound production: the strings are excited by the movement of the air.

Some instruments that have strings have an attached [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] that the player presses keys on to trigger a mechanism that sounds the strings, instead of directly manipulating the strings. These include the [[piano]], the [[clavichord]], and the harpsichord. With these [[keyboard instrument]]s, strings are occasionally plucked or bowed by hand. Modern [[composer]]s such as [[Henry Cowell]] wrote music that requires that the player reach inside the piano and pluck the strings directly, &quot;bow&quot; them with bow hair wrapped around the strings, or play them by rolling the bell of a [[brass instrument]] such as a [[trombone]] on the array of strings. However, these are relatively rarely used special techniques.

Other keyed string instruments, small enough for a strolling musician to play, include the plucked [[autoharp]], the bowed [[nyckelharpa]], and the hurdy-gurdy, which is played by cranking a rosined wheel.

Steel-stringed instruments (such as the guitar, bass, violin, etc.) can be played using a magnetic field. An [[E-Bow]] is a small hand-held battery-powered device that magnetically excites the strings of an electric string instrument to provide a sustained, singing tone reminiscent of a held bowed violin note.

In March 2019 [[digital intermediate]] colourist Skip Kimball posted a photo to his [[Instagram]] suggesting that he was working on the film.  In November 2018 Cameron told ''Empire'' magazine that a Blu-ray transfer was &quot;complete for my review&quot; and he hoped it would be ready before 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/the-abyss-blu-ray/ |title=Is ‘The Abyss’ Blu-ray Finally Being Released, and in 4K? |last=Evangelista |first=Chris |date=March 5, 2019 |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |access-date=15 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was however before [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney's acquisition of Fox]], so as of 2020, there has been no information about the blu-ray release.

==Adaptations==
Science-fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]] was hired to write a [[novelization]] of the film based on the screenplay and discussions with Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Books By Orson Scott Card - The Abyss |url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/abyss.shtml |website=Hatrack River |access-date=16 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135053/http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/abyss.shtml |archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey, and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit on the far side of the moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many of the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' aspects of the film.

A licensed [[interactive fiction]] video game based on the script was being developed for [[Infocom]] by [[Bob Bates]], but was cancelled when Infocom was shut down by its then-parent company [[Activision]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ACG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/168 |title=Bob Bates interview |last=Jong |first=Philip |date=12 February 2001 |website=Adventure Classic Gaming.com |access-date=27 October 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204141859/http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/168/ |archive-date=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sound Source Interactive]] later created an action video game entitled ''The Abyss: Incident at Europa''.

[[File:Dedekind cut- square root of two.png| thumb| right| 350px| Dedekind used his cut to construct the [[irrational number|irrational]], [[real number]]s.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Dedekind cuts''', named after German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]] but previously considered by [[Joseph Bertrand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertrand|first=Joseph|title=Traité d'Arithmétique |url = https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77735p/f209.image.r=%22joseph%20bertrand%22 |year=1849|at=page 203|quote=An incommensurable number can be defined only by indicating how the magnitude it expresses can be formed by means of unity.

A Dedekind cut is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of the rational numbers into two non-empty [[Set (mathematics) | sets]] ''A'' and ''B'', such that all elements of ''A'' are less than all elements of ''B'', and ''A'' contains no [[greatest element]]. The set ''B'' may or may not have a smallest element among the rationals. If ''B'' has a smallest element among the rationals, the cut corresponds to that rational. Otherwise, that cut defines a unique irrational number which, loosely speaking, fills the &quot;gap&quot; between ''A'' and&amp;nbsp;''B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dedekind |first=Richard |title=Continuity and Irrational Numbers |url=http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m446-05b/dedekind-book.pdf#page=15 |year=1872|at=Section IV |quote=Whenever, then, we have to do with a cut produced by no rational number, we create a new ''irrational'' number, which we regard as completely defined by this cut ... . From now on, therefore, to every definite cut there corresponds a definite rational or irrational number ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''A'' contains every rational number less than the cut, and ''B'' contains every rational number greater than or equal to the cut. An irrational cut is equated to an irrational number which is in neither set. Every real number, rational or not, is equated to one and only one cut of rationals.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Dedekind cuts can be generalized from the rational numbers to any [[totally ordered set]] by defining a Dedekind cut as a partition of a totally ordered set into two non-empty parts ''A'' and ''B'', such that ''A'' is closed downwards (meaning that for all ''a'' in ''A'', ''x'' ≤ ''a'' implies that ''x'' is in ''A'' as well) and ''B'' is closed upwards, and ''A'' contains no greatest element. See also [[completeness (order theory)]].

It is straightforward to show that a Dedekind cut among the real numbers is uniquely defined by the corresponding cut among the rational numbers. Similarly, every cut of reals is identical to the cut produced by a specific real number (which can be identified as the smallest element of the ''B'' set). In other words, the [[number line]] where every [[real number]] is defined as a Dedekind cut of rationals is a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[linear continuum|continuum]] without any further gaps.

== Definition ==

A Dedekind cut is a partition of the rationals &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; into two subsets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that

# &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty.
# &lt;math&gt;A \neq \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt; y &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y \in A &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x \in A &lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;closed downwards&quot;.)
# If &lt;math&gt; x \in A &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a &lt;math&gt; y \in A &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; y &gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; does not contain a greatest element.)

By relaxing the first two requirements, we formally obtain the [[extended real number line]].

== Representations ==

It is more symmetrical to use the (''A'', ''B'') notation for Dedekind cuts, but each of ''A'' and ''B'' does determine the other. It can be a simplification, in terms of notation if nothing more, to concentrate on one &quot;half&quot; — say, the lower one — and call any downward closed set ''A'' without greatest element a &quot;Dedekind cut&quot;.

If the ordered set ''S'' is complete, then, for every Dedekind cut (''A'', ''B'') of ''S'', the set ''B'' must have a minimal element ''b'', 
hence we must have that  ''A'' is the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (&amp;minus;∞, ''b''), and ''B'' the interval [''b'', +∞).
In this case, we say that ''b'' ''is represented by'' the cut (''A'', ''B'').

The important purpose of the Dedekind cut is to work with number sets that are ''not'' complete. The cut itself can represent a number not in the original collection of numbers (most often [[rational number]]s). The cut can represent a number ''b'', even though the numbers contained in the two sets ''A'' and ''B'' do not actually include the number ''b'' that their cut represents.

For example if ''A'' and ''B'' only contain [[rational numbers]], they can still be cut at {{radic|2}} by putting every negative rational number in ''A'', along with every non-negative number whose square is less than 2; similarly ''B'' would contain every positive rational number whose square is greater than or equal to 2. Even though there is no rational value for {{sqrt|2}}, if the rational numbers are partitioned into ''A'' and ''B'' this way, the partition itself represents an [[irrational number]].

==Ordering of cuts==
Regard one Dedekind cut (''A'', ''B'') as ''less than'' another Dedekind cut (''C'', ''D'') (of the same superset) if ''A'' is a proper subset of ''C''. Equivalently, if ''D'' is a proper subset of ''B'', the cut (''A'', ''B'') is again ''less than'' (''C'', ''D''). In this way, set inclusion can be used to represent the ordering of numbers, and all other relations (''greater than'', ''less than or equal to'', ''equal to'', and so on) can be similarly created from set relations.

The set of all Dedekind cuts is itself a linearly ordered set (of sets). Moreover, the set of Dedekind cuts has the [[least-upper-bound property]], i.e., every nonempty subset of it that has any upper bound has a ''least'' upper bound.  Thus, constructing the set of Dedekind cuts serves the purpose of embedding the original ordered set ''S'', which might not have had the least-upper-bound property, within a (usually larger) linearly ordered set that does have this useful property.

==Construction of the real numbers==
{{See also|Construction of the real numbers#Construction by Dedekind cuts}}
A typical Dedekind cut of the [[rational number]]s &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; is given by the partition &lt;math&gt;(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;A = \{ a\in\mathbb{Q} : a^2 &lt; 2 \text{ or } a &lt; 0 \},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \{ b\in\mathbb{Q} : b^2 \ge 2 \text{ and } b \ge 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the second line, &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt; without any difference as there is no solution for &lt;math&gt;x^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt; is already forbidden by the first condition. This results in the equivalent expression
:&lt;math&gt;B = \{ b\in\mathbb{Q} : b^2 &gt; 2 \text{ and } b &gt; 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

This cut represents the [[irrational number]] {{sqrt|2}} in Dedekind's construction. The essential idea is that we use a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which is the set of all rational numbers whose squares are less than 2, to &quot;represent&quot; number {{sqrt|2}}, and further, by defining properly arithmetic operators over these sets (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), these sets (together with these arithmetic operations) form the familiar real numbers.

To establish this, one must show that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; really is a cut (according to the definition) and the square of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt; (please refer to the link above for the precise definition of how the multiplication of cuts are defined), is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; (note that rigorously speaking this is a cut &lt;math&gt;\{x\ |\ x \in \mathbb{Q}, x &lt; 2\}&lt;/math&gt;). To show the first part, we show that for any positive rational &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x^2 &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt;, there is a rational &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^2 &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt;. The choice &lt;math&gt;y=\frac{2x+2}{x+2}&lt;/math&gt; works, thus &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a cut. Now armed with the multiplication between cuts, it is easy to check that &lt;math&gt;A \times A \le 2&lt;/math&gt; (essentially, this is because &lt;math&gt;x \times y \le 2, \forall x, y \in A, x, y \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore to show that &lt;math&gt;A \times A = 2&lt;/math&gt;, we show that &lt;math&gt;A \times A \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, and it suffices to show that for any &lt;math&gt;r &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; r&lt;/math&gt;. For this we notice that if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0, 2-x^2=\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;2-y^2 \le \frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; constructed above, this means that we have a sequence in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; whose square can become arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, which finishes the proof.

Note that the equality {{math|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} cannot hold since [[Square root of 2#Proofs of irrationality|{{sqrt|2}} is not rational]].

==Generalizations==
A construction similar to Dedekind cuts is used for the construction of [[surreal number]]s.

===Partially ordered sets===
{{Main|Dedekind–MacNeille completion}}
More generally, if ''S'' is a [[partially ordered set]], a ''completion'' of ''S'' means a [[complete lattice]] ''L'' with an order-embedding of ''S'' into ''L''. The notion of ''complete lattice'' generalizes the least-upper-bound property of the reals.

One completion of ''S'' is the set of its ''downwardly closed'' subsets, ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]. A related completion that preserves all existing sups and infs of ''S'' is obtained by the following construction: For each subset ''A'' of ''S'', let ''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt; denote the set of upper bounds of ''A'', and let ''A''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; denote the set of lower bounds of ''A''. (These operators form a [[Galois connection]].) Then the [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]] of ''S'' consists of all subsets ''A'' for which (''A''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''; it is ordered by inclusion. The Dedekind-MacNeille completion is the smallest complete lattice with ''S'' embedded in it.

'''DNA immunization''' is an elegant technique of directly injecting a specific antigen DNA coding sequence onto the cells of an immunized species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268810231_Developing_Snake_Antivenom_Sera_by_Genetic_Immunization_A_Review Developing Snake antivenom sera by genetic immunization]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855071/ DNA immunization as a technology platform for monoclonal antibody induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA vaccines protect against disease by injection with [[genetically engineered]] [[plasmid]] containing the [[DNA]] sequence encoding the [[antigen]](s) against which an immune response is sought, so cells directly produce the antigen, causing a protective [[immunological response]].&lt;ref name=whodnavax&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization| url = https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/ | title = DNA vaccines }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA vaccines have theoretical advantages over conventional [[vaccines]], including the ability to induce a wider range of immune response types.{{cn|date=August 2020}}  Several DNA vaccines have been tested for [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] use.&lt;ref name=whodnavax/&gt; In some cases, protection from disease in animals has been obtained, in others not.&lt;ref name=whodnavax/&gt; As of August 2016 no DNA vaccines had been approved in the US for human use.&lt;ref name=mittr/&gt;  Research is ongoing over the approach for [[virus|viral]], [[bacterial]] and [[parasitic]] diseases in humans, as well as for several cancers.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

== History ==
{{see also|Vaccine#History}}

DNA vaccines are so-called &quot;third-generation vaccines&quot;. &quot;For over a hundred years vaccination has been affected by one of two approaches: either introducing specific [[antigens]] against which the [[immune system]] reacts directly, or introducing live attenuated infectious agents that replicate within the host without causing disease [and that can] synthesize the antigens that subsequently prime the immune system.&quot;&lt;ref name=whodnavax/&gt; &quot;Recently, a radically new approach to vaccination has been developed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whodnavax&quot; /&gt; 

DNA vaccines contain DNA that codes for specific proteins (antigens) from a pathogen. The DNA is injected into the body and taken up by cells, whose normal metabolic processes synthesize proteins based on the genetic code in the plasmid that they have taken up. Because these proteins contain regions of amino acid sequences that are characteristic of bacteria or viruses, they are recognized as foreign and when they are processed by the host cells and displayed on their surface, the immune system is alerted, which then triggers immune responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Alarcon JB, Waine GW, McManus DP | volume = 42 | pages = 343–410 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10050276 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60152-9 | isbn = 9780120317424 | series = Advances in Parasitology | title = Advances in Parasitology Volume 42 | chapter = DNA Vaccines: Technology and Application as Anti-parasite and Anti-microbial Agents }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Robinson HL, Pertmer TM | title = DNA vaccines for viral infections: basic studies and applications | volume = 55 | pages = 1–74 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11050940 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3527(00)55001-5 | isbn = 9780120398553 | series = Advances in Virus Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the DNA may be encapsulated in protein to facilitate cell entry. If this [[capsid]] protein is included in the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a live vaccine without reversion risks.

In 1983, [[Enzo Paoletti]] and Dennis Panicali at the [[New York Department of Health]] devised a strategy to produce [[recombinant DNA]] vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary [[smallpox vaccine]] into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White LO, Gibb E, Newham HC, Richardson MD, Warren RC | title = Comparison of the growth of virulent and attenuated strains of Candida albicans in the kidneys of normal and cortison-treated mice by chitin assay | journal = Mycopathologia | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–7 | date = July 1979 |doi=10.1007/bf00470753| pmid = 384256 | s2cid = 31914107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They altered the DNA of [[cowpox]] virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely [[Herpes simplex virus]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[influenza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paoletti E, Lipinskas BR, Samsonoff C, Mercer S, Panicali D | title = Construction of live vaccines using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the hepatitis B virus surface antigen and the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 193–7 | date = January 1984 | pmid = 6320164 | pmc = 344637 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.1.193 | bibcode = 1984PNAS...81..193P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 4722848 - Method for immunizing animals with synthetically modified vaccinia virus&lt;/ref&gt;In 2016 a DNA vaccine for the [[Zika virus]] began testing in humans at the [[National Institutes of Health]].

Separately, [[Inovio Pharmaceuticals]] and [[GeneOne Life Science]] began tests of a different DNA vaccine against Zika in Miami. The NIH vaccine is injected into the upper arm under high pressure. Manufacturing the vaccines in volume remained unsolved as of August 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;mittr&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602073/us-government-starts-test-of-zika-vaccine-in-humans/?set=602081|title=The U.S. government has begun testing its first Zika vaccine in humans|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|access-date=2016-08-06|publisher=MIT Technology Review Magazine|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials for DNA vaccines to prevent HIV are underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Y, Wang S, Lu S | title = DNA Immunization for HIV Vaccine Development | journal = Vaccines | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–59 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 26344472 | pmc = 4494200 | doi = 10.3390/vaccines2010138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

&lt;!-- This section should be supplemented with the examples given in the rest of the text --&gt;
No DNA vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States. Few experimental trials have evoked a response strong enough to protect against disease and the technique's usefulness remains to be proven in humans. A [[veterinary]] DNA vaccine to protect [[horse]]s from [[West Nile virus]] has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fort Dodge Animal Health Announces Approval of West Nile Virus DNA Vaccine for Horses | date=2005-07-18 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134116417.html | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110516225614/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134116417.html | url-status =dead | archive-date =2011-05-16 | work =PR Newswire | access-date = 2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CDC and Fort Dodge Animal Health Achieve First Licensed DNA Vaccine |date=2005-07-18 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r050718.htm |work=CDC |access-date=2007-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820194311/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r050718.htm |archive-date=2007-08-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
DNA immunization is also being investigated as a means of developing [[antivenom]] sera.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268810231_Developing_Snake_Antivenom_Sera_by_Genetic_Immunization_A_Review Developing Snake antivenom sera by genetic immunization]&lt;/ref&gt; DNA immunization can be used as a technology platform for [[monoclonal antibody]] induction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855071/ DNA immunization as a technology platform for monoclonal antibody induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmid vectors ==

=== Vector design ===

DNA vaccines elicit the best immune response when highly active expression vectors are used. These are [[plasmids]] that usually consist of a strong viral promoter to drive the in vivo [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the gene (or [[complementary DNA]]) of interest.&lt;ref name=Mor1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mor G, Klinman DM, Shapiro S, Hagiwara E, Sedegah M, Norman JA, Hoffman SL, Steinberg AD | title = Complexity of the cytokine and antibody response elicited by immunizing mice with Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein plasmid DNA | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 2039–46 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7636255 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/4/2039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interferon alfa-2b|Intron A]] may sometimes be included to improve [[mRNA]] stability and hence increase protein expression.&lt;ref name=Leitner1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leitner WW, Seguin MC, Ballou WR, Seitz JP, Schultz AM, Sheehy MJ, Lyon JA | title = Immune responses induced by intramuscular or gene gun injection of protective deoxyribonucleic acid vaccines that express the circumsporozoite protein from Plasmodium berghei malaria parasites | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 159 | issue = 12 | pages = 6112–9 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9550412 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/12/6112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids also include a strong [[polyadenylation]]/transcriptional termination signal, such as bovine [[growth hormone]] or rabbit [[beta-globulin]] polyadenylation sequences.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Böhm1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm W, Kuhröber A, Paier T, Mertens T, Reimann J, Schirmbeck R | title = DNA vector constructs that prime hepatitis B surface antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte and antibody responses in mice after intramuscular injection | journal = Journal of Immunological Methods | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–40 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8690928 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1759(96)00035-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cistron|Polycistronic]] vectors (ones located at multiple genome sites) are sometimes constructed to express more than one immunogen, or to express an immunogen and an immunostimulatory protein.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis PJ, Babiuk LA | title = DNA vaccines: a review | journal = Advances in Virus Research | volume = 54 | pages = 129–88 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10547676 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60367-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lrMc3G9nIpkC&amp;q=lewis&amp;pg=PA129 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-039854-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” from which the immunogen is expressed, optimising vector design for maximal protein expression is essential.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the [[codon]] usage of pathogenic mRNAs for [[eukaryotic]] cells. Pathogens often have different [[GC-content|AT-contents]] than the target species, so altering the [[gene sequence]] of the immunogen to reflect the [[genetic code|codon]]s more commonly used in the target species may improve its expression.&lt;ref name=Andre1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = André S, Seed B, Eberle J, Schraut W, Bültmann A, Haas J | title = Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a synthetic gp120 sequence with optimized codon usage | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 1497–503 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9445053 | pmc = 124631 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1497-1503.1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration is the choice of [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]. The [[SV40]] promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the [[Rous Sarcoma Virus]] (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt; More recently, expression rates have been further increased by the use of the [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the [[Simian retrovirus|Mason-Pfizer monkey virus]] (MPV)-CTE with/without [[rev]]{{dn|date=October 2020}} increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector.&lt;ref name=Muthumani1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muthumani K, Zhang D, Dayes NS, Hwang DS, Calarota SA, Choo AY, Boyer JD, Weiner DB | title = Novel engineered HIV-1 East African Clade-A gp160 plasmid construct induces strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo | journal = Virology | volume = 314 | issue = 1 | pages = 134–46 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14517067 | doi = 10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00459-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic [[introns]], [[adenovirus]] tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the polyadenylation and transcriptional termination sequences.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt; An example of DNA vaccine plasmid is [[pVAC]], which uses SV40 [[promoter (biology)|promoter]].

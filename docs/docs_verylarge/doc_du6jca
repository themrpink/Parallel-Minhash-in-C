This article deals with the '''[[grammar]] of the Finnish language''' (the article [[Finnish language]] discusses the language in general and contains a quick overview of the grammar). For the ways in which the spoken language differs from the written language, see [[Colloquial Finnish]]. Unlike the languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are [[North Germanic languages]], Finnish is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language. [[morphological typology|Typologically]], Finnish is [[Agglutination|agglutinative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Haspelmath, Martin Dryer, Matthew S Gil, David Comrie, Bernard Bickel, Balthasar Nichols, Johanna|title=Fusion of selected inﬂectional formatives|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|oclc=945596278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is somewhat unique among the languages of Europe in having [[vowel harmony]].

==Pronouns==
The [[pronoun]]s are inflected in the Finnish language much in the same way that their referent nouns are.

===Personal pronouns===
The [[personal pronoun]]s are used to refer to human beings only. The personal pronouns in Finnish in the nominative case are listed in the following table:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Personal pronouns
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;  style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Singular
|-
|''minä'' || I
|-
|''sinä'' || you
|-
|''hän'' || he, she
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Plural
|-
|''me'' || we
|-
|''te'' || you
|-
|''he'' || they
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Polite
|-
|'' Te'' || you
|}

Because Finnish verbs are inflected for person and number, in the Finnish [[standard language]] subject pronouns are not required, and the [[pro-drop|first and second-person pronouns are usually omitted]] except when used for emphasis. In the third person, however, the pronoun is required: ''hän menee'' 's/he goes', ''he menevät'' 'they go'. In [[spoken Finnish]], all pronouns are generally used.

In colloquial Finnish, the [[Animacy|inanimate]] pronouns ''se'' and ''ne'' are very commonly used in place of the singular and plural [[Animacy|animate]] third-person pronouns, respectively. Use of ''hän'' and ''he'' is mostly restricted to writing and formal or markedly polite speech. ''Minä'' and ''sinä'' are usually replaced with colloquial forms. The most common variants are ''mä'' and ''sä'', though in some dialects ''mää'' and ''sää'', ''mnää'' and ''snää'' or ''mie'' and ''sie'' are used. ''Me'', ''te'' and ''he'' are short enough to lack reduced colloquial forms, and their variants (for example ''myö'', ''työ'', and ''hyö'' of some eastern varieties) are considered dialectal. Some common verbs, such as ''olla'' &quot;to be&quot; and ''tulla'' &quot;to come&quot;, exhibit similar reduced colloquial forms:

|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Polite
|-
|''Te olette/tulette''|| ''Te ootte/tuutte''
|}

The second-person plural can be used as a [[T–V distinction|polite form]] when addressing one person, as in some [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages. However, this usage is diminishing in Finnish society.

===Demonstrative pronouns===
The [[demonstrative]]s are used of non-human animate entities and inanimate objects. However, ''se'' and ''ne'' are often used to refer to humans in colloquial Finnish. (This usage is quite correct in a demonstrative sense, i.e. when qualified by the [[#Relative pronouns|relative pronoun]] ''joka'', and in fact it is [[hypercorrect]] to replace a demonstrative ''se'' or ''ne'' with ''hän'' or ''he'' just because the [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] is human.) Furthermore, the demonstratives are used to refer to group nouns and the number of the pronoun must correlate with the number of its referent.

===[[Interrogative pronoun]]s===
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

|-

|-
|''kuka'' || who, which (of many)
|-

|''ken'' || who, which (of many) — old or dialectal word
|-
|''kumpi'' || which (of two)
|-
|''kumpainen'' || which (of two) — old or dialectal word
|}

''Ken'' is now archaic, but its inflected forms are used instead of those of ''kuka'': ''ketä'' instead of ''kuta'' (&quot;whom&quot;): ''Ketä rakastat?'' &quot;Whom do you love?&quot;

===[[Relative pronoun]]s===
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Relative pronouns
|-
! Pronoun !! Example !! English
|-
| ''joka''&lt;br /&gt;(refers to preceding word)
| ''hän on ainoa, '''jonka''' muistan''

|-
| ''mikä''&lt;br /&gt;(refers to preceding clause/sentence ''or''&lt;br /&gt; to a pronoun or a superlative that refers to a thing)
| ''se on ainoa asia, '''minkä''' muistan''
| &quot;it is the only thing '''that''' (I) remember&quot;
|}

|-

|-

|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | toinen
| ''he rakastavat '''toisiaan'''''
| &quot;they love '''each other'''&quot; (plural)
|-
| ''he rakastavat '''toinen toistaan'''''
| &quot;they love '''one another'''&quot; (dual)
|}

===[[Reflexive pronoun]]s===
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Reflexive pronouns
|-
! Pronoun !! Suffix !! Example !! English
|-
| ''itse''
| plus corresponding possessive suffix
| ''keitin '''itselleni''' teetä''
| &quot;(I) made '''myself''' some tea&quot;
|}

===[[Indefinite pronoun]]s===
A large group that entails all of the pronouns that do not fall into any of the categories above. Notice that there are no negative pronouns, such as &quot;nobody&quot;; rather, the positive pronoun is negated with the negative verb ''ei''. No double negatives are possible.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Indefinite pronouns
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''joka'' (uninflected) || every, each
|-
| ''jokainen'' || every, everyone
|-
| ''joku'' || some, someone (person)
|-
| ''jompikumpi'' || either one
|-
| ''jokin'' || some, something (animal, thing)
|-
| ''kukin'' || each one
|-
| ''kumpainenkin'' || both (old or dialectal)
|-
| ''kumpikin'' || both
|-
| ''mikin'' || each thing (dialectal)
|-
| ''kenkään'' || anyone (old or poetic)
|-
| ''kukaan'' ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}}), ''kene...kään'' (oblique) || anyone
|-
| → ''ei kukaan'' || no one
|-
| ''kumpikaan'' || either one
|-
| → ''ei kumpikaan'' || neither one
|-
| ''mikään'' || anything
|-
| → ''ei mikään'' || nothing
|-
| ''mones'' ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}}), ''monente-'' (oblique) || the ordinal pronoun (representing first, second, etc.)
|}

Each pronoun declines. However, the endings ''-kaan/-kään'' and ''-kin'' are [[clitic]]s, and case endings are placed before them, e.g. ''mikään'' &quot;any&quot;, ''miltäkään'' &quot;from any&quot;. There are irregular nominatives. As indicated, ''kukaan'' is an irregular nominative; the regular root is ''kene-'' with ''-kään'', e.g. ''kukaan'' &quot;(not) anyone&quot;, ''keneltäkään'' &quot;from (not) anyone&quot;.

English lacks a direct equivalent to the pronoun {{lang|fi|mones}}; it would be &quot;that-th&quot;, or &quot;which-th&quot; for questions. For examples, {{lang|fi|Palkkio riippuu siitä '''monentenako''' tulee maaliin}} &quot;The reward depends on ''as-which-th'' one comes to the finish&quot;, or explicitly &quot;The reward depends on in which position one comes to the finish&quot;. It would be difficult to translate the question ''Monesko?'', but, although far from proper English, the question ''How manyeth'' may give an English-speaking person an idea of the meaning.

Some indefinite adjectives are often perceived as indefinite pronouns. These include:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Indefinite adjectives
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''ainoa'' || the only one
|-
| ''eräs'' || some, certain, one

|-

|-
| ''kaikki'' || all, everyone, everything
|-
| ''molemmat'' || both
|-
| ''moni'' || many
|-
| ''muu'' || other
|-
| ''muutama'' || some, a few
|-
| ''sama'' || same
|-
| ''toinen'' (non-reciprocal, non-numeral use) || another
|}

==Noun forms==
The Finnish language does not distinguish gender in [[noun]]s or even in personal pronouns: ''hän'' is 'he', 'she' or 'it' depending on the referent. There are no articles, neither definite nor indefinite.

===Possessive suffixes===

===Cases===
{{Main|Finnish noun cases}}
Finnish has fifteen [[declension|noun cases]]: four grammatical cases, six locative cases, two essive cases (three in some Eastern dialects) and three marginal cases.

|}
The following are several notes about the cases listed in the table above.

* A noun in the comitative case is always followed by a possessive suffix. However, as is typical in Finnish, an adjective does not take possessive suffixes: {{lang|fi|Mies ylellisine taloineen}} &quot;A man with his luxurious house(s)&quot;, with comitative {{lang|fi|-ne}} on both the adjective and noun, but the third person possessive suffix {{lang|fi|-en}} on the noun only.
* The accusative suffix on pronouns is [[suppletion|suppletive]] ({{lang|fi|-t}}, not {{lang|fi|-n}}), e.g. {{lang|fi|minut}}, the accusative form of {{lang|fi|minä}}, &quot;I&quot;, though genitive pronouns still end in {{lang|fi|-n}}. The object of imperatives in Finnic languages does not bear accusative case&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lees |first=Aet |title=7 Object Case in Relation to Verb Form |date=2015-01-01 |work=Case Alternations in Five Finnic Languages |pages=229–310 |publisher=BRILL |doi=10.1163/9789004296367_008 |isbn=978-90-04-29636-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (but rather the nominative), despite contrary claims in learner's grammars.
* Regarding the illative suffix {{lang|fi|-Vn}}: &quot;V&quot; stands in for a preceding (short) vowel: {{lang|fi|talo-Vn}} yields {{lang|fi|taloon}}, but {{lang|fi|kukka-Vn}} yields {{lang|fi|kukkaan}}.

==== Relationship between locative cases ====
As in other [[Uralic languages]], locative cases in Finnish can be classified according to three criteria: the spatial position (interior or surface), the motion status (stationary or moving), and within the latter, the direction of the movement (approaching or departing). The classification captures a [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] pattern that distinguishes interior and surface spatial position; long consonants (/sː/ in {{lang|fi|-ssa}} / {{lang|fi|-ssä}} and /lː/ in {{lang|fi|-lla}} / {{lang|fi|-llä}}) express stationary motion, whereas a /t/ expresses &quot;movement from&quot;. The table below shows these relationships schematically:

|}

===Plurals===
Finnish nominal plurals are often marked by /-i/ (though /-t/ is a [[Suppletion|suppletive]] variant in the nominative and accusative, as is common in [[Uralic languages]]). Singular and plural number cross-cut the distinctions in grammatical case, and several number/case combinations have somewhat idiosyncratic uses. Several of these deserve special mention.

====Nominative/accusative plural====
The nominative plural is used for [[Definiteness|definite]] [[Count noun|count]] nouns that are [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]], while the plural object of a [[telicity|telic]] verb bears the accusative plural. The [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretic]] suffix that covers both uses is ''-t''. This suffix can only appear in word-final position; i.e. it is omitted when a possessive suffix is present.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| '''''Huoneet''' olivat suuria'' || &quot;'''The rooms''' were large&quot;
|-
|''Minäkin näin '''koirat'''''
|&quot;I too saw '''the dogs'''&quot;
|}

====Numerals====
{{details|Finnish numerals}}
When a noun is [[Modifier (linguistics)|modified]] by a numeral greater than one, and the numeral is in the nominative singular, the noun bears the partitive singular. Otherwise, the noun and the numeral agree with each other in number and case.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Following numerals
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''huoneessa oli '''kaksi koiraa''''' || &quot;there were '''two dogs''' in the room&quot;

|-
| ''ostin tietokoneen '''tuhannella eurolla''''' || &quot;I bought a computer '''for a thousand euros'''&quot;
|-
| ''tarvitsen '''kahdet kengät''''' || &quot;I need '''two pairs of shoes'''&quot;
|}

====Inflected plural====
This uses the stem of the partitive plural inflected with the same set of endings as for singular nouns. The suffix is ''-i-'', and it suppresses long vowels; it may only appear before another suffix.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Inflected plural

| ''lintu on puussa'' || 'the bird is in the tree'
|-
| → ''linnut ovat puissa'' || 'the birds are in the trees'
|}

====Inflection of pronouns====
&lt;!-- Should these be under the main section &quot;pronouns&quot;? pne --&gt;
The personal pronouns are inflected in the same way as nouns, and can be found in most of the same cases as nouns. For example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Inflection of pronouns
|-
! Finnish !! Case !! Example !! English
|-
| ''minä'' || nominative || || 'I'
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | ''minun'' || rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | genitive || || ('my, mine')
|-
| ''tämä talo on '''minun''''' ||  'this house is '''mine'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| ''tämä on '''minun''' talo'''ni''''' ||  'this is '''my''' house'
|-
| ''minut'' || accusative || ''hän tuntee minut'' || 's/he knows me'
|-
| ''minua'' || partitive ||  ''hän rakastaa minua'' ||  's/he loves me'
|-
| ''minussa'' || inessive || ''tämä herättää minussa vihaa'' ||  'this provokes ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} awakens) anger in me'
|-
| ''minusta'' || elative ||  ''hän puhui minusta'' ||  's/he was talking about/of me'. Also used idiomatically to mean 'in my opinion'.
|-
| ''minuun'' || illative ||  ''hän uskoi minuun'' ||  's/he believed in me'
|-
| ''minulla'' || adessive || ''minulla on rahaa'' ||  'I've got some money' (lit.'On me there's money')
|-
| ''minulta'' || ablative || ''hän otti minulta rahaa'' ||  's/he took some money from/off me'.
|-
| ''minulle'' || allative || ''anna minulle rahaa'' ||  'give me some money'
|-
| ''sinuna'' || essive || ''sinuna en tekisi sitä'' || 'If I were you, I wouldn't do it' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'as you')
|-
| ''minuksi'' || translative || ''häntä luullaan usein minuksi'' ||  's/he is often mistaken for me'
|}

===Noun/adjective stem types===
The '''[[Stem (linguistics)|stem]]''' of a word is the part to which inflectional endings are affixed. For most noun and adjective types, the nominative case is identical to the basic stem (the nominative is [[unmarked]]).

====Vowel stems====
A word with a '''vowel stem''' is one that ends in a vowel in the nominative, and retains a final vowel in all forms. The stem vowel can however change in certain inflected forms:

|}

The change of original (pre-Proto-Finnic) final ''*e'' to ''i'' means that the stem vowel of a word ending in ''i'' cannot be determined from the nominative alone; one of the inflected forms must be consulted. However, most old inherited words ending in ''i'' decline as ''e''-stems (or consonants stems, see below), while modern loans, where ''i'' frequently is added for phonotactic reasons (as in the case of ''halli''), always decline as ''i''-stems.

====Consonant stems====
A word with a '''consonant stem''' is one where case suffixes can in some cases be affixed directly after the last consonant for at least some forms. Words with consonant stems come in three broad classes.

The first class of consonant-stem words largely resemble ''e''-stems, but allow elision of the stem vowel in the partitive singular, and for certain words, plural genitive. In the later case, this involves a special allomorph ''-ten'', employing the plural marker ''t'' rather than ''i''/''j''.

The final consonant in words of this class must be one of ''h, l, m, n, r, s, t''. Other remarks for ''e''-stem words still apply.

For some words of this type, modern Finnish displays a tendency of development from consonant-stems to e-stems. For example, the partitive singular of the word ''tuomi'' &quot;bird cherry&quot; may be ''tuonta'' (consonant stem) or ''tuomea'' (vowel stem).

Another class of consonant-stem words end in a consonant even in the nominative; if a stem vowel is required for phonotactic reasons, ''e'' again appears. Modern Finnish only allows dental and alveolar consonants (''l, n, r, s, t'') to occur as word-final, but originally, words ending in ''h, k, m'' were possible as well.

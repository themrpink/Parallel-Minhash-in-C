==Subspecies and hybrids==
Though interbreeding with other pike species can complicate the classification of some individuals, [[Zoology|zoologists]] usually recognize up to three [[subspecies]] of muskellunge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/becker.html|title=Fish and Fisheries|last=Grant|first=UW Sea|website=Seagrant.wisc.edu|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Great Lakes Muskellunge or Spotted Muskellunge (''E. m. masquinongy'') is the most common variety in the Great Lakes basin and surrounding area. The spots on the body form oblique rows.
* The Chautauqua Muskellunge or Barred Muskellunge (''E. m. ohioensis'') is known from the Ohio River system, [[Chautauqua Lake]], [[Lake Ontario]], and the St Lawrence River.
* The Clear Muskellunge (''E. m. immaculatus'') is most common in the inland lakes of Wisconsin, Minnesota, northwestern Ontario, and southeastern [[Manitoba]].

The [[tiger muskellunge]] (''E. masquinongy'' × ''lucius'' or ''E. lucius'' × ''masquinongy'') is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of the muskie and northern pike. Hybrids are sterile, although females sometimes unsuccessfully engage in spawning motions. Some hybrids are artificially produced and planted for anglers to catch. Tiger muskies grow faster than pure muskies, but do not attain the ultimate size of their pure relatives, as the tiger muskie does not live as long.

==Attacks on humans==
Although very rare, muskellunge attacks on humans do occur on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/i-came-back-up-screaming-winnipeg-woman-recovering-after-gruesome-muskie-attack-1.5046045 CTV News: 'I came back up screaming': Winnipeg woman recovering after gruesome Muskie attack]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bnhYOH_SiU&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Musky Attacks Manitoba Woman (Full Interview)|date=2020-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollock''' or '''pollack'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kirkpatrick, E. M.|title=[[Chambers 20th Century Dictionary]]|edition=New |year=1983|publisher=Chambers|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0550102345|page=904}}&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ə|k|}}) is the common name used for either of the two [[species]] of North Atlantic [[ocean|marine]] [[fish]] in the [[genus]] '''''Pollachius'''''. ''[[Pollachius pollachius]]'' is referred to as pollock in both North America and the United Kingdom, while ''[[Pollachius virens]]'' is usually known as '''coley''' in the British Isles (derived from the older name '''coalfish'''). Other names for ''P.&amp;nbsp;pollachius'' include the '''Atlantic pollock''', '''European pollock''', '''''lieu jaune''''', and '''lythe'''; while ''P.&amp;nbsp;virens'' is also known as '''Boston blue''' (distinct from [[bluefish]]), '''silver bill''', or '''saithe'''.

== Species ==
The recognized species in this genus are:&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase genus | genus = Pollachius| month = April | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Pollachius pollachius]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758)&lt;/small&gt; (pollack)
* ''[[Pollachius virens]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Linnaeus, 1758)&lt;/small&gt; (coalfish)

== Description ==
Both species can grow to {{convert|105|cm|ftin|frac=2|abbr=off}} and can weigh up to {{convert|21|kg|lb|0|abbr=off}}. ''P.&amp;nbsp;virens'' has a strongly defined, silvery [[lateral line]] running down the sides. Above the lateral line, the colour is a greenish black. The belly is white, while ''P.&amp;nbsp;pollachius'' has a distinctly crooked lateral line, grayish to golden belly, and a dark brown back. ''P.&amp;nbsp;pollachius'' also has a strong underbite. It can be found in water up to {{convert|180|m|ft fathom|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} deep over rocks and anywhere in the [[water column]]. Pollock is a [[whitefish (fisheries term)|whitefish]].

== As food ==
{{common fish}}
[[File:Time series for global capture of all pollock.png|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;Global commercial capture of pollock in million tonnes 1950–2010&lt;ref name=FAOdata&gt;Based on data sourced from the relevant [http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/search/en FAO Species Fact Sheets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Global total production pollock.png|thumb|160px|right|&lt;center&gt;The total capture of pollock in 2010 as reported by the FAO was {{convert|3.2|e6tonne|e6ST|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=FAOdata /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Atlantic pollock]] is largely considered to be a [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|whitefish]], although it is a fairly strongly flavoured one.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as Norway, in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to [[Cod as food|cod]] and [[haddock]]. However, in recent years,{{when|date=August 2019}} pollock has become more popular due to overfishing of cod and haddock. It can now be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items. For example, it is used minced in [[Fishstick|fish fingers]] or as an ingredient in [[Crab stick|imitation crab meat]] and is commonly used to make [[fish and chips]].

Because of its slightly grey colour, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile-sized, breaded with [[oatmeal]] and fried, as in [[Shetland]]. Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted, and dried over a peat hearth in [[Orkney]], where their texture becomes wooden.{{clarify|date=November 2017}} The fish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a [[salmon]]-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in Germany, where the fish is commonly sold as ''Seelachs'' or sea salmon. In Korea, pollock may be repeatedly frozen and defrosted to create ''hwangtae'', half-dried to create ''ko-da-ri'', or fully dried and eaten as ''book-o''. In 2019, South Korea imposed a total ban on pollock fishing &quot;to help replenish depleted stocks&quot; of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190115002800320 |title=S. Korea to impose year-round fishing ban on pollock |publisher=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=2019-01-15 |website=Yonhap News |access-date=2019-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, UK supermarket [[Sainsbury's]] briefly renamed pollock '''colin''' in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/06/sainsburys-pollack-colin-fish-stocks A colin and chips? Sainsbury's gives unfashionable pollack a makeover | Business | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sainsbury's, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock ([[:fr:Colin (poisson)|''colin'']]), launched the product under the banner &quot;Colin and chips can save British cod.&quot;

Pollock is regarded as a &quot;low-[[Mercury (element)|mercury]] fish&quot; – a woman weighing {{cvt|60|kg}} can safely eat up to {{convert|18|oz|g|order=flip|abbr=on}} per week, and a child weighing {{cvt|20|kg}} can safely eat up to {{convert|6|oz|g|order=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/food-safety/safe-fish-for-pregnant-women/|title=Which Fish Are Safe for Pregnant Women?|website=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2017-01-27 |accessdate=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other fish called pollock ==
{{main|Alaska pollock}}
One member of the genus ''[[Gadus]]'' is also commonly referred to as pollock: the [[Alaska pollock]] or walleye pollock (''Gadus chalcogrammus''), including the form known as the [[Norway pollock]]. They are also members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Gadidae]] but not members of the genus ''Pollachius''.

'''''Archosargus probatocephalus''''', the '''sheepshead''', is a marine [[fish]] that grows to {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but commonly reaches {{convert|10|to|20| in|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. It is deep and compressed in body shape, with five or six dark bars on the side of the body over a gray background. It has sharp dorsal spines. Its diet consists of [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, and other [[bivalve]]s, and [[barnacle]]s, [[fiddler crab]]s, and other [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/sheepshead/ |title=Sheepshead (''Archosargus probatocephalus'') |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a hard [[mouth]], with several rows of stubby [[tooth|teeth]] – the frontal ones closely resembling [[Human tooth|human teeth]] – which help crush the shells of prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheepshead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefeaturedcreature.com/2013/02/no-braces-necessary-for-the-sheepshead-fish-with-human-like-teeth.html |title=No Braces Necessary for the Sheepshead Fish With Human-like Teeth |publisher=thefeaturedcreature.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305041651/http://www.thefeaturedcreature.com/2013/02/no-braces-necessary-for-the-sheepshead-fish-with-human-like-teeth.html |archivedate=5 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range==
The sheepshead is found in coastal waters along the western Atlantic, from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Brazil]], but the greatest concentration is around southwest [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/descript/sheepshead/sheepshead.html | title=Florida Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Sheepshead Bay]] section of [[Brooklyn]], in [[New York City]], was named after the fish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooklynbased.net/email/2009/05/the-naming-of-sheepshead-bay/ |title=The Naming of Sheepshead Bay |publisher=Brooklyn Based |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now rarely found that far north. However they just recently started to return to the area in small numbers, with a few being caught in the Jamaica Bay and on the Rockaway Reef.

==Fishing==
As sheepshead feed on bivalves and crustaceans,&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;/&gt; successful baits include [[shrimp]], [[Emerita (genus)|sand fleas]] (mole crabs), [[clam]]s, fiddler crabs, and [[mussel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;state4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillis|first=Chad|title=Fishing 101: Sheepshead Porgy|url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/mar/06/fishing-101-sheepshead-porgy/|newspaper=naplesnews.com|date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheepshead have a knack for stealing bait, so a small [[fishhook|hook]] is necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;state4&quot;/&gt; Locating sheepshead with a boat is not difficult: fishermen look for rocky bottoms or places with obstructions, [[jetty|jetties]], and the pilings of [[bridge]]s and [[pier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;state4&quot;/&gt; The average weight of a sheepshead is {{convert|3|to|4|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but some individuals reach the range of {{convert|10|to|15|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;state4&quot;/&gt;

==Parasites==
As with other fish, the  sheepshead has a variety of [[fish parasites|parasites]]. One of them is the [[monogenea]]n ''[[Microcotyle archosargi]]'', which is parasitic on its [[gills]].

'''Fort Montgomery''' is a fortification built on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]] in [[Highlands, New York]] by the Continental Army during the [[American Revolution]].  Erected in 1776, Fort Montgomery was one of the first major investments by the Americans in strategic construction projects.

Declared a [[National Historic Landmark]], it is part of the [[Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area]], owned and operated by the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] as the '''Fort Montgomery State Historic Site'''.

==Background==
The strategic importance of the ability to control navigation along the Hudson River was obvious to both the Americans and the [[United Kingdom|British]] from the outbreak of open hostilities. The Hudson was the major means for transportation of supplies and troops throughout a large portion of the northeast. The fort was constructed at a site noted as early as the seventeenth century for its strategic advantage in controlling navigation along the river.

A month after the first open armed conflict in [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|Lexington]], the [[Continental Congress]] resolved on May 25, 1775 to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of protecting and maintaining control of the Hudson River. It noted that &quot;…a post be also taken in the Highlands on each side of Hudson’s River and batteries erected in such a manner as will most effectually prevent any vessels passing that may be sent to harass the inhabitants on the borders of said river…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsonrivervalley.net/historicaldocs.php &quot;Congressional Resolution to build forts on the Hudson&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127222958/http://www.hudsonrivervalley.net/historicaldocs.php |date=2004-11-27 }}, Hudson River Valley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Constitution==
[[James Clinton]] and Christopher Tappan, both lifetime residents of the area, were sent to scout appropriate locations. The initial site chosen was further to the north, on Martlaer's Island, across from [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Plans  for the fort called for four [[bastions]]. Construction of the fortifications began in the summer of 1775. By November it had 70 cannons. However, difficulties in construction and management of the original plan of fortifications, together with escalating costs, led to abandonment of that project. The site on the north side of Popolopen Creek across from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] was proposed, and in January 1776, the materials and resources from Fort Constitution were redirected to the construction at the new site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dmna.ny.gov/forts/fortsA_D/constituitionFort.htm &quot;Fort Constitution&quot;, New York State Military Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began on the new Fort Montgomery in March 1776.

==Fort Montgomery in the American Revolution==

Fort Montgomery was located at the confluence of [[Popolopen|Popolopen Creek]] with the [[Hudson River]] near [[Bear_Mountain_(Hudson_Highlands)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Orange County, New York]].  The fortifications included a river battery of six 32-pound cannons, a cable chain supported by a boom across the Hudson River (see [[Hudson River Chain]]), and landward [[redoubt]]s connected by [[defensive wall|ramparts]], all situated on a cliff promontory rising 100 feet (30 m) above the river. The fort was commanded by General [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], also the newly appointed governor of the state. Fort Montgomery and its companion fortification [[Fort Clinton]], on the southern bank of the Popolopen, held a combined garrison of roughly 700 American soldiers. These men were from the 5th NY Regiment, Lamb's Artillery, Orange County Militia, and Ulster County Militia.

The strategic importance of the opposite bank of Popolopen Creek was quickly realized, as it was an elevated cliff terrace with a full view of the Fort Montgomery site and could not be left undefended. The Army built the smaller fortification named Fort Clinton at that site. These two forts and their associated cannon batteries effectively controlled this stretch of the Hudson River. The Army also conceived a major engineering project to effectively blockade any naval traffic headed north on the river. In 1776 a [[Hudson River Chain|chain and boom]] were built across the river to provide a physical barrier to ships, in addition to the combined firepower of the fortifications, which could be massed against ships.

In July 1776, the New York convention{{Clarify|date=June 2014}} appointed a committee, including [[John Jay]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], George Clinton and [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], to &quot;devise and carry into execution&quot; measures for &quot;obstructing the channel of Hudson's river, or annoying the navigation of the said River.&quot; Worried about lack of arms, the committee worked to buy more cannons.

==Battle of Fort Montgomery==
{{Main|Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery}}
On October 6, 1777, a combined force of roughly 2,100 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], and British regulars led by Lieutenant General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] attacked forts Montgomery and Clinton from the landward side (where the defenses were only partially completed). They had support from cannon fire from British ships on the Hudson River that had passed through the [[chevaux de frise]] on the lower river. The land columns attacking from west of the fort consisted of the New York Volunteers, the [[Loyal American Regiment]], Emmerich's Chasseurs, the 57th and the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Regiments of Foot]]. By the end of the day, both forts had fallen to the British, who burned the forts and tore down the stonework buildings.

====Lexicographer====
{{Main|Lexicography}}
Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), whose ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as [[Jane Austen]].

====Researcher/Scholar====
{{Main|Research|Scholarly method}}

Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who wrote ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543); [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); and [[Sigmund Freud]], who wrote ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the center of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of manner; and Freud's ideas about the power of the [[unconscious mind]] overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.&lt;ref name=Weinert&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|title=Copernicus, Darwin and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford UK|isbn=978-1-4051-8184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translator====
{{Main|Translation}}
Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar]], who translated ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Arabic]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], who deciphered [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with the result that he could publish the first translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or [[pun]]s; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is supposedly untranslatable because &quot;no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title=&quot;Introduction&quot; to the English translation of &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780141441894|page=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred.

{{Quotation|''Even if translation is impossible – we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Dessaix]], translator, author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dessaix|first=Robert|title=&quot;Dandenongs Gothic: On Translation&quot; in (and so forth)|year=1998|publisher=Pan MacMillan Australia Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=0-7329-0943-0|pages=307|authorlink=Robert Dessaix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reportage===

====Blogger====
{{Main|Blog}}
Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the [[World Wide Web]] since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or &quot;posts&quot; form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. [[Malala Yousafzai]], a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence due to her blog for [[BBC]].

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter.  &quot;The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rettburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rettberg|first=Jill Walker|title=Blogging|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK; Malden, Massachusetts USA|isbn=978-0-7456-4133-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/blogging0000rett/page/42 42]|url=https://archive.org/details/blogging0000rett/page/42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with other forms of letter, the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that &quot;some of the audience will be random&quot; and &quot;that presumably changes the way we [writers] write.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rettburg /&gt; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]], whose ''Essais'' (&quot;attempts&quot;), were published in 1580, because Montaigne &quot;wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bakewell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=What Bloggers Owe Montaigne|journal=The Paris Review|date=12 November 2010|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/11/12/what-bloggers-owe-montaigne/|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Columnist====
{{Main|Columnist}}
Columnists write regular parts for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book, so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the female columnist [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
{{Main|List of diarists}}
[[File:Anne Frank signature.svg|thumb|Signature of [[Anne Frank]]]]
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts or emotions in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events or individual personalities. Examples include [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the [[Great Fire of London]]. [[Anne Frank]] (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old Dutch girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====
{{Main|Journalism}}
Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is [[Bob Woodward]], a journalist who investigated and wrote about [[Watergate scandal|criminal activities by the US President]].
{{Quotation| ''Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.''&lt;br /&gt;Geoffrey Barker, journalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker and de Brito&quot;&gt;Barker and de Brito, controversially lamenting the preference for looks over experience in televised journalism. {{cite news|last=Geoffrey Barker|title=Switch off the TV babes for some real news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/switch-off-the-tv-babes-for-some-real-news-20130501-2it0o.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=May 2, 2013}} {{cite news|last=Sam de Brito|title=Reality's bite worse than Barker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/blogs/all-men-are-liars/realitys-bite-worse-than-barker-20130502-2ivq8.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Memoirist====
{{Main|Memoir}}

Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are considered unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although meant to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Well-known memoirists include [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane]], and [[Giacomo Casanova]].

===Utilitarian===

====Ghostwriter====
{{Main|Ghostwriter}}
Ghostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.

====Letter writer====
[[File:Kusakabe Kimbei - Writing Letter (large).jpg|thumb|''Writing Letter''&lt;br /&gt;(Photograph by [[Kusakabe Kimbei]])]]

{{Main|Letter (message)}}
Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to [[Héloïse (abbess)|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] {{nowrap|(1090?–1164)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For text see [[s:Letters of Abélard and Héloïse|Letters of Abélard and Héloïse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters (or [[epistle]]s) of [[Paul the Apostle]] were so influential that over the two thousand years of Christian history, Paul became &quot;second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to St. Paul in the Middle Ages|year=2013|publisher=Koninklijke, Brill, NV|location=Leiden The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-23672-1 |pages=1|editor=Steven R. Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul and the Legacies of Paul|year=1990|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|location=Dallas|editor=William S. Babcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nla.ms-ms5393-2-s1.jpg|thumb|left|Water damaged unpublished autograph manuscript page of [[William Bligh|Bligh]]'s voyage in the launch of {{HMS|Bounty}}, from the ship to [[Tofua]] and from thence to [[Timor]] April 28 to June 14, 1789, after the ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny]]''. It contains notes used later as the basis for his report and all his subsequent narratives.]]

====Report writer====
{{Main|Report}}

Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the [[Crimean War]] and showed her determination to see improvements: &quot;...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her ''Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.'' This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural&quot; became for a long time, the &quot;leading authority on the medical administration of armies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=Lytton|title=Eminent Victorians|year=1918|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=0-14-000649-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eminentvictorian00stra_0/page/142 142–3]|edition=1981|authorlink=Lytton Strachey|chapter=Florence Nightingale – 3|title-link=Eminent Victorians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British army : founded chiefly on the experience of the late war|work=Adelaide Nutting historical nursing collection, AN 0054.|publisher=London : Harrison and Sons, 1858|oclc=7660327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logs and reports of [[Master mariner]] [[William Bligh]] contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the [[court-martial]] inquiring into the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}}.

====Scribe====
[[File:The Letter Writer.jpg|thumb|Scribe in India taking instructions from a client]]
{{Main|Scribe}}

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recording]], [[shorthand]], or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from first times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and &quot;found manuscripts in places like [[Tours]] and [[Toulouse]]&quot; which they copied.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Civilisation|year=1969|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-016589-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colors.

====Technical writer====
{{Main|Technical writer}}

A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as [[user guide]]s or [[owner's manual]]s for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write different procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant [[style guide]].

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at his manuscript burning]]
{{main|Writing process}}
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.&lt;ref name=Older&gt;{{cite news|last1=Older|first1=Daniel José|title=Writing Begins With Forgiveness: Why One of the Most Common Pieces of Writing Advice Is Wrong|url=http://sevenscribes.com/writing-begins-with-forgiveness-why-one-of-the-most-common-pieces-of-writing-advice-is-wrong/|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of [[photocopier]]s and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very earlier times, writers used [[vellum]] and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the inventor of [[Esperanto]], whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that &quot;his son would be thought a spy working code&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;– The English Language|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], lost the only copy of a manuscript for ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles William, Ed. &quot;Introductory Note&quot; in ''The Harvard Classics'', Vol. XXV, Part 3. New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son, 1909–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers usually develop a personal schedule. [[Angus Wilson]], for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Angus|title=Interview with Angus Wilson|journal=The Paris Review|year=1957|issue=Autumn-Winter No.17|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4848/the-art-of-fiction-no-20-angus-wilson|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writer's block]] is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

{{Quotation|''Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page''&lt;br /&gt;[[Gustave Flaubert]] writing to [[Louise Colet]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Plate caption to an image of a much-corrected page of [[Madame Bovary]] in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Rouen.

[[File:Leonid Pasternak - The Passion of creation.jpg|thumb|left|''Throes of Creation'' by [[Leonid Pasternak]] ]]

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. &quot;Didn't [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] also write facing a blank wall? ... [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Ted Hughes|Hughes]]|first=Ted|title=Ted Hughes: The Art of Poetry No. 71|journal=The Paris Review|year=1995|volume=Spring|issue= 134|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that other authors write and contribute to a part of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the part too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Librettist [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote the words for the [[comic opera]]s created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most best-known example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King [[James VI and I|James VI]] of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in [[Cambridge]] and some in [[Oxford]], who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]], published in 1611, has been described as an &quot;everlasting miracle&quot; because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to &quot;hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king&quot;, with the result that the language communicates itself &quot;in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nicolson2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}(p.240, 243)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multimedia====
[[File:William Blake Nurses Song Copy Z 1826.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]] &quot;[[Nurse's Song]]&quot; from ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]
Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. [[William Blake]] is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. [[Cartoonist]]s are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. [[Shaun Tan]], for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Shaun|title=The Oopsatoreum|year=2012|publisher=Powerhouse Publishing|location=Sydney|isbn=9781863171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's writers [[Beatrix Potter]], [[May Gibbs]], and [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]] are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
Some writers contribute very small sections to a part of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', under the editorship of lexicographer [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of [[William Chester Minor|W.C. Minor]], at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.&lt;ref name=Crowthorne&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester|title=The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words|year=1998|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0670878626|title-link=The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia, which relies on millions of writers and editors such as [[Simon Pulsifer]]&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Simon Pulsifer: The Duke of Data|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570732,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide.

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression&lt;ref name=Styron&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton|title=William Styron, The Art of Fiction No. 5|url= http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5114/the-art-of-fiction-no-5-william-styron|journal=The Paris Review|year=1954|issue=Spring|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording facts, history or research results. The many [[physician writer]]s, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the [[human condition]] with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, [[George Orwell]]'s essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946) takes this as its subject. As to &quot;what constitutes success or failure to a writer&quot;, it has been described as &quot;a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jane|title=JK Rowling on turning failure into success|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/jk-rowling-on-turning-failure-into-success-20141219-129vm6.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.''&lt;br /&gt;[[W. Somerset Maugham]] in ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919)&lt;ref name=Maugham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maugham|first1=Somerset|title=The Moon and Sixpence|date=1999|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099284765|page=8|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s order at the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. [[Philology|Philologist]] [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

{{Quotation| ''For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Fry]], author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=The Ode Less Travelled – Unlocking the Poet Within|year=2007|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-950934-9|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are [[Limerick (poetry)|limericks]], many comics and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''I think that I shall never see''
''a billboard lovely as a tree;''
''Indeed, unless the billboards fall''
''I'll never see a tree at all.''
[[Ogden Nash]], humorous poet, reworking a poem by [[Joyce Kilmer]] for comic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash&quot;&gt;Nash, Ogden, &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot;, ''The Face Is Familiar'' (Garden City Publishing, 1941), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

====Influence====
[[File:Ninety-Five Theses, Wittenberg.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' (at the All Saints' Church, [[Wittenburg]])]]
Anger has motivated many writers, including [[Martin Luther]], angry at religious corruption, who wrote the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' in 1517, to reform the church, and [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'Accuse]]'' in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

...
RAGUENEAU:   Ten minutes after six.
CYRANO: (nervously seating himself at Ragueneau's table, and drawing some paper toward him): A pen!. . .
RAGUENEAU (giving him the one from behind his ear): Here – a swan's quill.
...
CYRANO (taking up the pen, and motioning Ragueneau away):  Hush! (To himself): I will write, fold it, give it her, and fly! (Throws down the pen): Coward! ...But strike me dead if I dare to speak to her, ...ay, even one single word! (To Ragueneau): What time is it?

Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an original one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. [[Frances Milton Trollope|Frances Trollope]] is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in the United States, called ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' became a great success, &quot;even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life&quot; after which &quot;she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast&quot;.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Katherine|title=Victorian Wives|year=1974|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London, New York|isbn=0-85031-634-0|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her writer son [[Anthony Trollope]] &quot;her books saved the family from ruin&quot;.&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

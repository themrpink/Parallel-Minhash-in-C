Perry served in the West Indies during the [[Quasi War]] of 1798–1800 against France, in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Barbary Wars]] of 1801–1815, and in the [[Caribbean]] fighting piracy and the [[African slave trade|slave trade]], but is most noted for his heroic role in the [[War of 1812]] during the 1813 [[Battle of Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; During the war against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Perry supervised the building of a fleet at [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. He earned the title &quot;Hero of [[Lake Erie]]&quot; for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie, receiving a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] and the [[Thanks of Congress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;&gt;[[#Bloom|Bloom]], Page essay&lt;/ref&gt; His leadership materially aided the successful outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories, and the victory was a turning point in the battle for the west in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt; He is remembered for the words on his battle flag, &quot;Don't Give Up the Ship&quot;, which was a tribute to the dying command of his colleague Captain [[James Lawrence]] of USS ''Chesapeake''. He is also known for his message to General [[William Henry Harrison]] which reads in part, &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; ...&quot;

Perry became embroiled in a long-standing and bitter controversy with the commander of {{USS|Niagara|1813|6}}, Captain [[Jesse Elliott]], over their conduct in the Battle of Lake Erie, and both were the subject of official charges. In 1815, he successfully commanded {{USS|Java|1815|2}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Second Barbary War]]. So seminal was his career that he was lionized in the press (being the subject of scores of books and articles).&lt;ref name=&quot;biblio&quot;&gt;[[#Paullin|Paullin, 1918]], See ''Bibliography''&lt;/ref&gt; He has been frequently memorialized, and many places, ships and persons have been named in his honor.

==Childhood and early life==
As a boy, Perry lived in Tower Hill, [[Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name=&quot;capace&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Rhode Island |first1=Nancy |last1=Capace |location=St. Clair Shores, Michigan |page=368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qHPYeCvnASoC&amp;q=1761+Milestone&amp;pg=PA368 |isbn=9780403096107

Perry came from a long line of accomplished naval men from both sides of his family. His mother taught Perry and his younger brothers to read and write and had them attend [[Trinity Church (Newport, Rhode Island)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] regularly, where he was baptized by Reverend William Smith on April 1, 1794, at the age of nine. Reverend [[Theodore Dehon]], rector of the church from 1797 to 1810, had a significant influence on the young Perry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island.

==Early naval career==
Through his father's influence, Perry was appointed a [[midshipman]] in the United States Navy, at the age of thirteen, on April 7, 1799. Perry sailed aboard {{USS|General Greene|1799|6}}, of which his father was commanding officer, on her [[maiden voyage]] in June 1799. The ship made its first stop in [[Cuba]], charged with receiving American merchant ships and providing escort from [[Havana]] to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mackenzie40|Mackenzie, 1840]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's service aboard ''General Greene'' continued during the [[Quasi-War]] with [[French First Republic|France]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes|Barnes, 1912]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He first experienced combat on February 9, 1800, off the coast of the French colony of [[Haiti]], which was in a [[Haitian Revolution|state of rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown, 2006]], Oliver Hazard Perry, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes|Barnes, 1912]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Barbary War]], he served aboard {{USS|Adams|1799|6}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mackenzie40|Mackenzie, 1840]], pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; and later was [[first lieutenant]] (second in command) of {{USS|Nautilus|1799|6}}. He then served under Captain [[John Rodgers (1772–1838)|John Rodgers]] on {{USS|Constitution}} and USS ''Essex''. He was placed in charge of construction of [[gunboat]]s in Newport and [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]], Rhode Island.

Beginning in April 1809, he commanded the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Revenge|1806|6}}, engaging in patrol duties to enforce the [[Embargo Act]], as well as a successful raid to regain an American ship held in Spanish territory in Florida. On January 9, 1811, ''Revenge'' [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] off Rhode Island and was lost. &quot;Seeing fairly quickly that he could not save the vessel, [Perry] turned his attention to saving the crew, and after helping them down the ropes over the vessel's stern, he was the last to leave the vessel.&quot;&lt;ref name=copes&gt;{{cite journal | last = Copes | first = Jan M. | title =The Perry Family: A Newport Naval Dynasty of the Early Republic| journal =Newport History: Bulletin of the Newport Historical Society | volume =66, Part 2 | issue = 227 | pages = 49–77| publisher = Newport Historical Society | location =[[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport, RI]] | date = Fall 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} The subsequent court-martial exonerated Perry, placing blame on the ship's pilot.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;His progression from being the subject of a [[court-martial]] for running aground to being a formidable commander who made a real difference has a striking parallel to the career of Admiral [[Chester W.

Following the court-martial, Perry was given a leave of absence from the Navy. On May 5, 1811, he married Elizabeth Champlin Mason of Newport, Rhode Island, whom he had met at a dance in 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;/&gt; They enjoyed an extended honeymoon touring New England. The couple would eventually have five children, with one dying in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/pevi/historyculture/perry.htm|title=Oliver Hazard Perry – Perry's Victory &amp; International Peace Memorial|access-date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812==

At the beginning of the War of 1812, the British [[Royal Navy]] controlled the [[Great Lakes]], except for [[Lake Huron]], while the United States Navy controlled [[Lake Champlain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs06|Skaggs, 2006]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The American naval forces were very small, allowing the British to make many advances in the Great Lakes and northern New York [[:File:Grlakes lawrence map.png|waterways]]. The roles played by commanders like Perry, at [[Lake Erie]] and [[Isaac Chauncey]] at [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Thomas Macdonough]] at Lake Champlain all proved vital to the naval effort. Naval historian [[E. B. Potter]] noted that &quot;all naval officers of the day made a special study of [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson's]] battles&quot;. Oliver Perry was no exception.
&lt;ref name=potter&gt;[[#Potter|Potter, 1981]], p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
At his request, he was given command of the American naval forces on Lake Erie during the war. Secretary of the Navy [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] had charged prominent merchant seaman [[Daniel Dobbins]] with building the American fleet on [[Presque Isle Bay]] at [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and Perry was named chief naval officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Portrait&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFUYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT386 |title=The national portrait gallery of distinguished Americans |volume=1 |first1=James |last1=Herring |first2=James Barton |last2=Longacre |publisher=D.

On September 10, 1813, Perry's command fought a successful [[fleet action]] against a squadron of the Royal Navy in the Battle of Lake Erie. It was at the outset of this battle that Perry famously said, &quot;If a victory is to be gained, I will gain it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb__Od5AAAAMAAJ/page/n324 &lt;!-- pg=283 --&gt; Farmer, Silas.

Perry's [[flagship]], {{USS|Lawrence|1813|6}}, was so severely disabled in the encounter that the British commander, [[Robert Heriot Barclay]], thought that Perry would surrender it, and sent a small boat to request that the American vessel pull down its flag. Faithful to the words of his [[Naval Ensign|battle flag]], &quot;DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot; (a paraphrase of the dying words of Captain [[James Lawrence]], the ship's namesake and Perry's friend),&lt;ref name=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/trivia02.htm |title=Famous Navy Quotes: Who Said Them and When |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |access-date=September 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923044759/http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/trivia02.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Once aboard, Perry dispatched ''Niagara''{{'s}} commander, Captain [[Jesse Elliott]], to bring the other schooners into closer action while he steered ''Niagara'' toward the damaged British ships. Like Nelson's {{HMS|Victory||2}} at Trafalgar, ''Niagara'' broke the opposing line. Perry's force pounded Barclay's ships until they could offer no effective resistance and surrendered. Although he had won the battle aboard ''Niagara'', he received the British surrender on the deck of the recaptured ''Lawrence'' to allow the British to see the terrible price his men had paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer&quot;/&gt; Perry's battle report to General [[William Henry Harrison]] was famously brief: &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;quotes&quot;/&gt;{{#Tag:Ref|The British order of battle was actually two ships, ''one'' brig, ''two'' schooners and one sloop.&lt;ref name=rooz/&gt;{{rp|260–261}} &quot;Perry's message was inaccurate.&quot; &lt;ref name = altoff/&gt;{{rp|Note 129, p. 97.}}|group=upper-alpha}}

This was the first time in history that an entire British naval squadron had surrendered, and every captured ship was successfully returned to Presque Isle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs00|Skaggs, 2000]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skaggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2009-04/perry-triumphant |last1=Skaggs |first1=David Curtis |title=Perry Triumphant |date=April 2009 |volume=23 |journal=[[Naval History (magazine)|Naval History Magazine]] |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] |access-date=September 3, 2011 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the engagement was small compared to Napoleonic naval battles such as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the victory had disproportionate strategic importance, opening Canada up to possible invasion, while simultaneously protecting the entire [[Ohio Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_HIcc8n3K4C&amp;pg=PA48 Symonds, Craig L; Clipson, William J.

In fact, Perry was involved in nine battles that led to and followed the Battle of Lake Erie, and they all had a seminal impact. &quot;What is often overlooked when studying Perry is how his physical participation and brilliant strategic leadership influenced the outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Capturing [[Fort George, Ontario]] in the [[Battle of Fort George]]; Destroying the British munitions at [[Olde Fort Erie]] (see [[Capture of Fort Erie]]); Rescuing five vessels from Black Rock; Building the Erie fleet; Getting the ships over the sandbar; Blocking British supplies for a month prior to battle; Planning the Thames invasion with General Harrison; Winning the Battle of Lake Erie; and Winning the Battle of Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skaggs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Battle Flag===

&quot;Don't give up the ship&quot;, a phrase repeated by Captain James Lawrence during his dying days after being wounded by enemy fire aboard the ''Chesapeake'' on June 1, 1813, became the battle cry of Oliver Hazard Perry. Perry learned of Lawrence's demise upon arrival at Presque Isle and commanded that Lawrence would be honored with the name of a brig, which would simply be called ''Lawrence''. A battle flag would also be needed, and the words of Perry's good friend Lawrence would be just the battle cry suited for the coming days. A woman named Margaret Forster Steuart, resident of Erie Pennsylvania, wife of Army Captain Thomas Steuart and sister to Thomas Forster, both friends of Perry's, Forster being commander of the Erie Light Infantry that had guarded the fleet, was enlisted to make the battle flag. With the help of her two daughters, three nieces, and a cousin, she had the flag ready for Perry within just a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skaggs |first=David Curtis |date=2013 |title=The Battle of Lake Erie and Its Aftermath |url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/890518 |location=Ohio |publisher=The Kent State University Press |page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2009, Perry's flag, Steuart's work, and Lawrence's dying words can still be seen today, as the flag has been placed on display at [[Bancroft Hall]].

===Perry–Elliott controversy===
[[File:NH&amp;HC43575.jpg|thumb|280px|Mural: ''Battle of Lake Erie, 10 September 1813.'' (1959) by Charles Robert Patterson and Howard B. French, U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. ''Niagara'' joins the battle. ''Detroit'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' at right.]]
While Nelson had [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Collingwood]], Perry had Jesse Elliott, and was considerably less well served. Elliott, while serving with [[Isaac Chauncey]] at Lake Ontario, was tasked to augment Perry's squadron with 11 officers and 91 men, &quot;and none were sent but the worst.&quot;&lt;ref name=altoff2&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Altoff|first=Gerard T.|title=Deep Water Sailors Shallow Water Soldiers: Manning the United States Fleet on Lake Erie – 1813|publisher=The Perry Group|location=[[Put-in-Bay, Ohio|Put-in-Bay, OH]]|year = 1993 | pages= 23–24| isbn = 978-1887794015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, detailed by Chauncey to command ''Niagara,'' Elliott stated &quot;that if he could have foreseen that he himself should be sent to Lake Erie, his selections would have been different.&quot;&lt;ref name=altoff2/&gt; Elliott then appropriated the &quot;best of the worst&quot; for ''Niagara''; and Perry &quot;in the interest of harmony&quot; accepted the situation, though with growing ill-will.&lt;ref name=altoff2/&gt;

In his initial post-action report, Perry had praised Captain Elliott's role in the American victory at Lake Erie; and as news of the battle spread, Perry and Elliott were both celebrated as national heroes. Soon after, however, several junior officers publicly criticized Elliott's performance during the battle, charging that Elliott allowed ''Lawrence'' to suffer the brunt of the British fire while holding ''Niagara'' back from the fight. William Vigneron Taylor, Perry's [[sailing master]], in a letter to Taylor's wife, put it thus:

{{quote|The ''Lawrence'' alone rec'd the fire of the whole British squadron 2 1/2 hours within pistol shot—we were not supported as we ought to have been. Captain Perry led the ''Lawrence'' into action &amp; sustained the most destructive fire with the most gallant spirit perhaps that was ever witnessed under similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last =Taylor | first =William V. | title =Logbook of the USS ''Lawrence'' | publisher =Newport Historical Society | year =1813 | location =[[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport, RI]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;|William Taylor, 15 September 1813}}

The meeting between Elliott and Perry on the deck of ''Niagara'' was terse. Elliott inquired how the day was going. Perry replied, &quot;Badly.&quot; Elliott then volunteered to take Perry's small boat and rally the schooners, and Perry acquiesced.&lt;ref name=altoff/&gt;{{rp|49}} As Perry turned ''Niagara'' into the battle, Elliott was not aboard. Elliott's rejoinder to history's criticism of inaction was that there had been a lack of effective signaling. Charges were filed, but not officially acted upon. Attempting to restore his honor, Elliott and his supporters began a 30-year campaign that would outlive both men and ultimately leave his reputation in tatters.&lt;ref name=Skaggs/&gt;

In Perry's report to Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]], written three days after the battle, he mentioned Elliott in what, at first, seem to be complimentary terms, but, when read carefully, betray his disdain for Elliott.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Perry wrote, &quot;In this action he evinced his characteristic bravery and judgement; and, since the close of the action, has given me the most able and essential assistance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;American State Papers. Naval Affairs. Volume 1. pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional Gold Medal===

On January 6, 1814, Perry was honored with a [[Congressional Gold Medal]],&lt;ref name=Medal&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/medallichistoryo02loub/medallichistoryo02loub_djvu.txt |author=J.

Elliott was also recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal&lt;ref name=Medal/&gt; and the Thanks of Congress for his actions in the battle. This recognition would prove to fan the flames of resentment on both sides of the Elliott–Perry controversy.&lt;ref name=Skaggs/&gt;

In recognition of his victory at Lake Erie, in 1813 Perry was elected as an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

==Later commands and controversies==
[[File:OliverHazardPerryEngraving.jpg|thumb|upright|United States Navy engraved portrait of Commodore Perry]]

In May 1814, Perry took command of a squadron of seven gunboats based in Newport. He held this command for only two months as in July he was placed in command of {{USS|Java|1815|6}}, a 44-gun frigate which was under construction in [[Baltimore]]. While overseeing the outfitting of ''Java'', Perry participated in the defenses of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the British invasion of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In a twist of irony, these land battles would be the last time the career naval officer saw combat. The [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed before ''Java'' could be put to sea.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

For Perry, the post-war years were marred by controversies. In 1815, he commanded ''Java'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the [[Second Barbary War]]. While moored in Naples, Perry slapped the commander of the ship's Marines, Captain John Heath, whom Perry considered incompetent and insubordinate. The ensuing court-martial found both men guilty, but levied only mild reprimands. After the crew returned home, Heath challenged Perry to a pistol [[duel]], which was fought on October 19, 1817, on the same field in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]] where [[Burr–Hamilton duel|Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton]]. Heath fired first and missed. Perry declined to return fire, satisfying the Marine's honor.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

Perry's return from the Mediterranean also reignited the feud with Elliott. After an exchange of angry letters, Elliott challenged Perry to a duel, which Perry refused. (While it was normally considered cowardly to refuse a duel, Perry's stature as a hero was such that no one doubted his physical courage and few felt that Perry had wrongly offended Elliott's honor.) He instead, on August 8, 1818, filed formal court-martial charges against Elliott. Perry filed a total of six charges and twenty-one specifications including &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer,&quot; and failure to &quot;do his utmost to take or destroy the vessel of the enemy which it was his duty to encounter.&quot;

Wishing to avoid a scandal between two decorated naval heroes, Secretary of the Navy [[Smith Thompson]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] suppressed the matter by offering Perry a diplomatic mission to [[South America]] in exchange for dropping his charges. This put an official end to the controversy, though it would continue to be debated for another quarter century.&lt;ref name=Skaggs2&gt;{{cite book|title=Oliver Hazard Perry: Honor, Courage, and Patriotism in the Early U.S. Navy|first1=David Curtis |last1=Skaggs|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2006|pages=191–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAA05BcoIkgC&amp;pg=PR6 |access-date=September 3, 2011|isbn=978-1-59114-792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission to Venezuela and death==
In 1818 Perry purchased a [https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1199929800/ large house] on Washington Square in Newport which was built in 1750 for merchant Peter Buloid. The house remained in the Perry family until 1865 and now serves as the headquarters for {{ship|SSV|Oliver Hazard Perry||2}}, a [[sail training ship]].

In 1819, Perry sailed for the [[Orinoco River]], [[Venezuela]], aboard of the [[frigate]] {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}} with the frigate {{USS|Constellation|1797|2}} and the schooner {{USS|Nonsuch|1813|6}}, arriving on July 15 to discourage piracy, while still maintaining friendly relations with [[Republic of Venezuela]] and the [[United Provinces of South America|Republic of Buenos Aires]]. Shifting his flag to USS ''Nonsuch'', due to its shallower draft, Perry sailed upriver to [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]] to negotiate an anti-piracy agreement with President [[Simón Bolívar]]. A favorable treaty was signed on August 11 with Vice-President [[Francisco Antonio Zea]] in the absence of Bolivar (who was engaged in the liberation of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]]), but when the schooner started downriver, many of her crew, including Perry, had been stricken with [[yellow fever]].

Despite the crew's efforts to reach [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]] for medical assistance, the commodore died on board USS ''Nonsuch'' on August 23, 1819, his 34th birthday, as the ship entered the [[Gulf of Paria]] and was nearing [[Port of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/america/unitedstates/1783/1809/1809/perry-oh.htm Oliver Hazard Perry] Robinson Library accessed November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Port of Spain]] with great honors while the ''Nonsuch''{{'}}s crew acted as [[Guard of honour|honor guard]].

His remains were later taken back to the United States in 1826 and interred in Newport, Rhode Island. Originally interred in the Old [[Common Burial Ground]], his body was eventually moved to Newport's [[Island Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;sid=af7ec6e6a62cb051e355616f708c9a7f;rgn=full%20text;idno=AJA1974.0001.001;view=image;seq=0401 Drake, Samuel Adams, 1833–1905.

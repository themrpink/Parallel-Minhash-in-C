After the collapse of his businesses, Balzac traveled to [[Brittany]] and stayed with the De Pommereul family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86-805861/|title=Campaign of General Buonaparte in Italy, during the fourth and fifth years of the French republic /|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside [[Fougères]]. There he drew inspiration for ''[[Les Chouans]]'' (1829), a tale of love gone wrong amid the [[Chouannerie|Chouan]] royalist forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb298&quot;/&gt; Although Balzac was a supporter of the [[House of Bourbon|Crown]], Balzac paints the revolutionaries in a sympathetic light—even though they are the center of the book's most brutal scenes. This was the first book Balzac released under his own name, and it gave him what one critic called &quot;passage into the Promised Land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xix&lt;/ref&gt; It established him as an author of note (even if its historical fiction-genre imitates that of [[Sir Walter Scott]]) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms.

Soon afterwards, around the time of his father's death, Balzac wrote ''[[El Verdugo (short story)|El Verdugo]]''—about a 30-year-old man who kills his father (Balzac was 30 years old at the time). This was the first work signed &quot;Honoré ''de'' Balzac&quot;. He followed his father in the surname Balzac but added the aristocratic-sounding nobiliary particle to help him fit into respected society, a choice based on skill rather than by right. &quot;The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power&quot;, he wrote in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the decision was also significant; as Robb explained: &quot;The disappearance of the father coincides with the adoption of the nobiliary particle. A symbolic inheritance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Just as his father had worked his way up from poverty into respectable society, Balzac considered toil and effort his real mark of nobility.

When the [[July Revolution]] overthrew [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] in 1830, Balzac declared himself a [[Legitimist]], supporting King Charles' [[House of Bourbon|Royal House of Bourbon]], but not without qualifications. He felt that the new [[July Monarchy]] (which claimed widespread popular support) was disorganized and unprincipled, in need of a mediator to keep the political peace between the King and insurgent forces. He called for &quot;a young and vigorous man who belongs neither to the Directoire nor to the Empire, but who is 1830 incarnate....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robb, 190&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to be such a [[candidate]], appealing especially to the higher classes in [[Chinon]]. But after a near-fatal accident in 1832 (he slipped and cracked his head on the street), Balzac decided not to stand for election.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 193&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dessin de Nadar 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Balzac caricature by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] in 1850]]

1831 saw the success of ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'' (''The Wild Ass's Skin'' or ''The Magic Skin''), a fable-like tale about a despondent young man named Raphaël de Valentin who finds an animal skin which promises great power and wealth. He obtains these things, but loses the ability to manage them. In the end, his health fails and he is consumed by his own confusion. Balzac meant the story to bear witness to the treacherous turns of life, its &quot;serpentine motion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833 Balzac released ''[[Eugénie Grandet]]'', his first best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 155&lt;/ref&gt; The tale of a young lady who inherits her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career. The writing is simple, yet the individuals (especially the bourgeois title character) are dynamic and complex.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 120&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by ''[[La Duchesse de Langeais]]'', arguably the most sublime of his novels.

''[[Le Père Goriot]]'' (''Old Father Goriot'', 1835) was his next success, in which Balzac transposes the story of ''[[King Lear]]'' to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BEnAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=annee+balzacienne+donald+adamson&amp;dq=annee+balzacienne+donald+adamson &quot;Le Père Goriot devant la critique anglaise&quot;, ''L'Année Balzacienne'' [[Donald Adamson]] (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt; The centrality of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau,&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 258&lt;/ref&gt; but also the fact that he had fathered a child, [[Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay]], with his otherwise-married lover, [[Maria Du Fresnay]], who had been his source of inspiration for ''[[Eugénie Grandet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836 Balzac took the helm of the ''Chronique de Paris'', a weekly magazine of society and politics. He tried to enforce strict impartiality in its pages and a reasoned assessment of various ideologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb, 272&quot;&gt;Robb, 272&lt;/ref&gt; As Rogers notes, &quot;Balzac was interested in any social, political, or economic theory, whether from the right or the left.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine failed, but in July 1840 he founded another publication, the ''Revue Parisienne''. It produced three issues.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 326&lt;/ref&gt;

These dismal business efforts—and his misadventures in [[Sardinia]]—provided an appropriate ''milieu'' in which to set the two-volume ''[[Illusions perdues]]'' (''Lost Illusions'', 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet trying to make a name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb, 272&quot;/&gt; ''[[Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes]]'' (''The Harlot High and Low'', 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera ([[Vautrin]]) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 168&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Le Cousin Pons]]'' (1847) and ''[[La Cousine Bette]]'' (1848) tell the story of ''Les Parents Pauvres'' (''The Poor Relations''). The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author as a young law clerk. Balzac's health was deteriorating by this point, making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his novels were initially serialized, like those of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. Their length was not predetermined. ''Illusions Perdues'' extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas ''[[La Fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (''The Girl with the Golden Eyes'', 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.

===Work habits===
Balzac's work habits were legendary. He wrote from 1 am to 8 am every morning and sometimes even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Balzac, A Biography, Graham Robb, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He often worked for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Balzac Beatrix Proof.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Initial proofs of ''[[Béatrix (Balzac)|Béatrix]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Balzac revised obsessively, covering printer's proofs with changes and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during the publication of a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some—such as ''Les employés'' (''The Government Clerks'', 1841)—are nonetheless noted by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Balzac was &quot;by turns a hermit and a vagrant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, EB, 299&lt;/ref&gt; he managed to stay in tune with the social spheres which nourished his writing. He was friends with [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Pierre-Marie-Charles de Bernard du Grail de la Villette]], and he was acquainted with [[Victor Hugo]]. Nevertheless, he did not spend as much time in ''salons'' and [[Gentlemen's club|clubs]] of Paris like many of his characters. &quot;In the first place he was too busy&quot;, explains Saintsbury, &quot;in the second he would not have been at home there.... [H]e felt it was his business not to frequent society but to create it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; However he often spent long periods at the [[Château de Saché]], near [[Tours]], the home of his friend Jean de Margonne, his mother's lover and father to her youngest child. Many of Balzac's tormented characters were conceived in the chateau's small second-floor bedroom. Today the [[chateau]] is a museum dedicated to the author's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leschateauxdelaloire.org/chateaux/273091-musee-balzac|title=Musée Balzac - Les châteaux de la Loire|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=26 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930091618/http://www.leschateauxdelaloire.org/chateaux/273091-musee-balzac|archivedate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and romantic relationships===
In 1833, as he revealed in a letter to his sister, Balzac entered into an illicit affair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Revue de Paris, Volume 67, Part 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhgZAAAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Bureau de la Revue de Paris.|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; with fellow writer [[Maria Du Fresnay]], who was then aged 24. Her marriage to a considerably older man (Charles du Fresnay, Mayor of [[Sartrouville]]) had been a failure from the outset.&lt;ref name = &quot;chancerel_pierrot&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1=Chancerel|first1=Pierrot|title=La véritable Eugénie Grandet : Marie du Fresnay|magazine=Revue des sciences humaines|date=October–November 1955|language=French|trans-title=The real Eugénie Grandet: Marie du Fresnay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this letter, Balzac also reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant with his child. In 1834, 8 months after the event, [[Maria Du Fresnay]]'s daughter by Balzac, [[Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay]], was born. This revelation from French journalist [[:fr:Roger Pierrot|Roger Pierrot]] in 1955 confirmed what was already suspected by several historians: the dedicatee of the novel [[Eugénie Grandet]], a certain &quot;Maria&quot;, turns out to be [[Maria Du Fresnay]] herself.

In February 1832 Balzac received an intriguing letter from [[Odessa]]—with no return address and signed simply &quot;''L'Étrangère''&quot; (&quot;The Foreigner&quot;)—expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in ''La Peau de Chagrin'' and its negative portrayal of women. His response was to place a [[classified advertisement]] in the ''Gazette de France'', hoping that his anonymous critic would see it. Thus began a fifteen-year correspondence between Balzac and &quot;the object of [his] sweetest dreams&quot;: [[Ewelina Hańska]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hanska Holz Sowgen 1825.jpg|thumb|left|[[Countess]] [[Ewelina Hańska]] miniature by Holz von Sowgen (1825)]]
Ewelina (''née'' Rzewuska) was married to a [[Szlachta|nobleman]] twenty years her senior, [[Marshal]] [[Wacław Hański]], a wealthy Polish landowner living near [[Kiev]]. It had been a [[marriage of convenience]] to preserve her [[Rzewuski family|family]]'s fortune. In Balzac Countess Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires, with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 227&lt;/ref&gt; Their correspondence reveals an intriguing balance of passion, propriety and patience; [[Graham Robb|Robb]] says it is &quot;like an experimental novel in which the female protagonist is always trying to pull in extraneous realities but which the hero is determined to keep on course, whatever tricks he has to use&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshal Hański died in 1841, and his widow and her admirer finally had the chance to pursue their affections. A rival of the Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]], Balzac visited Countess Hańska in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1843 and won her heart.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 340&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of financial setbacks, health problems and objections from [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], the couple finally received permission to wed.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 261&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 1850, with Balzac's health in serious decline, they travelled by carriage from her [[family seat]] at [[:fr:Verkhovnia|Verhivnya]] [[Park#Private parks|Park]] in [[Volhynian Governorate|Volhynia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balzac-museum.com/contacts.html|title=Адреса музею Оноре де Бальзака у Верхівні|website=Balzac-museum.com|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[St. Barbara's Church, Berdychiv|St. Barbara's Catholic Church]] in [[Berdychiv]] ([[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s former banking city in present-day [[Ukraine]]), where they were married by Abbot Ożarowski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berdichev.org/distinghished_shrines_of_berdichev.html |title=Distinguished Shrines of Berdichev |accessdate=30 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923183609/http://www.berdichev.org/distinghished_shrines_of_berdichev.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |website=The Berdichev Revival }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten-hour journey to and from the ceremony took a toll on both husband and wife: her feet were too swollen to walk, and he endured severe heart trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he married late in life, Balzac had already written two treatises on marriage: ''Physiologie du Mariage'' and ''Scènes de la Vie Conjugale''. These works lacked firsthand knowledge; Saintsbury points out that &quot;cœlebs cannot talk of [marriage] with much authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbxxiv&quot;&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; In late April the newly-weds set off for Paris. His health deteriorated on the way, and Ewelina wrote to her daughter about Balzac being &quot;in a state of extreme weakness&quot; and &quot;sweating profusely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robb, 404&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived in the French capital on 20 May, his fifty-first birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 404&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Père-Lachaise - Division 48 - Balzac 07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Balzac's statue in the [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise]]]]
Five months after his wedding, on Sunday, 18 August 1850, Balzac died in the presence of his mother; [[Ewelina Hańska|Eve de Balzac (''formerly'' Countess Hańska)]] had gone to bed.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 263&lt;/ref&gt; He had been visited that day by [[Victor Hugo]], who later served as a [[pallbearer]] and the [[eulogy|eulogist]] at Balzac's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, EB, 301&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac is buried at [[Cimetière du Père Lachaise|Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris. At his [[memorial service]], Victor Hugo pronounced &quot;Today we have people in black because of the death of the man of talent; a nation in mourning for a man of genius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The full text is available at [http://www.gavroche.org/vhugo/balzaceulogy.shtml Victor Hugo Central].&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was attended by &quot;almost every writer in Paris&quot;, including [[Frédérick Lemaître]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas ''père'']] and [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Dumas ''fils'']],&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 412&lt;/ref&gt; as well as representatives of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and other dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/fr/decores/honore-de-balzac/89|title=Honoré de Balzac - La grande chancellerie|website=Legiondhonneur.fr|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a [[statue]] (called the [[Auguste Rodin#Balzac|Monument à Balzac]]) was created by the celebrated French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. Cast in bronze, the [[Monument to Balzac|Balzac Monument]] has stood since 1939 nearby the intersection of [[Boulevard Raspail]] and [[Boulevard Montparnasse]] at Place Pablo-Picasso. Rodin featured Balzac in several of his smaller sculptures as well.

==Writing style==
The ''Comédie Humaine'' remained unfinished at the time of his death—Balzac had plans to include numerous other books, most of which he never started.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 405&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently flitted between [[work in progress|works in progress]]. &quot;Finished articles&quot; were frequently revised between editions. This piecemeal style is reflective of the author's own life, a possible attempt to stabilize it through fiction. &quot;The vanishing man&quot;, wrote Sir Victor Pritchett, &quot;who must be pursued from the [[Montparnasse|rue Cassini]] to&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;[[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Ville d'Avray]], Italy, and [[Vienna]] can construct a settled dwelling only in his work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchett, 161&quot;/&gt;

===Realism===
[[File:Monument to Balzac.jpg|thumb|''[[Monument to Balzac]]'' by [[Auguste Rodin]] at Place Pablo-Picasso, Paris]]
Balzac's extensive use of detail, especially the detail of objects, to illustrate the lives of his characters made him an early pioneer of literary [[realism (arts)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 16&lt;/ref&gt; While he admired and drew inspiration from the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style of [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] [[Walter Scott]], Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 21&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the first edition of ''Scènes de la Vie privée'', he wrote: &quot;the author firmly believes that details alone will henceforth determine the merit of works&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rogers, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Plentiful descriptions of décor, clothing, and possessions help breathe life into the characters.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 26&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Balzac's friend [[Henri de Latouche]] had a good knowledge of hanging wallpaper. Balzac transferred this to his descriptions of the [[Vautrin|Pension Vauquer]] in ''Le Père Goriot'', making the wallpaper speak of the identities of those living inside.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics consider Balzac's writing exemplary of [[French literature of the 19th century#Naturalism|naturalism]]—a more pessimistic and analytical form of realism, which seeks to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist [[Émile Zola]] declared Balzac the father of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 421&lt;/ref&gt; Zola indicated that whilst the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characters====
Balzac sought to present his characters as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. &quot;To arrive at the truth&quot;, he wrote in the preface to ''[[Lily of the Valley (novel)|Le Lys dans la vallée]]'', &quot;writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rogers, 161&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Balzac's characters&quot;, Robb notes, &quot;were as real to him as if he were observing them in the outside world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 254&lt;/ref&gt; This reality was noted by playwright [[Oscar Wilde]], who said: &quot;One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [''Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes'' protagonist] Lucien de Rubempré.... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the characters depict a particular range of social types: the noble soldier, the scoundrel, the proud workman, the fearless spy, the alluring mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Helm, 23&lt;/ref&gt; That Balzac was able to balance the strength of the individual against the representation of the type is evidence of the author's skill. One critic explained that &quot;there is a center and a circumference to Balzac's world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lehan, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac's use of repeat characters, moving in and out of the ''Comédie'''s books, strengthens the realist representation. &quot;When the characters reappear&quot;, notes Rogers, &quot;they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 182&lt;/ref&gt; He also used a realist technique which French novelist [[Marcel Proust]] later termed &quot;retrospective illumination&quot;, whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.

[[Image:Balzac1901.jpg|thumb|left|''The Works of Honoré de Balzac'' (1901), including ''[[Le Père Goriot]]'']]
A nearly infinite reserve of energy propels the characters in Balzac's novels. Struggling against the currents of human nature and society, they may lose more often than they win—but only rarely do they give up. This universal trait is a reflection of Balzac's own social wrangling, that of his family, and an interest in the Austrian mystic and physician [[Franz Mesmer]], who pioneered the study of [[animal magnetism]]. Balzac spoke often of a &quot;nervous and fluid force&quot; between individuals, and Raphaël de Valentin's decline in ''La Peau de Chagrin'' exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from other people's company.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

====Place====
Representations of the city, countryside, and building interiors are essential to Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early [[French literature of the 19th century#Naturalism|naturalist]]. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages.&lt;ref&gt;Helm, 5&lt;/ref&gt; As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes that he had made on previous visits.&lt;ref&gt;Bertault, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Paris permeates ''La Comédie'': nature defers to the artificial [[metropolis]], in contrast to descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the [[countryside]]. &quot;If in Paris&quot;, Rogers says, &quot;we are in a man-made region where even the seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Balzac said, &quot;the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Balzac. ''Histoire des Treize: Ferragus, chef des dévorants'', XIII, 13; quoted in Rogers, 45&lt;/ref&gt; His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist [[Charles Dickens]] and Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 22&lt;/ref&gt; The centrality of Paris in ''La Comédie Humaine'' is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. &quot;Realism is nothing if not urban&quot;, notes critic [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]]; the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as ''[[Illusions Perdues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehan, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac visited the [[Château de Saché]] in Touraine which was owned by his friend Jean de Margonne (who was also his mother's lover), between 1830 and 1837, and wrote many of his novels in the series &quot;La Comedie Humaine&quot; there. It is now a Museum dedicated to Balzac where one can see his writing desk and quill pen and chair.

===Perspective===
Balzac's literary mood evolved over time from one of despondency and chagrin to that of solidarity and courage—but not optimism.&lt;ref&gt;Helm, 130&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Peau de Chagrin'', among his earliest novels, is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction. But the cynicism declined as his ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]'' developed, and the characters of ''Illusions Perdues'' reveal sympathy for those who are pushed to one side by society. As part of the 19th-century evolution of the novel as a &quot;democratic literary form&quot;, Balzac wrote that ''&quot;les livres sont faits pour tout le monde&quot;'' (&quot;books are written for everybody&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Prendergast, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac concerned himself overwhelmingly with the darker essence of human nature and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 128&lt;/ref&gt; His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets ''incognito'' among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb, 70&quot;&gt;Robb, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like ''Eugénie Grandet'' and ''Louis Lambert''.&lt;ref&gt;Robb and Sir Victor Pritchett cite specific examples, included in Biography, above.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Balzac was a [[Legitimism|legitimist]]; in many ways, his views are the antithesis of [[Victor Hugo]]'s democratic republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/courtesans/Balzac.html|title=Balzac: A Fight Against Decandence and Materialism|website=Mtholyoke.edu|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, in his essay &quot;Society and the Individual&quot;:

&quot;The only absolute authority which the imagination has been able to conceive, the authority of God, works according to rules which He has imposed on Himself. He can destroy all His worlds and return to His rest, but while He allows them to exist, they continue to be governed by the laws which together create order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delahanty|first=James J.|date=September 1963|title=Catholic Political Thought 1789-1848.

Nevertheless, his keen insight regarding working-class conditions earned him the esteem of many socialists including Marxists. [[Engels]] declared that Balzac was his favorite writer. Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' also makes some references to the works of Balzac, and Trotsky famously read Balzac in the middle of meetings of the Central Committee, much to the consternation of his colleagues and comrades.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Balzac bust by Rodin1892.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Bust of Balzac'' by [[Auguste Rodin]] (1892), displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London&lt;/center&gt;]]
Balzac influenced writers of his time and beyond. He has been compared to [[Charles Dickens]] and is considered one of Dickens' significant influences. Literary critic W. H. Helm calls one &quot;the French Dickens&quot; and the other &quot;the English Balzac&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Helm, 124&lt;/ref&gt; while another critic, Richard Lehan, states that &quot;Balzac was the bridge between the comic realism of Dickens and the naturalism of [[Émile Zola|Zola]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lehan, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustave Flaubert]] was also substantially influenced by Balzac. Praising his portrayal of society while attacking his [[prose]] style, Flaubert once wrote: &quot;What a man he would have been had he known how to write!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Robb, 422&lt;/ref&gt; While he disdained the label of &quot;realist&quot;, Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 54&lt;/ref&gt; This influence shows in Flaubert's work ''L'éducation sentimentale'' which owes a debt to Balzac's ''Illusions Perdues''.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 27&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What Balzac started&quot;, observes Lehan, &quot;Flaubert helped finish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehan, 48&quot;&gt;Lehan, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Proust]] similarly learned from the [[Literary realism|Realist]] example; he adored Balzac and studied his works carefully, although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac's &quot;vulgarity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proust, 56ff&lt;/ref&gt; Balzac's story ''Une Heure de ma Vie'' (''An Hour of my Life'', 1822), in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections, is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb, 70&quot;/&gt; However, Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was &quot;madness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Proust, 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the author most affected by Balzac was American expatriate novelist [[Henry James]]. In 1878 James wrote with sadness about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: &quot;Large as Balzac is, he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James (1878), 89&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote with admiration of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing &quot;a beast with a hundred claws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James (1914), 127&lt;/ref&gt; In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: &quot;the artist of the ''Comédie Humaine'' is half smothered by the historian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James (1914), 115&lt;/ref&gt; Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehan, 48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stowe, 28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Saroyan]] wrote a short story about Balzac in his 1971 book, ''[[Letters from 74 rue Taitbout]] or Don't Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody''.

Balzac's vision of a society in which class, money and personal ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, vii&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote: &quot;I have learned more [from Balzac] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl and Engels, Frederick Engels (1947). ''Literature and Art: Selections from Their Writings''. New York. Quoted in Rogers, ix&lt;/ref&gt; Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Camille Paglia]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 423&lt;/ref&gt; He was also praised by [[James Baldwin]], who said 1984: &quot;I’m sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [He taught me] the way that country and its society works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elgrably, Jordan. [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2994/the-art-of-fiction-no-78-james-baldwin &quot;James Baldwin, The Art of Fiction No. 78&quot;]. ''[[The Paris Review]]''. No. 91: Spring 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 [[Roland Barthes]] published ''[[S/Z]]'', a detailed analysis of Balzac's story ''[[Sarrasine]]'' and a key work in [[Structuralism#Structuralism in literary theory and literary criticism|structuralist]] literary criticism.

Balzac has also influenced popular culture. Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials, including: [[Travers Vale]]'s ''Père Goriot'' (1915), ''Les Chouans'' (1947), ''Le Père Goriot'' (1968 BBC mini-series), and ''La Cousine Bette'' (1974 BBC mini-series, starring [[Margaret Tyzack]] and [[Helen Mirren]]; 1998 film, starring [[Jessica Lange]]). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in [[Meredith Willson]]'s musical ''[[The Music Man]]''. He is included in [[François Truffaut]]'s 1959 film, ''[[The 400 Blows]]''. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers.&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, François et al. ''Correspondence, 1945–1984''. New York: Cooper Square Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8154-1024-7}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

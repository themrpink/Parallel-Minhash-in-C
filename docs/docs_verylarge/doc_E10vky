'''Indigo dye''' is an [[organic compound]] with a distinctive [[indigo|blue color]]. Historically, indigo was a [[natural dye]] extracted from the leaves of some plants of the [[Indigofera#Uses|''Indigofera'']] genus, in particular ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]''; dye wielding ''Indigofera'' plants were commonly grown and used throughout the world, in Asia in particular, as an important crop, with the production of indigo dyestuff economically important due to the previous rarity of some blue dyestuffs historically.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Most indigo [[dye]] produced today is [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]], constituting several thousand tons each year. It is most commonly associated with the production of [[denim]] cloth and [[jeans|blue jeans]], where its properties allow for effects such as [[stone washing]] and [[stone washing#acid-washed jeans|acid washing]] to be applied quickly.

==Uses==
[[File:Indigo plant extract sample.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Indigo dye]]
The primary use for indigo is as a dye for cotton yarn, mainly used in the production of denim cloth suitable for blue jeans; on average, a pair of blue jeans requires just {{convert|3|g}} - {{convert|12|g}} of dye to produce. Smaller quantities are used in the dyeing of wool and silk.

[[Indigo carmine]], also known as indigo, is an indigo derivative which is also used as a colorant. About 20 thousand tons are produced annually, again mainly for the production of blue jeans.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|doi= 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2|title= Indigo and Indigo Colorants|year= 2004|last1= Steingruber|first1= Elmar|isbn= 3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a food colorant, and is listed in the United States as [[FD&amp;C]] Blue No. 2.

===Natural sources===
{{see also|#Indigo derivatives}}
A variety of plants have provided indigo throughout history, but most natural indigo was obtained from those in the genus ''Indigofera'', which are native to the [[tropics]], notably the Indian subcontinent. The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (''Indigofera tinctoria'', also known as ''I. sumatrana''). A common alternative used in the relatively colder subtropical locations such as Japan's {{lang|ja-Latn|Ryukyu|italic=no}} Islands and Taiwan is ''[[Strobilanthes|Strobilanthes cusia]]''. 

Until the introduction of ''Indigofera'' species from the south, ''[[Polygonum tinctorum]]'' (''Dyer's knotweed'') was the most important blue dyestuff in East Asia; however, the crop produced less dyestuff than the average crop of indigo, and was quickly surpassed in terms of favour for the more economical ''Indigofera tinctoria'' plant. In [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the species grown is ''[[Indigofera suffruticosa]]'', also known as ''anil''. In Europe, [[Isatis tinctoria]], commonly known as ''woad'', was used for dyeing fabrics blue, containing the same dyeing compounds as indigo, also referred to as indigo.

Several plants contain indigo, which, when exposed to an oxidising source such as atmospheric oxygen, reacts to produce indigo dye; however, the relatively low concentrations of indigo in these plants make them difficult to work with, with the color more easily tainted by other dye substances also present in these plants, typically leading to a greenish tinge.

The precursor to indigo is [[indican]], a colorless, water-soluble derivative of the amino acid [[tryptophan]]. Indican readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] to release β-D-[[glucose]] and [[indoxyl]]. [[Oxidation]] by exposure to air converts indoxyl to indigotin, the insoluble blue chemical that is the endpoint of indigo dye. Indican was obtained from the processing of the plant's leaves, which contain as much as 0.2–0.8% of this compound. The leaves were soaked in water and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] to convert the [[glycoside]] indican present in the plant to the blue dye '''indigotin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schorlemmer|first=Carl|authorlink= Carl Schorlemmer|title=A Manual of the Chemistry of the Carbon compounds; or, Organic Chemistry|url=https://archive.org/details/amanualchemistr02schogoog|location=London|year=1874}} Quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; They precipitate from the fermented leaf solution when mixed with a strong base&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coyuchi.com/the-naturalista/indigo_dyeing/|title=Indigo Dyeing|website=Coyuchi Inc.|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[sodium hydroxide|lye]], pressed into cakes, dried, and powdered. The powder was then mixed with various other substances to produce different shades of blue and purple.

Natural sources of indigo also include mollusks; the [[Murex]] sea snail produces a mixture of indigo and 6,6'-dibromoindigo (red), which together produce a range of purple hues known as [[Tyrian purple]]. Light exposure during part of the dyeing process can convert the dibromoindigo into indigo, resulting in blue hues known as royal blue, hyacinth purple, or [[tekhelet]].

|image2=Indigo Synthesis V.1.svg|caption2=Pfleger's synthesis of indigo}}

Given its economic importance, indigo has been prepared by many methods. The [[Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis]] dates back to 1882. It involves an aldol condensation of o-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone, followed by cyclization and oxidative dimerization to indigo. This route is highly useful for obtaining indigo and many of its derivatives on the laboratory scale, but proved impractical for industrial-scale synthesis. Johannes Pfleger&lt;ref name=&quot;history.evonik.com&quot;/&gt; and [[Karl Heumann]] ([[:de:Karl Heumann|de]]) eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ingenious.org.uk&quot;/&gt; 

The first commercially practical route of producing indigo is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, [[N-Phenylglycine|''N''-phenylglycine]] is treated with a molten mixture of [[sodium hydroxide]], [[potassium hydroxide]], and [[sodamide]]. This highly sensitive melt produces [[indoxyl]], which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo. Variations of this method are still in use today. An alternative and also viable route to indigo is credited to Heumann in 1897. It involves heating ''N''-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine to {{convert|200|C}} in an inert atmosphere with sodium hydroxide. The process is easier than the Pfleger method, but the precursors are more expensive. Indoxyl-2-carboxylic acid is generated. This material readily decarboxylates to give indoxyl, which oxidizes in air to form indigo.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The preparation of indigo dye is practised in college laboratory classes according to the original Baeyer-Drewsen route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKee |first1=James R. |last2=Zanger |first2=Murray |year=1991 |title=A microscale synthesis of indigo: Vat dyeing |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=68 |issue=10 |page=A242 |doi=10.1021/ed068pA242 |bibcode=1991JChEd..68..242M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Indigo-Historische Farbstoffsammlung.jpg|thumb|right| Indigo, historical dye collection of the [[Dresden University of Technology|Technical University of Dresden]], Germany]]
The oldest known fabric dyed indigo, dated to 6,000 years ago, was discovered in [[Huaca Prieta]], Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Splitstoser JC, Dillehay TD, Wouters J, Claro A|date= 2016-09-14|title= Early pre-Hispanic use of indigo blue in Peru|journal= [[Science Advances]]|volume= 2|issue= 9|pages= e1501623|doi= 10.1126/sciadv.1501623|pmid= 27652337|pmc= 5023320|bibcode= 2016SciA....2E1623S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Asian countries, such as [[India]], Japan, and [[Southeast Asia]]n nations have used indigo as a dye (particularly [[silk]] dye) for centuries. The dye was also known to ancient civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]], [[Mesoamerica]], [[Peru]], [[Iran]], and Africa. Indigo was also cultivated in India, which was also the earliest major center for its production and processing.&lt;ref name=k&amp;c&gt;Kriger &amp; Connah, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Indigofera tinctoria|I. tinctoria]]'' species was domesticated in India.&lt;ref name=k&amp;c/&gt; Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], where it was valued as a luxury product.&lt;ref name=k&amp;c/&gt;

India was a primary supplier of indigo to Europe as early as the Greco-Roman era. The association of India with indigo is reflected in the Greek word for the dye, ''indikón'' (Ἰνδικόν, Indian).&lt;ref name=&quot;StClair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Lives of Colour|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=9781473630819|location=London|page=189|oclc=936144129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans [[latin]]ized the term to ''indicum'', which passed into [[Venetian language|Italian dialect]] and eventually into English as the word indigo.

In Mesopotamia, a neo-Babylonian [[cuneiform]] tablet of the seventh century BC gives a recipe for the dyeing of wool, where [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]]-colored wool (''uqnatu'') is produced by repeated immersion and airing of the cloth.&lt;ref name=&quot;StClair&quot; /&gt; Indigo was most probably imported from India. The Romans used indigo as a pigment for painting and for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. It was a luxury item imported to the Mediterranean from India by Arab merchants.

Indigo remained a rare commodity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. A chemically identical dye derived from the woad plant ''([[Isatis tinctoria]])'' was used instead. In the late 15th century, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route to India. This led to the establishment of direct trade with India, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], China, and Japan. Importers could now avoid the heavy duties imposed by [[Iran|Persia]]n, [[Levant]]ine, and Greek middlemen and the lengthy and dangerous land routes which had previously been used. Consequently, the importation and use of indigo in Europe rose significantly. Much European indigo from Asia arrived through ports in Portugal, the Netherlands, and England. Many indigo plantations were established by European powers in tropical climates. Spain imported the dye from its colonies in Central and South America, and it was a major crop in [[Haiti]] and Jamaica, with much or all of the labor performed by enslaved Africans and African Americans. In the Spanish colonial era, intensive production of indigo for the world market in the region of modern El Salvador entailed such unhealthy conditions that the local indigenous population, forced to labor in pestilential conditions, was decimated.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Walter (6 August 1991). ''The Formation of Complex Society in Southeastern Mesoamerica''. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigo plantations also thrived in the [[Virgin Islands]]. However, France and Germany outlawed imported indigo in the 16th century to protect the local woad dye industry.

Indigo was the foundation of centuries-old textile traditions throughout West Africa. From the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads of the [[Sahara]] to [[Cameroon]], clothes dyed with indigo signified wealth. Women dyed the cloth in most areas, with the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]] and the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] of [[Mali]] particularly well known for their expertise. Among the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] male dyers, working at communal dye pits was the basis of the wealth of the ancient city of [[Kano]], and they can still be seen plying their trade today at the same pits.&lt;ref&gt;Kriger, Colleen E. &amp; Connah, Graham (2006).

Peasants in [[Bengal]] revolted against unfair treatment by the [[East India Company]] traders/planters in what became known as the [[Indigo revolt]] in 1859, during the [[British Raj]] of [[India]]. The play ''[[Nil Darpan]]'' by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]] is based on the slavery and forced cultivation of indigo.

The demand for indigo in the 19th century is indicated by the fact that in 1897, {{convert|7000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} were dedicated to the cultivation of indican-producing plants, mainly in India.

===Synthetic development===
[[File:Indigoproduktion BASF 1890.JPG|thumb|Production of Indigo dye in a [[BASF]] plant (1890)]]
In 1865 the German chemist [[Adolf von Baeyer]] began working on the synthesis of indigo. He described his first synthesis of indigo in 1878 (from [[isatin]]) and a second synthesis in 1880 (from [[2-nitrobenzaldehyde]]). (It was not until 1883 that Baeyer finally determined the structure of indigo.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Baeyer (1883) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90697p/f512.image.langEN &quot;Ueber die Verbindungen der Indigogruppe&quot;] [On the compounds of the indigo group], ''Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin'', '''16''' : 2188-2204 ; see especially p. 2204.&lt;/ref&gt;) The synthesis of indigo remained impractical, so the search for alternative starting materials at [[Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik]] (BASF) and Hoechst continued.

The synthesis of N-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine from the easy to obtain [[aniline]] provided a new and economically attractive route. BASF developed a commercially feasible manufacturing process that was in use by 1897, at which time 19,000 tons of indigo were being produced from plant sources. This had dropped to 1,000 tons by 1914 and continued to contract. By 2011 50,000 tons of synthetic indigo were being produced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemists go green to make better blue jeans|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00103-8|journal=Nature|year=2018|volume=553|issue=7687|page=128|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-00103-8|bibcode=2018Natur.553..128.|accessdate=19 February 2018|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyeing technology==
[[File:Leucoindigo structure.png|thumb|Indigo white (leuco-indigo)]]
[[File:IndigoDyedYarn.JPG|thumb|Yarn dyed with indigo dye]]

===Indigo white===
Indigo is a challenging dye because it is not [[soluble]] in water. To be dissolved, it must undergo a chemical change ([[Redox|reduction]]). Reduction converts indigo into &quot;white indigo&quot; ([[leuco dye|leuco]]-indigo). When a submerged fabric is removed from the dyebath, the white indigo quickly combines with [[oxygen]] in the air and reverts to the insoluble, intensely colored indigo. When it first became widely available in Europe in the 16th century, European dyers and printers struggled with indigo because of this distinctive property. It also required several chemical manipulations, some involving toxic materials, and had many opportunities to injure workers. In the 19th century, English poet [[William Wordsworth]] referred to the plight of indigo dye workers of his hometown of Cockermouth in his autobiographical poem ''The Prelude''. Speaking of their dire working conditions and the empathy that he felt for them, he wrote:
:Doubtless, I should have then made common cause
:With some who perished; haply perished too
:A poor mistaken and bewildered offering
:Unknown to those bare souls of miller blue

A pre-industrial process for production of indigo white, used in Europe, was to dissolve the indigo in stale urine, which contains ammonia. A more convenient reductive agent is zinc. Another pre-industrial method, used in Japan, was to dissolve the indigo in a heated vat in which a culture of [[thermophile|thermophilic]], [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] bacteria was maintained. Some species of such bacteria generate [[hydrogen]] as a metabolic product, which convert insoluble indigo into soluble indigo white. Cloth dyed in such a vat was decorated with the techniques of ''[[shibori]]'' (tie-dye), ''[[kasuri]], [[katazome]]'', and ''[[tsutsugaki]]''. Examples of clothing and banners dyed with these techniques can be seen in the works of [[Hokusai]] and other artists.

===Direct printing===
Two different methods for the direct application of indigo were developed in England in the 18th century and remained in use well into the 19th century. The first method, known as 'pencil blue' because it was most often applied by pencil or brush, could be used to achieve dark hues. [[Arsenic trisulfide]] and a thickener were added to the indigo vat. The arsenic compound delayed the oxidation of the indigo long enough to paint the dye onto fabrics.

[[File:IndigoDyePotOnStove.JPG|thumb|Pot of freeze-dried indigo dye]]
The second method was known as 'China blue' due to its resemblance to Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Instead of using an indigo solution directly, the process involved printing the insoluble form of indigo onto the fabric. The indigo was then reduced in a sequence of baths of [[iron(II) sulfate]], with air-oxidation between each immersion. The China blue process could make sharp designs, but it could not produce the dark hues possible with the pencil blue method.

Around 1880, the 'glucose process' was developed. It finally enabled the direct printing of indigo onto fabric and could produce inexpensive dark indigo prints unattainable with the China blue method.

Since 2004, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] indigo, or instant indigo, has become available. In this method, the indigo has already been reduced, and then freeze-dried into a crystal. The crystals are added to warm water to create the dye pot. As in a standard indigo dye pot, care has to be taken to avoid mixing in oxygen. Freeze-dried indigo is simple to use, and the crystals can be stored indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |title=Directions for Instant Indigo |author=Judith McKenzie McCuin |access-date=2008-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041116195957/http://paradisefibers.com/instantindigo.htm |archive-date=2004-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
[[File:Indigo3D.png|thumb|170px|Indigo, space-filling]]
Indigo dye is a dark blue crystalline powder that [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] at {{convert|390|–|392|C}}. It is insoluble in water, [[ethanol|alcohol]], or [[diethyl ether|ether]], but soluble in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]. The [[chemical formula]] of indigo is [[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[[nitrogen|N]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The molecule absorbs light in the orange part of the spectrum (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 613&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wouten | first1 = J. | last2 = Verhecken | first2 = A. | year = 1991 | title = High-performance liquid chromatography of blue and purple indigoid natural dyes | url = | journal = Journal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 266–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound owes its deep color to the conjugation of the [[double bond]]s, i.e. the double bonds within the molecule are adjacent and the molecule is planar. In indigo white, the conjugation is interrupted because the molecule is non-planar.

The related [[Ciba blue]] (5,7,5′,7′-tetrabromoindigo) is, however, of commercial value. 

Indigo and its derivatives featuring intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding have very low solubility in organic solvents. They can be made soluble using transient [[protecting group]]s such as the [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|tBOC group]], which suppresses intermolecular bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Głowacki |first1=Eric Daniel |last2=Voss |first2=Gundula |last3=Demirak |first3=Kadir |last4=Havlicek |first4=Marek |last5=Sünger |first5=Nevsal |last6=Okur |first6=Aysu Ceren |last7=Monkowius |first7=Uwe |last8=Gąsiorowski |first8=Jacek |last9=Leonata |first9=Lucia |last10=Sariciftcia |first10=Niyazi Serdar |display-authors=5 |date=2013 |title=A facile protection–deprotection route for obtaining indigo pigments as thin films and their applications in organic bulk heterojunctions |url= |journal=Chemical Communications |volume=49 |issue=54 |pages=6063–6065 |doi=10.1039/C3CC42889C|pmid=23723050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heating of the tBOC indigo results in efficient thermal deprotection and regeneration of the parent H-bonded pigment.

Treatment with sulfuric acid converts indigo into a blue-green derivative called [[indigo carmine]] (sulfonated indigo). It became available in the mid-18th century. It is used as a colorant for food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.

==Indigo as an organic semiconductor==
Indigo and some of its derivatives are known to be ambipolar [[organic semiconductors]] when deposited as thin films by vacuum evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adma.201102619 | pmid = 22109816 | title = Indigo - A Natural Pigment for High Performance Ambipolar Organic Field Effect Transistors and Circuits | year = 2012 | last1 = Irimia-Vladu | first1 = Mihai | last2 = Głowacki | first2 = Eric D. | last3 = Troshin | first3 = Pavel A. | last4 = Schwabegger | first4 = Günther | last5 = Leonat | first5 = Lucia | last6 = Susarova | first6 = Diana K. | last7 = Krystal | first7 = Olga | last8 = Ullah | first8 = Mujeeb | last9 = Kanbur | first9 = Yasin | last10 = Bodea | first10 = Marius A. | last11 = Razumov | first11 = Vladimir F. | last12 = Sitter | first12 = Helmut | last13 = Bauer | first13 = Siegfried | author14-link = Niyazi Serdar Sarıçiftçi | last14 = Sarıçiftçi | first14 = Niyazi Serdar | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and the environment==

'''Lambert Simnel''' (c. 1477 &amp;ndash; c. 1525) was a [[pretender]] to the throne of [[England]]. In 1487, his claim to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], threatened the newly established reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (who reigned 1485&amp;ndash;1509). Simnel became the figurehead of a Yorkist rebellion organised by [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]]. The rebellion was crushed in 1487. Simnel was pardoned because of his tender years, and was thereafter employed by the Royal household as a [[Servant|scullion]], and, later, as a [[falconry|falconer]].&lt;ref&gt;Elton, G. R. ''England under the Tudors''. London: Methuen, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Simnel was born around 1477. His real name is not known—contemporary records call him John, not Lambert, and even his surname is suspect.  Different sources have different claims of his parentage, from a [[baker]] and [[tradesman]] to organ builder. Most definitely, he was of humble origin. At the age of about ten, he was taken as a pupil by an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-trained priest named Richard Simon (or Richard Symonds / Richard Simons / William Symonds) who apparently decided to become a [[kingmaker]]. He tutored the boy in courtly manners and contemporaries described the boy as handsome. He was taught the necessary etiquette and was well educated by Simon.&lt;ref name = &quot;jim&quot;&gt;Williamson, James A., ''The Tudor Age'', New York: D. McKay Co., 1961, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pretender==
Simon noticed a striking resemblance between Lambert and the sons of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], so he initially intended to present Simnel as [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], son of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], the younger of the vanished [[Princes in the Tower]].&lt;ref name = &quot;jim&quot;/&gt; However, when he heard rumours (at the time false) that the [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] had died during his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London]], he changed his mind. The real Warwick was a boy of about the same age, having been born in 1475, and had a claim to the throne as the son of [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]], King Edward IV's executed brother.

According to James A. Williamson, Simnel was merely a figurehead for a rebellion that was already being planned by the Yorkists:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was merely a commonplace tool to be used for important ends, and the attempt to overthrow Henry VII would have taken place had Simnel never existed. The Yorkist leaders were determined on a serious push, rising of their party in England supported by as great a force as possible from overseas.&lt;ref name = &quot;jim&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a few short years, he made hosting appearances on Australian [[reality show]] [[Do it yourself|DIY]] [[television program]]s. Durie was the main host and the lead landscaper on the garden makeover program ''[[Backyard Blitz]]'', on the [[Nine Network]] - created and produced by horticulturist [[Don Burke]] - from 2000 to 2005. Don Burke, whose production company recruited Durie in 1999 to front ''Backyard Blitz '', describes him as a &quot;born showman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newidea.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/backyard-blitzed-by-nine-20061114-ge3kdx.html|title=Backyard blitzed by Nine|date=14 November 2006|website=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durie was the host on the TV renovation show ''[[The Block (Australian TV series)|The Block]]'', on the [[Nine Network]]. The original ''The Block'' TV series first ran for two consecutive seasons in 2003 and 2006, hosted by Durie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/tv/2017/07/29/the-block-season-13/|title=Could this be the last season?

In 2007, Durie participated in the 6th Australian series of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (Australian TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', in which he was eliminated in 7th place, on 17 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/judge-knifes-jamies-act/news-story/810e54e248985da6e64d9fcc8bf3016b?sv=470f29f97c7847fd2bca2e3cd6ffc3ec |title=Category |work=The Courier Mail|accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2007, Durie hosted ''[[Australia's Best Backyards]]'' on the [[Seven Network]]. The show was a lifestyle garden program, similar to ''[[Backyard Blitz]]'' on the [[Nine Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/australias-best-backyards/episodes.aspx|title=Australia's Best Backyards: Episodes - Lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Durie has filmed lifestyle segments with [[Oprah Winfrey]], on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)]], whom he credits as giving him his US TV breakthrough. Durie states that Winfrey &quot;wholly and solely&quot; is responsible for his career being launched in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;domain.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtonight.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2007/05/oprah-and-durie-at-it-again.html|title=Oprah and Durie at it again|date=19 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily/tv-gardener-and-designer-is-threetimes-engaged-but-has-never-made-it-down-the-aisle/news-story/979037492bcda99ed9326c9d853636bc |title=We're for Sydney |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Oprah came calling, Durie relocated to the US. And with her ringing endorsement it meant that executive doors were opened, and Durie's already significant businesses were expanded in a country far bigger than Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/jamies-back-in-the-room-20150601-ghdudj.html|title=Jamie's back in the room|first=Clare|last=Rigden|date=3 June 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durie hosted the US [[PBS]] series ''[[The Victory Garden (TV series)|The Victory Garden]]'' from 2007 to 2010. The show is PBS network's longest running gardening TV series, which equips viewers with the confidence and inspiration to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty in the garden and in the kitchen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt; Durie hosted the dynamic design makeover show ''HGTV Showdown'' on the [[HGTV]] network in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide.com&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, Durie was the television host of the Australian lifestyle program ''[[The Outdoor Room]]'', broadcast on [[Seven Network]], with repeats broadcast on [[7Two]]. The premise of the show was that Durie set out to &quot;bring the world to your very own backyard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;7plus.com.au&quot;/&gt;

Following the end of ''The Outdoor Room'' show on the [[Seven Network]], in 2010, Durie relocated the concept of the series to broadcast on the [[HGTV]] network as ''The Outdoor Room with Jamie Durie''. Unable to bring his own Australian design team along, Durie put together a new team of designers, horticulturists and contractors.&lt;ref name=&quot;hgtv.com&quot;/&gt; In his HGTV series, Durie rescues forlorn yards in [[Southern California]] with design schemes inspired by gardens and landscapes from around the world. Filmed mostly in and around [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], ''The Outdoor Room with Jamie Durie'' uses sustainable ideas, such as low-water plantings and reclaimed hardscape, to design intimate, livable environments for erstwhile non-gardeners.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardendesign.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

Since 2015, Durie has co-presented as a visiting expert in gardening &amp; landscaping, on the Australian lifestyle program, ''[[The Living Room (TV series)|The Living Room]]'', a quad-triple award-winner of the [[Logie Award for Most Popular Lifestyle Program]], that airs on [[Network Ten]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaweek.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au&quot;/&gt;

In 2019, Durie joined Australia's [[Seven Network]] reality renovation series [[House Rules (Australian TV series)|House Rules]] as a new judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2018/10/jamie-durie-joins-house-rules.html|title=Jamie Durie joins House Rules|date=22 October 2018|work=TV Tonight|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture design and merchandise lines==
In 2010, Durie's company ''Patio Landscape Architecture and Design'' was renamed ''Durie Design'', committed to not just rejuvenating the existing gardens, but offering new exciting outdoor destinations for the clients, and with an emphasis on funky furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/2011/05/20/jamie-durie-to-rejuvenate-haymans-gardens/|title=Jamie Durie to rejuvenate Hayman's gardens|first=Powla|last=Gee|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au1&quot;/&gt;

With his furniture design success, Durie has worked for Hollywood celebrity clients, such as designing 100 pieces of furniture for American [[talk show]] host and comedian [[Chelsea Handler]] and he designed garden landscapes for actress [[Charlize Theron]] for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

==Awards and accolades==
The Australian reality television garden makeover program ''[[Backyard Blitz]]'', on the [[Nine Network]], was the winner of six [[Logie Award]]s of ''Most Popular Lifestyle Program'' (from 2001 until 2006). Durie won the [[Logie Award]] for the ''Most Popular New Talent'' award in 2001, and was nominated for the ''Most Popular Presenter'' award for his role in ''Backyard Blitz'' from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;newidea.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;/&gt;

Durie's 2003 landscape design book, ''Patio - Garden Design and Inspiration'', ([[Allen &amp; Unwin]] - {{ISBN|9781741146547}}) was short-listed APA Book Design Awards, for Best Designed Illustrated Book 2003 Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;allenandunwin.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Durie |url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/lifestyle/Patio-Jamie-Durie-9781741146547 |title=Patio - Jamie Durie - 9781741146547 - Allen &amp; Unwin - Australia |publisher=Allenandunwin.com |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Durie won a Gold Medal at Britain's prestigious [[Royal Horticultural Society]] (RHS) [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in [[Chelsea, London]]. A team of 22 workers built the AU$800,000, 200sqm celebration of the Kimberley landscape, called ''Australian Garden and designed by Durie'', in 16 days. ''Australian Garden'' won one of the eight Gold Medals given in the Show Garden category. All the materials were shipped from Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au&quot;/&gt;

In 2012, Durie was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] (OAM) for services to the environment, and charity work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/jamie-durie-awarded-with-medal-of-the-order-of-australia/news-story/4a0a088528ebd57b90f21b542e6c577b|title=Durie awarded for design, environment work}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Durie began collaborating with the Italian luxury furniture brand [[Natuzzi Group]] Riva 1920. Durie and Riva 1920 launched a bespoke collection of five furniture pieces, including the ''Tubular'' dining table, to widespread acclaim at [[Milan Furniture Fair]] 2013. The ''Tubular'' table and chair (the range also includes bookshelves) and Durie's ''Bungalow range'' were both finalists in the New York Design Awards, announced in Manhattan on 20 May 2014, for Product Design Category, ''Furniture Indoor &amp; Outdoor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com.au/vogue-living/milan-report/jamie-durie-wins-new-york-design-award/news-story/df98b15c5ff418b5b5a6012ade1e5588?|title=Jamie Durie wins New York Design Award - Vogue Australia|first=Dijana|last=Kumurdian|website=www.vogue.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au1&quot;/&gt;

== 2012-2017 Company lawsuit ==
As of 2012, Durie has been engaged in a legal battle for a breach of contract claim brought by a disgruntled former business manager and licensing agent, Michael Curnow. Curnow sued Durie after Curnow's services were terminated. At the start, Durie declared he would fight the breach of contract claim worth more than AU$750,000 brought by Curnow, who worked in the Mona Vale office of Durie's landscape and interior design business, ''Durie Design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/jamie-durie-to-fight-breach-of-contract-claim-by-former-business-manager-worth-750000/news-story/e0c2e203323acac52f5349694bfb88f1|title=Money row puts Durie in court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the NSW Supreme Court case, in September 2017, Justice [[Michael Slattery (admiral)|Michael Slattery]] found largely in favour of Curnow. Durie, who was partially victorious over a claim by Curnow for commissions on work brought to Durie by other agents, disputes that he would be facing damages of more than AU$800,000 as claimed by Curnow. Costs are yet to be determined with a directions hearing in late 2017, though after a 3½-year legal battle and some of the most expensive lawyers in the country, final costs could be another AU$800,000.{{Update inline|date=June 2019|reason=did the directions hearing determine costs?}} Durie was reluctant to discuss the judgment when ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' spoke with him at the time of the ruling, although he did express his disappointment at the finding and that he had been targeted &quot;because I have a public profile ...that guy has made millions out of me over the years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ps-celebrity-gardener-jamie-durie-to-dig-deep-after-court-battle-20170908-gydm4g.html|title=Private Sydney: Celebrity gardener Jamie Durie to dig deep after court battle|first=Andrew|last=Hornery|date=15 September 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, it was reported that Durie's company ''JPD Media &amp; Design'' has been forced into voluntary administration, with Simon Cathro from Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants appointed to look into the company's financial situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;newidea.com.au&quot;/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Durie owns properties in [[Pittwater]], on the [[Northern Beaches]] of [[Sydney]], Australia, and in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au1&quot;/&gt; Durie is unmarried, but he has been engaged three times. He has stated, &quot;I've always been career-focused and my relationships have suffered because of that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt; Durie's former partner, Nadine Bush, is the creative director at ''Durie Design'', and is the co-author of ''Living Design'' (2016, Lantern Australia Publishers). Durie says she is a friend and colleague.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au1&quot;/&gt;

Durie has a grown-up daughter, Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles. Durie says, &quot;We go camping together, surfing and bike riding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytelegraph.com.au1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://people.hgtv.com/talent/jamie-durie/jamie-durie-bio |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908164613/https://people.hgtv.com/talent/jamie-durie/jamie-durie-bio |archive-date=8 September 2018 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/jamie-durie-meet-my-gorgeous-daughter-24444|title=Jamie Durie: Meet my gorgeous daughter!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durie describes his life as &quot;I want simply to find more balance and walk down the little path of self discovery...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt;

Each year, Durie donates his time and resources to many charities, including [[facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy]] (FSHD), the Children's Cancer Institute and [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children|The Children's Hospital at Westmead]] (also called the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children or Sydney Children's Hopital Network, Westmead), [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;rushentertainment.com.au&quot;/&gt;

      <text bytes="8800" xml:space="preserve">In [[chess]], a '''pin''' is a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece. Moving the attacking piece to bring on the pin is called '''pinning'''; the defending piece so restricted is described as '''pinned'''.

Only pieces that can move an indefinite number of squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line (i.e. bishops, rooks, and queens) can pin. Kings, knights, and pawns cannot pin. Any piece can be pinned except the king, since the king must be immediately removed from [[check (chess)|check]] under all circumstances (see [[Skewer (chess)#Absolute skewer]]).

|There is an ''absolute pin'' on the black knight – moving it would illegally expose the black king to check from the bishop. There is a ''relative pin'' on the white knight – moving it would allow the black rook to capture the queen.
}}

=== Absolute pin ===
An ''absolute pin'' is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is the [[King (chess)|king]]. In this case it is illegal to move the pinned piece out of the line of attack, as that would place one's king in [[Check (chess)|check]] (see diagram). A piece pinned in this way can still give check or defend another piece from capture by the king.

=== Relative pin ===
A ''relative pin'' is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is a piece other than the king, but typically is more valuable than the pinned piece. Moving such a pinned piece is legal but may not be prudent, as the shielded piece would then be vulnerable to capture (see diagram).

=== Partial pin ===

|Since the black queen is pinned to the black king by the white rook, the queen cannot move off the e-file.  
}}
If a rook or queen is pinned along a {{chessgloss|file}} or {{chessgloss|rank}}, or a bishop or queen is pinned along a {{chessgloss|diagonal}}, the pin is a ''partial pin'': the pinned piece can still move along its line but cannot leave that line. A partially pinned piece can break its own pin by capturing the pinning piece; however, this can still be advantageous to the pinning player, as in the example diagram (the pinning rook is defended, so capturing it with the queen would lose {{chessgloss|material}}).

A queen can only ever be partially pinned, as it can move in any linear direction. Pawns are a more complex case; due to its limited and conditional movement, whether a pin on a pawn is partial depends on both the line and direction of the pin, as well as whether there are opposing pieces available for it to capture.

It is possible for two opposing pieces to be partially pinning each other.  It is also possible for one piece to be pinned in one direction (line of attack) and partially pinned in another, or otherwise pinned in two or more directions.

=== Situational pin ===

|White to move. White's knight should not capture the black bishop.

Sometimes a piece may be considered to be in a ''situational pin''.  A situational pin is not an absolute pin and the pinned piece can still legally be moved; however, moving the pinned piece out of the line of attack can result in some detriment to the player (e.g. checkmate, immediate loss of the game, occupation of a critical square by the opponent, etc.).

Consider the diagrammed position, it is White's turn to move. The black bishop on d5 is unprotected and White can capture it with 1.Nxd5; however, White should not play the capture or otherwise move the knight, due to 1...Rb1+ winning White's rook (the king is forced to move, exposing the h1-rook to a [[Skewer (chess)|skewer]] attack). It can be said that the white knight is &quot;pinned to the b1-square&quot; rather than pinned to a piece.

== Pin combinations ==
Pinning can also be used in combination with other tactics.  For example, a piece can be pinned to prevent it from moving to attack, or a defending piece can be pinned as part of tactic [[Undermining (chess)|undermining]] an opponent's defense. 

A pinned piece can usually no longer be counted on as a defender of another friendly piece (that is out of the pinning line of attack) or as an attacker of an opposing piece (out of the pinning line). A pinned piece can still check the opposing king, however, and therefore can still defend friendly pieces against captures made by the enemy king.

== Unpinning ==
The act of breaking a pin is ''unpinning''. This can be executed in a number of ways: the piece creating the pin can be captured; another unit can be moved onto the line of the pin; or the unit to which a piece is pinned can be moved.

Although a pin is not a [[chess tactics|tactic]] in itself, it can be useful in tactical situations.  One tactic which takes advantage of a pin can be called ''working the pin''.  In this tactic, other pieces from the pinning piece's side attack the opposing pinned piece.  Since the pinned piece cannot move out of the line of attack, the player whose piece is pinned may move other pieces to defend the pinned piece, but the pinning player may yet attack with even more pieces, etc.

== Pins commonly seen in gameplay ==
A pin that often occurs in openings is the move Bb5 which, if Black has moved ...Nc6 and ...d6 or ...d5, pins the knight on c6, because moving the knight would expose the king on e8 to check. (The same may, of course, occur on the other flank, with a bishop on g5, or by Black on White, with a bishop on b4 or g4.)

A common way to win the queen is to pin her to the king with a rook: for instance with the black queen on e5 and the black king on e8 and no other pieces on the e-file, the move Re1 by White would pin Black's queen.

The diagram shows [[Vladimir Lenin]]–[[Maxim Gorky]], Capri 1908,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1387603 |title=Lenin vs. Gorky, Capri 1908 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; with White to move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://budchess.sweb.cz/s&amp;p.htm Chess games played by Communists]&lt;/ref&gt; Black is threatening the following rook sacrifice and {{chessgloss|forced mate}}:  
:'''27... Rh1+ 28. Kxh1 Qh2{{chessAN|#}}'''

White cannot play 27.gxh3, because the queen on g3 is pinning the pawn to the g-file. The only move that postpones the mate is 27.Nf4, which temporarily blocks Black's bishop from protecting his queen, but to no avail as Black can simply play 27...Bxf4 renewing the mate threat. Or, Black can respond by mating a different way:  
:'''27. Nf4 Qh2+ 28. Kf2 Rhxf3#'''

In this case, White cannot capture 29.gxf3 because the queen now on h2 pins the pawn to the 2nd rank. With mate being inevitable, White resigned after move 26.

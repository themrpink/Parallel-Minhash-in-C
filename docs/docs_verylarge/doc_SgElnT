Apart from these fundamentals, other strategic plans or tactical sequences may be employed in the opening.

Most players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] consider that White, by virtue of the first move, [[First-move advantage in chess|begins the game with a small advantage]]. Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve {{chessgloss|equality}}, or to develop {{chessgloss|dynamism|dynamic}} {{chessgloss|counterplay}} in an unbalanced position.

=== Middlegame ===
{{Main|Chess middlegame}}

The middlegame is the part of the game when most pieces have been developed. Because the opening theory has ended, players have to assess the position, to form plans based on the features of the positions, and at the same time to take into account the tactical possibilities in the position.&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), p. 32–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical plans or strategic themes—for example the {{chessgloss|minority attack}}, that is the attack of {{chessgloss|queenside}} pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside—are often appropriate just for some [[pawn structure]]s, resulting from a specific group of openings. The study of openings should therefore be connected with the preparation of plans typical for resulting middlegames.

Middlegame is also the phase when most [[Combination (chess)|combinations]] occur.&lt;ref name=vids2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Chess-MasterClass-Learn-to-Play-Chess/1192984645 | title=Chess Masterclass: Learn to Play Chess! | publisher=Skillshare.com | accessdate=2020-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middlegame combinations are often connected with the attack against the opponent's king; some typical patterns have their own names, for example the [[Boden's Mate]] or the [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker—Bauer]] combination.

Another important strategical question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transform into an endgame (i.e. {{chessgloss|simplification|simplify}}). For example, minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a [[Chess endgame#Bishop and pawn endings|''bishops and pawns'']] ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with [[opposite-colored bishops endgame|bishops on opposite colors]] is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of one or two pawns.

The endgame (or ''end game'' or ''ending'') is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and endgame:&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), p. 187ff&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
*The king, which must be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame and it is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.
*[[Zugzwang]], a disadvantage because the player has to make a move, is often a factor in endgames and rarely in other stages of the game. For example, in the adjacent diagram, Black on move must go 1...Kb7 and allow white to queen after 2.Kd7, while White on move must allow a draw either after 1.Kc6 stalemate or losing the last pawn by going anywhere else.

Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on board. [[Checkmate#Basic checkmates|Basic checkmates]] are positions where one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, [[Chess endgame#King and pawn endings|king and pawn endgames]] involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on board other than kings, e.g. &quot;[[rook and pawn versus rook endgame]]&quot;.

[[File:Solidus-Crispus-sirmium RIC -.jpg|thumb|[[Crispus|Crispus Caesar]]]]
__NOTOC__
Year '''326''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCXXVI]]''') was a [[common year starting on Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Constantinus and Constantinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1079 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 326 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Edward the Martyr''' ({{lang-ang|Eadweard}}, pronounced {{IPAc-ang|ēa|d|w|e|a|r|d}}; {{circa|lk=no|962}} {{snd}}18 March 978) was [[King of the English]] from 975 until he was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King [[Edgar the Peaceful]] but was not his father's acknowledged [[heir apparent|heir]]. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his younger half-brother [[Æthelred the Unready]], recognised as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops [[Dunstan]] of Canterbury and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald of York]].

The great nobles of the kingdom, [[ealdormen]] [[Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|Ælfhere]] and [[Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|Æthelwine]], quarrelled, and civil war almost broke out. In the so-called anti-monastic reaction, the nobles took advantage of Edward's weakness to dispossess the [[Benedictine]] reformed monasteries of lands and other properties that King Edgar had granted to them.

Edward's short reign was brought to an end by his murder at [[Corfe Castle]] in 978 in circumstances that are not altogether clear. He was hurriedly buried at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], but was reburied with great ceremony at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]] early in 979. In 1001 Edward's remains were moved to a more prominent place in the abbey, probably with the blessing of his half-brother King Æthelred. Edward was already reckoned a saint by this time.

A number of [[hagiography|lives]] of Edward were written in the centuries following his death in which he was portrayed as a [[martyr]], generally seen as a victim of the Queen Dowager [[Ælfthryth, Queen of England|Ælfthryth]], mother of Æthelred. He is today recognized as a saint in the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Family==
Edward's date of birth is unknown, but he was the eldest of Edgar's three children.  He was probably in his teens when he succeeded his father, who died at age 32 in 975.&lt;ref name=Higham7&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was known to be King Edgar's son, but he was not the son of Queen Ælfthryth, the third wife of Edgar. This much and no more is known from contemporary [[Anglo-Saxon charters|charters]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 783; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later sources of questionable reliability address the identity of Edward's mother. The earliest such source is a life of [[Dunstan]] by [[Osbern of Canterbury]], probably written in the 1080s. Osbern writes that Edward's mother was a nun at [[Wilton Abbey]] whom the king seduced.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 783; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Eadmer]] wrote a life of Dunstan some decades later, he included an account of Edward's parentage obtained from [[Nicholas of Worcester]]. This denied that Edward was the son of a liaison between Edgar and a nun, presenting him as the son of Æthelflæd, daughter of Ordmær, &quot;ealdorman of the East Anglians&quot;, whom Edgar had married in the years when he ruled [[Mercia]] (between 957 and [[Eadwig]]'s death in 959).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional accounts are offered by [[Goscelin]] in his life of Edgar's daughter Saint [[Edith of Wilton]] and in the histories of [[John of Worcester]] and [[William of Malmesbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 783; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Together these various accounts suggest that Edward's mother was probably a noblewoman named Æthelflæd, surnamed ''Candida'' or ''Eneda''—&quot;the White&quot; or &quot;White Duck&quot;.&lt;ref name=Higham6&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A charter of 966 describes Ælfthryth, whom Edgar had married in 964, as the king's &quot;lawful wife&quot;, and their eldest son Edmund as the legitimate son of the king. Edward is noted as the king's son.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 2; John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] was a supporter of Ælfthryth and Æthelred, but [[Dunstan]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], appears to have supported Edward, and a genealogy created at his [[Glastonbury Abbey]] circa 969 gives Edward precedence over Edmund and Æthelred.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, &quot;The Women in Edgar's Life&quot;, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Ælfthryth was the widow of [[Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia]], and perhaps Edgar's third wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stafford|title=Unification and Conquest|pages=52&amp;57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyril Hart argues that the contradictions regarding the identity of Edward's mother, and the fact that Edmund appears to have been regarded as the legitimate heir until his death in 971, suggest that Edward was probably illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hart |first=Cyril |contribution= Edward the Martyr |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8515 |access-date=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Barbara Yorke]] thinks that Æthelflæd was Edgar's wife, but Ælfthryth was a consecrated queen when she gave birth to her sons, who were therefore considered more &quot;legitimate&quot; than Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, &quot;The Women in Edgar's Life&quot;, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelwold denied that Edward was legitimate, but Yorke considers this &quot;opportunist special pleading&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, &quot;Æthelwold and the Politics of the Tenth Century&quot;, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmund's full brother Æthelred may have inherited his position as [[heir apparent|heir]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, &quot;Edgar&quot;; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 7. Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 8, dissents from this view.&lt;/ref&gt; On a charter to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] at [[Winchester]], the names of Ælfthryth and her son Æthelred appear ahead of Edward's name.&lt;ref name=Higham7/&gt; When Edgar died on 8 July 975, Æthelred was probably nine and Edward only a few years older.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller&quot;&gt;Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed succession==
Edgar had been a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a probably unwilling church and nobility, aided by the leading clerics of the day, [[Dunstan]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; [[Oswald of Worcester]], [[Archbishop of York]]; and Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]]. By endowing the reformed [[Benedictine]] monasteries with the lands required for their support, he had dispossessed many lesser nobles, and had rewritten leases and loans of land to the benefit of the monasteries. Secular clergy, many of whom would have been members of the nobility, had been expelled from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported the reformers, but following his death, the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.&lt;ref&gt;John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 113–9; Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, pp. 783–4; Miller, &quot;Edgar&quot;; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 2–4; Fisher, &quot;Anti-Monastic Reaction&quot;, pp. 254–255 &amp; 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading figures had all been supporters of the reform, but they were no longer united. Relations between Archbishop Dunstan and Bishop Æthelwold may have been strained.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, 784.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman [[Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia]],&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 9; Williams, &quot;Ælfhere&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; while Ælfhere and his kin were rivals for power with the affinity of [[Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 4–5 &amp; 9; Hart, &quot;Æthelwine&quot; .&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstan was said to have questioned Edgar's marriage to Queen Dowager Ælfthryth and the legitimacy of their son Æthelred.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 7 &amp; 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

These leaders were divided as to whether Edward or Æthelred should succeed Edgar. Neither law nor precedent offered much guidance. The choice between the sons of [[Edward the Elder]] had divided his kingdom, and Edgar's elder brother [[Eadwig]] had been forced to give over a large part of the kingdom to Edgar.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son Æthelred, aided by Bishop Æthelwold; and Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman Ælfhere and his allies supported Æthelred and that Æthelwine and his allies supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;While Higham, Miller and Williams suggest that Ælfhere supported Æthelred, Hart makes Æthelwine and his party the supporters of Æthelred.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later sources suggest that perceptions of legitimacy played a part in the arguments, as did the relative age of the two candidates. In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at [[Kingston upon Thames]], most likely in 975.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 10; Miller, &quot;Edward the Martyr&quot;. Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 100, suggests that the inauguration may have taken place in March 976.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to [[Abingdon Abbey]] and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 10; this seizure is recorded in charter [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=937 S 937].&lt;/ref&gt;
==Edward's reign==

After recording Edward's succession, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reports that a [[comet]] appeared, and that famine and &quot;manifold disturbances&quot; followed.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121, Ms. D &amp; E, s.a. 975 &amp; p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 976.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;manifold disturbances&quot;, sometimes called the anti-monastic reaction, appear to have started soon after Edgar's death. During this time, the experienced Ealdorman Oslac of Northumbria, effective ruler of much of northern England, was exiled due to unknown circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 11; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 10; Fisher, &quot;Anti-Monastic Reaction&quot;, p. 268; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 100; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121, Ms. D, s.a. 975.&lt;/ref&gt; Oslac was followed as ealdorman by Thored, either Oslac's son of that name or Thored Gunnar's son mentioned by the ''Chronicle'' in 966.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 24; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 119, Ms. E, s.a. 966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward, or rather those who were wielding power on his behalf, also appointed a number of new ealdormen to positions in [[Wessex]]. Little is known of two of these men, and it is difficult to determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in [[Sussex]], and perhaps also parts of [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]], was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw [[Hampshire]], held lands in [[Rutland]], perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.

The third ealdorman, [[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]], today best known for his [[Latin]] history, ruled in the west. Æthelweard was a descendant of King [[Æthelred of Wessex]] and probably the brother of King Eadwig's wife. He appears to have been a supporter of Edward rather than of either faction.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 11–12; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 9–10, 17 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, the [[secular clergy]] who had been driven from the monasteries returned, driving the [[regular clergy]] out in their turn. Bishop Æthelwold had been the main enemy of the seculars, and Archbishop Dunstan appears to have done little to aid his fellow reformer at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the magnates took the opportunity to undo many of Edgar's grants to monasteries and to force the abbots to rewrite leases and loans to favour the local nobility. Ealdorman Ælfhere was the leader in this regard, attacking Oswald's network of monasteries across Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, &quot;Ælfhere&quot;. Ælfhere was remembered as a generous patron and protector of the reformed [[Glastonbury Abbey]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ælfhere's rival Æthelwine, while a staunch protector of his family monastery of [[Ramsey Abbey]], treated [[Ely Abbey]] and other monasteries harshly.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, &quot;Anti-Monastic Reaction&quot;, pp. 266–267; Hart, &quot;Æthelwine&quot;. Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point during these disorders, Ælfhere and Æthelwine appear to have come close to open warfare. This may well have been related to Ælfhere's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey. Æthelwine, supported by his kinsman Ealdorman [[Byrhtnoth]] of Essex and others unspecified, mustered an army and caused Ælfhere to back down.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few [[Anglo-Saxon charters|charters]] survive from Edward's reign, perhaps as few as three, leaving Edward's brief reign in obscurity.  By contrast, numerous charters survived from the reigns of his father Edgar and half-brother Æthelred.  All of the surviving Edward charters concern the royal heartland of [[Wessex]]; two deal with [[Crediton]] where Edward's former tutor [[Sideman (bishop)|Sideman]] was [[Bishop of Crediton|bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 11; Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 784; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 977.&lt;/ref&gt; During Edgar's reign, dies for coins were cut only at [[Winchester]] and distributed from there to other mints across the kingdom.  Edward's reign permitted dies to be cut locally at [[York]] and at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. The general impression is of a reduction or breakdown of royal authority in the midlands and north.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, &quot;Edward&quot;, p. 784; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 11 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The machinery of government continued to function, as councils and synods met as customary during Edward's reign, at [[Kirtlington]] in [[Oxfordshire]] after Easter 977, and again at [[Calne]] in [[Wiltshire]] the following year. During the meeting at Calne, some councillors were killed and others injured by the collapse of the floor of their room.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 122, Ms. E, s.a. 977 &amp; p. 123, Ms. C, s.a. 978; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 102; Hart, &quot;Æthelwine&quot;; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' containing the most detailed account records that Edward was murdered in the evening of 18 March 978, while visiting Ælfthryth and Æthelred, probably at or near the mound on which the ruins of [[Corfe Castle]] now stand. It adds that he was buried at Wareham &quot;without any royal honours&quot;. The compiler of this version of the ''Chronicle'', manuscript E, called the [[Peterborough]] Chronicle, says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;No worse deed for the English race was done than this was, since they first sought out the land of Britain. Men murdered him, but God exalted him. In life he was an earthly king; after death he is now a heavenly saint. His earthly relatives would not avenge him, but his Heavenly Father has much avenged him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 123, Ms. E, s.a. 979, also in Ms. D; Williams, ''Æthelred the Unready'', p. 11; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other recensions of the ''Chronicle'' report less detail, the oldest text stating only that he was killed, while versions from the 1040s say that he was [[martyr]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121. Ms. A, s.a. 978 &amp; Ms. C, s.a. 978.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AEHF 1.jpg|thumb|An [[Advanced Extremely High Frequency]] communications orion satellite centre relays secure communications for the United States 
and other allied countries.]]
A '''communications satellite''' is an [[artificial satellite]] that relays and amplifies [[radio]] telecommunications signals via a [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]]; it creates a [[communication channel]] between a source [[transmitter]] and a [[Radio receiver|receiver]] at different locations on [[Earth]]. Communications satellites are used for [[television]], [[telephone]], [[radio]], [[internet]], and [[military]] applications. There are about 2,000 communications satellites in Earth's orbit, used by both private and government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Labrador |first=Virgil |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/524891/satellite-communication |title=satellite communication |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2015-02-19 |access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are in [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|22,236|mi|km}} above the [[equator]], so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky, so the [[satellite dish]] antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it.

The high frequency [[radio wave]]s used for telecommunications links travel by [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth.  The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satellites.spacesim.org/english/function/communic/index.html |title=Satellites - Communication Satellites |publisher=Satellites.spacesim.org |access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and [[microwave]] [[frequencies]]. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or &quot;bands&quot; certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerospace.org&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], along with Vahid K. Sanadi building on work by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].  In October 1945, Clarke published an article titled &quot;Extraterrestrial Relays&quot; in the British magazine ''[[Wireless World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225093216/http://www.lsi.usp.br/~rbianchi/clarke/ACC.ETRelaysFull.html Extraterrestrial Relays]&lt;/ref&gt; The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of [[satellite|artificial satellite]]s in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Thus, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the [[invention|inventor]] of the communications satellite and the term 'Clarke Belt' employed as a description of the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/18/arthur-c-clarke-inventor-of-satellite-visionary-in-technology/ |title=Arthur C. Clarke, inventor of satellite, visionary in technology, dead at 90 |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2008-03-18 |access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later a project named [[Communication Moon Relay]] was a telecommunication project carried out by the United States Navy. Its objective was to develop a secure and reliable method of wireless communication by using the Moon as a passive reflector and a natural communications satellite.

The first [[Satellite|artificial Earth satellite]] was [[Sputnik 1]]. Put into orbit by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, it was equipped with an on-board [[radio]]-[[transmitter]] that worked on two frequencies: 20.005 and 40.002&amp;nbsp; MHz. Sputnik 1 was launched as a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development. However, it was not placed in orbit for the purpose of sending data from one point on earth to another.

The first satellite to relay communications was [[Pioneer 1]], an intended lunar probe that was launched on October 11, 1958. Though the spacecraft only made it about halfway to the moon, it flew high enough to carry out the proof of concept relay of telemetry across the world, first from Cape Canaveral to Manchester, England; then from Hawaii to Cape Canaveral; and finally, across the world from Hawaii to Manchester.&lt;ref name = pioneering2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sdfo.org/stl/Pioneer%20Part%20III.pdf|last=Marcus|first=Gideon|title= Pioneering Space II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first satellite purpose-built to relay communications was NASA's [[SCORE (satellite)|Project SCORE]] in 1958, which used a tape recorder to [[store and forward]] voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communications Satellites|url=http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=768488682|publisher=AIAA|edition=5th|date = March 16, 2007|isbn=978-1884989193|last1=Martin|first1=Donald|last2=Anderson|first2=Paul|last3=Bartamian|first3=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courier 1B, built by [[Philco]], launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite.

The first artificial satellite used solely to further advances in global communications was a balloon named [[Echo 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/8973-1st-communication-satellite-giant-space-balloon-50-years.html ECHO 1 space.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Echo 1 was the world's first artificial communications satellite capable of relaying signals to other points on Earth. It soared {{convert|1,000|mi|km|order=flip}} above the planet after its Aug. 12, 1960 launch. Launched by NASA, Echo 1 was a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon that served as a [[Passive repeater|passive reflector]] for radio communications. The world's first inflatable satellite — or &quot;satelloon&quot;, as they were informally known — helped lay the foundation of today's satellite communications. The idea behind a communications satellite is simple: Send data up into space and beam it back down to another spot on the globe. Echo 1 accomplished this by essentially serving as an enormous mirror, 10 stories tall, that could be used to reflect communications signals.

There are two major classes of communications satellites, ''[[Balloon satellite|passive]]'' and ''active''. Passive satellites only [[Reflector (antenna)|reflect]] the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver.  Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to [[free-space path loss]], so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerospace.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospace.org/2013/12/12/military-satellite-communications-fundamentals/ |title=Military Satellite Communications Fundamentals &amp;#124; The Aerospace Corporation |website=Aerospace |date=2010-04-01 |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905170449/http://www.aerospace.org/2013/12/12/military-satellite-communications-fundamentals/ |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.
[[Telstar]] was the second active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&amp;T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch. [[Relay program|Relay 1]] was launched on December 13, 1962, and it became the first satellite to transmit across the [[Pacific Ocean]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-SP-93&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf|title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30–32|access-date=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]]'s [[Syncom|Syncom 2]], launched on July 26, 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a [[geosynchronous orbit]]. It revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north–south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, [[Syncom|Syncom 3]] was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north–south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.

Beginning with the Viking program,{{efn|The last Viking lander reverted to Earth-direct communications after both orbiters expired.}} all [[Mars lander]]s, aside from Mars Pathfinder, have used orbiting spacecraft as communications satellites for relaying their data to Earth. The landers use [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] transmitters to send their data to the orbiters, which then relay the data to Earth using either [[X band]] or [[Ka band]] frequencies. These higher frequencies, along with more powerful transmitters and larger antennas, permit the orbiters to send the data much faster than the landers could manage transmitting directly to Earth, which conserves valuable time on the [[NASA Deep Space Network|receiving antennas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://sandilands.info/sgordon/communications-with-mars-curiosity| title =Talking to Martians: Communications with Mars Curiosity Rover| website =Steven Gordon's Home Page| access-date =17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications satellites usually have one of three primary types of [[orbit]], while other [[List of orbits|orbital classifications]] are used to further specify orbital details.
* Geostationary satellites have a ''[[geostationary orbit]]'' (GEO), which is {{convert|22,236|mi|km}} from Earth's surface. This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change, the satellite appears to &quot;stand still&quot; in the sky.  This is because the satellite's orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth.  The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky, they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears.
* ''[[Medium Earth orbit]]'' (MEO) satellites are closer to Earth. [[Orbital altitude]]s range from {{convert|2,000|to|36000|km|mi}} above Earth.
* The region below medium orbits is referred to as ''[[low Earth orbit]]'' (LEO), and is about {{convert|160|to|2,000|km|mi}} above Earth.

As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster, they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite, but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and &quot;set&quot; when they go behind the Earth. Therefore, to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites, so one will always be in the sky for transmission of communication signals.  However, due to their relatively small distance to the Earth their signals are stronger.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- suspect that what is meant is &quot;stronger for a given power level of signal&quot;, but the statement is unsourced, so not clear.  It is not true that ALL LEO and MEO comm sat signals are STRONGER than ALL GEO/GSO comm sats. --&gt;

===Low Earth orbit (LEO)===
{{Main|Low Earth orbit}}
[[File:Orbits around earth scale diagram.svg|thumb|[[Low Earth orbit]] in Cyan]]
A [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about {{convert|160|to|2,000|km|mi}} above the earth's surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the earth) of about 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/sd/IADC-2002-01-IADC-Space_Debris-Guidelines-Revision1.pdf|title=IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines|date=September 2007|publisher=INTER-AGENCY SPACE DEBRIS COORDINATION COMMITTEE: Issued by Steering Group and Working Group 4|quote=Region A, Low Earth Orbit (or LEO) Region – spherical region that extends from the Earth's surface up to an altitude (Z) of 2,000 km}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly {{convert|1,000|km|mi}} from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.

Low-Earth-orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, do not require as high [[signal strength]] (''Recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is dramatic)''. Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost.

In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.

===Satellite constellation===
{{Main|Satellite constellation}}

A group of satellites working in concert is known as a [[satellite constellation]]. Two such constellations, intended to provide [[satellite phone]] services, primarily to remote areas, are the [[Iridium (satellite)|Iridium]] and [[Globalstar]] systems. The Iridium system has 66 satellites.

It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low-Earth-orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part.  This will be the case with the CASCADE system of [[Canada]]'s [[CASSIOPE]] communications satellite. Another system using this store and forward method is [[Orbcomm]].

===Medium Earth orbit (MEO)===
{{Main|Medium Earth orbit}}

A MEO is a satellite in orbit somewhere between {{convert|2,000|and|35786|km|mi}} above the earth's surface.  MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality. MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites, usually between 2 and 8 hours. MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites. A MEO satellite's longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network. One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite's distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite, although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite.

Like LEOs, these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the earth.  This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit, where satellites are always {{convert|35786|km|mi}} from the earth.

Typically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about {{convert|10,000|mi|km|order=flip}} above earth. In various patterns, these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.

====Examples====
*In 1962, the communications satellite, '''Telstar''', was launched. It was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high-speed telephone signals. Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realised. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth's rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.
*In 2013 the first four of a constellation of 20 MEO satellites was launched. The [[O3b (satellite)|O3b]] satellites provide [[Internet access|broadband internet services]], in particular to remote locations and maritime and in-flight use, and orbit at an altitude of {{convert|8063|km|mi|0}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arianespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/VS05-O3b-launchkit-EN.pdf ''Soyuz Flight VS05 Launch Kit''] Arianespace.

===Geostationary orbit (GEO)===
{{Main|Geostationary orbit}}
[[File:Geostat.gif|thumb|[[Geostationary orbit]]]]

To an observer on Earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky.  This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth's own [[angular velocity]] (one revolution per [[sidereal day]], in an [[non-inclined orbit|equatorial orbit]]).

A geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite's motion. This is relatively inexpensive.

In applications that require many ground antennas, such as [[DirecTV]] distribution, the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.

====Examples====
* The first geostationary satellite was [[Syncom 3]], launched on August 19, 1964, and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. Shortly after Syncom 3, [[Intelsat I]], aka ''Early Bird'', was launched on April 6, 1965, and placed in orbit at 28° west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
* On November 9, 1972, Canada's first geostationary satellite serving the continent, [[Anik A1]], was launched by [[Telesat Canada]], with the United States following suit with the launch of [[Westar 1]] by [[Western Union]] on April 13, 1974.
* On May 30, 1974, the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be [[three-axis stabilized]] was launched: the experimental satellite [[ATS-6]] built for [[NASA]].
* After the launches of the Telstar through Westar 1 satellites, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now [[SES S.A.|SES]]) launched [[Satcom 1]] in 1975.  It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early [[cable TV]] channels such as WTBS (now [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]), [[HBO]], [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]) and [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]] become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV [[Cable television headend|headends]] using the satellite.  Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[CBS]], to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations.  Satcom 1 was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24 [[Transponder (Satellite communications)|transponders]] as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.
By 2000, '''Hughes Space and Communications''' (now [[Boeing Satellite Development Center]]) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include [[Space Systems/Loral]], [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] with the [[Star Bus]] series, [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Martin]] (owns the former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business), [[Northrop Grumman]], Alcatel Space, now [[Thales Alenia Space]], with the [[Spacebus]] series, and [[Astrium]].

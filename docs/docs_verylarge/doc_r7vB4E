Hooker's army faced Lee across the Rappahannock from its winter quarters in [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]] and around Fredericksburg. Hooker developed a strategy that was, on paper, superior to those of his predecessors. He planned to send his 10,000 cavalrymen under Maj. Gen. [[George Stoneman]] to cross the Rappahannock far upstream and raid deep into the Confederate rear areas, destroying crucial supply depots along the railroad from the Confederate capital in Richmond to Fredericksburg, which would cut Lee's lines of communication and supply.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, pp. 9–10; Eicher, p. 474; Cullen, pp. 17–18; Welcher, p. 659; Sears, pp. 120–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker reasoned that Lee would react to this threat by abandoning his fortified positions on the Rappahannock and withdrawing toward his capital. At that time, Hooker's infantry would cross the Rappahannock in pursuit, attacking Lee when he was moving and vulnerable. Stoneman attempted to execute this turning movement on April 13, but heavy rains made the river crossing site at Sulphur Spring impassable. President Lincoln lamented, &quot;I greatly fear it is another failure already.&quot; Hooker was forced to create a new plan for a meeting with Lincoln, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]], and general in chief [[Henry W. Halleck]] in [[Aquia Harbour, Virginia|Aquia]] on April 19.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, pp. 9–10; Eicher, p. 474; Cullen, pp. 17–18; Welcher, p. 659; Sears, pp. 120–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker's second plan was to launch both his cavalry and infantry simultaneously in a bold [[double envelopment]] of Lee's army. Stoneman's cavalry would make a second attempt at its deep strategic raid, but at the same time, 42,000 men in three corps (V, XI, XII Corps) would stealthily march to cross the Rappahannock upriver at Kelly's Ford. They would then proceed south and cross the Rapidan at Germanna and Ely's Ford, concentrate at the Chancellorsville crossroads, and attack Lee's army from the west.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p. 17; Gallagher, pp. 10–11; Welcher, p. 659; Sears, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

While they were under way, 10,000 men in two divisions from the II Corps would cross at the U.S. Ford and join with the V Corps in pushing the Confederates away from the river. The second half of the double envelopment was to come from the east: 40,000 men in two corps (I and VI Corps, under the overall command of John Sedgwick) would cross the Rappahannock below Fredericksburg and threaten to attack Stonewall Jackson's position on the Confederate right flank.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p. 17; Gallagher, pp. 10–11; Welcher, p. 659; Sears, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 25,000 men (III Corps and one division of the II Corps) would remain visible in their camps at Falmouth to divert Confederate attention from the turning movement. Hooker anticipated that Lee would either be forced to retreat, in which case he would be vigorously pursued, or he would be forced to attack the Union Army on unfavorable terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p. 17; Gallagher, pp. 10–11; Welcher, p. 659; Sears, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the defining characteristics of the battlefield was a dense woodland south of the Rapidan known locally as the &quot;Wilderness of Spotsylvania&quot;. The area had once been an open broadleaf forest, but during colonial times the trees were gradually cut down to make charcoal for local pig iron furnaces. When the supply of wood was exhausted, the furnaces were abandoned and secondary forest growth developed, creating a dense mass of brambles, thickets, vines, and low-lying vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 132, 193–94; Krick, pp. 35–36; Gallagher, pp. 11–13; Cullen, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catharine Furnace]], abandoned in the 1840s, had recently been reactivated to produce iron for the Confederate war effort. This area was largely unsuitable for the deployment of artillery and the control of large infantry formations, which would nullify some of the Union advantage in military power. It was important for Hooker's plan that his men move quickly out of this area and attack Lee in the open ground to the east. There were three primary roads available for this west-to-east movement: the Orange Plank Road, the Orange Turnpike, and the River Road.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 132, 193–94; Krick, pp. 35–36; Gallagher, pp. 11–13; Cullen, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate dispositions were as follows: the Rappahannock line at Fredericksburg was occupied by Longstreet's First Corps division of Lafayette McLaws on Marye's Heights, with Jackson's entire Second Corps to their right. Early's division was at Prospect Hill and the divisions of Rodes, Hill, and Colston extended the Confederate right flank along the river almost to Skinker's Neck. The other division present from Longstreet's Corps, Anderson's, guarded the river crossings on the left flank. Stuart's cavalry was largely in [[Culpeper County]] near Kelly's Ford, beyond the infantry's left flank.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 98–99; Cullen, p. 19; Salmon, pp. 173–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial movements===

====April 27–30: Movement to battle====
[[File:WPMA01 CHANCELLORSVILLE, 27-30 April 1863.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Chancellorsville, '''Situation Late 30 April 1863 and Movements since 27 April''']]

On April 27–28, the initial three corps of the Army of the Potomac began their march under the leadership of Slocum. They crossed the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers as planned and began to concentrate on April 30 around the hamlet of [[Chancellorsville, Virginia|Chancellorsville]], which was little more than a single large, brick mansion at the junction of the Orange Turnpike and Orange Plank Road. Built in the early 19th century, it had been used as an inn on the turnpike for many years, but now served as a home for the Frances Chancellor family. Some of the family remained in the house during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, text for map 84; Gallagher, pp. 13–14; Salmon, p. 175; Sears, pp. 141–58; Krick, p. 32; Eicher, pp. 475, 477; Welcher, pp. 660–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker arrived late in the afternoon on April 30 and made the mansion his headquarters. Stoneman's cavalry began on April 30 its second attempt to reach Lee's rear areas. Two divisions of II Corps crossed at U.S. Ford on April 30 without opposition. By dawn on April 29, pontoon bridges spanned the Rappahannock south of Fredericksburg and Sedgwick's force began to cross.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, text for map 84; Gallagher, pp. 13–14; Salmon, p. 175; Sears, pp. 141–58; Krick, p. 32; Eicher, pp. 475, 477; Welcher, pp. 660–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleased with the success of the operation so far, and realizing that the Confederates were not vigorously opposing the river crossings, Hooker ordered Sickles to begin the movement of the III Corps from Falmouth the night of April 30 – May 1. By May 1, Hooker had approximately 70,000 men concentrated in and around Chancellorsville.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, text for map 84; Gallagher, pp. 13–14; Salmon, p. 175; Sears, pp. 141–58; Krick, p. 32; Eicher, pp. 475, 477; Welcher, pp. 660–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Hooker's right crossing the Rappahannock.jpg|thumb|Troops on Hooker's right cross the Rappahannock]]
In his Fredericksburg headquarters, Lee was initially in the dark about the Union intentions and he suspected that the main column under Slocum was heading towards [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]]. Jeb Stuart's cavalry was cut off at first by Stoneman's departure on April 30, but they were soon able to move freely around the army's flanks on their reconnaissance missions after almost all their Union counterparts had left the area.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, pp. 176–77; Gallagher, pp. 16–17; Krick, pp. 39; Salmon, pp. 176–77; Cullen, pp. 21–22; Sears, pp. 187–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Stuart's intelligence information about the Union river crossings began to arrive, Lee did not react as Hooker had anticipated. He decided to violate one of the generally accepted [[Principles of War|principles of war]] and divide his force in the face of a superior enemy, hoping that aggressive action would allow him to attack and defeat a portion of Hooker's army before it could be fully concentrated against him. He became convinced that Sedgwick's force would demonstrate against him, but not become a serious threat, so he ordered about 4/5 of his army to meet the challenge from Chancellorsville. He left behind a brigade under Brig. Gen. [[William Barksdale]] on heavily fortified Marye's Heights behind Fredericksburg and one division under Maj. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]], on Prospect Hill south of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, pp. 176–77; Gallagher, pp. 16–17; Krick, pp. 39; Salmon, pp. 176–77; Cullen, pp. 21–22; Sears, pp. 187–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

These roughly 11,000 men and 56 guns would attempt to resist any advance by Sedgwick's 40,000. He ordered Stonewall Jackson to march west and link up with Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division, which had pulled back from the river crossings they were guarding and began digging earthworks on a north-south line between the Zoan and Tabernacle churches. McLaws's division was ordered from Fredericksburg to join Anderson. This would amass 40,000 men to confront Hooker's movement east from Chancellorsville. Heavy fog along the Rappahannock masked some of these westward movements and Sedgwick chose to wait until he could determine the enemy's intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, pp. 176–77; Gallagher, pp. 16–17; Krick, pp. 39; Salmon, pp. 176–77; Cullen, pp. 21–22; Sears, pp. 187–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen. [[Robert E.

* [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]. Longstreet and the majority of his corps (the divisions of Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]] and Maj. Gen.  [[George E. Pickett]], and two artillery battalions) were detached for duty in southeastern Virginia. The divisions present at Chancellorsville were those of Maj. Gens. [[Lafayette McLaws]] and [[Richard H. Anderson]].
* [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]], commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson]], with the divisions of Maj. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]], Brig. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]], Maj. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]], and Brig. Gen. [[Raleigh E. Colston]].
* [[Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Cavalry Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. (Stuart's corps had only two brigades at Chancellorsville, those of Brig. Gens. [[Fitzhugh Lee]] and [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee]]. The brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and [[William E. Jones (general)|William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones]] were detached.)

The Chancellorsville campaign was one of the most lopsided clashes of the war, with the Union's effective fighting force more than twice the Confederates', the greatest imbalance during the war in Virginia. Hooker's army was much better supplied and was well-rested after several months of inactivity. Lee's forces, on the other hand, were poorly provisioned and were scattered all over the state of [[Virginia]]. Some 15,000 men of Longstreet's Corps had previously been detached and stationed near [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] in order to block a potential threat to Richmond from Federal troops stationed at [[Fort Monroe]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] on the Peninsula, as well as at Norfolk and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, pp. 168–72; Kennedy, pp. 194–97; Eicher, p. 474; Cullen, p. 16; Sears, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the continued Federal inactivity, by late March Longstreet's primary assignment became that of requisitioning provisions for Lee's forces from the farmers and planters of [[North Carolina]] and Virginia. As a result of this the two divisions of Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]] and Maj. Gen.  [[George Pickett]] were {{convert|130|mi|km}} away from Lee's army and would take a week or more of marching to reach it in an emergency. After nearly a year of campaigning, allowing these troops to slip away from his immediate control was Lee's gravest miscalculation. Although he hoped to be able to call on them, these men would not arrive in time to aid his outnumbered forces.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, pp. 168–72; Kennedy, pp. 194–97; Eicher, p. 474; Cullen, p. 16; Sears, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

===May 1: Hooker passes on opportunity===
[[File:Chancellorsville May1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Chancellorsville, actions on '''May 1''']]

Jackson's men began marching west to join with Anderson before dawn on May 1. Jackson himself met with Anderson near Zoan Church at 8 a.m., finding that McLaws's division had already arrived to join the defensive position. But Stonewall Jackson was not in a defensive mood. He ordered an advance at 11 a.m. along two roads toward Chancellorsville: McLaws's division and the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]] on the Turnpike, and Anderson's other brigades and Jackson's arriving units on the Plank Road.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 177; Welcher, p. 663; Gallagher, pp. 17–19; Cullen, pp. 23–25; Sears, pp. 196–202; Krick, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, Hooker ordered his men to advance on three roads to the east: two divisions of Meade's V Corps (Griffin and Humphreys) on the River Road to uncover Banks's Ford, and the remaining division (Sykes) on the Turnpike; and Slocum's XII Corps on the Plank Road, with Howard's XI Corps in close support. Couch's II Corps was placed in reserve, where it would be soon joined by Sickles's III Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 177; Welcher, p. 663; Gallagher, pp. 17–19; Cullen, pp. 23–25; Sears, pp. 196–202; Krick, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shots of the Battle of Chancellorsville were fired at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. as the armies collided. McLaws's initial attack pushed back Sykes's division. The Union general organized a counterattack that recovered the lost ground. Anderson then sent a brigade under Brig. Gen. [[Ambrose Wright]] up an [[Potomac, Fredericksburg and Piedmont Railroad|unfinished railroad]] south of the Plank Road, around the right flank of Slocum's corps. This would normally be a serious problem, but Howard's XI Corps was advancing from the rear and could deal with Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 177; Cullen, p. 25; Krick, pp. 59–62; Welcher, pp. 663–65; Gallagher, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes's division had proceeded farther forward than Slocum on his right, leaving him in an exposed position. This forced him to conduct an orderly withdrawal at 2 p.m. to take up a position behind Hancock's division of the II Corps, which was ordered by Hooker to advance and help repulse the Confederate attack. Meade's other two divisions made good progress on the River Road and were approaching their objective, Banks's Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 177; Cullen, p. 25; Krick, pp. 59–62; Welcher, pp. 663–65; Gallagher, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being in a potentially favorable situation, Hooker halted his brief offensive. His actions may have demonstrated his lack of confidence in handling the complex actions of such a large organization for the first time (he had been an effective and aggressive division and corps commander in previous battles), but he had also decided before beginning the campaign that he would fight the battle defensively, forcing Lee, with his small army, to attack his own, larger one. At the [First] [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] (December 13, 1862), the Union army had done the attacking and met with a bloody defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 212; Eicher, p. 478; Cullen, p. 26; Esposito, text for map 85; Gallagher, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker knew Lee could not sustain such a defeat and keep an effective army in the field, so he ordered his men to withdraw back into the Wilderness and take a defensive position around Chancellorsville, daring Lee to attack him or retreat with superior forces at his back. He confused matters by issuing a second order to his subordinates to hold their positions until 5 p.m., but by the time it was received, most of the Union units had begun their rearward movements. That evening, Hooker sent a message to his corps commanders, &quot;The major general commanding trusts that a suspension in the attack to-day will embolden the enemy to attack him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 212; Eicher, p. 478; Cullen, p. 26; Esposito, text for map 85; Gallagher, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker's subordinates were surprised and outraged by the change in plans. They saw that the position they were fighting for near the Zoan Church was relatively high ground and offered an opportunity for the infantry and artillery to deploy outside the constraints of the Wilderness. Meade exclaimed, &quot;My God, if we can't hold the top of the hill, we certainly can't hold the bottom of it!&quot; Viewing through the lens of hindsight, some of the participants and many modern historians judged that Hooker effectively lost the campaign on May 1. [[Stephen W. Sears]] observed, however, that Hooker's concern was based on more than personal timidity.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 212–13; Cullen, pp. 26–28. Eicher, p. 478. called Hooker's order &quot;an almost surrealistic blunder.&quot; Furgurson, pp. 130–32, wrote &quot;With mass, position, and momentum on his side, after one of the most successful opening moves in American military history, Hooker bowed and handed the initiative to Lee. ... At no other time between [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Sumter]] and [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] did moral character so decisively affect the battle.&quot; Both Eicher and Furgurson suggest that Hooker's abstinence from alcohol during the battle may have affected his normally pugnacious personality. Krick, p. 9, refers to &quot;impressive evidence&quot; that he was drinking during the battle, but that &quot;other evidence&quot; denies the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground being disputed was little more than a clearing in the Wilderness, to which access was available by only two narrow roads. The Confederate response had swiftly concentrated the aggressive Stonewall Jackson's corps against his advancing columns such that the Federal army was outnumbered in that area, about 48,000 to 30,000, and would have difficulty maneuvering into effective lines of battle. Meade's two divisions on the River Road were too far separated to support Slocum and Sykes, and reinforcements from the rest of the II Corps and the III Corps would be too slow in arriving.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 212–13; Cullen, pp. 26–28. Eicher, p. 478. called Hooker's order &quot;an almost surrealistic blunder.&quot; Furgurson, pp. 130–32, wrote &quot;With mass, position, and momentum on his side, after one of the most successful opening moves in American military history, Hooker bowed and handed the initiative to Lee. ... At no other time between [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Sumter]] and [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] did moral character so decisively affect the battle.&quot; Both Eicher and Furgurson suggest that Hooker's abstinence from alcohol during the battle may have affected his normally pugnacious personality. Krick, p. 9, refers to &quot;impressive evidence&quot; that he was drinking during the battle, but that &quot;other evidence&quot; denies the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Union troops dug in around Chancellorsville that night, creating log breastworks, faced with [[abatis]], Lee and Stonewall Jackson met at the intersection of the Plank Road and the Furnace Road to plan their next move. Jackson believed that Hooker would retreat across the Rappahannock, but Lee assumed that the Union general had invested too much in the campaign to withdraw so precipitously. If the Federal troops were still in position on May 2, Lee would attack them. As they discussed their options, cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart arrived with an intelligence report from his subordinate, Brig. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 233–35; Esposito, text for map 86; Eicher, p. 479; Cullen, pp. 28–29; Krick, pp. 64–70; Salmon, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hooker's left flank was firmly anchored by Meade's V Corps on the Rappahannock, and his center was strongly fortified, his right flank was &quot;in the air.&quot; Howard's XI Corps was camped on the Orange Turnpike, extending past Wilderness Church, and was vulnerable to a flanking attack. Investigations of a route to be used to reach the flank identified the proprietor of Catharine Furnace, Charles C. Wellford, who showed Jackson's cartographer, [[Jedediah Hotchkiss]], a recently constructed road through the forest that would shield marchers from the observation of Union pickets. Lee directed Jackson to make the flanking march, a maneuver similar to the one that had been so successful prior to the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] (Second Manassas). An account by Hotchkiss recalls that Lee asked Jackson how many men he would take on the flanking march and Jackson replied, &quot;my whole command.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 233–35; Esposito, text for map 86; Eicher, p. 479; Cullen, pp. 28–29; Krick, pp. 64–70; Salmon, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on the morning of May 2, Hooker began to realize that Lee's actions on May 1 had not been constrained by the threat of Sedgwick's force at Fredericksburg, so no further deception was needed on that front. He decided to summon the I Corps of Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]] to reinforce his lines at Chancellorsville. His intent was that Reynolds would form up to the right of the XI Corps and anchor the Union right flank on the Rapidan River.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 228–30; Furgurson, pp. 156–57; Welcher, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the communications chaos of May 1, Hooker was under the mistaken impression that Sedgwick had withdrawn back across the Rappahannock and, based on this, that the VI Corps should remain on the north bank of the river across from the town, where it could protect the army's supplies and supply line. In fact, both Reynolds and Sedgwick were still west of the Rappahannock, south of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 228–30; Furgurson, pp. 156–57; Welcher, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker sent his orders at 1:55&amp;nbsp;a.m., expecting that Reynolds would be able to start marching before daylight, but problems with his telegraph communications delayed the order to Fredericksburg until just before sunrise. Reynolds was forced to make a risky daylight march. By the afternoon of May 2, when Hooker expected him to be digging in on the Union right at Chancellorsville, Reynolds was still marching to the Rappahannock.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 228–30; Furgurson, pp. 156–57; Welcher, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, for the second time, Lee was dividing his army. Jackson would lead his Second Corps of 28,000 men around to attack the Union right flank while Lee exercised personal command of the remaining two divisions, about 13,000 men and 24 guns facing the 70,000 Union troops at Chancellorsville. For the plan to work, several things had to happen. First, Jackson had to make a 12-mile (19&amp;nbsp;km) march via roundabout roads to reach the Union right, and he had to do it undetected. Second, Hooker had to stay tamely on the defensive. Third, Early would have to keep Sedgwick bottled up at Fredericksburg, despite the four-to-one Union advantage there. And when Jackson launched his attack, he had to hope that the Union forces were unprepared.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 231–35, 239–40; Eicher, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate cavalry under Stuart kept most Union forces from spotting Jackson on his long flank march, which started between 7 and 8 a.m. and lasted until midafternoon. Several Confederate soldiers saw the Union observation balloon ''Eagle'' soaring overhead and assumed that they could likewise be seen, but no such report was sent to headquarters. When men of the III Corps spotted a Confederate column moving through the woods, their division commander, Brig. Gen. [[David B. Birney]], ordered his artillery to open fire, but this proved little more than harassment. The corps commander, Sickles, rode to Hazel Grove to see for himself and he reported after the battle that his men observed the Confederates passing for over three hours.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p. 29; Sears, pp. 244–45; Salmon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hooker received the report about the Confederate movement, he thought that Lee might be starting a retreat, but he also realized that a flanking march might be in progress. He took two actions. First, he sent a message at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to the commander of the XI Corps, Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]] on his right flank: &quot;We have good reason to suppose the enemy is moving to our right. Please advance your pickets for purposes of observation as far as may be safe in order to obtain timely information of their approach.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 245, 254–59; Krick, p. 76; Salmon, pp. 178–79; Cullen, pp. 30–32; Welcher, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., Howard replied that he was &quot;taking measures to resist an attack from the west.&quot; Hooker's second action was to send orders to Sedgwick - &quot;attack the enemy in his front&quot; at Fredericksburg if &quot;an opportunity presents itself with a reasonable expectation of success&quot; - and Sickles - &quot;advance cautiously toward the road followed by the enemy, and harass the movement as much as possible&quot;. Sedgwick did not take action from the discretionary orders. Sickles, however, was enthusiastic when he received the order at noon. He sent Birney's division, flanked by two battalions of Col. [[Hiram Berdan]]'s U.S. sharpshooters, south from Hazel Grove with orders to pierce the column and gain possession of the road.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 245, 254–59; Krick, p. 76; Salmon, pp. 178–79; Cullen, pp. 30–32; Welcher, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the action came too late. Jackson had ordered the 23rd Georgia Infantry to guard the rear of the column and they resisted the advance of Birney and Berdan at Catherine Furnace. The Georgians were driven south and made a stand at the same [[Potomac, Fredericksburg and Piedmont Railroad|unfinished railroad]] bed used by Wright's Brigade the day before. They were overwhelmed by 5 p.m. and most were captured. Two brigades from [[A.P. Hill]]'s division turned back from the flanking march and prevented any further damage to Jackson's column, which by now had left the area.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 245, 254–59; Krick, p. 76; Salmon, pp. 178–79; Cullen, pp. 30–32; Welcher, p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Jackson's men were unaware of the small action at the rear of their column. As they marched north on Brock Road, Jackson was prepared to turn right on the Orange Plank Road, from which his men would attack the Union lines at around Wilderness Church. However, it became apparent that this direction would lead to essentially a frontal assault against Howard's line. Fitzhugh Lee met Jackson and they ascended a hill with a sweeping view of the Union position. Jackson was delighted to see that Howard's men were resting, unaware of the impending Confederate threat.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 84–86; Salmon, p. 179; Cullen, p. 34; Sears, pp. 257–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

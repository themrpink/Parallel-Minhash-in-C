[[File:Gabriele d&amp;#039;Annunzio-L&amp;#039;armata d&amp;#039;Italia-Carabba-1916.png|thumb|300 px|Gabriele d'Annunzio, ''L'armata d'Italia'', Carabba, 1916]]

The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' wrote of him:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of d' Annunzio, although by many of the younger generation injudiciously and extravagantly admired, is almost the most important literary work given to Italy since the days when the great classics welded her varying dialects into a fixed language. The psychological inspiration of his novels has come to him from many sources—French, Russian, Scandinavian, German—and in much of his earlier work there is little fundamental originality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His creative power is intense and searching, but narrow and personal; his heroes and heroines are little more than one same type monotonously facing a different  problem at a different phase of life. But the faultlessness of his style and the wealth of his language have been approached by none of his contemporaries, whom his genius has somewhat paralysed. In his later work [meaning as of 1911], when he begins drawing his inspiration from the traditions of bygone Italy in her glorious centuries, a current of real life seems to run through the veins of his personages. And the lasting merit of D'Annunzio, his real value to the literature of his country, consists precisely in that he opened up the closed mine of its former life as a source of inspiration for the present and of hope for the future, and created a language, neither pompous nor vulgar, drawn from every source and district suited to the requirements of modern thought, yet absolutely classical, borrowed from none, and, independently of the thought it may be used to express, a thing of intrinsic beauty. As his sight became clearer and his purpose strengthened, as exaggerations, affectations, and moods dropped away from his conceptions, his work became more and more typical Latin work, upheld by the ideal of an Italian Renaissance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Italy some of his poetic works remain popular, most notably his poem &quot;La pioggia nel pineto&quot; (''The Rain in the Pinewood''), which exemplifies his linguistic virtuosity as well as the sensuousness of his poetry. His work was part of the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics#Literature|literature event]] in the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|art competition]] at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/920848 |title=Gabriele D'Annunzio |work=Olympedia |accessdate=22 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==

D'Annunzio's life and work are commemorated in a museum, ''[[Il Vittoriale degli Italiani]]'' (''The Shrine of Italian Victories''). He planned and developed it himself, adjacent to his villa at [[Gardone Riviera]] on the southwest bank of [[Lake Garda]], between 1923 and his death. Now a national monument, it is a complex of military museum, library, literary and historical archive, theatre, war memorial and [[mausoleum]]. The museum preserves his [[torpedo boat]] ''MAS 96'' and the SVA-5 aircraft he flew over Vienna.

His birthplace is also open to the public as a museum, [[Birthplace of Gabriele D'Annunzio Museum]] in Pescara.

'''Margaret of Anjou''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Marguerite}}; 23 March 1430&amp;nbsp;– 25 August 1482) was the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] and nominally [[Queen of France]] by marriage to [[King Henry VI]] from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471. Born in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] into the [[House of Valois-Anjou]], Margaret was the second eldest daughter of [[René, King of Naples]], and [[Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine]].

She was one of the principal figures in the series of dynastic civil wars known as the [[Wars of the Roses]] and at times personally led the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian faction]]. Some of her contemporaries such as the [[John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]] praised &quot;Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit&quot; and [[Edward Hall]] describes her personality: &quot;This woman excelled all other, as well in beauty and favour, as in wit and policy, and was of stomach and courage, more like to a man, than a woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b39v6r|title=Margaret of Anjou|publisher=BBC Radio 4|date=24 May 2018|accessdate=28 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to her husband's frequent bouts of insanity, Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the [[House of York|Yorkist faction]] headed by [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], and this provided the spark that ignited a civil conflict that lasted for more than 30 years, decimated the old nobility of England, and caused the deaths of thousands of men, including her only son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471.

Margaret was taken prisoner by the victorious Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. In 1475, she was ransomed by her cousin, King [[Louis XI of France]]. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king, and she died there at the age of 52.

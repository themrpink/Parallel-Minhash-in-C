'''TAT-14''' is the 14th consortium [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]] system. In operation from 2001, it uses [[wavelength division multiplexing]].  The cable system is built from multiple pairs of fibres—one fibre in each pair is used for data carried in one direction and the other in the opposite direction.  Although optical fibre can be used in both directions simultaneously, for reliability it is better not to require splitting equipment at the end of the individual fibre to separate transmit and receive signals—hence a fibre pair is used.  TAT-14 uses four pairs of fibres—two pairs as active and two as backup. Each fibre in each pair carries 16 wavelengths in one direction, and each wavelength carries up to an [[Synchronous optical networking|STM-256]] (38,486,016 kbit/s as payload).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tat-14.com/tat14/&lt;/ref&gt;  The fibres are bundled into submarine cables connecting the United States and the European Union (United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark) in a [[ring topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the time this cable went into operation, the expected ''[[1990s United States boom|long boom]]'' (term coined by [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]]) was already ending in the ''[[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]] death''. The overinvestment in transcontinental [[optical fiber]] capacity led to a financial crisis in private cable operators like [[Global Crossing]].

In the [[Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak#Europe|cables leak]] released by [[WikiLeaks]], it is revealed that the landing point in [[Katwijk|Katwijk, the Netherlands]] is included in a [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] list of [[critical infrastructure]] susceptible to [[Terrorism|terrorist attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Cable failure ==

In November 2003, TAT-14 suffered two breaks within weeks of each other, first on the southern link between the US and UK, then on the link between France and the Netherlands which had been providing redundant service to the UK via the northern link through Denmark, resulting in disruption to Internet services in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The system, involving the first commercial use of a new lightweight deep sea cable with a weight in water of about one-fifth that of armored deep sea cable, was laid in two phases. The first, CANTAT A, was the {{cvt|2072|nmi| mi km}} ocean section laid by HMTS [[CS Monarch (1945)|''Monarch'']] with the U.K. shore end laid by HMTS ''Ariel''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Built 1939 by Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Canadian end laid by the U.S. Army CS [[USNS Albert J.

The new Trans Atlantic cables, TAT-1, CANTAT-1 and [[TAT-2]], with their high capacity brought about a major change in regulations, with specific changes in the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] policies regarding lease of foreign cable channels by U.S. international record carriers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Companies had been divided by the [[Communications Act of 1934]] according to the technology used.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hills/&gt; CANTAT-1 operated from 1961 to 1986, initially carrying 60 telephone circuits, later modified from 4&amp;nbsp;kHz channels to 3&amp;nbsp;kHz channels, expanding capacity to 80 telephone circuits.&lt;ref name=HATCANTAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=HATtime/&gt;

      <text bytes="2383" xml:space="preserve">'''CANTAT-2''' was the second Canadian [[transatlantic telephone cable]],
in operation from 1974 to 1992.
It could carry 1,840 simultaneous telephone calls
between [[Beaver Harbour, Nova Scotia|Beaver Harbour]], [[Nova Scotia]] and England. The parties involved were [[Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation]] (now [[Teleglobe]]) and the British [[General Post Office]]. The cable was rerouted to [[Sable Island]] as [[Sitifofog 2000]] for a period, and was eventually decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Glover |first=Bill |title=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications — Atlantic Cables: 1856-2018 |publisher=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications |date=5 March 2019 |url=https://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/CableTimeLine/atlantic.htm |accessdate=2 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CANTAT-3''' was the third [[Canada|Canadian]] [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]], in operation from 1994 to 2010, initially carrying 3 x 2.5 Gbit/s between [[Canada]] and [[Europe]]. It branches to both [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;farice&quot;&gt;[http://www.farice.is/about-us/company-history/ Farice: The background of the FARICE-1 cable]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2006, CANTAT-3 services were disrupted due to damage to the [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]], resulting in degradation of service to hundreds of thousands of users connecting via internet and media providers ([[Síminn]], [[Vodafone]] and [[HIVE (ISP)|Hive]]). The country was however backed up by the second submarine cable, [[FARICE-1]] The most notable effect of the event was a temporary shut-down of data communications by Iceland's universities and hospitals, which relied exclusively on CANTAT-3's services. Although it was predicted that a full recovery of the cable would take ten days, starting from midnight on January 13, 2007, it actually took until July 29, 2007 before service was fully restored. During that time, the Icelandic universities and hospitals in [[Akureyri]] and [[Reykjavík]] relied on emergency connectivity obtained via local internet providers [[Síminn]] and [[Vodafone]]. The Icelandic government decided not to buy extra bandwidth for the university network through the functioning [[FARICE-1]] cable, despite being a large shareholder in FARICE-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siminn.is/um-simann/frettasetur/nanar/item31135/ Press release by Síminn at 2006-12-17 about failure of CANTAT-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130918001907/http://www.siminn.is/um-simann/frettasetur/nanar/item31135/ |date=2013-09-18 }} (Icelandic)&lt;/ref&gt;

CANTAT-3 was operated by [[India]]'s [[VSNL International Canada|Teleglobe]].

CANTAT-3 was the only NL-16 laser regenerative 2.5 Gig/s submarine system built in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/greenlandtheory/greenland/odin-cable-system?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2Ftemplates%2Fprint%2F&amp;showPrintDialog=1|title=12.17 ODIN Cable System|website=Greenland Theory|access-date=31 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this huge system was built at STC Submarine Networks, [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States|USA]], from 1993-1994 (which later became [[Alcatel Submarine Networks]]). STC Submarine Networks in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. made the rest of the system. The Canadian portion (shore end system) was laid off [[Nova Scotia]] by the [[VSNL International Canada|Teleglobe]] cable ship CS John Cabot. The main-lay portion was deployed off Nova Scotia towards the Faroes on board the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] ship Global Mariner. Other cable ships were involved in the completion of this system. This was the northernmost cable system ever deployed at the time.

Given that CANTAT-3 suffered multiple&lt;ref name=&quot;farice&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siminn.is/um-simann/frettasetur/nanar/store63/item4304/ Press release by Síminn at 2003-11-05 about failure of CANTAT-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130918001914/http://www.siminn.is/um-simann/frettasetur/nanar/store63/item4304/ |date=2013-09-18 }} (Icelandic)&lt;/ref&gt; interruptions, the alternative cables [[FARICE-1]], [[DANICE]] and [[Greenland Connect]] were established and/or expanded&lt;ref name=&quot;farice&quot;/&gt; to ensure cabled telecommunication connectivity in Iceland. CANTAT-3 also had too little capacity by 2007 for domestic Internet usage  and became outdated as soon as the DANICE cable came into operation by 2009. The Iceland, Denmark and Germany portion of CANTAT-3 is still in use (2016) and is powered from Iceland and connected to Sylt in Germany and Blaabjerg in Denmark. This portion of the cable is now connected to several oil platforms in the North Sea and that is the primary function of CANTAT-3. The current owner of CANTAT-3 is the Farose Telecom (Föroya Tele). The transatlantic portion is no longer in operation and has not been replaced.

The city, together with nearby [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Darmstadt]], and [[Mainz]], is part of the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Region]], a [[metropolitan area]] with a combined population of about 5.8&amp;nbsp;million people.

Wiesbaden is one of the oldest [[spa town]]s in Europe. Its name translates to &quot;meadow baths&quot;, a reference to its famed [[hot springs]]. It is also internationally famous for its architecture and climate—it is also called the &quot;[[Nice]] of the North&quot; in reference to the city in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, Wiesbaden boasted 26 hot springs. {{As of|2008}}, fourteen of the springs are still flowing.&lt;ref&gt;''Wiesbadener Tagblatt''. September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the town hosted the tenth ''[[Hessentag]] Landesfest'' (English: Hessian Day, a state festival).

The city is considered the tenth richest in Germany (2014) boasting 110.3% of the national average [[gross domestic product]] in 2017. The average annual buying power per citizen is €24,783.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ihk-wiesbaden.de/blob/wiihk24/standort/downloads/3673134/a84f4bcc1fe3be9ec5f85c8a5dfa7b96/Kaufkraft-2016-IHK-Wiesbaden-data.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021228/https://www.ihk-wiesbaden.de/blob/wiihk24/standort/downloads/3673134/a84f4bcc1fe3be9ec5f85c8a5dfa7b96/Kaufkraft-2016-IHK-Wiesbaden-data.pdf |archive-date=August 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical setting==
[[File:Sattelite Wiesbaden Mainz.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of Wiesbaden (north of the [[Rhine]]) and Mainz]]

Wiesbaden is situated on the right (northern) bank of the [[Rhine]], below the confluence of the [[Main (river)|Main]], where the Rhine's main direction changes from north to west. The city is across the Rhine from Mainz, the capital of the federal state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Frankfurt am Main is located about {{convert|38|km|mi|1}} east. To the north of the city are the [[Taunus]] Mountains, which trend in a northeasterly direction.

The city center, the ''Stadtmitte'', is located in the north-easternmost part of the [[Upper Rhine Valley]] at the spurs of the Taunus mountains, about {{convert|5|km|mi|1}} from the Rhine. The landscape is formed by a wide lowland between the Taunus heights in the north, the Bierstadter Höhe and the Hainerberg in the east, the Mosbacher Mountain in the south, and the Schiersteiner Mountain in the west, an offshoot of the Taunus range. The downtown is drained only by the narrow valley of the Salzbach, a tributary of the Rhine, on the eastern flanks of the Mosbacher Mountain. The city's main railway line and the Mainz road (''Mainzer Straße'') follow this valley. Several other streams drain into the Salzbach within the city center: the Wellritzbach, the Kesselbach, the Schwarzbach, the Dambach, and the Tennelbach, as well as the outflow of many thermal and mineral springs in the ''Kurhaus'' (spa) district. Above the city center, the Salzbach is better known as the Rambach.

[[File:Wiesbaden De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|left|View of Wiesbaden from the ''Topographia Hassiae'' by [[Matthäus Merian]] in 1655.|295px]]The highest point of the Wiesbaden municipality is located northwest of the city center near the summit of the Hohe Wurzel, with an elevation of {{convert|608|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest point is the harbour entrance of Schierstein at {{convert|83|m|ft|0}} above sea level. The central square (the ''Schlossplatz'', or palace square) is at an elevation of {{convert|115|m|ft|0}}.

Wiesbaden covers an area of {{convert|204|km2|0|abbr=on}}. It is {{convert|17.6|km|mi|1}} from north to south and {{convert|19.7|km|mi|1}} from west to east. In the north are vast forest areas, which cover 27.4% of the urban area. In the west and east are [[vineyards]] and agricultural land, which cover 31.1% of the area. Of the municipality's {{convert|79|km|mi|1}}-long border, the Rhine makes up {{convert|10.3|km|mi|1}}.

===Climate===
Wiesbaden has a [[temperate climate|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb) with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|9.8|°C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|1.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|18.6|°C|1}} in July.

==History==
[[File:Heidenmauer in Wiesbaden.jpg|thumb|The ''Heidenmauer'' (&quot;Heathen Wall&quot;) of ''Aquae Mattiacorum''&lt;ref&gt;The hypothesis of the Heidenmauer being a remainder of an aquaeduct now has been definitely proven wrong.

===Classical antiquity===
While evidence of settlement at present-day Wiesbaden dates back to the [[Neolithic]] era, historical records document continuous occupancy after the erection of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] fort in 6&amp;nbsp;AD which housed an auxiliary cavalry unit. The [[hot spring|thermal springs]] of Wiesbaden are first mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. They were famous for their recreation pools for Roman army horses and possibly as the source of a mineral used for red hair dye (which was very fashionable around the turn of BC/AD among women in Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Csysz, Walter: Wiesbaden in der Römerzeit. Aalen: Theiss editors, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman settlement is first mentioned using the name ''Aquae Mattiacorum'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;Waters of the Mattiaci&quot;) in 121. The [[Mattiaci]] were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]], possibly a branch of the neighboring [[Chatti]], who lived in the vicinity at that time. The town also appears as Mattiacum in [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia]] (2.10). The Roman Empire built the [[Limes Germanicus]], which was a line of Roman frontier fortifications in the [[Taunus]]. Wiesbaden is just south of the Taunus.

The capital of the province of [[Germania Superior]], [[Mogontiacum]] (present-day [[Mainz]]), base of 2 (at times 3) Roman legions, was just over the Rhine and connected by a bridge at the present-day borough of [[Mainz-Kastel]] (Roman &quot;''castellum''&quot;), a strongly fortified bridgehead.

The [[Alamanni]], a coalition of Germanic tribes from beyond the ''Limes'', captured the fort around 260. Later, in the 370s, when the Romans and Alamanni were allied, the Alemanni gained control of the Wiesbaden area and were in charge of its defense against other Germanic tribes.

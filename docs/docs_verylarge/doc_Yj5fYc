The {{nihongo|'''Mitsubishi Group'''|三菱グループ|Mitsubishi Gurūpu|also known as the '''Mitsubishi Group of Companies''' or '''Mitsubishi Companies''', and informally as the '''Mitsubishi [[Keiretsu]]'''}} is a group of autonomous [[Japan]]ese [[multinational corporation|multinational]] companies in a variety of industries.

Founded by [[Iwasaki Yatarō]] in 1870, the Mitsubishi Group historically descended from the '''Mitsubishi''' [[zaibatsu]], a unified company which existed from 1870 to 1946. The company was disbanded during the [[occupation of Japan]] following [[World War II]]. The former constituents of the company continue to share the Mitsubishi [[brand]] and [[trademark]]. Although the group companies participate in limited business cooperation, most famously through monthly &quot;Friday Conference&quot; executive meetings, they are formally independent and are not under common control. The four main companies in the group are [[MUFG Bank]] (the largest bank in Japan), [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] (a [[sogo shosha|general trading company]]), [[Mitsubishi Electric]] and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (both being diversified manufacturing companies).

== History ==
[[File:Y Iwasaki.png|thumb|upright|[[Iwasaki Yatarō|Yatarō Iwasaki]], the founder of Mitsubishi]]

The Mitsubishi company was established as a [[shipping]] firm by [[Iwasaki Yatarō]] (1834–1885) in 1870. In 1873, its name was changed to ''Mitsubishi Shokai''. The name {{nihongo4||{{linktext|三菱}}|Mitsubishi}} consists of two parts: &quot;''mitsu''&quot; (三) meaning &quot;three&quot; and &quot;''hishi''&quot; (菱, which becomes &quot;''bishi''&quot; under [[rendaku]]) meaning &quot;[[water caltrop]]&quot;, and hence &quot;[[rhombus]]&quot;, which is reflected in the company's [[logo]]. It is also translated as &quot;three diamonds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishi.com/e/group/mark.html|title=mitsubishi.com - About Mitsubishi - Mitsubishi Mark -|website=www.mitsubishi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitsubishi was established in 1870, two years after the [[Meiji Restoration]], with shipping as its core business. Its diversification was mostly into related fields. It entered into coal-mining to gain the coal needed for ships, bought a shipbuilding yard from the government to repair the ships it used, founded an iron mill to supply iron to the shipbuilding yard, started a [[marine insurance]] business to cater for its shipping business, and so forth. Later, the managerial resources and technological capabilities acquired through the operation of shipbuilding were used to expand the business further into the manufacture of aircraft and equipment. The experience of overseas shipping led the firm to enter into a trading business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odagiri &amp; Goto&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Odagiri | first = Hiroyuki | title = Technology and Industrial Development in Japan | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-19-828802-6 | page = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the company bought into [[coal mining]] by acquiring the Takashima Mine, followed by [[Hashima Island]] in 1890, using the production to fuel their extensive [[steamship]] fleet.  They also diversified into shipbuilding, [[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], warehousing, and trade. Later diversification carried the organization into such sectors as [[paper]], [[steel]], [[glass]], electrical equipment, [[aircraft]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[real estate]]. As Mitsubishi built a broadly based [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], it played a central role in the modernization of Japanese industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gearheads.org/the-history-of-mitsubishi-group/|title=The History of Mitsubishi Group|date=19 May 2012|publisher=GearHeads|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1921, the [[Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Company]] in Nagoya invited British [[Sopwith Camel]] designer [[Herbert Smith (aircraft designer)|Herbert Smith]], along with several other former Sopwith engineers to assist in creating an aircraft manufacturing division.  After moving to Japan, they designed the [[Mitsubishi 1MT]], [[Mitsubishi B1M]], [[Mitsubishi 1MF]], and [[Mitsubishi 2MR]].

The merchant fleet entered into a period of diversification that would eventually result in the creation of three entities:
* [[Mitsubishi Bank]] (now a part of the [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]]) was founded in 1919.  After its mergers with the Bank of Tokyo in 1996, and [[UFJ Holdings]] in 2004, this became Japan's largest bank.
* [[Mitsubishi Corporation]], founded in 1950, Japan's largest general trading company
* [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]], which includes these industrial companies:
** [[Mitsubishi Motors]], the sixth-largest Japan-based [[car]] manufacturer.
** Mitsubishi Atomic Industry, a [[nuclear power]] company.
** [[Mitsubishi Chemical]], the largest Japan-based [[chemical]]s company
** Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, a power generation division
** [[Nikon|Nikon Corporation]], specializing in optics and imaging.

The firm's prime real estate holdings in the [[Marunouchi]] district of Tokyo, acquired in 1890, were spun off in 1937 to form [[Mitsubishi Estate]], now one of the largest real estate development companies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.mec.co.jp/e/company/history/index.html|publisher=Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd.|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
[[File:Mitsubishi Zero-Yasukuni.jpg|thumb|Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot; fighter]]

During the Second World War, Mitsubishi manufactured military aircraft under the direction of Dr. [[Jiro Horikoshi]]. The [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] was a primary Japanese naval fighter in [[World War II]]. It was used by [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] pilots throughout the war, including in ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks during the later stages. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] pilots were astounded by its maneuverability, and it was very successful in combat until the Allies devised tactics to use their advantage in armor and diving speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;life1942110986&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Wilcox|first1=Richard|title=The Zero|date=9 November 1942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=wilcox+mitsubishi+1942&amp;pg=PA86|magazine=Life Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonski, Edward.

Mitsubishi made use of forced labor during this tenure. Laborers included allied POWs, as well as Chinese citizens. In the post-war period, lawsuits and demands for compensations were presented against the Mitsubishi Corporation, in particular by former Chinese workers. On July 24, 2015, the company agreed to formally apologize for this wartime labor, and compensated 3765 Chinese laborers who were conscripted to Mitsubishi Mining during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-24/news/64817007_1_mitsubishi-materials-chinese-victims-compensation |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305114303/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-24/news/64817007_1_mitsubishi-materials-chinese-victims-compensation |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 2015, the company apologized for using American soldiers as slave laborers during World War II, making them the first major Japanese company to apologize for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/20/us-usa-mitsubishimaterials-apology-idUSKCN0PU02620150720 | title=Mitsubishi Materials apologizes for using U.S. POWs as slave labor | work=Reuters | date=20 July 2015 | accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitsubishi was involved in the [[opium]] trade in China during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Retribution|last= Hastings|first= Max|authorlink= Max Hastings|year= 2007|publisher= Vintage|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-307-27536-3|page= 413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war era ===
Mitsubishi was among a number of major Japanese conglomerates targeted for dissolution during the [[occupation of Japan]]. It was broken up into a large number of smaller enterprises whose stock was offered to the public. For several years, these companies were banned from coordinating with each other and from using the Mitsubishi name and trademarks. These restrictions were lifted in 1952, as the [[Korean War]] generated a need for a stronger industrial base in Japan. Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which had themselves been broken up into many smaller entities, again coalesced by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris-Suzuki|first1=Tessa, ed.|title=Japanese Capitalism Since 1945: Critical Perspectives|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9a9fV8RQFNsC&amp;pg=PA113|isbn=9780873325516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitsubishi companies participated in [[Japanese economic miracle|Japan's unprecedented economic growth of the 1950s and 1960s]]. For example, as Japan modernized its energy and materials industries, the Mitsubishi companies created Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Mitsubishi Atomic Power Industries, Mitsubishi Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Mitsubishi Petroleum Development. The traditional Mitsubishi emphasis on technological development was in new ventures in such fields as space development, aviation, ocean development, data communications, computers, and semiconductors. Mitsubishi companies also were active in consumer goods and services.

In 1970, Mitsubishi companies established the Mitsubishi Foundation to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the founding of the first Mitsubishi company. The companies also individually maintain charitable foundations. Mitsubishi pavilions have been highlights of expositions in Japan since EXPO'70 in Osaka in the 1970s to 1980s.

Mitsubishi, along with other manufacturers, was affected by the [[Kobe Steel#Scandal|Kobe Steel scandal]] in 2017, which  - involved falsified data for products supplied to the aerospace, car and electric power industries.

On November 28, 2018, the [[South Korea Supreme Court]] ordered Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which serves as one of Mitsubishi's core companies, to pay 10 Koreans 150m won ($133,000; £104,000) in compensation for forced labor which it oversaw during the Japanese occupation of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/s-korea-court-orders-japans-mitsubishi-to-pay-compensation-for-wartime-forced-labor/2018/11/28/4f0a6616-f37e-11e8-9240-e8028a62c722_story.html|title=New South Korean court ruling angers Japan, deepening crisis between America's closest Pacific allies|first1=Simon |last1=Denyer |website=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnov28&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46381207|title=Mitsubishi payout ordered over WW2 labour|date=29 November 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 family members of other victims of the forced labour which Mitsubishi Heavy Industries oversaw and who sued sometime before 2008 will also be awarded compensation as well.&lt;ref name=bbcnov28 /&gt; All 28 plaintiffs had previously filed a lawsuit in Japan, but had their lawsuit dismissed by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=bbcnov28 /&gt; The Japanese Government has responded to the court's decision that it is a breach of the international law, citing [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|the agreement between the two countries]].

The Mitsubishi Group is made up of about 40 individual companies without a controlling parent company. Each of the Mitsubishi companies owns substantial (but usually not controlling) portions of the shares of the others.

Twenty-nine of the group companies participate in the {{nihongo|Friday Conference|金曜会|Kinyō-kai}}, a luncheon meeting of their most senior executives held on the second Friday of each month. The group began its tradition of monthly executive meetings in 1952, and over time the meetings became a venue for coordinating policy between the group companies. However, by the 1990s, this practice was criticized (particularly by non-Japanese investors) as a possible violation of [[antitrust law]]. Since 1993, the Friday Conference has officially been held as a social function, and not for the purpose of discussing or coordinating business strategy. Despite this, the Friday Conference has been a venue for informal cooperation and coordination between the group companies, most notably in bailing out [[Mitsubishi Motors]] during the mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=三菱グループの最高決定機関「金曜会」の知られざる権力構造と裏序列|url=http://diamond.jp/articles/-/85099|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=Shukan Diamond|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Friday Conference, the group companies' heads of general affairs hold a meeting on the third Monday of each month, and the group companies' legal and IP departments hold a trademark policy coordination meeting on the first Friday of each month.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot; /&gt;

'''Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina''' ({{lang-de|Maria Theresia}}; 13 May 1717 – 29 November 1780) was the only female ruler of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg dominions]], ruling from 1740 until her death. She was the sovereign of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Lodomeria and Galicia]], the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]]. By marriage, she was [[Duchess of Lorraine]], [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and [[Holy Roman Empress]].

Maria Theresa started her 40-year reign when her father, [[Emperor Charles VI]], died in October 1740. Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] and spent his entire reign securing it. He neglected the advice of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], who believed that a strong military and a rich treasury were more important than mere signatures. Eventually, Charles VI left behind a weakened and impoverished state, particularly due to the [[War of the Polish Succession]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)]]. Moreover, upon his death, [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and [[Kingdom of France|France]] all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime. [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (who became Maria Theresa's greatest rival for most of her reign) promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of [[Silesia]] in the seven-year conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. In defiance of the grave situation, she managed to secure the vital support of the Hungarians for the war effort. Over the course of the war, despite the loss of Silesia and a few minor territories in Italy, Maria Theresa successfully defended her rule over most of the Habsburg empire. Maria Theresa later unsuccessfully tried to reconquer Silesia during the [[Seven Years' War]].

Though she was expected to cede power to her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis I]], and her eldest son, [[Emperor Joseph II]], who were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, Maria Theresa was the absolute sovereign who ruled with the counsel of her advisers. Maria Theresa promulgated institutional, financial and educational reforms, with the assistance of [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Wenzel Anton of Kaunitz-Rietberg]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz]] and [[Gerard van Swieten]]. She also promoted [[commerce]] and the development of agriculture, and reorganised Austria's ramshackle military, all of which strengthened Austria's international standing. However, she despised the Jews and the Protestants, and on certain occasions she ordered their expulsion to remote parts of the realm. She also advocated for the state church and refused to allow [[religious pluralism]]. Consequently, her regime was criticized as intolerant by some contemporaries.

== Birth and early life ==
[[File:Maria Theresa, age 3.jpeg|thumb|left|Three-year-old Maria Theresa in the gardens of [[Hofburg Palace]]]]
The second and eldest surviving child of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]] and [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], Archduchess Maria Theresa was born on 13 May 1717 in [[Vienna]], a year after the death of her elder brother, Archduke Leopold,{{sfn|Goldsmith|1936|p=17}} and was baptised on that same evening. The [[dowager]] empresses, her aunt [[Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and grandmother [[Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg]], were her godmothers.{{sfn|Morris|1937|p=21}} Most descriptions of her baptism stress that the infant was carried ahead of her cousins, [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] and [[Maria Amalia, Holy Roman Empress|Maria Amalia]], the daughters of Charles VI's elder brother and predecessor, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], before the eyes of their mother, Wilhelmine Amalia.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=6}} It was clear that Maria Theresa would outrank them,{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=6}} even though their grandfather, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I]], had his sons sign the [[Mutual Pact of Succession]], which gave precedence to the daughters of the elder brother.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=12}} Her father was the only surviving male member of the House of Habsburg and hoped for a son who would prevent the extinction of his dynasty and succeed him. Thus, the birth of Maria Theresa was a great disappointment to him and the people of Vienna; Charles never managed to overcome this feeling.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=12}}

Maria Theresa replaced Maria Josepha as [[heir presumptive]] to the Habsburg realms the moment she was born; Charles VI had issued the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] which had placed his nieces behind his own daughters in the line of succession.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=129}} Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)]], Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the [[Ostend Company]] in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction.{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|p=24}} In total, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Early modern France|France]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]], [[Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] recognised the sanction.&lt;ref name=Brittanica1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473697/Pragmatic-Sanction-of-Emperor-Charles-VI |title=Pragmatic Sanction of Emperor Charles VI|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date= 29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Spain, Saxony, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.

Little more than a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, [[Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1718–1744)|Maria Anna]], and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=128}} The portraits of the imperial family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=23}} The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=228}} Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.{{efn|Members of the Habsburg dynasty often married their close relatives; examples of such inbreeding were uncle-niece pairs (Maria Theresa's grandfather [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain]], [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Anna of Austria (1549–1580)|Anna of Austria]], [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Mariana of Austria]], etc). Maria Theresa, however, descended from Leopold I's third wife who was not closely related to him, and her parents were only distantly related. {{harvnb|Beales|1987|pp=20–1}}.}}

Maria Theresa was a serious and reserved child who enjoyed singing and archery. She was barred from horse riding by her father, but she would later learn the basics for the sake of her [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian coronation ceremony]]. The imperial family staged opera productions, often conducted by Charles&amp;nbsp;VI, in which she relished participating. Her education was overseen by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Contemporaries thought her [[Latin]] to be quite good, but in all else, the Jesuits did not educate her well.{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|pp=19–21}} Her spelling and punctuation were unconventional and she lacked the formal manner and speech which had characterised her Habsburg predecessors.{{efn|Rather than using the formal manner and speech, Maria Theresa spoke (and sometimes wrote) [[Viennese German]], which she picked up from her servants and ladies-in-waiting. {{harvnb|Spielman|1993|p=206}}.}} Maria Theresa developed a close relationship with [[Marie Karoline von Fuchs-Mollard|Countess Marie Karoline von Fuchs-Mollard]], who taught her etiquette. She was educated in drawing, painting, music and dancing – the disciplines which would have prepared her for the role of [[queen consort]].{{sfn|Mahan|1932|pp=21–2}} Her father allowed her to attend meetings of the council from the age of 14 but never discussed the affairs of state with her.{{sfn|Morris|1937|p=28}} Even though he had spent the last decades of his life securing Maria Theresa's inheritance, Charles never prepared his daughter for her future role as sovereign.{{sfn|Browning|1994|p=37}}

== Marriage ==
The question of Maria Theresa's marriage was raised early in her childhood. [[Léopold Clément, Hereditary Prince of Lorraine|Leopold Clement of Lorraine]] was first considered to be the appropriate suitor, and he was supposed to visit Vienna and meet the Archduchess in 1723. These plans were forestalled by his death from [[smallpox]].{{sfn|Mahan|1932|pp=24–5}}

Leopold Clement's younger brother, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], was invited to Vienna. Even though Francis Stephen was his favourite candidate for Maria Theresa's hand,{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|p=22}} the Emperor considered other possibilities. Religious differences prevented him from arranging his daughter's marriage to the Protestant prince [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick of Prussia]].{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=27}} In 1725, he betrothed her to [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Spain]] and her sister, Maria Anna, to [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Philip of Spain]]. Other European powers compelled him to renounce the pact he had made with the Queen of Spain, [[Elisabeth Farnese]]. Maria Theresa, who had become close to Francis Stephen, was relieved.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=26}}{{sfn|Morris|1937|pp=25–6}}

Francis Stephen remained at the imperial court until 1729, when he ascended the throne of Lorraine,{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=27}} but was not formally promised Maria Theresa's hand until 31 January 1736, during the [[War of the Polish Succession]].{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=37}} [[Louis XV of France]] demanded that Maria Theresa's fiancé surrender his ancestral [[Duchy of Lorraine]] to accommodate his father-in-law, [[Stanisław I]], who had been deposed as King of Poland.{{efn|Maria Theresa's father compelled Francis Stephen to renounce his rights to Lorraine and told him: &quot;''No renunciation, no archduchess.&quot;'' {{harvnb|Beales|1987|p=23}}.}} Francis Stephen was to receive the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] upon the death of childless Grand Duke [[Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Gian Gastone de' Medici]].{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|p=25}} The couple were married on 12 February 1736.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=38}}

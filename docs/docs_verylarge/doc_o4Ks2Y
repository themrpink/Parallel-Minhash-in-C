:&lt;math&gt;\text{throughput cost accounting ratio} = \frac{\text{return}}{\text {factory hours}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{throughput} = \text{sales} - \text{material costs}&lt;/math&gt;

==Activity-based Costing==
{{main|Activity-based costing}}
[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) is a system for assigning costs to products based on the activities they require. In this case, activities are those regular actions performed inside a company.&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan Publishing UK. Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Talking with the customer regarding invoice questions&quot; is an example of activity inside most companies.

Companies may be moved to adopt ABC by a need to improve costing accuracy, that is, understand better the true costs and profitability of individual products, services, or initiatives. ABC gets closer to true costs in these areas by turning many costs that standard cost accounting views as indirect costs essentially into direct costs. By contrast, standard cost accounting typically determines so-called indirect and overhead costs simply as a percentage of certain direct costs, which may or may not reflect actual resource usage for individual items.

Under ABC, accountants assign 100% of each employee's time to the different activities performed inside a company (many will use surveys to have the workers themselves assign their time to the different activities). The accountant then can determine the total cost spent on each activity by summing up the percentage of each worker's salary spent on that activity.

A company can use the resulting activity cost data to determine where to focus its operational improvements. For example, a job-based manufacturer may find that a high percentage of its workers are spending their time trying to figure out a hastily written customer order. Via (ABC) Activity-based costing, the accountants now have a currency amount pegged to the activity of &quot;Researching Customer Work Order Specifications&quot;. Senior management can now decide how much focus or money to budget for resolving this process deficiency. [[Activity-based management]] includes (but is not restricted to) the use of activity-based costing to manage a business.

While (ABC) Activity-based costing may be able to pinpoint the cost of each activity and resources into the ultimate product, the process could be tedious, costly and subject to errors.

As it is a tool for a more accurate way of allocating fixed costs into a product, these fixed costs do not vary according to each month's production volume. For example, the elimination of one product would not eliminate the overhead or even direct labour cost assigned to it. Activity-based costing (ABC) better identifies product costing in the long run, but may not be too helpful in day-to-day decision-making.

== Integrating EVA and Process-Based Costing ==

Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012).&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Mocciaro Li Destri A., Picone P. M. &amp; Minà A. (2012), Bringing Strategy Back into Financial Systems of Performance Measurement: Integrating EVA and PBC, Business System Review, Vol 1., Issue 1. pp.85-102.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the Economic Value Added criteria with Process-Based Costing (PBC). The EVA-PBC methodology allows us to implement the EVA management logic not only at the firm level, but also at lower levels of the organization. EVA-PBC methodology plays an interesting role in bringing strategy back into financial performance measures.

==Lean Accounting==
{{main|Lean accounting}}

[[Lean accounting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|journal=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed in recent years to provide the accounting, control, and measurement methods supporting [[lean manufacturing]] and other applications of lean thinking such as healthcare, construction, insurance, banking, education, government, and other industries.

There are two main thrusts for Lean Accounting. The first is the application of lean methods to the company's accounting, control, and measurement processes. This is not different from applying lean methods to any other processes. The objective is to eliminate waste, free up capacity, speed up the process, eliminate errors &amp; defects, and make the process clear and understandable.
The second (and more important) thrust of Lean Accounting is to fundamentally change the accounting, control, and measurement processes so they motivate lean change &amp; improvement, provide information that is suitable for control and decision-making, provide an understanding of customer value, correctly assess the financial impact of lean improvement, and are themselves simple, visual, and low-waste. Lean Accounting does not require the traditional management accounting methods like [[standard costing]], activity-based costing, variance reporting, cost-plus pricing, complex transactional control systems, and untimely &amp; confusing financial reports. These are replaced by:
* lean-focused performance measurements
* simple summary direct costing of the value streams
* decision-making and reporting using a ''box score''
* financial reports that are timely and presented in &quot;plain English&quot; that everyone can understand
* radical simplification and elimination of transactional control systems by eliminating the need for them
* driving lean changes from a deep understanding of the value created for the customers
* eliminating traditional budgeting through monthly sales, operations, and financial planning processes (SOFP)
* value-based pricing
* correct understanding of the financial impact of lean change

As an organization becomes more mature with lean thinking and methods, they recognize that the combined methods of lean accounting in fact creates a lean management system (LMS) designed to provide the planning, the operational and financial reporting, and the motivation for change required to prosper the company's on-going lean transformation.

==Marginal Costing==
{{see also|Cost–volume–profit analysis|Marginal cost}}

The cost-volume-profit analysis is the systematic examination of the relationship between selling prices, sales, production volumes, costs, expenses and profits. This analysis provides very useful information for decision-making in the management of a company. For example, the analysis can be used in establishing sales prices, in the product mix selection to sell, in the decision to choose marketing strategies, and in the analysis of the impact on profits by changes in costs. In the current environment of business, a business administration must act and take decisions in a fast and accurate manner. As a result, the importance of cost-volume-profit is still increasing as time passes.

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN''

A relationship between the cost, volume and profit is the contribution margin. The contribution margin is the revenue excess from sales over variable costs. The concept of contribution margin is particularly useful in the planning of business because it gives an insight into the potential profits that a business can generate. The following chart shows the income statement of a company X, which has been prepared to show its contribution margin:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Sales || $1,000,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $600,000
|-
| Contribution Margin || $400,000
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $100,000
|}

''CONTRIBUTION MARGIN RATIO''

The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage. The contribution margin ratio, which is sometimes called the profit-volume ratio, indicates the percentage of each sales dollar available to cover fixed costs and to provide operating revenue. For the company Fusion, Inc. the contribution margin ratio is 40%, which is computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Contribution Margin Ratio} = (\text{Sales - Variable Costs}) / \text{Sales}&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution margin ratio measures the effect on operating income of an increase or a decrease in sales volume. For example, assume that the management of Fusion, Inc. is studying the effect of adding $80,000 in sales orders. Multiplying the contribution margin ratio (40%) by the change in sales volume ($80,000) indicates that operating income will increase $32,000 if additional orders are obtained. To validate this analysis the table below shows the income statement of the company including additional orders:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Sales || $1,080,000
|-
| (-) Variable Costs || $648,000 (1,080,000 x 60%)
|-
| Contribution Margin || $432,000 (1,080,000 x 40%)
|-
| (-) Fixed Costs || $300,000
|-
| Income from Operations || $132,000
|}

Variable costs as a percentage of sales are equal to 100% minus the contribution margin ratio. Thus, in the above income statement, the variable costs are 60% (100% - 40%) of sales, or $648,000 ($1,080,000 X 60%). The total contribution margin $432,000, can also be computed directly by multiplying the sales by the contribution margin ratio ($1,080,000 X 40%).

In '''management accounting''' or '''managerial accounting,''' managers use the provisions of [[accounting]] information in order to better inform themselves before they decide matters within their organizations, which aids their [[management]] and performance of control functions.

==Definition==
[[Image:IFAC Definition of MA.jpg|thumb|450px|IFAC Definition of enterprise financial management concerning three broad areas: cost accounting; performance evaluation and analysis; planning and decision support. Managerial accounting is associated with  higher value, more predictive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations (International Good Practice Guidance) |author=Professional Accountants in Business Committee |publisher=International Federation of Accountants |year=2009 |page=7 c|isbn=9781608150373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Copyright July 2009, International Federation of Accountants'']]
One simple definition of management accounting is the provision of financial and non-financial decision-making information to managers.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns, Quinn, Warren &amp; Oliveira, ''Management Accounting'', McGraw-Hill, London, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;In other other words, Management accounting helps directors inside an organization to  make decisions. This can also be known  as cost accounting. This is the way toward distinguishing, examining, deciphering and imparting data to supervisors to help accomplish business goals. The information gathered includes all fields accounting that educates the administration regarding business tasks identifying with the financial expenses and decisions made  by the organization. Accountants use  plans to measure the overall strategy of operations within the organization.

According to the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] (IMA): &quot;Management accounting is a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization's strategy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Management Accounting |publisher=Institute of Management Accountants |year=2008 |url=http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020120432/http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management accountants (also called managerial accountants) look at the events that happen in and around a business while considering the needs of the business. From this, data and estimates emerge. Cost accounting is the process of translating these estimates and data into knowledge that will ultimately be used to guide decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|title=What is Management Accounting? - Definition - Meaning - Example|website=myaccountingcourse.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162414/https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|archivedate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA), the largest management accounting institute with over 100,000 members describes &quot;Management accounting as analysing information to advise business strategy and drive sustainable business success&quot;.

==Scope, practice, and application==
{{See also|Management accounting principles|Decision theory}}

The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) states that management accounting as practice extends to the following three areas:
* [[Strategic management]] — advancing the role of the management accountant as a strategic partner in the organization
* [[Performance management]] — developing the practice of business decision-making and managing the performance of the organization
* [[Risk management]] — contributing to frameworks and practices for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting risks to the achievement of the objectives of the organization

The [[Institute of Certified Management Accountants]] (CMA) states, &quot;A management accountant applies his or her professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation undertaking&quot;.

Management accountants are seen as the &quot;value-creators&quot; amongst the accountants. They are more concerned with forward-looking and taking decisions that will affect the future of the organization, than in the historical recording and compliance (score keeping) aspects of the profession. Management accounting knowledge and experience can be obtained from varied fields and functions within an organization, such as information management, treasury, efficiency auditing, marketing, valuation, pricing, and logistics. In 2014 CIMA created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423144019/http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial versus Management accounting==
{{More citations needed|date=March 2017}}
Management accounting information differs from [[financial accountancy]] information in several ways:
* while shareholders, creditors, and public regulators use publicly reported financial accountancy, information, only managers within the organization use the normally confidential management accounting information
* while financial accountancy information is historical, management accounting information is primarily forward-looking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5q2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|title=BASIC CONCEPTS OF ACCOUNTING|last=Ladda|first=Dr R. L.|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781312161306|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}};
* while financial accountancy information is case-based, management accounting information is model-based with a degree of abstraction in order to support generic decision making;
* while financial accountancy information is computed by reference to general financial accounting standards, management accounting information is computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using [[management information system]]s.
Focus:  
* Financial accounting focuses on the company as a whole.
* Management accounting provides detailed and disaggregated information about products, individual activities, divisions, plants, operations and tasks.

==Traditional versus innovative practices==
[[Image:Managerial Costing Timeline.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Managerial costing time line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Presentation at IMA's annual conference - Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework Session |first=Anton |last=van der Merwe |date=7 September 2011 |place=Orlando, FL |publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Used with permission by the author A. van der Merwe. Copyright 2011. All Rights Reserved.'']]

The distinction between '''traditional''' and '''innovative''' accounting practices is illustrated with the visual timeline ''(see sidebar)'' of managerial costing approaches presented at the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] 2011 Annual Conference.

[[Traditional standard costing]] (TSC), used in [[cost accounting]], dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in management accounting practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of income statement and balance sheet line items such as [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS) and inventory valuation.  Traditional [[standard costing]] must comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP US) and actually aligns itself more with answering financial accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants.  Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume.

In the late 1980s, accounting practitioners and educators were heavily criticized on the grounds that management accounting practices (and, even more so, the curriculum taught to accounting students) had changed little over the preceding 60 years, despite radical changes in the business environment. In 1993, the Accounting Education Change Commission Statement Number 4&lt;ref name=AECC&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions and Issues|url=http://www.aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|work=Issues Statement Number 4: Improving the Early Employment Experience of Accountants|publisher=American Accounting Association|accessdate=2 November 2011|author=Accounting Education Change Commission|location=Sarasota, FL|year=1993|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427214402/http://aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|archivedate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for faculty members to expand their knowledge about the actual practice of accounting in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Matuszewski, L. |author3=Tidrick, D. |title=Escaping Professional Dominance?|journal=Cost Management|year=2011|issue=Sep/Oct|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional accounting institutes, perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations, subsequently devoted considerable resources to the development of a more innovative skills set for management accountants.

[[Variance (accounting)|Variance analysis]] is a systematic approach to the comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period.  While some form of variance analysis is still used by most manufacturing firms, it nowadays tends to be used in conjunction with innovative techniques such as ''[[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost analysis]]'' and ''activity-based costing'', which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind. ''Life-cycle costing'' recognizes that managers' ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life-cycle (i.e., before the design has been finalized and production commenced), since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products.

[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) recognizes that, in modern factories, most manufacturing costs are determined by the amount of 'activities' (e.g., the number of production runs per month, and the amount of production equipment idle time) and that the key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities.  Both lifecycle costing and activity-based costing recognize that, in the typical modern factory, the avoidance of disruptive events (such as machine breakdowns and quality control failures) is of far greater importance than (for example) reducing the costs of raw materials. Activity-based costing also de-emphasizes direct labor as a cost driver and concentrates instead on activities that drive costs, as the provision of a service or the production of a product component.

Other approach is the German [[Grenzplankostenrechnung]] (GPK) costing methodology. Although it has been in practiced in Europe for more than 50 years, neither GPK nor the proper treatment of 'unused capacity' is widely practiced in the U.S.&lt;ref name=MA_ATMP&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Van der Merwe, Anton |title=Management Accounting - Approaches, Techniques, and Management Processes|journal=Cost Management|year=2006|issue=May/Jun|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another accounting practice available today is [[resource consumption accounting]] (RCA).  RCA has been recognized by the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) as a &quot;sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques&quot;&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval&gt;{{cite journal|author=Professional Accountants In Business Committee|title=International Good Practice Guidance: Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations|url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|date=July 2009|accessdate=10 November 2011|page=24|publisher=International Federation of Accountants|location=New York|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404144149/http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|archivedate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs.  RCA was derived by taking costing characteristics of GPK, and combining the use of activity-based drivers when needed, such as those used in activity-based costing.&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval /&gt;

A modern approach to close accounting is continuous accounting, which focuses on achieving a point-in-time close, where accounting processes typically performed at period-end are distributed evenly throughout the period.

==Role within a corporation==
Consistent with other roles in modern corporations, management accountants have a dual reporting relationship. As a strategic partner and provider of decision based financial and operational information, management accountants are responsible for managing the business team and at the same time having to report relationships and responsibilities to the corporation's finance organization and finance of an organization.

The activities management accountants provide inclusive of forecasting and planning, performing variance analysis, reviewing and monitoring costs inherent in the business are ones that have dual accountability to both finance and the business team. Examples of tasks where accountability may be more meaningful to the business management team vs. the corporate finance department are the development of new product costing, [[operations research]], business driver metrics, sales management scorecarding, and client profitability analysis. (See [[financial modeling]].) Conversely, the preparation of certain financial reports, reconciliations of the financial data to source systems, risk and regulatory reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they are charged with aggregating certain financial information from all segments of the corporation.

[[Thermal desorption]] is highly effective at removing PCBs from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qi|first1=Zhifu|title=Effect of temperature and particle size on the thermal desorption of PCBs from contaminated soil|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|date=March 2014|volume=21|issue=6|pages=4697–4704|doi=10.1007/s11356-013-2392-4|pmid=24352542|s2cid=26156538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
PCBs are fairly chemically unreactive, this property being attractive for its application as an inert material. They resist [[oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Amy |last1=Boate |first2=Greg |last2=Deleersnyder |first3=Jill |last3=Howarth |first4=Anita |last4=Mirabelli |first5=Leanne |last5=Peck |title=Chemistry of PCBs |year=2004 |url=http://wvlc.uwaterloo.ca/biology447/modules/intro/assignments/Introduction2a.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040912060901/http://wvlc.uwaterloo.ca/biology447/modules/intro/assignments/Introduction2a.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-12 |access-date=2007-11-07}}{{self-published source|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=May 2013}}
Many chemical compounds are available to destroy or reduce the PCBs. Commonly, PCBs are degraded by basis mixtures of [[glycol]]s, which displace some or all chloride. Also effective are reductants such as sodium or [[sodium naphthenide]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Vitamin B12 has also shown promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es9804823 |title=Polychlorinated Biphenyl Reductive Dechlorination by Vitamin B12s: Thermodynamics and Regiospecificity |year=1999 |last1=Woods |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Trobaugh |first2=Darin J. |last3=Carter |first3=Kim J. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=857–863|bibcode=1999EnST...33..857W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbial===
Some micro-organisms [[biodegradation|degrade]] PCBs by reducing the C-Cl bonds. Microbial dechlorination tends to be rather slow-acting in comparison to other methods. Enzymes extracted from microbes can show PCB activity. In 2005, ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' biodegraded a high percentage of PCBs in soil samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15683392|title=Bioreductive deposition of palladium (0) nanoparticles on ''Shewanella oneidensis'' with catalytic activity towards reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls.|journal=Environmental Microbiology|vauthors=De Windt W, Aelterman P, Verstraete W |year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00696.x|volume=7|issue=3|pages=314–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low voltage current can stimulate the microbial degradation of PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=23123087 | author1=Chun CL | title=Electrical stimulation of microbial PCB degradation in sediment | author2=Payne RB | author3=Sowers KR | author4=May HD | journal=Water Research |date=January 2003 | volume=47 | issue=1 | pages=141–152 | doi=10.1016/j.watres.2012.09.038 | pmc=3508379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungal===
There is research showing that some ligninolytic fungi can degrade PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cvančarová|first1=M|last2=Křesinová|first2=Z|last3=Filipová|first3=A|last4=Covino|first4=S|last5=Cajthaml|first5=T|title=Biodegradation of PCBs by ligninolytic fungi and characterization of the degradation products|journal=[[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]]|date=September 2012|volume=88|issue=11|pages=1317–1323|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.107|pmid=22546633|bibcode=2012Chmsp..88.1317C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[organic chemistry]], the '''phenyl group''' or '''phenyl ring''' is a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] group of atoms with the formula [[carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Phenyl groups are closely related to [[benzene]] and can be viewed as a benzene ring, minus a hydrogen, which may be replaced by some other element or compound to serve as a [[functional group]]. Phenyl groups have six carbon atoms bonded together in a [[hexagonal]] planar ring, five of which are bonded to individual hydrogen atoms, with the remaining carbon bonded to a [[substituent]]. Phenyl groups are commonplace in [[organic chemistry]].&lt;ref name=March&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jerry|title=Advanced organic chemistry: reactions, mechanisms, and structure|url=https://archive.org/details/advancedorganicc04edmarc|url-access=registration|date=1992|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-60180-7|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often depicted with alternating double and single bonds, phenyl groups are [[aromaticity|chemically aromatic]] and have equal bond lengths between carbon atoms in the ring.&lt;ref name=March/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSU&quot;&gt;&quot;Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry: Aromaticity&quot;. Michigan State University. http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/react3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Usually, a &quot;phenyl group&quot; is synonymous to C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;– and is [[skeletal formula#Pseudoelement symbols|represented by the symbol]] Ph or, archaically, [[Φ]]. Benzene is sometimes denoted as PhH. Phenyl groups are generally attached to other atoms or groups. For example, [[triphenylmethane]] (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH) has three phenyl groups attached to the same carbon center. Many or even most phenyl compounds are not described with the term &quot;phenyl&quot;. For example, the chloro derivative C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl is normally called [[chlorobenzene]], although it could be called phenyl chloride. In special (and rare) cases, isolated phenyl groups are detected: the phenyl anion (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), the phenyl cation (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and the phenyl [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''·'''&lt;/sup&gt;).

Although Ph and phenyl uniquely denote C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, substituted derivatives also are described using the phenyl terminology. For example, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is nitrophenyl and F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is pentafluorophenyl. Monosubstituted phenyl groups (that is, disubstituted benzenes) are associated with [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] reactions and the products follow the [[arene substitution pattern]]. So, a given substituted phenyl compound has three isomers, ''ortho'' (1,2-disubstitution), ''meta'' (1,3-disubstitution) and ''para'' (1,4-disubstitution). A disubstituted phenyl compound (trisubstituted benzene) may be, for example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted, or 1,2,3-trisubstituted. Higher degrees of substitution, of which the pentafluorophenyl group is an example, exist, and are named according to IUPAC nomenclature.

===Etymology===
Phenyl is derived from the French word ''phényle'', which in turn derived from Greek ''phaino:'' &quot;shining&quot;, as the first phenyl compounds named were byproducts of [[history of manufactured gas|making and refining]] various [[gas lighting|gases used for lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/phenyl|title=phenyl: Definition of phenyl in English by Lexico Dictionaries|accessdate=24 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McMurry, &quot;The word is derived from the Greek ''pheno'' (“I bear light”), commemorating the discovery of benzene by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in London street lamps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McMurry |first1=John E. |title=Organic Chemistry, Enhanced Edition |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9781111790042 |page=518 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ffs7AAAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure, bonding, and characterization==
Phenyl compounds are derived from [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), at least conceptually and often in terms of their production. In terms of its electronic properties, the phenyl group is related to a [[vinyl group]]. It is generally considered an inductively withdrawing group (-''I''), because of the higher electronegativity of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atoms, and a resonance donating group (+''M''), due to the ability of its π system to donate electron density when conjugation is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansch|first=Corwin.|last2=Leo|first2=A.|last3=Taft|first3=R. W.|date=1991-03-01|title=A survey of Hammett substituent constants and resonance and field parameters|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=91|issue=2|pages=165–195|doi=10.1021/cr00002a004|issn=0009-2665}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenyl group is [[hydrophobic]]. Phenyl groups tend to resist oxidation and reduction. Phenyl groups (like all aromatic compounds) have enhanced stability in comparison to equivalent bonding in [[aliphatic]] (non-aromatic) groups. This increased stability is due to the unique properties of aromatic [[Molecular orbital theory|molecular orbitals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSU&quot;/&gt;

The bond lengths between carbon atoms in a phenyl group are approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hameka1987&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameka|first1=Hendrik F.|title=Computation of the structures of the phenyl and benzyl radicals with the UHF method|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=52|issue=22|year=1987|pages=5025–5026|issn=0022-3263|doi=10.1021/jo00231a035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-[[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectroscopy, protons of a phenyl group typically have [[chemical shift]]s around 7.27 ppm. These chemical shifts are influenced by [[aromatic ring current]] and may change depending on substituents.

==Preparation, occurrence, and applications==
Phenyl groups are usually introduced using reagents that behave as sources of the phenyl anion or the phenyl cation. Representative reagents include [[phenyllithium]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Li) and [[phenylmagnesium bromide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;MgBr). Electrophiles attack benzene to give phenyl derivatives:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;E + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
where E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (the &quot;electrophile&quot;) = Cl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These reactions are called [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Phenyl groups are found in many organic compounds, both natural and synthetic (see figure). Most common among natural products is the [[amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]], which contains a phenyl group. A major product of the [[petrochemical industry]] is &quot;[[Benzene#Production|BTX]]&quot; consisting of benzene, toluene, and xylene - all of which are building blocks for phenyl compounds. The [[polymer]] [[polystyrene]] is derived from a phenyl-containing monomer and owes its properties to the rigidity and hydrophobicity of the phenyl groups. Many drugs as well as many pollutants contain phenyl rings.
One of the simplest phenyl-containing compounds is [[phenol]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH. It is often said the [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance stability]] of phenol makes it a stronger [[acid]] than that of [[aliphatic]] [[alcohols]] such as [[ethanol]] ([[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 10 vs. 16–18). However, a significant contribution is the greater [[electronegativity]] of the ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[alpha carbon]] in phenol compared to the ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; alpha carbon in aliphatic alcohols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silva2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=Pedro Jorge|title=Inductive and Resonance Effects on the Acidities of Phenol, Enols, and Carbonyl α-Hydrogens|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=74|issue=2|year=2009|pages=914–916|issn=0022-3263|doi=10.1021/jo8018736|pmid=19053615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dafydd ap Gwilym''' (c. 1315/1320 – c. 1350/1370) is regarded as one of the leading [[Welsh people|Welsh]] poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. (Dafydd ap Gwilym scholar [[R. Geraint Gruffydd]] suggests c. 1315-c. 1350 as his dates; other scholars {{who|date=December 2014}} place him a little later, c. 1320-c. 1370.)

==Life==
Tradition has it that he was born at Brogynin, Penrhyn-coch (at the time [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn Fawr]] parish), [[Ceredigion]]. His father, Gwilym Gam, and mother, Ardudfyl, were both from [[nobility|noble]] families. As one of noble birth it seems Dafydd did not belong to the guild of professional poets in medieval Wales, and yet the poetic tradition had been strong in his family for generations.

According to R. Geraint Gruffydd he died in 1350, a possible victim of the [[Black Death]]. Tradition says that he was buried within the precinct of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[Strata Florida Abbey]], [[Ceredigion]]. This burial location is disputed by supporters of the [[Talley Abbey]] theory who contend that burial took place in the Talley Abbey Churchyard:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On Saturday 15 September 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by a [[Prifardd]] to mark the site in the churchyard at Talley where a deeply-rooted tradition asserts that the poet Dafydd ap Gwilym lies buried. For many centuries the rival claims of Talley and Ystrad Fflur have been debated as the burialplace of Wales’ foremost poet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y_Llycha&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talyllychau.org.uk/WPcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Issue06-September2007.pdf |title=Y Llychau Issue 6, 2007; p. 16 |publisher=Parochial Church Council of St Michael &amp; All Angels, Talley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first recorded observation that Dafydd ap Gwilym was buried in Talley was made in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y_Llycha&quot;/&gt; Talley is located about 30 miles from Strata Florida (Welsh: Ystrad Fflur).

==Poetry==
It is believed that about one hundred and seventy of his poems have survived, though many others have been attributed to him over the centuries. His main themes were love and nature. The influence of wider European ideas of [[courtly love]], as exemplified in the [[troubadour]] poetry of [[Provence|Provençal]], is seen as a significant influence on Dafydd's poetry.

He was an innovative poet who was responsible for popularising the metre known as the &quot;[[cywydd]]&quot; and first to use it for praise. But perhaps his greatest innovation was to make himself the main focus of his poetry. By its very nature, most of the work of the traditional Welsh court poets kept their own personalities far from their poetry, the primary purpose of which was to sing the praises of their patrons. Dafydd's work, in contrast, is full of his own feelings and experiences, and he is a key figure in this transition from a primarily social poetic tradition into one in which the poet's own vision and art is given precedence. 

Although Dafydd wrote comparatively conventional praise poetry, he also wrote love poetry and poetry expressing a personal wonderment at nature; Dafydd's poetry on the latter subject in particular is largely without precedent in Welsh or European literature in terms of its depth and complexity. His popularity during his own historic period is testified by the fact that so many of his poems were selected for preservation in texts, despite a relatively short career compared to some of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edwards |first1=Huw M. |title=The Literary Context |url=http://www.dafyddapgwilym.net/docs/The%20Literary%20Context.pdf |website=dafyddapgwilym.net |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his poems are addressed to women, but particularly to two of them, Morfudd and Dyddgu. His best-known works include the following poems:
*''Morfudd fel yr haul'' (Morfudd like the sun), a poem to the wife of an [[Aberystwyth]] merchant who seems to have had a long affair with Dafydd, and whom he addressed in many poems; [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Morfudd_fel_yr_haul full text]
*''Merched Llanbadarn'' ([[The Girls of Llanbadarn|The girls of Llanbadarn]]), in which he speaks of going to church on Sunday purely in order to ogle the local women; [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Merched_Llanbadarn full text]
*''Trafferth mewn tafarn'' ([[Trouble at a Tavern|Trouble in a tavern]]), in which he recounts an incident in a tavern that would be worthy of any slapstick film; [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Trafferth_mewn_tafarn full text]
*''Yr wylan'' ([[The Seagull (poem)|The seagull]]), a poem in which Dafydd asks a seagull to carry a message to his love; [https://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Yr_Wylan full text]
*''Y Rhugl Groen'' (The rattle bag), in which Dafydd's intercourse with a young girl is cruelly interrupted; [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Y_Rhugl_Groen full text]; and
*''Cywydd y gal'' (A poem in praise of the penis), a risqué piece of pure medieval [[erotica]]; [http://cy.wikisource.org/wiki/Cywydd_y_gal full text]. Until recently not included in Dafydd's canon for reasons of editorial squeamishness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=David |date=Summer 1985 |title=''Cywydd y Gal'' by Dafydd ap Gwilym |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ampnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Parry+refrained+from+printing%22&amp;dq=%22Parry+refrained+from+printing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |journal=Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies |issue=9 |pages=72–73 |access-date=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Johnston's explanatory notes on the Astrée / Naïve CD 'Beethoven: Irish, Welsh &amp; Scottish Songs' (2001), the words to WoO155 '26 wallisische Lieder', Nr.14 'Der Traum' (1810), were &quot;translated from the Welsh of Dafydd ap Gwilym&quot;. This would be Dafydd's dream-vision poem 'Y Breuddwyd'.

'''Hedd Wyn''' (born '''Ellis Humphrey Evans''', 13 January 1887{{spaced ndash}}31 July 1917) was a [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] [[poet]] who was killed on the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge|second day]] of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] during [[World War I]]. He was posthumously awarded the [[Chairing of the Bard|bard's chair]] at the 1917 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]]. Evans, who had been awarded several chairs for his poetry, was inspired to take the bardic name ''Hedd Wyn'' ({{IPA-cy|heːð wɨ̞n|}}, &quot;blessed peace&quot;) from the way sunlight penetrated the mist in the [[Meirionnydd]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/wyn.html|title=Hedd Wyn|publisher=www.poetsgraves.co.uk|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in the village of [[Trawsfynydd]], [[Wales]], Evans wrote much of his poetry while working as a [[shepherd]] on his family's hill farm. His style, which was influenced by [[romantic poetry]], was dominated by themes of nature and religion. He also wrote several [[war poetry|war poems]] following the outbreak of war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1914.

==Early life==
Ellis Humphrey Evans was born on 13 January 1887 at Penlan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trawsfynydd.org/wp/?page_id=22|title=Trawsfynydd – History}}&lt;/ref&gt; a house in the centre of [[Trawsfynydd]], [[Meirionydd]], [[Wales]]. He was the eldest of eleven children born to Evan and Mary Evans. In the spring of 1887, the family moved to his father's family 168-acre hill-farm of Yr Ysgwrn, in Cwm Prysor, a few miles from [[Trawsfynydd]].&lt;ref&gt;Llwyd (2009), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his life there, apart from a short stint in South Wales.

Ellis Evans received a basic education  from the age of six at the local primary school and Sunday school. He left school around fourteen years of age and worked as a [[shepherd]] on his father's farm.&lt;ref&gt;Llwyd (2009), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his brief attendance in formal schooling (6-14) he had a talent for poetry and had already composed his first poem by the age of eleven, &quot;Y Das Fawn&quot; (the peat stack). Ellis's interests included both Welsh and English poetry. His main influence was the [[Romantic poetry]] of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and themes of nature and religion dominated his work.

== Eisteddfodau ==
His talent for poetry was well known in the village of [[Trawsfynydd]], and he took part in numerous competitions and local [[eisteddfod]]au, winning his first [[Chairing of the Bard|chair]] (Cadair y Bardd) in Bala, 1907, at the age of 20. In 1910, he was given the [[bardic name]] Hedd Wyn ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] for &quot;blessed peace&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Literal translation: white peace&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the sun's rays penetrating the mists in the valleys of Meirionydd. It was suggested by the poet Bryfdir at a poets' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dehandschutter |first=Lieven  |authorlink=Lieven Dehandschutter |year=2001 |title= Hedd Wyn. A Welsh tragedy in Flanders. Vormingscentrum Lodewijk Dosfel (Gent, Flanders, Belgium) |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, he won chairs at the local eisteddfodau at [[Pwllheli]] and [[Llanuwchllyn]], and in 1915 he was successful at local eisteddfodau in [[Pontardawe]] and Llanuwchllyn. That same year he wrote his first poem for the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]]: ''Eryri'', an ode to [[Snowdonia]]. In 1916 he took second place at the Aberystwyth National Eisteddfod with ''Ystrad Fflur'', an [[awdl]] written in honour of [[Strata Florida]], the [[medieval]] [[Cistercian]] abbey ruins in [[Ceredigion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.books.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~alwyn/Cerddibugail/ystrad_fflyr.shtml |title=Online Text |publisher=Freepages.books.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained an ambition to win the National Eisteddfod chair the following year.

==First World War==
Hedd Wyn was a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] and did not enlist for the war initially, feeling he could never kill anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVP7Imhnm5kC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=hedd+wyn+pacifist#q=hedd%20wyn%20pacifist |title=Improving Learning in College: Rethinking Literacies Across the Curriculum |date= 4 March 2009|isbn=9781134031474 |accessdate=2017-10-15|last1=Ivanic |first1=Roz |last2=Edwards |first2=Richard |last3=Barton |first3=David |last4=Martin-Jones |first4=Marilyn |last5=Fowler |first5=Zoe |last6=Hughes |first6=Buddug |last7=Mannion |first7=Greg |last8=Miller |first8=Kate |last9=Satchwell |first9=Candice |last10=Smith |first10=June }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war left [[Nonconformity in Wales|Welsh non-conformists]] deeply divided. Traditionally, the Nonconformists had not been comfortable at all with the idea of warfare. The war saw a major clash within Welsh Nonconformism between those who backed military action and those who adopted a pacifist stance on religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Shipton |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-world-war-pacifism-cracks-8362287 |title=The First World War, pacifism, and the cracks in Wales' Nonconformism movement |publisher=Wales Online |date=2014-12-30 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war inspired Hedd Wyn's work and produced some of his most noted poetry, including ''Plant Trawsfynydd'' (&quot;Children of Trawsfynydd&quot;), ''Y Blotyn Du'' (&quot;The Black Dot&quot;), and ''Nid â’n Ango'' (&quot;[It] Will Not Be Forgotten&quot;). His poem, ''Rhyfel'' (&quot;War&quot;), remains one of his most frequently quoted works.
{{Verse translation|lang=cy|
Gwae fi fy myw mewn oes mor ddreng,
A Duw ar drai ar orwel pell;
O'i ôl mae dyn, yn deyrn a gwreng,
Yn codi ei awdurdod hell.

Pan deimlodd fyned ymaith Dduw
Cyfododd gledd i ladd ei frawd;
Mae sŵn yr ymladd ar ein clyw,
A'i gysgod ar fythynnod tlawd.

Mae'r hen delynau genid gynt,
Ynghrog ar gangau'r helyg draw,
A gwaedd y bechgyn lond y gwynt,
A'u gwaed yn gymysg efo'r glaw
|
Why must I live in this grim age,
When, to a far horizon, God
Has ebbed away, and man, with rage,
Now wields the sceptre and the rod?

=== Rogallo wing ===
Sport parachuting has experimented with the [[Rogallo wing]], among other shapes and forms.  These were usually an attempt to increase the forward speed and reduce the landing speed offered by the other options at the time.  The ram-air parachute's development and the subsequent introduction of the sail slider to slow deployment reduced the level of experimentation in the sport parachuting community. The parachutes are also hard to build.

=== Ribbon and Ring ===
[[File:HiRISE image of MSL during EDL (refined).png|thumb|The [[Mars Science Laboratory]] capsule, carrying the Mars rover [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']], descending under a ring parachute.]]
Ribbon and ring parachutes have similarities to annular designs. They are frequently designed to deploy at [[supersonic]] speeds. A conventional parachute would instantly burst upon opening and be shredded at such speeds. Ribbon parachutes have a ring-shaped canopy, often with a large hole in the centre to release the pressure. Sometimes the ring is broken into ribbons connected by ropes to leak air even more. These large leaks lower the stress on the parachute so it does not burst or shred when it opens. Ribbon parachutes made of [[Kevlar]] are used on nuclear bombs, such as the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]] and [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Mitcheltree| first1=R| last2=Witkowski| first2=A| title=High Altitude Test Program for a Mars Subsonic Parachute| journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics| url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37615/1/05-0981.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703083934/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37615/1/05-0981.pdf| url-status=dead| archive-date=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ram-air ===
The principle of the Ram-Air Multicell Airfoil was conceived in 1963 by Canadian Domina &quot;Dom&quot; C. Jalbert, but serious problems had to be solved before a ram-air canopy could be marketed to the sport parachuting community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=Charles W. |date=1975 |title=Sport Parachuting |location=Chicago |publisher=Henry Regnery Company |page=191 |isbn=0-8092-8378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ram-air parafoils are steerable (as are most canopies used for sport parachuting), and have two layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form &quot;cells&quot;. The cells fill with higher-pressure air from vents that face forward on the leading edge of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the parachute lines trimmed under load such that the ballooning fabric inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called ''[[Airlock (parachute)|airlocks]]''.  &quot;The first jump of this canopy (a Jalbert Parafoil) was made{{when|date=June 2020}} by International Skydiving Hall of Fame member Paul &quot;Pop&quot; Poppenhager.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ram-air&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://skydivingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame/inductee/domina-c-jalbert|title = International Skydiving Hall of Fame Member Domina C.

==== Varieties ====
[[File:Ram air square.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[United States Navy]] Parachute Team &quot;Leap Frogs&quot; jumper landing a &quot;square&quot; ram-air parachute.]]
Personal ram-air parachutes are loosely divided into two varieties – rectangular or tapered – commonly called &quot;squares&quot; or &quot;ellipticals&quot;, respectively. Medium-performance canopies (reserve-, [[BASE jumping|BASE]]-, canopy formation-, and accuracy-type) are usually rectangular. High-performance, ram-air parachutes have a slightly tapered shape to their leading and/or trailing edges when viewed in plan form, and are known as ellipticals. Sometimes all the taper is on the leading edge (front), and sometimes in the trailing edge (tail).

Ellipticals are usually used only by sport parachutists. They often have smaller, more numerous fabric cells and are shallower in profile. Their canopies can be anywhere from slightly elliptical to highly elliptical, indicating the amount of taper in the canopy design, which is often an indicator of the responsiveness of the canopy to control input for a given wing loading, and of the level of experience required to pilot the canopy safely.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The rectangular parachute designs tend to look like square, inflatable air mattresses with open front ends. They are generally safer to operate because they are less prone to dive rapidly with relatively small control inputs, they are usually flown with lower wing loadings per square foot of area, and they glide more slowly. They typically have a lower [[glide ratio]].

Wing loading of parachutes is measured similarly to that of aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical wing loading for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter – often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly with wing loading below 5&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly with wing loading between 5 and 7&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this wing loading. Professional Canopy pilots compete with wing loading of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes with wing loading higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.

Smaller parachutes tend to fly faster for the same load, and ellipticals respond faster to control input. Therefore, small, elliptical designs are often chosen by experienced canopy pilots for the thrilling flying they provide. Flying a fast elliptical requires much more skill and experience. Fast ellipticals are also considerably more dangerous to land. With high-performance elliptical canopies, nuisance malfunctions can be much more serious than with a square design, and may quickly escalate into emergencies. Flying highly loaded, elliptical canopies is a major contributing factor in many skydiving accidents, although advanced training programs are helping to reduce this danger.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

High-speed, cross-braced parachutes, such as the Velocity, VX, XAOS, and Sensei, have given birth to a new branch of sport parachuting called &quot;swooping.&quot; A race course is set up in the landing area for expert pilots to measure the distance they are able to fly past the {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on}} tall entry gate. Current world records exceed {{convert|180|m|ft}}.

Aspect ratio is another way to measure ram-air parachutes. Aspect ratios of parachutes are measured the same way as aircraft wings, by comparing span with chord. Low aspect ratio parachutes, ''i.e.'', span 1.8 times the chord, are now limited to precision landing competitions. Popular precision landing parachutes include Jalbert (now NAA) Para-Foils and John Eiff's series of Challenger Classics. While low aspect ratio parachutes tend to be extremely stable, with gentle stall characteristics, they suffer from steep glide ratios and a small tolerance, or &quot;sweet spot&quot;, for timing the landing flare.

Because of their predictable opening characteristics, parachutes with a medium aspect ratio around 2.1 are widely used for reserves, BASE, and canopy formation competition.  Most medium aspect ratio parachutes have seven cells.

High aspect ratio parachutes have the flattest glide and the largest tolerance for timing the landing flare, but the least predictable openings. An aspect ratio of 2.7 is about the upper limit for parachutes. High aspect ratio canopies typically have nine or more cells. All reserve ram-air parachutes are of the square variety, because of the greater reliability, and the less-demanding handling characteristics.

=== Paragliders ===
{{main|paraglider}}
[[File:Paraglider at Cochrane Hill, AB, Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Paragliding]] at [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]] hill, [[Alberta|AB]], [[Canada]], 1991. An APCO Starlite 26.]]
[[File:Apco_Starlite_26_paraglider_launch_inflating_cells_by_pulling_up_top_risers.jpg|thumb|Apco Starlite 26 paraglider launch inflating cells by pulling up top risers]]
Paragliders - virtually all of which use ram-air canopies - are more akin to today's sport parachutes than, say, parachutes of the mid-1970s and earlier. Technically, they are ''ascending parachutes'', though that term is not used in the paragliding community, and they have the same basic airfoil design of today's 'square' or 'elliptical' sports [[parachuting]] canopy, but generally have more sectioned cells, higher aspect ratio and a lower profile. Cell count varies widely, typically from the high 20s to the 70s, while aspect ratio can be 8 or more, though aspect ratio (projected) for such a canopy might be down at 6 or so - both outrageously higher than a representative skydiver's parachute. The wing span is typically so great that it's far closer to a very elongated rectangle or ellipse than a ''square'' and that term is rarely used by paraglider pilots. Similarly, span might be ~15 m with span (projected) at 12 m. Canopies are still attached to the harness by suspension lines and (four or six) risers, but they use lockable [[carabiner]]s as the final connection to the harness. Modern high-performance paragliders often have the cell openings closer to the bottom of the leading edge and the end cells might appear to be closed, both for aerodynamic streamlining (these apparently closed end cells are vented and inflated from the adjacent cells, which have venting in the cell walls).

The main difference is in paragliders' usage, typically longer flights that can last all day and hundreds of kilometres in some cases. The harness is also quite different from a parachuting harness and can vary dramatically from ones for the beginner (which might be just a bench seat with nylon material and webbing to ensure the pilot is secure, no matter the position), to seatboardless ones for high altitude and [[Cross-country flying|cross-country flights]] (these are usually full-body cocoon- or hammock-like devices to include the outstretched legs - called ''speedbags'', ''aerocones'', etc. - to ensure aerodynamic efficiency and warmth). In many designs, there will be protection for the back  and shoulder areas built-in, and support for a reserve canopy, water container, etc. Some even have windshields.

Because paragliders are made for foot- or ski-launch, they aren't suitable for terminal velocity openings and of course, there is no slider to slow down an opening (paraglider pilots typically start with an ''open'' but uninflated canopy). To launch a paraglider, one typically spreads out the canopy on the ground to closely approximate an open canopy with the suspension lines having little slack and less tangle - see more in [[Paragliding]]. Depending on the wind, the pilot has three basic options: 1) a running forward launch (typically in no wind or slight wind), 2) a standing launch (in ''ideal'' winds) and 3) a reverse launch (in higher winds). In ideal winds, the pilot pulls on the top risers to have the wind inflate the cells and simply eases the brakes down, much like an aircraft's flaps, and takes off. Or if there is no wind, the pilot runs or skis to make make it inflate, typically at the edge of a cliff or hill. Once the canopy is above one's head, it's a gentle pull down on both toggles in ideal winds, a tow (say, behind a vehicle) on flat ground, a continued run down the hill, etc. Ground handling in a variety of winds is important and there are even canopies made strictly for that practice, to save on wear and tear of more expensive canopies designed for say, [[Cross-country flying|XC]], competition or just recreational flying.

==== General characteristics ====

Main parachutes used by [[skydiver]]s today are designed to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the [[slider (parachuting)|slider]]; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a [[grommet]] near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the rigging lines of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces the rate at which the lines can spread. This reduces the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate.

At the same time, the overall design of a parachute still has a significant influence on the deployment speed. Modern sport parachutes' deployment speeds vary considerably. Most modern parachutes open comfortably, but individual skydivers may prefer harsher deployment.

The deployment process is inherently chaotic. Rapid deployments can still occur even with well-behaved canopies. On rare occasions, deployment can even be so rapid that the jumper suffers bruising, injury, or death. Reducing the amount of fabric decreases the air resistance.  This can be done by making the slider smaller, inserting a mesh panel, or cutting a hole in the slider.

== Deployment ==
[[File:3Ring release animation.gif|thumb|upright|Animation of [[3-ring release system]] used by a skydiver to cut away the main parachute. It utilizes a [[mechanical advantage]] of 200 to 1.]]
Reserve parachutes usually have a [[ripcord (skydiving)|ripcord]] deployment system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed [[pilot chute]]. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, to which it is attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.

Only the hand-deployed pilot chute may be collapsed automatically after deployment—by a kill line reducing the in-flight drag of the pilot chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This is known as a free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.

Occasionally, a pilot chute does not generate enough force either to pull the pin or to extract the bag. Causes may be that the pilot chute is caught in the turbulent wake of the jumper (the &quot;burble&quot;), the closing loop holding the pin is too tight, or the pilot chute is generating insufficient force. This effect is known as &quot;pilot chute hesitation,&quot; and, if it does not clear, it can lead to a total malfunction, requiring reserve deployment.

Paratroopers' main parachutes are usually deployed by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag that contains the parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration, the deployment bag is known as a direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.

== Safety ==
[[File:typhoon deploying parachute arp.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] using a [[drogue parachute]] for braking after landing.]]
A parachute is carefully folded, or &quot;packed&quot; to ensure that it will open reliably. If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in a malfunction where the main parachute fails to deploy correctly or fully. In the United States and many developed countries, emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by &quot;[[Parachute rigger|riggers]]&quot; who must be trained and certified according to legal standards. Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary &quot;main&quot; parachutes.

Exact numbers are difficult to estimate because parachute design, maintenance, loading, packing technique and operator experience has a significant impact on malfunction rates. Approximately one in a thousand sport main parachute openings malfunctions, requiring the use of the reserve parachute, although some skydivers have many thousands of jumps and never needed to use their reserve parachute.

Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed somewhat differently. They are also designed more conservatively, favouring reliability over responsiveness and are built and tested to more exacting standards, making them more reliable than main parachutes. Regulated inspection intervals, coupled with significantly less use contributes to reliability as wear on some components can adversely affect reliability. The primary safety advantage of a reserve parachute comes from the [[probability]] of an unlikely main malfunction being multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction, although there is also a small possibility that a malfunctioning main parachute cannot be released and thus interfere with the reserve parachute. In the United States, the 2017 average fatality rate is recorded to be 1 in 133,571 jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety |title=Skydiving Safety |publisher=United States Parachute Association |access-date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822014822/https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety |url-status=live |archive-date=August 22, 2018|df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries and fatalities in sport skydiving are possible even under a fully functional main parachute, such as may occur if the skydiver makes an error in judgment while flying the canopy which results in a high-speed impact either with the ground or with a hazard on the ground, which might otherwise have been avoided, or results in collision with another skydiver under canopy.

[[File: Apollo 15 descends to splashdown.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 15]] spacecraft landed safely despite a parachute line failure in 1971.]]
Below are listed the malfunctions specific to round parachutes. 
* A &quot;Mae West&quot; or &quot;blown periphery&quot; is a type of round parachute malfunction that contorts the shape of the canopy into the outward appearance of a large [[brassiere]], named after the generous proportions of the late actress [[Mae West]].  The column of nylon fabric, buffeted by the wind, rapidly heats from friction and opposite sides of the canopy can fuse together in a narrow region, removing any chance of it opening fully.
*A &quot;streamer&quot; is the main chute which becomes entangled in its lines and fails to deploy, taking the shape of a paper streamer.  The parachutist cuts it away to provide space and clean air for deploying the reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;
* An &quot;inversion&quot; occurs when one skirt of the canopy blows between the suspension lines on the opposite side of the parachute and then catches air. That portion then forms a secondary lobe with the canopy inverted. The secondary lobe grows until the canopy turns completely inside out.
* A &quot;[[barber's pole]]&quot; describes having a tangle of lines behind the jumper's head, who cuts away the main and opens his reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;[http://www.screamingeagle.org/PDFs/JumpSchoolatFortBenning.pdf Scott Royce E. &quot;Bo.&quot; ''Jump School at Fort Benning'' (originally published in a column called DUSTOFF in the July – August 1988 Issue of the ''Screaming Eagle Magazine'')] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130034732/http://screamingeagle.org/PDFs/JumpSchoolatFortBenning.pdf |date=November 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The &quot;[[Malfunction (parachuting)#Horseshoe|horseshoe]]&quot; is an out-of-sequence deployment, when the parachute lines and bag are released before the bag drogue and bridle. This can cause the lines to become tangled or a situation where the parachute drogue is not released from the container.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;
*&quot;Jumper-In-Tow&quot; involves a static line that does not disconnect, resulting in a jumper being towed behind the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;

== Records ==

[[File: HIGUEROTE DESDE EL AIRE.png|thumb|upright|A jumper in free-fall in Venezuela with his parachute on his back]]

On August 16, 1960, [[Joseph Kittinger]], in the [[Project Excelsior#Test jumps|Excelsior III test jump]], set the previous world record for the highest parachute jump. He jumped from a [[balloon]] at an altitude of {{Convert|102800|ft|m|0}} (which was also a piloted balloon altitude record at the time). A small stabilizer chute deployed successfully, and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeffrey S. Hampton |title='Hero of Aviation' speaks about record-setting free fall |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |page=Y1 |date=December 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; also setting a still-standing world record for the longest parachute [[free-fall]], if falling with a stabilizer chute is counted as free-fall. At an altitude of {{Convert|17500|ft|m|-2}}, Kittinger opened his main chute and landed safely in the [[New Mexico]] desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref name=Friend&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Friend | title=Out of thin air His free fall from {{convert|20|mi|km}} put NASA on firm footing | work=[[USA Today]] | page=1D | date=August 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as {{convert|-94|°F|°C|0}}. In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of 614&amp;nbsp;mph (988&amp;nbsp;km/h or 274&amp;nbsp;m/s), or Mach 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/fichas-e/1960/HMN-19600816.htm |title=Data of the stratospheric balloon launched on 8/16/1960 For EXCELSIOR III |publisher=Stratocat.com.ar |date=September 25, 2013 |access-date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev|Yevgeni Andreyev]], a colonel in the [[Soviet Air Force]], held the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump (without [[drogue chute]]) after falling for 24,500&amp;nbsp;m (80,380&amp;nbsp;ft) from an altitude of 25,457&amp;nbsp;m (83,523&amp;nbsp;ft) near the city of [[Saratov, Russia]] on November 1, 1962, until broken by [[Felix Baumgartner]] in 2012.

[[Felix Baumgartner]] broke Joseph Kittinger's record on October 14, 2012, with a [[Red Bull Stratos|jump]] from an altitude of 127,852 feet (38,969.3 m) and reaching speeds up to 833.9&amp;nbsp;mph (1,342.0&amp;nbsp;km/h or 372.8&amp;nbsp;m/s), or nearly Mach&amp;nbsp;1.1.  Kittinger was an advisor for Baumgartner's jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/faster-than-the-speed-of-sound-the-man-who-falls-to-earth-1877875.html|title=Faster than the speed of sound: the man who falls to earth|date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Eustace]] made a jump from the stratosphere on October 24, 2014, from an altitude of 135,889.108 feet (41,419 m). However, because Eustace's jump involved a [[drogue parachute]] while Baumgartner's did not, their vertical speed and free fall distance records remain in different record categories.

'''Pesticides''' are substances that are meant to control [[pest (organism)|pests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients|title=Basic Information about Pesticide Ingredients |date=Apr 2, 2018|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|access-date=Dec 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term pesticide includes all of the following: [[herbicide]], [[insecticide]]s (which may include [[insect growth regulator]]s, termiticides, etc.) [[nematicide]], [[molluscicide]], [[piscicide]], [[avicide]], [[rodenticide]], [[bactericide]], [[insect repellent]], [[animal repellent]], [[antimicrobial]], and [[fungicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.nasda.org/foundation/pesticide-applicator-certification-and-training|title=National Pesticide Applicator Certification Core Manual | vauthors = Randall C, Hock W, Crow E, Hudak-Wise C, Kasai J |publisher=[[National Association of State Departments of Agriculture]] Research Foundation|year=2014|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Washington|pages=|chapter=Pest Management|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabletable.org/263/pesticides|title=Pesticides in Our Food System |website=Food Print|publisher=GRACE Communications|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from [[weed]]s, fungi, or [[insect]]s. As an example - The fungus ''[[Alternaria solani|Alternaria]]'' is used to combat the Aquatic weed, ''[[Salvinia]]''.

In general, a pesticide is a chemical (such as [[carbamate]]) or [[biological agent]] (such as a [[virus]], [[bacterium]], or [[entomopathogenic fungus|fungus]]) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant [[pathogen]]s, weeds, [[mollusca|molluscs]], [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[fish]], [[nematode]]s (roundworms), and [[microbe]]s that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. Along with these benefits, pesticides also have drawbacks, such as [[Pesticide poisoning|potential toxicity]] to humans and other species.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) has defined ''pesticide'' as:
:any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals, causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport, or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances that may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids, or other pests in or on their bodies. The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant, or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit. Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.&lt;ref name=code /&gt;

Pesticides can be classified by target [[organism]] (e.g., [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[rodenticide]]s, and [[pediculicide]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10&quot;/&gt; – see table), chemical structure (e.g., organic, inorganic, synthetic, or [[biopesticide|biological (biopesticide)]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | date=1997|title=Educational and Informational Strategies to Reduce Pesticide Risks|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=26|issue=2|pages=191–200|doi=10.1006/pmed.1996.0122|pmid=9085387|issn=0091-7435}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the distinction can sometimes blur), and physical state (e.g. [[fumigation|gaseous (fumigant)]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Biopesticide]]s include microbial pesticides and [[biochemical]] pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/types-pesticide-ingredients|title=Types of Pesticide Ingredients | date=Jan 3, 2017|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|access-date=Dec 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant-derived pesticides, or &quot;botanicals&quot;, have been developing quickly. These include the [[pyrethrum|pyrethroid]]s, [[rotenone|rotenoid]]s, [[nicotine|nicotinoid]]s, and a fourth group that includes [[strychnine]] and [[scilliroside]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamryn 1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Pesticide-Profiles-Toxicity-Environmental-Impact-and-Fate/Kamrin/p/book/9781566701907|title=Pesticide Profiles: Toxicity, Environmental Impact, and Fate| vauthors = Kamrin MA |date=1997|publisher=CRC|isbn=978-1566701907|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton|pages=|oclc=35262311}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include [[organochlorine]]s, [[organophosphate]]s, and [[carbamate]]s. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., [[DDT]]) could be separated into dichlorodiphenyl ethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamryn 1997&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|239–240}} Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], allowing [[acetylcholine]] to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamryn 1997&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|136–137}} Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. [[2,4-D]]), triazines (e.g., [[atrazine]]), ureas (e.g., [[diuron]]), and Chloroacetanilide (e.g., [[alachlor]]). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamryn 1997&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|300}} Triazines interfere with photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamryn 1997&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|335}} Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including [[glyphosate]].

Initially, the company struggled in the [[spice trade]] because of the competition from the already well-established [[Dutch East India Company]]. The English company opened a factory in Bantam on Java on its first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Java remained an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The Bantam factory closed in 1683.

Company ships docked at [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]] in 1608. The company established its first Indian factory in 1611 at [[Machilipatnam|Masulipatam]] on the [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]; and a second at Surat in 1612. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. However, in 1609 he renewed the East India Company's charter for an indefinite period, with the proviso that its privileges would be annulled if trade was unprofitable for three consecutive years.

English traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;fordham1&quot;&gt;The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods. {{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/india/1617englandindies.html|title=Indian History Sourcebook: England, India, and The East Indies, 1617 CE|publisher=Fordham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1612, James I instructed Sir [[Thomas Roe]] to visit the Mughal Emperor Nur-ud-din Salim [[Jahangir]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1605–1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:&lt;ref name=&quot;fordham1&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.

For confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}

== Expansion ==
The company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da Índia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] – Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch [[United East India Company]] (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China, which helped secure EIC ports in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gabriel Tatton's Maritime Atlas of the East Indies, 1620–1621: Portsmouth Royal Naval Museum, Admiralty Library Manuscript, MSS 352 |first=Sarah |last=Tyacke |author-link=Sarah Tyacke |journal=Imago Mundi |volume=60 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=39–62 |doi=10.1080/03085690701669293|s2cid=162239597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company established [[trading post]]s in [[Surat]] (1619), [[Chennai|Madras]] (1639), Bombay (1668), and [[Calcutta]] (1690). By 1647, the company had 23&amp;nbsp;factories, each under the command of a [[factor (agent)|factor]] or master merchant and governor, and 90 employees{{clarify|date=March 2017}} in India. The major factories became the walled forts of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] in Bengal, [[Fort St George]] in Madras, and [[Bombay Castle]].

In 1634, the Mughal emperor [[Jahangir]] extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of [[Bengal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/east-india-company-sent-a-diplomat-to-jahangir-all-the-mughal-emperor-cared-about-was-beer/281255/|title=East India Company sent a diplomat to Jahangir &amp; all the Mughal Emperor cared about was beer|first=William|last=Dalrymple|date=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–1641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.

Within the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&amp;nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&amp;nbsp;ships. It specialised in the spice trade and gave its shareholders 40% annual dividend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neatorama.com/2012/08/06/The-Nutmeg-Wars/|title=The Nutmeg Wars|website=Neatorama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British East India Company was fiercely competitive with the Dutch and French throughout the 17th and 18th centuries over spices from the [[Spice Islands]]. Spices, at the time, could only be found on these islands, such as pepper, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon could bring profits as high as 400 percent from one voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=1600 The British East India Company| trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 5, 13:16| medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales. Chantilly, VA, USA | publisher=Liulevicius, Professor Vejas Gabriel (lecturer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tension was so high between the Dutch and the British East Indies Trading Companies that it escalated into at least four [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] between them:&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt; 1652–1654, 1665–1667, 1672–1674 and 1780–1784.

The Dutch Company maintained that profit must support the cost of war which came from trade which produced profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=1600 The British East India Company| trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 5, 15:18| medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales. Chantilly, VA, USA | publisher=Liulevicius, Professor Vejas Gabriel (lecturer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition arose in 1635 when Charles I granted a trading licence to Sir [[William Courten|William Courteen]], which permitted the rival [[Courteen association]] to trade with the east at any location in which the EIC had no presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riddick|first=John F. |title=The history of British India: a chronology |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0-313-32280-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;East India Company&quot; (1911). [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Volume 8, p.835&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689 a Mughal fleet commanded by [[Sidi Yaqub]] attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to [[Aurangzeb]]'s camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops, and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Asia.aspx|title=Asia facts, information, pictures – Encyclopedia.com articles about Asia|publisher=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavery 1621–1757 ===

The East India Company's own archives suggest that its involvement in the slave trade began in 1684, when a Captain Robert Knox was tasked with purchasing 250 slaves from Madagascar to be transported to St. Helena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinkston|first=Bonnie|date=3 October 2018|title=Documenting the British East India Company and their Involvement in the East Indian Slave Trade|url=https://aquila.usm.edu/slisconnecting/vol7/iss1/10|journal=SLIS Connecting|volume=7|issue=1|pages=53–59|doi=10.18785/slis.0701.10|issn=2330-2917|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, it was the early 1620s when the East India Company began transporting slave labor to and using it in its facilities across Asia and the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=East India Company {{!}} Definition, History, &amp; Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company|access-date=21 June 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen (2015) suggests that it was 1621.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=European Slave Trading in the Indian Ocean, 1500–1850|url=http://www.ohioswallow.com/book/European+Slave+Trading+in+the+Indian+Ocean%2C+1500%E2%80%931850|access-date=21 June 2020|website=Ohio University Press • Swallow Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Bodleian Library MS. Jap. b.2 Shuinjo.jpg|thumb|Document with the original [[vermilion]] seal of Tokugawa Ieyasu, granting trade privileges in Japan to the East India Company in 1613]]

In 1613, during the rule of [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the British ship {{ship||Clove|ship|2}}, under the command of Captain [[John Saris]], was the first British ship to call on Japan. Saris was the chief factor of the EIC's trading post in Java, and with the assistance of [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]], a British sailor who had arrived in Japan in 1600, he was able to gain permission from the ruler to establish a commercial house in [[Hirado, Nagasaki|Hirado]] on the Japanese island of [[Kyushu]]:
{{quote|We give free license to the subjects of the King of Great Britaine, Sir Thomas Smythe, Governor and Company of the East Indian Merchants and Adventurers forever safely come into any of our ports of our Empire of Japan with their shippes and merchandise, without any hindrance to them or their goods, and to abide, buy, sell and barter according to their own manner with all nations, to tarry here as long as they think good, and to depart at their pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marguerite Eyer|last=Wilbur|title=The East India Company: And the British Empire in the Far East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTCsAAAAIAAJ|year=1945|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2864-5|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, unable to obtain Japanese [[raw silk]] for import to China and with their trading area reduced to Hirado and [[Nagasaki]] from 1616 onwards, the company closed its factory in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Akira|last1=Hayami|title=Japan's Industrious Revolution: Economic and Social Transformations in the Early Modern Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-1rCQAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-55142-3|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mughal convoy piracy incident of 1695 ===
In September 1695, Captain [[Henry Every]], an English pirate on board the {{ship||Fancy|ship|2}}, reached the Straits of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet on return from the annual pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden ''[[Ganj-i-Sawai]]'', reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the ''Fateh Muhammed''. They were spotted passing the straits en route to [[Surat]]. The pirates gave chase and caught up with ''Fateh Muhammed'' some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some £50,000 to £60,000 worth of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=Douglas R |year=2009 |title=The Pirates' Pact: The Secret Alliances Between History's Most Notorious Buccaneers and Colonial America|location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-147476-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul ''Ganj-i-Sawai'', which resisted strongly before eventually [[striking the colours|striking]]. ''Ganj-i-Sawai'' carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the ''Ganj-i-Sawai'' had a total value between £325,000 and £600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sims-Williams |first1=Ursula |title=The highjacking of the Ganj-i Sawaʼi |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2013/03/the-highjacking-of-the-ganj-i-sawa%CA%BCi.html# |website=The British Library |accessdate=16 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter sent to the Privy Council by Sir [[John Gayer (died 1711)|John Gayer]], then governor of Bombay and head of the East India Company, Gayer claims that &quot;it is certain the Pirates&amp;nbsp;... did do very barbarously by the People of the Ganj-i-Sawai and Abdul Ghaffar's ship, to make them confess where their money was.&quot; The pirates set free the survivors who were left aboard their emptied ships, to continue their voyage back to India.

When the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. To appease Aurangzeb, the East India Company promised to pay all financial reparations, while [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] declared the pirates ''[[hostis humani generis]]'' (&quot;enemies of the human race&quot;). In mid-1696 the government issued a £500 bounty on Every's head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. When the East India Company later doubled that reward, the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burgess|2009|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and [[Nawab Daud Khan]] to attack and close four of the company's factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughals]], blaming them for their countryman's depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his [[Grand Vizier]] Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E.

== Forming a complete monopoly ==

[[File:Rear view of the East India Company's Factory at Cossimbazar.jpg|thumb|Rear view of the East India Company's Factory at Cossimbazar]]
The prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power. The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company – the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new &quot;parallel&quot; East India Company (officially titled the ''English Company Trading to the East Indies'') was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boggart&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boggart |first1=Dan |editor1-last=Lamoreaux |editor1-first=Naomi R. |editor2-last=Wallis |editor2-first=John Joseph |title=East Indian Monopoly and Limited Access in England |journal=Organizations, Civil Society, and the Roots of Development |date=2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of £315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot; /&gt;

It quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last1=Company|first1=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R. Hill at the Government Press|pages=217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this arrangement, the merged company lent to the Treasury a sum of £3,200,000, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot; /&gt;

In the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby and Parliament. The company sought a permanent establishment, while Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730. {{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

At this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of £1&amp;nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddnb.com&quot;&gt;Thomas, P. D. G. (2008) &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22699 Pratt, Charles, first Earl Camden (1714–1794)]&quot;, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, online edn. Retrieved 15 February 2008 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war took place on Indian soil, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt–Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddnb.com&quot; /&gt;

With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. In 1801 [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] reported to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that

=== Saltpetre trade ===
[[File:Potassium nitrate.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saltpetre]] used for [[gunpowder]] was one of the major trade goods of the company]]

Sir [[Sir John Banks, 1st Baronet|John Banks]], a businessman from [[Kent]] who negotiated an agreement between the king and the company, began his career in a syndicate arranging contracts for [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling the navy]], an interest he kept up for most of his life. He knew that [[Samuel Pepys]] and [[John Evelyn]] had amassed a substantial fortune from the [[Levant]] and Indian trades.

He became a director and later, as governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of £20,000 and £30,000 worth of [[saltpetre]]—also known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in [[gunpowder]]—for the King &quot;at the price it shall [[Candle auction|sell by the candle]]&quot;—that is by auction—where bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janssens|first1=Koen|title=Annales Du 17e Congrès D'Associationi Internationale Pour L'histoire Du Verre|publisher=Asp / Vubpress / Upa|isbn=978-90-5487-618-2|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir6UHACu7zMC&amp;pg=PA366|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company. So high was the demand from armed forces that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salt.org.il/frame_saltpet.html|title=SALTPETER the secret salt – Salt made the world go round|publisher=salt.org.il|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seven Years' War (1756–1763) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories. [[Robert Clive]], the governor-general, led the company to a victory against [[Joseph François Dupleix]], the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize [[Battle of Manila (1762)|Manila]] in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regiments.org/wars/18thcent/56philip.htm |title=The Seven Years' War in the Philippines |website=Land Forces of Britain, the Empire and Commonwealth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040710132157/http://www.regiments.org/wars/18thcent/56philip.htm |archivedate=10 July 2004 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|reason=Citation is to a hobbyist website; there must be peer reviewed academically published sources for this.|date=November 2016}}

By the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war ([[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]], [[Mahé, India|Mahe]], [[Karaikal]], [[Yanam, French India|Yanam]] and [[Chandernagar]]) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondichéry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.

The East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. This was one of the incidents which led to the [[American revolution]] and independence of the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Stacy|title=The big box swindle|url=https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/7/19/stacy-mitchell|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East India Company Army and Navy ===
{{Main|Presidency armies}}
In its first century and half, the EIC used a few hundred soldiers as guards. The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203–227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.

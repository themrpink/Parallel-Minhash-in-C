A '''single-occupancy vehicle''' ('''SOV''') is a privately operated [[vehicle]] whose only occupant is the driver. The drivers of SOVs use their vehicles primarily for personal travel, daily commuting and for running errands. The types of vehicles include, but are not limited to, [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs), [[light-duty truck]]s, and any combination thereof, along with all the various van and car sizes, but would  generally be taken to exclude [[human-powered vehicle]]s such as bicycles. This term is used by [[transportation engineering|transportation engineers]] and [[transportation planning|planners]].  SOVs contrast with [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s (HOV), which have two or more occupants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/82391565.html?dids=82391565:82391565&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+01%2C+2001&amp;author=Charles+Komanoff.+Charles+Komanoff+is+a+trustee+of+the+Tri-State+Transportation+Campaign%2C+a+non-profit+group.&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Giuliani+Puts+Brakes+on+Car+Culture&amp;pqatl=google Newsday Oct 1, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mannering, Fred L., Walter P.

'''''Quercus kelloggii''''', the '''California black oak''', also known as '''Kellogg oak''', is an [[oak]] in the [[red oak]] section (genus ''Quercus'', section ''Lobatae'', series ''Agrifoliae''), native to western [[North America]]. Although genetically separated from them for more than 20 million years its leaves (though not its fruit) are remarkably similar in appearance to several other members of the red oak section including the red oak (''[[Quercus rubra]]'') and the black oak (''[[Quercus velutina]]'') found in eastern and central North America.

==Distribution and habitat==
California black oak is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing in [[California mixed evergreen forest|mixed evergreen forests]], [[California oak woodland|oak woodlands]], and [[coniferous forest]]s. California black oak is distributed along foothills and lower mountains of [[California]] and western [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BONAP&quot;&gt;{{BONAP |genus=Quercus |species=kelloggii |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s&gt;{{Calflora|Quercus kelloggii |id=7000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is found from [[Lane County, Oregon]], south through the [[Cascade Range]], the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast]], [[Transverse Ranges|Transverse]], and [[Peninsular Ranges]] to [[San Diego County, California]] and into [[Baja California (region)|Baja California]]. The tree occurs in pure or mixed stands. Pure stands usually indicate sites unfavorable to conifer growth or recurring disturbance such as fire or logging activities. The tree can grow in many types of soils, but it is important that the soil be well-drained.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=s/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BONAP&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Quercus kelloggii (bark leaf).jpg|thumb|left|California black oak leaf and bark]]
''Quercus kelloggii'' typically grows from {{cvt|9|–|25|m|ft}} in height and from {{cvt|0.3|-|1.4|m|ft}} in diameter. Large trees may exceed {{cvt|36|m|ft}} in height and {{cvt|1.6|m|ft}} diameter. The species also grows in [[shrub]]by scrub-oak form on poor sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;&gt;{{FEIS |genus=Quercus |species=kelloggii |type=tree |last=Fryer |first=Janet L. |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In open areas the crown is broad and rounded, with lower branches nearly touching the ground or forming a browse line. In closed stands, the crown is narrow and slender in young trees and irregularly broad in old trees. Trunks are usually free of branches on the lower {{cvt|6|–|12|m|ft}} in closed stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt; Trunks are often forked, and usually decayed and hollow in older trees. The bark is thin and smooth in young trees, becoming thick, ridged, and plate-like with age.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt; This oak grows from one to several vertical roots which penetrate to bedrock, with large, laterally spreading roots extending off from vertical ones. It also has a number of surface roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;FNA&quot;&gt;{{eFloras|1|233501052|Quercus kelloggii |family=Fagaceae |first=Kevin C. |last=Nixon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acorn]]s are relatively large in this species, from {{cvt|2.5|–|3|cm|in}} long and {{cvt|1.5|-|1.8|cm|in}} wide. The deeply lobed leaves are typically {{cvt|10|–|20|cm|in}} long. While individual trees generally have a lifespan between 100 and 200 years, California black oak can live up to 500&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FNA&quot;/&gt;

The tree reproduces when its acorns sprout to form seedlings. It also reproduces [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] with new growth sprouting from the root crown after the tree is top-killed by [[wildfire]], [[logging]], [[frost]], or other events.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FNA&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
The California black oak is a critical species for wildlife. Oaks (''[[Quercus]]'' spp.) may be the single most important genus used by [[wildlife]] for food and cover in California forests and rangelands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/quekel/all.html|title=Quercus kelloggii|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2019-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California black oak occupies more total area in California than any other hardwood species. Livestock also make heavy use of this species for food and cover.

[[Image:Quercus kelloggii (tree).jpg|thumb|right|Young California black oaks]]
Cavities in the trees provide den or nest sites for [[owl]]s, various woodpeckers, [[tree squirrel]]s, and [[American black bear]]s. Trees provide valuable shade for livestock and wildlife during the hot summer months. California black oak forest types are heavily used for spring, summer, and fall cover by black bear.

It is browsed by [[deer]] and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitney |first=Stephen |title=Western Forests (The Audubon Society Nature Guides) |date=1985 |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=0-394-73127-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/westernforests00whit/page/396 396] |url=https://archive.org/details/westernforests00whit/page/396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acorns are heavily utilized by livestock, mule deer, feral [[pig]]s, rodents, [[mountain quail]], [[Steller's jay]], and [[woodpecker]]s. Acorns constitute an average of 50% of the fall and winter diets of [[western gray squirrel]] and [[black-tailed deer]] during good mast years. Fawn survival rates increase or decrease with the size of the acorn crop.

It is a preferred foraging substrate for many birds. All of 68 bird species observed in oak woodlands of the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] of California used California black oak for part of their foraging activities. [[Acorn woodpecker]], [[Bullock's oriole]], and [[Nashville warbler]] show strong preference for California black oak. The [[parasitic plant]] [[Phoradendron villosum|Pacific mistletoe]] (''Phoradendron villosum''), which commonly grows on this oak, produces berries which attract birds as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

Many animals [[Cache (biology)|cache]] the acorns, and acorns that have been stored in the ground or otherwise buried are more likely to sprout than those that remain on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

The tree is adapted to wildfire. It is protected from smaller fires by its thick bark. If it is top-killed and burned away in a larger fire, it easily resprouts and has a good supply of nutrients and water stored in its root system.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt; Acorns sprout into seedlings after fire and sites that have been cleared of canopy and leaf litter in fires are ideal for seedling success.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

This oak is vulnerable to [[sudden oak death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

==Allergenicity==
The pollen is released in spring and is a severe allergen.
&lt;ref name=&quot;pollen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=California Black Oak (''Quercus kellogii'') |url=http://www.pollenlibrary.com/Local/Specie/Quercus+kelloggii/in/Santa%20clara%20County/CA/ |website=Pollen Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Some California [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] preferred California black oak acorns over those of other species for making acorn meal. This acorn was a [[staple food]] for many Native American groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;FNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Quercus+kelloggii Ethnobotany]&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans recognized the importance of fire to this oak, and purposely lit fires in oak woodlands to promote its health and ensure their food source.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

The [[wood]] is used for making furniture, [[pallet]]s, and construction timber.&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt; It is used as an [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FEIS&quot;/&gt;

===Timber===
California black oak comprises a total volume of 29% of California's hardwood timber resources, and is the major hardwood sawn into lumber there. The total estimated area of species occurrence is 361,800 ha (3,618&amp;nbsp;km² or 894,000 acres); 239,200 ha (2,392&amp;nbsp;km² or 591,000 acres) of timberland and 122,600 ha (1,226&amp;nbsp;km² or 303,000 acres) of woodland. Of this land 60% is privately owned, 31% is in National Forests, and 9% is on other public lands. It has greatly decreased from its historic abundance. This is due to a number of factors, including drought, disease, animal foraging, logging practices, fire suppression, and a variety of other human impacts. Cutting green trees for fuelwood has contributed to the decline of this species, and illegal harvesting of green trees from public lands is a continuing problem.

It was long considered by foresters and government agencies to be a weed tree. In its earlier years, its only use was to feed the boilers of donkey engines bringing in the valuable pine and fir logs. There was a period in the mid 1960s when U.S. Forest Service policy in California's National Forests was systematic extermination of California black oak by girdling the trees.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The objective was to make room for more coniferous growth. In the rush to utilize the pines, firs and redwoods, the dense hardwoods were looked on with contempt. Like a few other visionaries in the 1960s, [[Guy Hall]] thought the California black oak presented a beautiful challenge that deserved better than eradication. In 1965 Hall convinced federal agencies to cease their extermination policies.

[[Plantation]]s of California black oak have been successfully established in clearcuts from acorn plantings. Thinning such stands promotes stand productivity and wood quality, and is recommended when trees are from {{cvt|9|–|15|m|ft}} tall or when stand density (basal area) exceeds 29 m²/ha (125&amp;nbsp;ft²/acre). This tree has also been managed for hardwood production by maintaining scattered pure stands within coniferous forests. Stands of this species will often establish on poorer sites, where conifer seedling establishment has not been successful.

===Cultivation===
''Quercus kelloggii'' is cultivated in the specialty [[horticulture]] trade as an [[ornamental tree]] for [[native plant]], [[xeriscape|drought tolerant]] water conserving, and [[habitat garden]]s, and various types of municipal, commercial, and agency sustainable landscape and [[ecological restoration|restoration]] projects.

Chernyakhovsk was founded in 1336 by the [[Teutonic Knights]] on the site of a former [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] fortification when [[Dietrich von Altenburg]], the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master]] of the Teutonic Knights, built a [[castle]] called '''Insterburg''' following the [[Prussian Crusade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Teutonic Knights' [[Northern Crusades]] campaign against the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the town was devastated in 1376 and then again by [[history of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Polish]] troops in 1457. The castle had been rebuilt as the seat of a [[Procurator (Teutonic Knights)|Procurator]] and a settlement also named Insterburg grew up to serve it.

When the Prussian Duke [[Albert, Duke in Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] in 1525 [[secularized]] the monastic [[State of the Teutonic Order]], Insterburg became part of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] and was granted [[town privileges]] on 10 October 1583 by the Prussian regent [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Margrave George Frederick]].{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Insterburg became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701, and because the area had been depopulated by [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the early 18th century, King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] invited [[Protestantism|Protestant]] refugees who had been expelled from the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] to settle in Insterburg in 1732.

In 1818, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the town became the seat of [[Insterburg District]] within the [[Gumbinnen (region)|Gumbinnen Region]]. [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] died at Insterburg in 1818 on his way from his [[Livonia]]n manor to Germany, where he wanted to renew his health. In 1863, a Polish secret organization was founded and operated in Insterburg, which was involved in [[arms trafficking]] to the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland during the [[January Uprising]]. Since May 1864, the leader of the organization was Józef Racewicz.

Insterburg became a part of the [[German Empire]] following the 1871 [[unification of Germany]], and on May&amp;nbsp;1, 1901, it became an [[independent city]] separate from Insterburg District. During [[World War I]] the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] seized Insterburg on 24 August 1914, but it was retaken by Germany on 11 September 1914. The [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] era after World War I saw the town separated from the rest of the country as the province of [[East Prussia]] had become an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]]. The [[association football]] club [[Yorck Boyen Insterburg]] was formed in 1921. During [[World War II]], Insterburg was heavily bombed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] on July&amp;nbsp;27, 1944. The town was stormed by [[Red Army]] troops on January&amp;nbsp;21–22, 1945. As part of the northern part of East Prussia, Insterburg was transferred from Germany to the [[Soviet Union]] after the war as previously agreed between the [[Allies of World War II|victorious powers]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. The [[Germans|German]] population was either [[evacuation of East Prussia|evacuated]] or [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expelled]] and replaced with [[Russians]]. On 7 April 1946, Insterburg was renamed as Chernyakhovsk in honor of the Soviet World War II [[Army General (Soviet rank)|Army General]], [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]], who commanded the army that first entered East Prussia in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot; /&gt;

After 1989, a group of people introduced the [[Akhal-Teke]] horse breed to the area and opened an Akhal-Teke breeding [[stable]].

== Coat of Arms Controversy ==
[[File:Wappen von Insterburg.gif|thumb|left|110px|Coat of arms of Insterburg]]On September 2019 the local court ruled&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-court-finds-illegal-german-coat-of-arms-of-town-in-far-western-exclave/30169130.html|title=Russian Court Finds Illegal 'German' Coat Of Arms Of Town In Far Western Exclave|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the coat of arms was illegal because it carries &quot;elements of foreign culture.&quot; The local court alleged that [[Law of Russia|Russian laws]] do not allow the use of foreign languages and symbols in Russian state symbols and ordered the town &quot;to remove any violations of the law.&quot;

The town's coat of arms, adopted in 2002, was based on the historic coat of arms of the town that before 1946 was known under its original [[Prussia]]n name - Insterburg.

The full version of coat of arms in question has a picture of a Prussian man with a horn and the Latin initials G.F. for the Regent of Prussia [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George Frederick]], [[margrave]] of [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] (1543–1603), who gave Insterburg the status of town and with it his family coat of arms.

The case brought before the court follows a trend among several towns in the region that have announced their intentions to change their coat of arms as tensions mount between Russia and the West following Moscow's [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Ukraine's Crimea]] in 2014 and its support for pro-Russian separatists in [[Ukraine]]'s east.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

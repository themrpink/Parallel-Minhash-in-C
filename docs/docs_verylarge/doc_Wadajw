===First republic===
{{main|Republic of Lucca}}
After the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany]], the city began to constitute itself an independent [[Medieval commune|commune]] with a charter in 1160. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor provinces in the region between southern [[Liguria]] and northern Tuscany dominated by the [[Malaspina family|Malaspina]]; Tuscany in this time was a part of feudal Europe. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]’s ''Divine Comedy'' includes many references to the great feudal families who had huge jurisdictions with administrative and judicial rights. Dante spent some of his exile in Lucca.

In 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[capitano del popolo]]'' (captain of the people) named [[Luchetto Gattilusio]]. In 1314, internal discord allowed [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] of Pisa to make himself lord of Lucca. The Lucchesi expelled him two years later, and handed over the city to another  ''[[condottiero]]'', [[Castruccio Castracani]], under whose rule it became a leading state in central Italy. Lucca rivalled [[Florence]] until Castracani's death in 1328. On 22 and 23 September 1325, in the [[battle of Altopascio]], Castracani defeated [[Florence]]'s Guelphs. For this he was nominated by [[Louis IV the Bavarian]] to become duke of Lucca. Castracani's tomb is in the church of San Francesco. His biography is [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s third famous book on political rule.

Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, the city was sold to a rich Genoese, Gherardino Spinola, then seized by John, king of Bohemia. Pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them it was ceded to [[Mastino II della Scala]] of [[Verona]], sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, and then nominally liberated by the emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] and governed by his vicar.

In 1408, Lucca hosted the [[convocation]] intended to end the schism in the papacy.

Lucca managed, at first as a [[democracy]], and after 1628 as an [[oligarchy]], to maintain its independence alongside of [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]], and painted the word ''Libertas'' on its banner until the French Revolution in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Napoleonic conquest===
[[File:Palazzo pfanner, giardini 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Pfanner]], garden view]]
Lucca had been the second largest Italian city state (after [[Venice]]) with a republican constitution (&quot;comune&quot;) to remain independent over the centuries.

Between 1799 and 1800 it was contended by the French and Austrian armies. Finally the French prevailed and granted a democratic constitution in the 1801. Howeverer, already in 1805 the Republic of Lucca was converted into a monarchy by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who installed his sister [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi]] as &quot;Princess of Lucca&quot;.

From 1815 to 1847 it was a [[Bourbon house|Bourbon-Parma]] [[Duchy of Lucca|duchy]]. The only reigning dukes of Lucca were [[Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca|Maria Luisa of Spain]], who was succeeded by her son [[Charles II, Duke of Parma]] in 1824. Meanwhile, the [[Duchy of Parma]] had been assigned for life to [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], the second wife of [[Napoleon]]. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Vienna (1815)]], upon the death of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] in 1847, Parma reverted to [[Charles II, Duke of Parma]], while Lucca lost independence and was annexed to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. As part of Tuscany, it became part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1860 and finally part of the [[Italy|Italian State]] in 1861.

===World War II internment camp===
{{Further|List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy}}
In 1942, during [[World War II]], a [[prisoner-of-war]] camp was established at the village of [[Colle di Compito]], in the municipality of [[Capannori]], about {{convert|11|km}} from Lucca. Its official number was P.G. (''prigionieri di guerra'') 60,&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Megargee | editor1-first=G.P. | editor-last2=White | editor-first2=J.R. | title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945, Volume III: Camps and Ghettos under European Regimes Aligned with Nazi Germany|chapter=Colle di Compecito|first=Silvia Q.|last=Angelini | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-253-02386-5 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nBTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA421 | access-date=26 May 2020  | page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was usually referred to as PG 60 Lucca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ill-treatment of prisoners of war at Camp PG 60, Lucca, Italy, July to November 1942 | website=The National Archives | date=2008-12-18 | url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=8803320&amp;catln=6 | access-date=26 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it never had permanent structures and accommodation consisted of tents in an area prone to flooding, it housed more than 3,000 British and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] prisoners of war during the period of its existence. It was handed over to the Germans on 10 September 1943, not long after the signing of the [[Italian armistice]]. During the [[Italian Social Republic]], as a [[puppet state]] of the Germans, [[political prisoner]]s, foreigners, [[common law]] prisoners and [[Jew]]s were interned there, and it functioned as a [[concentration camp]]. In June 1944 the prisoners were moved to [[Bagni di Lucca#World War II|Bagni di Lucca]].&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;

===Walls, streets, and squares===
The walls encircling the old town remain intact, even as the city expanded and modernized, unusual for cities in the region. Initially built as a defensive [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]], once the walls lost their military importance they became a pedestrian promenade, the Passeggiata delle Mura Urbane, a street atop the walls linking the bastions. It passes through the Bastions of Santa Croce, San Frediano, San Martino, San Pietro/Battisti, San Salvatore, La Libertà/Cairoli, San Regolo, San Colombano, Santa Maria, San Paolino/Catalani, and San Donato; and over the gates (Porte): San Donato, Santa Maria, San Jocopo, Elisa, San Pietro, and Sant'Anna. Each of the four principal sides of the structure is lined with a different tree species than the others.

The walled city is encircled by Piazzale Boccherini, Viale Lazzaro Papi, Viale Carlo Del Prete, Piazzale Martiri della Libertà, Via Batoni, Viale Agostino Marti, Viale G. Marconi (''vide'' [[Guglielmo Marconi]]), Piazza Don A. Mei, Viale [[Alfredo Pacini|Pacini]], Viale Giusti, Piazza Curtatone, Piazzale Ricasoli, Viale Ricasoli, Piazza Risorgimento (''vide'' [[Risorgimento]]), and Viale [[Giosuè Carducci]].

The town includes a number of public squares, most notably the [[Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, Lucca|Piazza dell'Anfiteatro]], site of ancient Roman amphitheater; but also Piazzale Verdi; Piazza Napoleone'; and Piazza San Michele.

'''Siderno''' ({{lang-scn|label=[[Central-Southern Calabrian|Calabrian]]|Sidernu}} or {{lang|scn|Siderni}}; {{cns|{{Lang-el|Σιδέρνο|translit=Sidérno}}|date=May 2019}}) is a town and ''[[comune]]''  in  the [[Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria]], [[Calabria]], southern [[Italy]], about 3 kilometres from [[Locri]].

'''Siderno Marina''' is the newer town located on the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian coast]]. It is a destination for both Italian and foreign [[tourism|tourists]] and has a bathing beach.

'''Siderno Superiore''' is the old town, higher up on the flank of the coastal mountain range. It has historic palaces, old buildings and very narrow streets. It has now become a ghost town because most of the old population has moved to the more modern Siderno which is the new city and offers more job opportunities and services.

==History==
The early history of the town is unknown. The old town in the hilly inland was probably founded in the 10th century by some people from [[Locri]], who had fled to the area to defend themselves from Saracen incursions; in the following century it became a hamlet of the county of [[Grotteria]] and was home to various feudal lords. Siderno Marina was built along the coast after the [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|1783 earthquake]].&lt;ref name=siderno&gt;[http://www.hotelsincalabria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=88&amp;lang=en Siderno] (''Retrieved January 22, 2010'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
Large-scale emigration abroad as well as to Northern Italy, which began to diminish only in the 1970s, has had a lasting effect on the demographic situation in the region. Emigrants from Siderno emigrated to the United States, Canada and Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianlives.arts.uwa.edu.au/stories/pisconeri Maria Pisconeri (née Panetta)], Italian Lives in Western Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familiesunearthed.com/lagana/lagana-giovanni.htm Giovanni Lagana &amp; Maria Larosa], Lagana Family Genealogy&lt;/ref&gt; since the end of the 19th century to find employment.

Many moving to Canada settled in [[Schreiber, Ontario]], because of the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and many played a major part in its completion.  One of them was Cosimo Figliomeni. His good fortune and letters home lured many of his villagers to jobs in Schreiber. Half of Schreiber's 2,000 residents trace their roots to the Italian city of Siderno.&lt;ref name=doc&gt;[http://www.whitepinepictures.com/seeds/i/7/index.html Sons and Daughters: The Italians of Schreiber], A Scattering of Seeds – The Creation of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Siderno  is a  tourist resort  on the Ionian coast of the province of Reggio Calabria, with wide, sandy beaches, and a clear sea .&lt;ref name=siderno/&gt;

The Siderno area is a center of production of [[bergamot orange]], a citrus fruit that is used as an essence and fundamental ingredient in cosmetics, for its wound healing properties in the pharmaceutical industry, and for flavouring in the food industry.&lt;ref name=siderno/&gt;

==Crime==
{{main|Siderno Group}}
The town is home to the [['Ndrangheta]], a [[Mafia]]-type criminal organization based in Calabria. Several powerful criminal clans originate from the town. Siderno was the fiefdom of [[Antonio Macrì]], the undisputed local boss until his demise in January 1975.

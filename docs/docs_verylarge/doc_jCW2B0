===1952===
Dewey did not run for president in 1952, but [[Draft Eisenhower movement|he played a key role]] in securing the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1952|Republican nomination]] for [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Taft was an announced candidate and, given his age, he freely admitted 1952 would be his last chance to win the presidency. Once Eisenhower became a candidate, Dewey used his powerful political machine to win Eisenhower the support of delegates in New York and elsewhere. 

The 1952 campaign culminated in a climactic moment in the fierce rivalry between Dewey and Taft for control of the Republican Party. At the Republican Convention, pro-Taft delegates and speakers verbally attacked Dewey as the real power behind Eisenhower, but Dewey had the satisfaction of seeing Eisenhower win the nomination and end Taft's presidential hopes for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 584–595.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey played a major role in helping California Senator [[Richard Nixon]] become Eisenhower's running mate. When Eisenhower won the presidency later that year, many of Dewey's closest aides and advisors became leading figures in the Eisenhower Administration. Among them were [[Herbert Brownell Jr.|Herbert Brownell]], who would become Eisenhower's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]; [[James Hagerty]], who would become [[White House Press Secretary]]; and [[John Foster Dulles]], who would become Eisenhower's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

== Rivalry with Robert A. Taft ==
Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, &quot;For fifteen years&amp;nbsp;... these two combatants waged political warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced the other as a political heretic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 279)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that &quot;we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a [[laissez-faire]] society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts to turn back the clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country.&quot; He added that people who opposed such social programs should &quot;go out and try to get elected in a typical American community and see what happens to them. But they ought not to do it as Republicans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 547-548)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the speech Dewey added that the Republican Party believed in social progress &quot;under a flourishing, competitive system of private enterprise where every human right is expanded&amp;nbsp;... we are opposed to delivering the nation into the hands of any group who will have the power to tell the American people whether they may have food or fuel, shelter or jobs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 548)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey believed in what he called &quot;compassionate capitalism&quot;, and argued that &quot;in the modern age, man's needs include as much economic security as is consistent with individual freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 34&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; When Taft and his supporters criticized Dewey's policies as liberal &quot;me-tooism&quot;, or &quot;aping the [[New Deal]] in a vain attempt to outbid Roosevelt's heirs&quot;, Dewey responded that he was following in the tradition of Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and that &quot;it was conservative reforms like anti-trust laws and federal regulation of railroads&amp;nbsp;... that retained the allegiance of the people for a capitalist system combining private incentive and public conscience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 34&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Nixon Contact Sheet WHPO-2168 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Dewey with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1969]]
In May 1953, Governor Dewey set up a nine-member Advisory Board to help the State Safety Division's Bureau of Safety and Accident Prevention and appointed [[Edward Burton Hughes]] (the Deputy [[New York State Superintendent of Public Works]]) as Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;''Ogdensburg Journal'', 26 May 1953, front page – Dewey Appoints Advisory Board to Safety Bureau (report)&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Board was formed to draft accident prevention policies and programs.

Dewey's third term as governor of New York expired at the end of 1954, after which he retired from public service and returned to his law practice, [[Dewey Ballantine]], although he remained a power broker behind the scenes in the Republican Party. In 1956, when Eisenhower mulled not running for a second term, he suggested Dewey as his choice as successor, but party leaders made it plain that they would not entrust the nomination to Dewey yet again, and ultimately Eisenhower decided to run for re-election. Dewey also played a major role that year in convincing Eisenhower to keep Nixon as his running mate; Eisenhower had considered dropping Nixon from the Republican ticket and picking someone he felt would be less partisan and controversial. However, Dewey argued that dropping Nixon from the ticket would only anger Republican voters while winning Eisenhower few votes from the Democrats. Dewey's arguments helped convince Eisenhower to keep Nixon on the ticket. In 1960, Dewey would strongly support Nixon's ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign against Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 623–626.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dewey publicly supported [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in all four of his campaigns for Governor of New York, and backed Rockefeller in his losing 1964 bid for the Republican presidential nomination against Arizona Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], he did privately express concern and disappointment with what he regarded as Rockefeller's &quot;spendthrift&quot; methods as governor, and once told him &quot;I like you Nelson, but I don't think I can afford you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 624-625)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, when both Rockefeller and Nixon were competing for the Republican presidential nomination, Dewey was publicly neutral, but &quot;privately, according to close friends, he favored Nixon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 625)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, as the conservative wing assumed more and more power within the Republican Party, Dewey removed himself further and further from party matters. When the Republicans in 1964 gave the conservative Senator Goldwater their presidential nomination Dewey declined to even attend the Republican Convention in San Francisco; it was the first Republican Convention he had missed since 1936.

Although closely identified with the Republican Party for virtually his entire adult life, Dewey was a close friend of Democratic Senator [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], and Dewey aided Humphrey in being named as the Democratic nominee for vice-president in 1964, advising President [[Lyndon Johnson]] on ways to block efforts at the party convention by Kennedy loyalists to stampede [[Robert F. Kennedy]] onto the ticket as Johnson's running mate.

In the mid-1960s, President Johnson tried to convince Dewey to accept positions on several government commissions, especially a national crime commission, which Johnson wanted Dewey to chair.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 627)&lt;/ref&gt; After Nixon won the presidency in 1968, there were rumors that Dewey would be offered a cabinet position, or a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 631)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dewey declined all offers to return to government service, preferring instead to concentrate on his highly profitable law firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt; By the early 1960s, his share of the firm's profits had made him a millionaire, and his net worth at the time of his death was estimated at over $3&amp;nbsp;million (or $19&amp;nbsp;million in 2019 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 621)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=3%2C000%2C000&amp;year1=197103&amp;year2=201707)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey was offered the position of Chief Justice of the United States by Dwight D. Eisenhower and again by Richard Nixon in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot; /&gt; He declined the offer both times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1tBBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=thomas+dewey+new+york|title=Almost President: The Men Who Lost the Race but Changed the Nation|last=Farris|first=Scott|date=2013-05-07|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780762784219|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Dewey's wife Frances died in July 1970, after battling [[breast cancer]] for six years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 630–634.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/23/archives/mrs-nixon-attends-mrs-deweys-rites.html)&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1970, Dewey began to date actress [[Kitty Carlisle]], and there was talk of marriage between them.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 634-636)&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 1971, Dewey traveled to [[Miami, Florida]] for a brief golfing vacation with friend [[Dwayne Andreas]] and other associates. 

On March 16, following a round of golf with [[Boston Red Sox]] player [[Carl Yastrzemski]], he returned to his room in the Seaview Hotel to pack; he was due that evening at the [[White House]] in Washington to help celebrate the engagement of President Nixon's daughter, [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 637)&lt;/ref&gt; When Dewey failed to appear for his ride to the Miami airport, a concerned Andreas convinced the hotel management to take him to Dewey's room.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot; /&gt; They found Dewey, fully dressed, lying on his back across the bed, and packed to leave.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 637-638)&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy determined that he had died suddenly from a massive [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] eight days before his 69th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 635–638.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 638-639)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a public memorial service at [[St. James' Episcopal Church (New York City)|Saint James' Episcopal Church]] in New York City, which was attended by President Nixon, former vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]], New York governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], and other prominent politicians, Dewey was buried next to his wife Frances in the town cemetery of [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 640)&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his farm of Dapplemere was sold and renamed &quot;Dewey Lane Farm&quot; in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public image==
Dewey received varied reactions from the public and fellow politicians, with praise for his good intentions, honesty, administrative talents, and inspiring speeches, but most also criticizing his ambition and perceived stiffness in public. One of his biographers wrote that he had &quot;a personality that attracted contempt and adulation in equal proportion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 18&quot; /&gt; 

Dewey was a forceful and inspiring speaker, traveling the whole country during his presidential campaigns and attracting uncommonly huge crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters, p. 18&quot;&gt;Peters, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His friend and neighbor Lowell Thomas believed that Dewey was &quot;an authentic colossus&quot; whose &quot;appetite for excellence [tended] to frighten less obsessive types&quot;, and his 1948 running mate Earl Warren &quot;professed little personal affection for Dewey, but [believed] him a born executive who would make a great president.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 18&quot; /&gt; The pollster [[George Gallup]] once described Dewey as &quot;the ablest public figure of his lifetime... the most misunderstood man in recent American history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 18&quot; /&gt;

On the other hand, President Franklin D. Roosevelt privately called Dewey &quot;the little man&quot; and a &quot;son of a bitch&quot;, and to Robert Taft and other conservative Republicans Dewey &quot;became synonymous with&amp;nbsp;... New York newspapers, New York banks, New York arrogance – the very city Taft's America loves to hate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 33&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; A Taft supporter once referred to Dewey as &quot;that snooty little governor of New York.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 33&quot; /&gt;

=== Appearance and mustache ===
Dewey grew his mustache when he was dating Frances, and because &quot;she liked it, the mustache stayed, to delight cartoonists and dismay political advisers for twenty years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1944 election campaign, Dewey suffered an unexpected blow when [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]] was reported as having mocked Dewey as &quot;the little man on the wedding cake&quot;{{Efn|Longworth did not originate the witticism. Democratic Party operatives Isabel Kinnear Griffin and Helen Essary Murphy began circulating the remark, attributing it to Longworth to help it spread (Cordery, p. 424).}}, alluding to his neat mustache and dapper dress. It was ridicule he could never shake.

Roger Masters, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, wrote: &quot;The shaved face has become a reflection of the [[Protestant ethic]]. Politicians are supposed to control nature in some sense, so beards and mustaches, which imply a reluctance to control nature, are now reserved for [[artisans]] or [[academics]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes103188&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=OLIN|first=DIRK|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-31/local/me-469_1_facial-hair|title=In Politics, the Mustache Is the Kiss of Death|date=1988-10-31|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2016-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|&quot;Since 1912, the Oval Office has not been gained by anyone bearing so much as mutton chop, goatee or fu man chu. And it's been 40 years since the either party has even nominated a facially hirsute candidate.&quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes103188/&gt;}}

Dewey alienated former Republican president [[Herbert Hoover]], who confided to a friend &quot;Dewey has no inner reservoir of knowledge on which to draw for his thinking,&quot; elaborating that &quot;A man couldn't wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leuchtenburg, ''Herbert Hoover'' (2009), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators and analysts in 1948 attributed the falloff in Dewey's popularity late in his presidential campaign, in part, to his distinctive mustache and resemblance to actor [[Clark Gable]], which was said to raise doubts with voters as to the seriousness of Dewey as prospective leader of the Free World.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes103188&quot; /&gt; 

=== Aloofness ===
Dewey had a tendency towards pomposity&lt;ref&gt;Dewey defeats Truman: Well, everyone makes mistakes. ''Chicago Tribune.'' http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-deweydefeats-story,0,6484067.story&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered stiff and unapproachable in public, with his aide [[Ruth Hanna McCormick|Ruth McCormick Simms]] once describing him as &quot;cold, cold as a February iceberg&quot;. She added that &quot;he was brilliant and thoroughly honest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 298-299&lt;/ref&gt;

During his governorship, one writer observed: &quot;A blunt fact about Mr. Dewey should be faced: it is that many people do not like him. He is, unfortunately, one of the least seductive personalities in public life. That he has made an excellent record as governor is indisputable. Even so, people resent what they call his vindictiveness, the 'metallic' nature of his efficiency, his cockiness (which actually conceals a nature basically shy), and his suspiciousness. People say... that he is as devoid of charm as a rivet or a lump of stone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Gunther, po. 533)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Dewey's friends considered him a warm and friendly companion. Journalist Irwin Ross noted that, &quot;more than most politicians, [Dewey] displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others' views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern a sense of the dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Ross, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A magazine writer described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that, &quot;Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/17/archives/thomas-e-dewey-is-dead-at-68-racket-buster-twice-ran-for-president.html?_r=1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo O'Brien, a reporter for the [[United Press International]] (UPI), recalled Dewey in an interview by saying that &quot;I hated his guts when he first came to Albany, and I loved him by the time he left. It was almost tragic – how he put on a pose that alienated people. Behind a pretty thin veneer he was a wonderful guy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; John Gunther wrote in 1947 that many supporters were fiercely loyal to Dewey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunther, p. 533&quot;&gt;(Gunther, p. 533)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opportunism and vagueness ===
Dewey's presidential campaigns were hampered by Dewey's habit of not being &quot;prematurely specific&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters, p. 18&quot; /&gt; on controversial issues. President Truman poked fun at Dewey's vague campaign by joking that [[Republican Party (United States)|G.O.P.]] actually stood for &quot;grand old platitudes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dewey Defeats Truman? No Way. Truman &quot;Gave 'em Hell&quot; on His Whistle Stop Tour in 1948 ''US News,'' Jan 17, 2008 https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/01/17/when-harry-gave-em-hell.html?PageNr=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's frequent refusal to discuss specific issues and proposals in his campaigns was based partly on his belief in public opinion polls; one biographer claimed that he &quot;had an almost religious belief in the revolutionary science of public-opinion sampling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 30&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first presidential candidate to employ his own team of pollsters, and when a worried businessman told Dewey in the 1948 presidential campaign that he was losing ground to Truman and urged him to &quot;talk specifics in his closing speeches&quot;, Dewey and his aide Paul Lockwood displayed polling data that showed Dewey still well ahead of Truman, and Dewey told the businessman &quot;when you're leading, don't talk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 30&quot; /&gt;

[[Walter Lippman]] regarded Dewey as an opportunist, who &quot;changes his views from hour to hour… always more concerned with taking the popular position than he is in dealing with the real issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journalist [[John Gunther]] wrote that &quot;There are plenty of vain and ambitious and uncharming politicians. This would not be enough to cause Dewey's lack of popularity. What counts more is that so many people think of him as opportunistic. Dewey seldom goes out on a limb by taking a personal position which may be unpopular... every step is carefully calculated and prepared.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunther, p. 533&quot; /&gt; 

=== Relationship with legislators ===
As governor, Dewey had a reputation for ruthless treatment of New York legislators and political opponents. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Dewey] cracked the whip ruthlessly on [Republican] legislators who strayed from the party fold. Assemblymen have found themselves under investigation by the State Tax Department after opposing the Governor over an insurance regulation bill. Others discover job-rich construction projects, state buildings, even highways, directed to friendlier [legislators]... [He] forced the legislature his own party dominates to reform its comfortable ways of payroll padding. Now legislative workers must verify in writing every two weeks what they have been doing to earn their salary; every state senator and assemblyman must verify that [they] are telling the truth. All this has occasioned more than grumbling. Some Assemblymen have quit in protest. Others have been denied renomination by Dewey's formidable political organization. Reporters mutter among themselves about government by blackmail.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 38&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Honesty and integrity ===
Dewey received positive publicity for his reputation for honesty and integrity. The newspaper editor [[William Allen White]] praised Dewey as &quot;an honest cop with the mind of an honest cop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

He insisted on having every candidate for a job paying $2,500 or more rigorously probed by state police. He was so concerned about the elected public official being motivated by the wealth his position could produce that he frequently said, &quot;No man should be in public office who can't make more money in private life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Repeated statement quoted in Eigen's Political &amp; Historical Quotations, The Literacy Alliance Quote Number 549592.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey accepted no anonymous campaign contributions and had every large contributor not known personally to him investigated &quot;for motive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt; When he signed autographs, he would date them so that no one could imply a closer relationship than actually existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

A journalist noted in 1947 that Dewey &quot;has never made the slightest attempt to capitalize on his enormous fame, except politically. Even when temporarily out of office, in the middle 1930s, he rigorously resisted any temptation to be vulgarized or exploited...he could easily have become a millionaire several times over by succumbing to various movie and radio offers. He would have had to do nothing except give permission for movies or radio serials to be built around his career and name. Be it said to his honor, he never did so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Gunther, p. 531)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1964, the New York State legislature officially renamed the [[New York State Thruway]] in honor of Dewey. Signs on Interstate 95 between the end of the [[Bruckner Expressway]] (in the [[Bronx]]) and the [[Connecticut]] state line, as well as on the Thruway mainline (Interstate 87 between the Bronx-Westchester line and Albany, and Interstate 90 between Albany and the New York-Pennsylvania line) designate the name as ''Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway,'' though this official designation is rarely used in reference to these roads.

Dewey's official papers from his years in politics and public life were given to the [[University of Rochester]]; they are housed in the university library and are available to historians and other writers.

In 2005, the [[New York City Bar Association]] named an award after Dewey. The Thomas E. Dewey Medal, formerly sponsored by the law firm of [[Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP]], is awarded annually to one outstanding Assistant District Attorney in each of New York City's five counties (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond). The Medal was first awarded on November 29, 2005. The Thomas E. Dewey Medal is now sponsored by the law firm Dewey Pegno &amp; Kramarsky LLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thomas E. Dewey Medal |url=https://www.nycbar.org/about/awards-and-special-lectures/the-thomas-e-dewey-medal |website=NYC Bar |accessdate=7 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, [[Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf]] (the successor firm to Dewey Ballantine) filed for bankruptcy.

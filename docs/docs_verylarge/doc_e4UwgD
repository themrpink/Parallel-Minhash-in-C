'''Printing''' is a process for mass reproducing text and [[Printmaking|images]] using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing include [[cylinder seal]]s and objects such as the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Cylinders of Nabonidus]]. The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was [[woodblock printing]], which appeared in China before 220 AD for cloth printing, however it would not be applied to paper until the seventh century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cave&quot;&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas&quot;, 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in printing technology include the [[movable type]] invented by [[Bi Sheng]] around 1040 AD&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Chinese Inventions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota-china.com |access-date=July 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archive-date=December 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century.

==History==
{{Main|History of printing}}

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textiles]] and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D.

====In East Asia====
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|left|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China, 868 AD ([[British Library]])]]
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 A.D.). The earliest examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the [[Diamond Sutra]] ([[British Library]]) of 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |title=Oneline Gallery: Sacred Texts |publisher=British Library |access-date=March 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110093610/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |archive-date=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Tsuen-Hsuin |first1=Tsien |author-link1=Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Needham |first2=Joseph |author-link2=Joseph Needham |title=Paper and Printing |series=Science and Civilisation in China |volume=5 part 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=158, 201 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and Japan, which also used Chinese [[logogram]]s, but the technique was also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;[[Thomas Franklin Carter]], ''The Invention of Printing in China and its Spread Westward'', The Ronald Press, NY 2nd ed. 1955, pp. 176–78&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for [[old master print]]s and [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=A Hyatt |title=Prints and People |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=Princeton |volume=5-18 |isbn=978-0-691-00326-9|year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arabs never used this to print the [[Quran]] because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;{{elaboration needed|date=May 2019}}

====In the Islamic world====
Block printing, called ''[[tarsh]]'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Middle-East &amp; Levant, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic [[Timurid Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), &quot;[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]&quot;. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), pp. 427–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Golden Age of Islam]] saw printing of texts, including passages from the [[Quran]] and Hadith, adopting the Chinese craft of paper making, developed it and adopted it immensely in the [[Islamic world]], which led to a significant increase in the production of manuscript texts. The printing technique in [[Egypt]] was embraced reproducing texts on paper strips and supplying them in different copies to meet the demand.&lt;ref&gt;See Geoffrey Roper, Muslim Printing Before Gutenberg and the references cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloom8&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Bloom |year=2001 |title=Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World |url=https://archive.org/details/paperbeforeprint00bloo |url-access=limited |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-08955-4 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/paperbeforeprint00bloo/page/n23 8]–10, 42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Europe====
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the technique transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference – An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in US), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}} (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movable-type printing===

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Chinese Inventions&quot;/&gt; Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which &quot;proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I., ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of [[paper money]]
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as &quot;extremely similar to Gutenberg's&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) However, more correctly it should be described as the other way around. Gutenberg's form of metal movable type was extremely similar to the Korean Jikji's, which was printed 78 years prior to the Gutenberg Bible. A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The printing press===
{{main|Printing press}}
[[File:De uitvinding van de boekdrukkunst, anoniem, Museum Plantin-Moretus, PK OPB 0186 005.jpg|thumb|450px|The invention of printing, anonymous, design by [[Stradanus]], collection [[Plantin-Moretus Museum]]]]
Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]], adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=S. H. |author-link=S. H. Steinberg |title=Five Hundred Years of Printing |edition=3rd |year=1974 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |isbn=978-0-14-020343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, [[tin]], [[antimony]], copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] – entry &quot;printing&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gutenberg started work on his [[printing press]] around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Polenz |first=Peter von. |title=Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I. Einführung, Grundbegriffe, Deutsch in der frühbürgerlichen Zeit. |publisher=New York/Berlin: Gruyter, Walter de GmbH |year=1991 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to [[typography]] and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]].

Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing have been called the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg &quot;Man of the Millennium&quot;.

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]]. There are multiple types of rotary printinting press technologies that are still used today: sheetfed [[Offset printing|offset]], [[rotogravure]], and [[Flexography|flexographic]] printing.

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image area (printing areas)
# Non-image area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure
# Porous, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator.

===Letterpress===
[[File:Commercial. Le Samedi BAnQ P48S1P03551.jpg|thumb|Miehle press printing Le Samedi journal. [[Montreal]], 1939.]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]]. A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the bed of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper. 
There is different paper for different works the quality of paper shows different ink to use

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century and [[Global spread of the printing press|remained in wide use for books and other uses]] until the second half of the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used modern printing process. This technology is best described as when a positive (right-reading) image on a printing plate is inked and transferred (or &quot;offset&quot;) from the plate to a rubber blanket. The blanket image becomes a mirror image of the plate image. An offset transfer moves the image to a printing substrate (typically paper), making the image right-reading again. Offset printing utilizes a [[Lithography|lithographic]] process which is based on the repulsion of oil and water. The offset process employs a flat (planographic) image carrier (plate) which is mounted on a press cylinder. The image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts an (acidic) film of water, keeping the non-image areas ink-free. Most offset presses utilize three cylinders: Plate, blanket, impression. Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using offset lithography.

===Gravure===
{{Main|Rotogravure}}
'''Gravure printing''' is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or [[laser]] ablation.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Flexography===
[[Flexography]] is a type of relief printing.The relief plates are typically made from [[photopolymer]]s.
The process is used for flexible packaging, corrugated board, labels, newspapers and more. In this market it competes with gravure printing by holding 80% of the market in USA, 50% in Europe but only 20% in Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;IzdebskaThomas2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joanna Izdebska|author2=Sabu Thomas|title=Printing on Polymers: Fundamentals and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjROBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=24 September 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-323-37500-9|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:
* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]
* [[Inkjet]], used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* [[Laser printing]] (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
* [[Pad printing]], popular for its ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
* [[Relief print]], mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogues]]
* [[Screen-printing]] for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
* [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
* [[Thermal printing]], popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009&quot;&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: &quot;Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries&quot;, ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–45 (417, table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that &quot;the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs-Burke&quot;&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Burke, Peter]] (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though sometimes printing in [[Hebrew]] or [[Armenian script]] was permitted.  Thus the first movable type printing in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in Hebrew in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;or soon after; Naim A. Güleryüz, ''Bizans'tan 20. Yüzyıla – Türk Yahudileri'', Gözlem Gazetecilik Basın ve Yayın A.Ş., İstanbul, January 2012, p. 90 {{ISBN|978-9944-994-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]]. [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the [[Ulama]]. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters.  Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J., &quot;İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa and Turkish Incunabula&quot;, ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', 1968, volume 88, issue 3, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2009&quot;&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime's Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby's]&quot;, [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of printing 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyrowitz41&quot;&gt;Meyrowitz: &quot;Mediating Communication: What Happens?&quot; in &quot;Questioning the Media&quot;, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyrowitz41&quot; /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his 1895 lecture ''On the Study of History'', gave &quot;assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs-Burke&quot; /&gt;

Print was instrumental in changing the social nature of reading.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge and allowed comparisons of incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: Because texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged as people were able to form their own opinions on texts.
# Dangerous reading: Reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable, especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love, and if women could read, they could read love notes.
# Creative reading: Printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended.
# Extensive reading: Once print made a wide range of texts available, earlier habits of intensive reading of texts from start to finish began to change, and people began reading selected excerpts, allowing much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics.
# Private reading: Reading was linked to the rise of individualism because, before print, reading was often a group event in which one person would read to a group. With print, both literacy and the availability of texts increased, and solitary reading became the norm.

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, while the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the numbers of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational impact ===
Gutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their &quot;language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modie|first=G|date=2014|title=Gutenberg's Effects on Universities|journal=History of Education|volume=43 |issue=4|page=17|doi=10.1080/0046760X.2014.930186|s2cid=145093891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The language of scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==== University libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. &quot;Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. This issue was solved, however, by a man named Merton (1589) who decided books should be stacked horizontally on shelves.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Arc Jet Complex ==
The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an advanced thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under a variety of simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven vacuum system, a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, data acquisition system, and other auxiliary systems.

The magnitude and capacity of these systems makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, is one of the highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples {{convert|203|by|508|mm|sp=us}} in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, sample sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. [[Catalycity]] studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.

The Arc Jet Complex was listed on the National Register in 2017.

== Range complex ==

===Ames Vertical Gun Range===
The [[Ames Vertical Gun Range]] (AVGR) was designed to conduct scientific studies of lunar impact processes in support of the Apollo missions. In 1979, it was established as a National Facility, funded through the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program. In 1995, increased scientific needs across various disciplines resulted in joint core funding by three different science programs at NASA Headquarters (Planetary Geology and Geophysics, Exobiology, and Solar System Origins). In addition, the AVGR provides programmatic support for various proposed and ongoing planetary missions (e.g. Stardust, Deep Impact).

Using its 0.30 [[Caliber|cal]] light-gas gun and powder gun, the AVGR can launch projectiles to velocities ranging from {{convert|500|to|7000|m/s|ft/s mph|abbr=on}}. By varying the gun's angle of elevation with respect to the target vacuum chamber, impact angles from 0° to 90° relative to the gravitational vector are possible. This unique feature is extremely important in the study of crater formation processes.

The target chamber is approximately {{convert|2.5|m|sp=us}} in diameter and height and can accommodate a wide variety of targets and mounting fixtures. It can maintain vacuum levels below {{convert|0.03|Torr|Pa}}, or can be back filled with various gases to simulate different planetary atmospheres. Impact events are typically recorded with high-speed video/film, or Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).

===Hypervelocity Free-Flight Range===
The [[Hypervelocity Free-Flight]] (HFF) Range currently comprises two active facilities: the Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) and the Gun Development Facility (HFFGDF). The HFFAF is a combined Ballistic Range and Shock-tube Driven Wind Tunnel. Its primary purpose is to examine the aerodynamic characteristics and flow-field structural details of free-flying aeroballistic models.

The HFFAF has a test section equipped with 16 shadowgraph-imaging stations. Each station can be used to capture an orthogonal pair of images of a [[hypervelocity]] model in flight. These images, combined with the recorded flight time history, can be used to obtain critical aerodynamic parameters such as lift, drag, static and dynamic stability, flow characteristics, and pitching moment coefficients. For very high [[Mach number]] (M &gt; 25) simulations, models can be launched into a counter-flowing gas stream generated by the shock tube. The facility can also be configured for hypervelocity impact testing and has an aerothermodynamic capability as well. The HFFAF is currently configured to operate the {{convert|1.5|in}} [[light-gas gun]] in support of continuing thermal imaging and transition research for NASA's hypersonics program.

The HFFGDF is used for gun performance enhancement studies, and occasional impact testing. The Facility uses the same arsenal of light-gas and powder guns as the HFFAF to accelerate particles that range in size from {{convert|3.2|to|25.4|mm|sp=us}} diameter to velocities ranging from {{cvt|0.5|to|8.5|km/s|mph}}. Most of the research effort to date has centered on Earth atmosphere entry configurations (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle), planetary entry designs ([[Viking]], [[Pioneer Venus]], ''[[Galileo]]'' and [[Mars Science Laboratory|MSL]]), and aerobraking (AFE) configurations. The facility has also been used for scramjet propulsion studies ([[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]]) and meteoroid/orbital debris impact studies ([[Space Station]] and [[Reusable launch vehicle|RLV]]). In 2004, the facility was utilized for foam-debris dynamics testing in support of the Return To Flight effort. As of March 2007, the GDF has been reconfigured to operate a cold gas gun for subsonic [[Crew Exploration Vehicle|CEV]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] aerodynamics.

===Electric Arc Shock Tube===
The [[Electric Arc Shock Tube]] (EAST) Facility is used to investigate the effects of radiation and ionization that occur during very high velocity atmospheric entries. In addition, the EAST can also provide air-blast simulations requiring the strongest possible shock generation in air at an initial pressure loading of {{convert|1|atm}} or greater. The facility has three separate driver configurations, to meet a range of test requirements: the driver can be connected to a diaphragm station of either a {{convert|102|mm|sp=us}} or a {{convert|610|mm|sp=us}} shock tube, and the high-pressure {{convert|102|mm|sp=us}} shock tube can also drive a {{convert|762|mm|sp=us}} shock tunnel. Energy for the drivers is supplied by a 1.25-MJ-capacitor storage system.

==United States Geological Survey (USGS)==
In September 2016, the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) announced plans to relocate its West Coast science center from nearby [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] to the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The relocation is expected to take five years and will begin in 2017 with 175 of the USGS employees moving to Moffett. The relocation is designed to save money on the $7.5 million annual rent the USGS pays for its Menlo Park campus. The land in Menlo Park is owned by the [[General Services Administration]], which is required by federal law to charge market-rate rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noack|first1=Mark|title=USGS moving to new home at Moffett Field|url=http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2016/09/19/usgs-eyes-new-home-at-moffett-field|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=Mountain View Voice|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics Alliance Project ===
In 1999, Mark León developed NASA's Robotics Education Project&amp;nbsp;— now called the Robotics Alliance Project&amp;nbsp;— under his mentor Dave Lavery, which has reached over 100,000 students nationwide using [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST robotics]] and [[Botball|BOTBALL]] robotics competitions. The Project's FIRST branch originally comprised [[FIRST Robotics Competition|FRC]] [http://www.team254.com/ Team 254: &quot;The Cheesy Poofs&quot;], an all-male team from [[Bellarmine College Preparatory|Bellarmine High School]] in [[San Jose, California]]. In 2006, [http://spacecookies.org Team 1868: &quot;The Space Cookies&quot;], an all-female team, was founded in collaboration with the Girl Scouts.  In 2012, [http://frc971.org/ Team 971: &quot;Spartan Robotics&quot;] of [[Mountain View High School (Mountain View, California)|Mountain View High School]] joined the Project, though the team continues to operate at their school. All three teams are highly decorated. All three have won Regional competitions, two have won the [[FIRST Championship]], two have won the Regional Chairman's Award, and one is a Hall of Fame team. The three teams are collectively referred to as &quot;House teams&quot;.

The mission of the project is &quot;To create a human, technical, and programmatic resource of robotics capabilities to enable the implementation of future robotic space exploration missions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Robotics Alliance Project Mission|url=http://robotics.nasa.gov/mission.php | work=NASA Robotics Alliance Project | publisher=NASA | accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent events ==
Although the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] slightly increased funding for [[NASA]] overall, the substantial realignment in research priorities that followed the announcement of the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] in 2004 led to a significant number of layoffs at Ames.

On October 22, 2006, NASA opened the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. The center continued work that [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] undertook, including the [[Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]].

In 2008, the [[Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project]] (LOIRP) was given space in the old [[McDonald's]] (the building was renamed McMoons) to digitize data tapes from the five 1966 and 1967 [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft that were sent to the [[Moon]].

Also in 2008, it was announced that former Ames director [[Henry McDonald (engineer)|Henry McDonald]] was a 60th Anniversary Class inductee of the Ames Hall of Fame for providing, &quot;...exceptional leadership and keen technical insight to NASA Ames as the Center re-invented itself in the late 1990s.&quot;

In 2010, scientists at the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at Ames studied the aerodynamics of the [[Adidas Jabulani|Jabulani]] World Cup soccer ball, concluding that it tends to &quot;[[knuckleball|knuckle under]]&quot; at speeds of {{convert|45|to|50|mph}}.&lt;ref name='nasa_soccer'&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/nasalife/features/soccer_ball.html ''NASA Scores Big With Student Soccer Players in the U.S.A. and Canada''].  18 June 2010.  Retrieved March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Aerospace engineer Rabi Mehta attributed this effect to asymmetric flow due to the ball's seam construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-turns-world-cup-into-lesson-in-aerodynamics|title=NASA Turns World Cup into Lesson in Aerodynamics|last=Colen|first=Jerry|date=2015-03-06|work=NASA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, scientists at Ames announced that they had synthesized &quot;...[[uracil]], [[cytosine]], and [[thymine]], all three components of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]], non-biologically in a laboratory under conditions found in space.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/03/05/nasa-scientists-create-ingredients-of-life-in-simulated-space-conditions/ | title=NASA Scientists Create Ingredients of Life in Simulated Space Conditions| date=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public-private partnerships ==

The federal government has re-tasked portions of the facility and human resources to [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/business/index.html support] private sector industry, research, and education.

[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] became the first corporate affiliate of a new Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI); a collaborative venture established by the [[University of California Santa Cruz]] and NASA, based at Ames. The Bio|Info|Nano R&amp;D Institute is dedicated to creating scientific breakthroughs by the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology.

[[Singularity University]] hosts its leadership and educational program at the facility. The [[Organ Preservation Alliance]][http://www.organpreservationalliance.org/] is also headquartered there; the Alliance is a nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the [[Methuselah Foundation]]'s [[Methuselah Foundation#New Organ Prize|New Organ Prize]] &quot;to catalyze breakthroughs on the remaining obstacles towards the long-term storage of organs&quot; to overcome the drastic unmet medical need for viable organs for transplantation. [[Kleenspeed Technologies]] is headquartered there.

===Google===
On 28&amp;nbsp;September 2005, [[Google]] and Ames Research Center disclosed details to a long-term research partnership. In addition to pooling engineering talent, Google planned to build a {{convert|1000000|sqft|ha|adj=on}} facility on the ARC campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2005/05_50AR.html |title=NASA Takes Google on Journey into Space |publisher=NASA Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the projects between Ames, Google, and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] is the [[Gigapan]] Project – a robotic platform for creating, sharing, and annotating terrestrial [[gigapixel]] images.

[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|right|An aquifer cross-section. This diagram shows two aquifers with one aquitard (a confining or impermeable layer) between them, surrounded by the bedrock ''aquiclude'', which is in contact with a gaining [[stream]] (typical in [[humid]] regions). The water table and [[vadose zone|unsaturated zone]] are also illustrated.|upright=1.4]]

An '''aquifer''' is an underground layer of [[water]]-bearing [[permeability (Earth sciences)|permeable rock]], rock fractures or unconsolidated materials ([[gravel]], [[sand]], or [[silt]]). [[Groundwater]] can be extracted using a water [[well]]. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called [[hydrogeology]]. Related terms include '''aquitard''', which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/aquitard |title=aquitard: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=6 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929023340/http://www.answers.com/topic/aquitard |archive-date=29 September 2010  |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''aquiclude''' (or ''aquifuge''), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer, the pressure of which could create a confined aquifer.
== Depth ==
Aquifers occur from near-surface to deeper than {{convert|9000|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/aquifers-and-groundwater | title = Aquifers and Groundwater | work = USGS | quote = ...more than 30,000 feet. On the average, however, the porosity and permeability of rocks decrease as their depth below land surface increases; the pores and cracks in rocks at great depths are closed or greatly reduced in size because of the weight of overlying rocks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be used for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be replenished by local rainfall. Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources. Part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] in North Africa, the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon]] and [[Anti-Lebanon]] ranges between Syria and Lebanon, the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] in Oman, parts of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and neighboring ranges in the [[Southwestern United States|United States' Southwest]], have shallow aquifers that are exploited for their water. [[Overexploitation]] can lead to the exceeding of the practical sustained yield; i.e., more water is taken out than can be replenished. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as [[Libya]] and Israel, increased water usage associated with population growth has caused a lowering of the [[water table]] and the subsequent [[Saltwater intrusion|contamination of the groundwater with saltwater]] from the sea.

A [[beach]] provides a model to help visualize an aquifer. If a hole is dug into the sand, very wet or saturated sand will be located at a shallow depth. This hole is a crude well, the wet sand represents an aquifer, and the level to which the water rises in this hole represents the water table.

In 2013 large freshwater aquifers were discovered under continental shelves off Australia, China, North America and South Africa. They contain an estimated half a million cubic kilometers of &quot;low salinity&quot; water that could be economically processed into [[Drinking water|potable water]]. The reserves formed when ocean levels were lower and rainwater made its way into the ground in land areas that were not submerged until the [[ice age]] ended 20,000 years ago. The volume is estimated to be 100 times the amount of water extracted from other aquifers since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/freshwater-reserves-under-sea/30072/ |title=Huge reserves of freshwater lie beneath the ocean floor |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=11 December 2013 |access-date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Post |first1=V.

== Classification ==
An ''aquitard'' is a zone within the Earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. An aquitard can sometimes, if completely impermeable, be called an ''aquiclude'' or ''aquifuge''. Aquitards are composed of layers of either [[clay]] or non-porous rock with low [[hydraulic conductivity]].

=== Saturated versus unsaturated ===
{{see also|Water content|Soil moisture}}
Groundwater can be found at nearly every point in the Earth's shallow subsurface to some degree, although aquifers do not necessarily contain [[fresh water]]. The Earth's crust can be divided into two regions: the ''[[water content|saturated]] zone'' or ''[[phreatic]] zone'' (e.g., aquifers, aquitards, etc.), where all available spaces are filled with water, and the ''unsaturated zone'' (also called the [[vadose zone]]), where there are still pockets of air that contain some water, but can be filled with more water.

''Saturated'' means the pressure head of the water is greater than [[atmospheric pressure]] (it has a gauge pressure &amp;gt; 0). The definition of the water table is the surface where the [[Hydraulic head|pressure head]] is equal to atmospheric pressure (where gauge pressure = 0).

''Unsaturated'' conditions occur above the water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under [[suction]]. The [[Hydrogeology#Water content|water content]] in the unsaturated zone is held in place by surface [[Adhesion|adhesive forces]] and it rises above the water table (the zero-[[Hydrogeology#Hydraulic head|gauge-pressure]] [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobar]]) by [[capillary action]] to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the [[capillary fringe]]) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and is not the same as saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In [[sand]]y soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} but can range between {{convert|0.3|and|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/plymouth/programs/vepras.html |title=Morphological Features of Soil Wetness |publisher=Ces.ncsu.edu |access-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809084433/http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/plymouth/programs/vepras.html |archive-date=9 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capillary rise of water in a small-[[diameter]] tube involves the same physical process. The water table is the level to which water will rise in a large-diameter pipe (e.g., a well) that goes down into the aquifer and is open to the atmosphere.

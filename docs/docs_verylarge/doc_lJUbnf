A '''sugar beet''' is a plant whose root contains a high concentration of [[sucrose]] and which is grown commercially for [[sugar]] production. In plant breeding it is known as the Altissima [[cultivar group]] of the common beet (''[[Beta vulgaris]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Beta.html Sorting ''Beta'' names at MMPND.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504173112/http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Beta.html |date=2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other beet cultivars, such as [[beetroot]] and [[chard]], it belongs to the subspecies ''Beta vulgaris'' subsp. ''vulgaris.'' Its closest wild relative is the [[sea beet]] (''Beta vulgaris'' subsp. ''maritima'').&lt;ref name=springer/&gt;

In 2013, Russia, France, the United States, Germany, and Turkey were the world's five largest sugar beet producers.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; In 2010–2011, North America and Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar and were all net importers of sugar.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt; The US harvested {{convert|1,004,600|acre|ha|0}} of sugar beets in 2008.&lt;ref name=usda2/&gt; In 2009, sugar beets accounted for 20% of the world's sugar production.&lt;ref name=agrisugar1/&gt;

==Description==
The sugar beet has a conical, white, fleshy root (a [[taproot]]) with a flat crown. The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by [[photosynthesis]] in the leaves and is then stored in the root.

The root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% [[Beet pulp|pulp]].&lt;ref name=respons/&gt; The exact sugar content can vary between 12% and 21% sugar, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a [[cash crop]]. The pulp, [[Solubility|insoluble]] in water and mainly composed of [[cellulose]], hemicellulose, [[lignin]], and [[pectin]], is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and [[molasses]], add another 10% to the value of the harvest.&lt;ref name=agrisugar1/&gt;

Sugar beets grow exclusively in the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] zone, in contrast to [[sugarcane]], which grows exclusively in the tropical and subtropical zones. The average weight of a sugar beet ranges between {{convert|0.5|and|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Sugar beet foliage has a rich, brilliant green color and grows to a height of about {{convert|35|cm|inch|abbr=on}}. The leaves are numerous and broad and grow in a tuft from the crown of the beet, which is usually level with or just above the ground surface.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Beta vulgaris}}
Modern sugar beets date back to mid-18th century [[Silesia]] where the king of [[Prussia]] subsidised experiments aimed at processes for sugar extraction.&lt;ref name=langer&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hill, G. |author2=Langer, R.

Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this strain for white, conical tubers.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; The selection was named ''weiße schlesische Zuckerrübe'', meaning white Silesian sugar beet, and boasted about a 6% sugar content.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; This selection is the progenitor of all modern sugar beets.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt;

A royal decree led to the first factory devoted to sugar extraction from beetroots being opened in [[Konary, Wołów County|Kunern]], Silesia (now Konary, [[Poland]]) in 1801. The Silesian sugar beet was soon introduced to [[France]], where [[Napoleon]] opened schools specifically for studying the plant. He also ordered that {{convert|28000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} be devoted to growing the new sugar beet.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt; This was in response to British blockades of cane sugar during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which ultimately stimulated the rapid growth of a European sugar beet industry.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdsugar&quot;/&gt; By 1840, about 5% of the world's sugar was derived from sugar beets, and by 1880, this number had risen more than tenfold to over 50%.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt; The sugar beet was introduced to North America after 1830, with the first commercial production starting in 1879 at a farm in [[Alvarado, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ucdsugar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; The sugar beet was also introduced to [[Chile]] by German settlers around 1850.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt;

===Creation===
&quot;The beet-root, when being boiled, yields a juice similar to syrup of sugar, which is beautiful to look at on account of its vermilion color&quot;&lt;ref name=worldcat/&gt; (1575).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kloranebotanical.foundation/fr/lhistoire-du-sucre L'histoire du sucre] Klorane botanical foundation&lt;/ref&gt; This was written by 16th-century scientist, [[Olivier de Serres]], who discovered a process for preparing sugar syrup from the common red beet. However, because crystallized cane sugar was already available and provided a better taste, this process never caught on. This story characterizes the history of the sugar beet. The competition between beet sugar and sugarcane for control of the sugar market plays out from the first extraction of a sugar syrup from a garden beet into the modern day.

The use of sugar beets for the extraction of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered the existence of a sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for the extraction of sugar was the white beet.&lt;ref name=margg/&gt; Despite Marggraf’s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor [[Franz Karl Achard]] began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5–6% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties. Under the patronage of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], he opened the world's first beet [[sugar factory]] in 1801, at Cunern (Polish: Konary) in Silesia.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

===France===
[[File:French sugar beet mill, 1843.jpg|thumb|French sugar beet mill in operation in the 1840s]]
The work of Achard soon attracted the attention of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who appointed a commission of scientists to go to Silesia to investigate Achard's factory. Upon their return, two small factories were constructed near Paris. Although these factories were not altogether a success, the results attained greatly interested Napoleon. Thus, when two events, the blockade of Europe by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]], made the importation of cane sugar untenable, Napoleon seized the opportunity offered by beet sugar to address the shortage. In 1811, Napoleon issued a decree appropriating one million [[franc]]s for the establishment of sugar schools, and compelling the farmers to plant a large acreage to sugar beets the following year. He also prohibited the further importation of sugar from the Caribbean effective in 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;

The number of mills increased considerably during the 1820s and 1830s, reaching a peak of 543 in 1837. The number was down to 382 in 1842, producing about 22.5 million kg of sugar during that year.&lt;ref&gt;L'Illustration Journal Universel, 13 May 1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
As a result of the French advances in sugar beet production and processing made during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the beet sugar industry in Europe developed rapidly. A new tax levied in Germany in 1810 prompted the experimentation to increase the sugar content of the beet. This was because the tax assessed the value of the sugar beet crop based on the unprocessed weight of the sugar beet rather than the refined sugar produced from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=poggi/&gt; By 1812, Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Quéruel]], working for the industrialist [[Benjamin Delessert]], devised a process of sugar extraction suitable for industrial application. By 1837, France had become the largest sugar beet producer in the world, a position it continued to hold in the world even into 2010. By 1837, 542 factories in France were producing 35,000 tonnes of sugar. However, by 1880, Germany became the largest producer of sugar from sugar beet in the world, since the German factories processed most of the sugar beets grown in eastern France.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr1&quot;/&gt;

By the 1850s, sugar beet production had reached Russia and Ukraine. This was made possible by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to beet sugar producers upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Kiple&quot;/&gt; The protection provided to the sugar beet industry by these bounties caused drastic damage to the cane sugar industry and their grip on the British sugar market. The result was a reduction in the production of cane sugar, molasses and rum until 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tasti/&gt; During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar beet producers and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production. This resulted in a shortage that revived the shrinking cane sugar industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Sugar industry of the United States}}
The first attempts at sugar beet cultivation were pursued by [[abolitionists]] in New England. The &quot;Beet Sugar Society of Philadelphia&quot; was founded in 1836 and promoted home-produced beet sugar as an alternative to the slave-produced cane sugar from the [[West Indies]] or sugar imported from Asia (called &quot;free sugar&quot; because it was grown without using slavery), but tasted &quot;awful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman 2008 95–104&quot;/&gt; This movement failed, perhaps most due to the unpopularity of abolitionists at the time, at least until the Civil War, when these associations became irrelevant and only the economic feasibility of the industry remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman 2008 95–104&quot;/&gt;

In the 1850s an attempt was made in [[Utah]] by the [[LDS Church]]-owned [[Deseret Manufacturing Company]] to grow and process sugar beets, that failed for several reasons. First, the beet seeds they imported from France were not able to produce much sugar in the heavily salinized soil of Utah. Second, the cost of importing the beet seed from France consumed any possibility for profit. Finally, none of the people running the factory knew how to properly use the chemicals to separate the sugar from the beet pulp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert M. Harveson&quot;/&gt;

The first successful sugar beet factory was built by [[E. H. Dyer]] at Alvarado, California (now [[Union City, California|Union City]]), in 1870, but was not profitable until 1879. The factory survived on subsidies, since the abolitionist stigma that had held back the development of a sugar beet industry had been erased with the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman 2008 95–104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert M. Harveson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnuson 1918 68–79&quot;/&gt;
After this first success in Alvarado, the sugar beet industry expanded rapidly. Research done by [[Rachel Lloyd (chemist)|Rachel Lloyd]] at the University of Nebraska in the late 1880s resulted in a large production increase in the state of Nebraska. In 1889, [[Arthur Stayner]] and others were able to convince LDS Church leaders to support a second attempt, leading to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrington&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |authorlink= Leonard J.

Capital investment in factories demanded an adequate supply of sugar beets. In central Colorado&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fcgov.com/historicpreservation/pdf/german-russia-doc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and western Nebraska, this was provided substantially by [[Germans from Russia]] who were already expert at sugar beet farming when they immigrated in large numbers circa 1890–1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverwedge&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Silver Wedge: The Sugar Beet Industry in Fort Collins |author=Eric Twitty |work=SWCA Environmental Consultants |date=August 2003 |access-date=9 August 2020 |url= https://www.fcgov.com/parkplanning/files/silver-wedge_the-sugar-beet-industry-in-fort-collins_a-historical-context.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=GERMANS FROM RUSSIA and the GREAT WESTERN SUGAR COMPANY |author=Carl McWilliams |work=cityofloveland.org |date=2020 |access-date=9 August 2020 |url= http://www.cityofloveland.org/home/showdocument?id=51754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, the sugar beet industry in the US matched the production of its European counterparts. The largest producers of beet sugar in the US were California, Utah, and Nebraska until the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnuson 1918 68–79&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tauss/&gt; In California were [[Japanese Americans]]; when they were interned during World War II, California's beet sugar production shifted inland to states such as Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Utah. In many of the regions where new sugar beet farms were started during the war, farmers were unfamiliar with beet sugar cultivation, so they hired Japanese workers from [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] who were familiar with sugar beet production to work on the farms.&lt;ref name=fiset/&gt;

Sugar beets are grown in 11 states and represent 55% of the US sugar production&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/history-sugarbeets | title=History of sugarbeets| date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to sugarcane, which is grown in three states plus the US territory of [[Puerto Rico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/X0513E/x0513e15.htm | title=The North American Sugar Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/17/505861855/the-final-days-of-hawaiian-sugar|title=The final days of Hawaiian sugar|publisher=US National Public Radio – Hawaii|date=2016-12-17|accessdate=2020-10-16 |first=Molly |last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for 45% of US sugar production.

===United Kingdom===
Sugar beets were not grown on a large scale in the United Kingdom until the mid-1920s, when 17 processing factories were built, following war-time shortages of imported cane sugar. Before World War I, with its far-flung empire, the United Kingdom simply imported the sugar from the cheapest market. However, World War I had created a shortage in sugar, prompting the development of domestic production. The first sugar beet processing factory was built at [[Lavenham]] in [[Suffolk]] in 1860, but failed after a few years without the government support its counterparts on the continent received. By the end of the century sugar production had ceased and the factory was re-purposed as a store house for horse hair and matting. It was totally destroyed by fire in 1905 and today, no trace remains.
The Dutch built the first successful factory at [[Cantley, Norfolk|Cantley]] in Norfolk in 1912, and it was moderately successful since, because of its Dutch backing, it received Dutch bounties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;

Sugar beet seed from France was listed in the annual catalogues of [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] from that firm's inception in 1898 until the first of their own varieties was introduced in 1909. In 1915, the British Sugar Beet Society was formed to create an example of a domestic sugar beet industry for the purpose of obtaining government financing. Twelve years later, in 1927, they succeeded. The sugar beet industry in the United Kingdom was finally subsidized providing stability to the domestic industry that had experienced volatile shifts in profits and losses in the years since 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowling 1928&quot;/&gt;

===Russia===
References to the sugar manufacturing from beets in Russia are dating back to 1802. [[Jacob Stepanovich Esipov|Jacob Esipov]] has built a first Russian commercial factory producing sugar from beets in the Tula province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slovar.wikireading.ru/2456463 &quot;slovar.wikireading&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 &quot;History of sugar production&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, some particularly impressive advancements were made in seed development, of which the most useful was the development of a frost-resistant sugar beet, further expanding the growing range of the sugar beet.&lt;ref name=buzan/&gt;

The sugar beet, like [[sugarcane]], needs a peculiar [[soil]] and a proper climate for its successful cultivation. The most important requirement is the soil must contain a large supply of nutrients, be rich in [[humus]], and be able to contain a great deal of moisture. A certain amount of [[alkali]] is not necessarily detrimental, as sugar beets are not especially susceptible to injury by some alkali. The ground should be fairly level and well-drained, especially where [[irrigation]] is practiced.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

Generous crops can be grown in both sandy soil and heavy [[loam]]s, but the ideal soil is a sandy loam, i.e., a mixture of organic matter, clay and sand. A subsoil of gravel, or the presence of hard-pan, is not desirable, as cultivation to a depth of from {{convert|12|to|15|in|cm|1}} is necessary to produce the best results.

Climatic conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall and winds have an important bearing upon the success of sugar beet agriculture. A temperature ranging from {{convert|15|to|21|°C|°F|1}} during the growing months is most favorable. In the absence of adequate irrigation, {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} of rainfall are necessary to raise an average crop. High winds are harmful, as they generally crust the land and prevent the young beets from coming through the ground. The best results are obtained along the coast of southern California, where warm, sunny days succeeded by cool, foggy nights seem to meet sugar beet's favored growth conditions. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is the most important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Near the equator, the shorter days and the greater heat of the sun sharply reduce the sugar content in the beet.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

In high elevation regions such as those of Idaho, Colorado and Utah, where the temperature is high during the daytime, but where the nights are cool, the quality of the sugar beet is excellent. In [[Michigan]], the long summer days from the relatively high latitude (the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]], where production is concentrated, lies between the 41st and 46th parallels North) and the influence of the Great Lakes result in satisfactory climatic conditions for sugar beet culture. [[Sebewaing, Michigan]] lies in [[the Thumb]] region of Michigan; both the region and state are major sugar beet producers. Sebewaing is home to one of three [[Michigan Sugar Company]] factories. The town sponsors an annual Michigan Sugar Festival.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}

To cultivate beets successfully, the land must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing is the first principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed up and out of the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar beet crops exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

[[File:Entladung Bunker.JPG|thumb|A sugar beet harvest in progress, Germany]]
In most [[temperate]] climates, beets are planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn. At the northern end of its range, growing seasons as short as 100 days can produce commercially viable sugar beet crops. In warmer climates, such as in [[California]]'s [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], sugar beets are a winter crop, planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring. In recent years, [[Syngenta]] has developed the so-called tropical sugar beet. It allows the plant to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Beets are planted from a small seed; {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of beet seed comprises 100,000 seeds and will plant over {{convert|1|ha|acre|spell=in}} of ground ({{convert|1|lb|kg|3|spell=in|disp=or}} will plant about {{convert|1|acre|ha|spell=in|disp=or}}.

Until the latter half of the 20th century, sugar beet production was highly labor-intensive, as weed control was managed by densely planting the crop, which then had to be manually thinned two or three times with a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] during the growing season. Harvesting also required many workers. Although the roots could be lifted by a [[plough]]-like device which could be pulled by a horse team, the rest of the preparation was by hand. One laborer grabbed the beets by their leaves, knocked them together to shake free loose soil, and then laid them in a row, root to one side, greens to the other. A second worker equipped with a beet hook (a short-handled tool between a [[billhook]] and a [[sickle]]) followed behind, and would lift the beet and swiftly chop the crown and leaves from the root with a single action. Working this way, he would leave a row of beets that could be forked into the back of a [[cart]].

Today, mechanical sowing, [[herbicide]] application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses a series of blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The [[Sugar beet harvester|beet harvester]] lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root in a single pass over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.

If the beets are to be left for later delivery, they are formed into [[storage clamp|clamps]]. Straw bales are used to shield the beets from the weather. Provided the clamp is well built with the right amount of ventilation, the beets do not significantly deteriorate. Beets that freeze and then defrost, produce complex carbohydrates that cause severe production problems in the factory. In the UK, loads may be hand examined at the factory gate before being accepted.

In the US, the fall harvest begins with the first hard frost, which arrests [[photosynthesis]] and the further growth of the root. Depending on the local climate, it may be carried out over the course of a few weeks or be prolonged throughout the winter months. The harvest and processing of the beet is referred to as &quot;the campaign&quot;, reflecting the organization required to deliver the crop at a steady rate to processing factories that run 24 hours a day for the duration of the harvest and processing (for the UK, the campaign lasts about five months). In the Netherlands, this period is known as ''de bietencampagne'', a time to be careful when driving on local roads in the area while the beets are being grown, because the naturally high [[clay]] content of the soil tends to cause slippery roads when soil falls from the trailers during transport.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, the cities of [[Kyiv]] and [[Sevastopol]] are part of the country constituent regions along with the autonomous republic of [[Crimea]] (ARK), and 24 other oblasts (see [[Oblasts of Ukraine]]).

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, having city status gives the city's [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] no additional inherent powers; [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] depends on a grant from the [[British monarchy|monarch]] and merely confers on the place so designated the right to call itself a city. Many cities and large urban areas are [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], meaning they have their own local government, separate from the surrounding county. (However, a number of large urban areas have a number of unitary authorities, such as [[Greater Manchester]], which mean they do not have a unified, citywide local government.) [[County borough]] referred to a [[borough]] or a city, independent of [[county council]] control in England and Wales from 1889 to 1974 with the term continuing in use in Northern Ireland. Wales re-introduced the term in 1994 for use with certain unitary authorities.

London, the capital of the United Kingdom and its [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] England, is administratively [[Greater London]], which consists of the [[City of London]] and 32 [[London boroughs]]. Greater London is not one of the [[Metropolitan county|metropolitan]] or [[Non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]], which the remainder of England is subdivided into. London has its own [[London Assembly|assembly]] and [[Mayor of London|directly elected mayor]], which exercise local government/[[Devolution|devolved powers]] greater than any other city or place in the UK, apart from the nations/provinces of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  [[Gibraltar]] is also autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Bernard A. Cook p.506, {{ISBN|0815313365}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=P7-2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT550&amp;lpg=PT550&amp;dq=gibraltar+city+state&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JpyBVZvUtp&amp;sig=YTlHvP10CQMIQ9Gv01d7lK7HLjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioxtuFssnbAhUFNxQKHb1sCGA4ChDoAQhCMAU#v=onepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], the same type of city is referred to as a [[List of Ontario census divisions#Single-tier municipalities|single-tier municipality]] (there are also [[List of Ontario separated municipalities|separated municipalities]]). In [[Quebec]], they are often called separated cities, as they are not [[Regional County Municipality|Regional County Municipalities]].  The vast majority of cities, towns, and villages in [[Alberta]] are separate from their surrounding county/municipal district.  In [[Manitoba]], all incorporated cities, towns, and villages are classified as separate urban municipalities and are fully independent from surrounding [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]]; unincorporated communities, including local urban districts, remain part of their surrounding rural municipalities. [[New Brunswick]], all county government was abolished in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0370/0370/0003/0001-e.asp|title=Environment and Local Government / Environnement et Gouvernements locaux|publisher=Gnb.ca|accessdate=30 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023538/http://www.gnb.ca/0370/0370/0003/0001-e.asp|archive-date=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in theory, all cities, townships, and settlements in New Brunswick could be considered independent cities.

=== Dominican Republic ===
In Dominican Republic the [[Distrito Nacional (Dominican Republic)|Nacional District]], containing the city of [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo de Guzman]] was created as a special district in 1922.

=== Mexico ===
[[Mexico City]], the capital of the United Mexican States (Mexico), is coterminous with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]] (''Distrito Federal''). The 31 states and the Federal District are collectively called &quot;federal entities&quot; (''entidades federativas'' in Spanish).

===United States===
{{main article|Independent city (United States)}}
There are 41 independent cities in the United States. Of these, 38 are in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hornbook of Virginia History''. &quot;[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/cities_of_virginia Cities of Virginia].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Virginia''. Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 19 Dec. 2016. Web. 20 Jul. 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are called 'independent' because they are not in the territory of any [[County (United States)|county]] or counties.  Independent cities in Virginia may, however, serve as county seats for neighboring counties.

The three independent cities outside Virginia are [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]; and [[Carson City, Nevada]].

[[New York City]] displays many features associated with independent cities but is, in fact, a ''[[sui generis]]'' municipality that is coextensive with five counties.  Counties invariably are administrative divisions of state government.  In the case of New York City, however, they are also administrative divisions of ''city'' government.  As city administrative divisions, the five counties are called [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]], retaining the label 'county' as state administrative divisions.  For three out of the five boroughs, the borough and county have different names: the borough of [[Manhattan]] is the County of New York; [[Brooklyn]] is Kings County; and [[Staten Island]] is Richmond County.  For the remaining two boroughs, [[Queens]] and [[the Bronx]], the county and borough share the same name.

Another similar entity is a [[consolidated city-county]].  An independent city is not even nominally part of any county, whereas for a consolidated city and county, the county at least nominally exists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlc.org/resource/cities-101-consolidations Cities 101 -- Consolidations], from [[National League of Cities]]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], the largest city in a county is consolidated with the county government while smaller communities continue to operate within the same county but separately from Indianapolis.  In other cases, such as The City and [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|County]] of [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]], and The City and County of [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], there is a complete consolidation of municipality and county.  San Francisco, for example, has a chief executive called &quot;Mayor&quot;, a term normally associated with city government, but the legislative body is called &quot;Board of Supervisors&quot;, which is otherwise associated with county government in California.

[[Washington, D.C.]], meanwhile, effectively functions in varying ways as an independent city, [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated city-county]], and state all in one, although it has special Constitutional status as the &quot;district constituting the seat of government of the United States,&quot; and is not part of a county or a state. In 1871, the cities of Washington and [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and the [[Washington County, D.C.|County of Washington]] were consolidated into a single local government.

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===
The [[Buenos Aires]] city was previously the [[Federal District]] of [[Argentina]]. In 1996, under the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution]], the city gained '''[[autonomous city]]''' status, and changed its formal name to '''Autonomous City of Buenos Aires''', and held its first mayoral elections. Buenos Aires is represented in the [[Argentine Senate]] by three senators and in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] by 25 national deputies.

=== Brazil ===
[[Brasília]], the capital of [[Brazil]], is set within the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. The Federal District is a special unit of the federation, as it is not organized the same manner as a municipality, does not possess the same autonomy as a state (but is ranked among them) and is closely related to the central power. The District Governor is elected directly for a 4-year term. Local laws are issued by a legislative chamber also elected by the local population. Judiciary affairs are carried out by the [[Federal government of Brazil|Union]], instead of being appointed by the governor as in the other [[states of Brazil]]. The Federal District has the status of a federal state in many aspects. It has representatives both in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house of congress) and in the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] (upper house of congress).

=== Colombia ===
In [[Colombia]] the [[Capital District (Colombia)|Capital District]], containing the city of [[Bogotá]] was created as Special District in 1955 by [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]].

=== Venezuela ===
The [[Capital District (Venezuela)|Capital District]] has the capital of [[Venezuela]], [[Caracas]].

== Oceania ==

=== Papua New Guinea ===
[[Port Moresby]], the capital of [[Papua New Guinea]], has been contained within the [[National Capital District, Papua New Guinea|National Capital District of Papua New Guinea]] since the country achieved independence in 1975.

Pronounceitright.com . Retrieved on 2012-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; born 27 October 1952) is an Italian actor, comedian, screenwriter and director. He gained international recognition for writing, directing and starring in the holocaust comedy-drama film ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (1997), for which he received the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (the first for a non-English male performance) and [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]].

Benigni made his acting debut in 1977's ''[[Berlinguer, I Love You]]'', which he also wrote, and was directed by [[Giuseppe Bertolucci]]. Benigni's directorial debut was the 1983 [[anthology film]] ''[[Tu mi turbi]]'', which was also the acting debut of his wife, [[Nicoletta Braschi]]. In 1986, Benigni made his first English-language film, ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'', written and directed by [[Jim Jarmusch]], with whom Benigni would make two more films: ''[[Night on Earth]]'' (1991) and ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' (2003).

In 1988, Benigni was acclaimed for the film ''[[The Little Devil]]'', which he directed, wrote and starred in. Costarring American actor [[Walter Matthau]] and Braschi, the film was shot in alternating takes in both Italian and English. Benigni continued to have success and acclaim as a director with ''[[Johnny Stecchino]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Monster (1994 film)|The Monster]]'', and portrayed [[Inspector Clouseau]]'s son in ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'' (1993), an American-Italian co-production filmed in English, directed by [[Blake Edwards]].

His subsequent directorial efforts, ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (2002), in which he played the [[Pinocchio|title character]], and ''[[The Tiger and the Snow]]'' (2005), received mixed reviews.

While he has not directed another film since 2005, Benigni has continued to act on stage and film, touring Italy with his one-man show ''TuttoDante'', and starred in the films ''[[To Rome with Love (film)|To Rome with Love]]'' (2012), directed by [[Woody Allen]], and as [[Mister Geppetto]] in [[Matteo Garrone]]'s 2019 adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (2019 film)|Pinocchio]]''.

==Early life==
Benigni was born in [[Manciano La Misericordia]] (a ''[[frazione]]'' of [[Castiglion Fiorentino]]), the son of Isolina Papini (1919–2004), a fabric maker, and Luigi Benigni (1919–2004), a bricklayer, carpenter, and farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/3/Roberto-Benigni.html Roberto Benigni Biography (1952–)]. Filmreference.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; He has three sisters: Bruna (born 1945), Albertina (born 1947) and Anna (born 1948). He was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and served as an [[Altar server|altar boy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104101101/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22134181.html When Tragedy, Comedy Meet: Italian actor-director Roberto Benigni].

During that autumn he moved to Rome where he took part in some experimental theatre shows, some of which he also directed. In 1975, Benigni had his first theatrical success with ''Cioni Mario di Gaspare fu Giulia'', written by [[Giuseppe Bertolucci]].

Benigni became widely known in Italy in the 1970s for a television series called ''Onda Libera'', on RAI2, produced by [[Renzo Arbore]], in which he interpreted the satirical piece ''The Hymn of the Body Purged'' (''L'inno del corpo sciolto'', a [[scatology|scatological]] song about the joys of [[defecation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Celli |first=Carlo |title=The Divine Comic: The Cinema of Roberto Benigni |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2001 |page=[https://archive.org/details/divinecomiccinem00cell/page/9 9] |isbn=978-0-8108-4000-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/divinecomiccinem00cell/page/9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A great scandal for the time, the series was suspended due to [[censorship]]. His first film was 1977's ''[[Berlinguer, I Love You]]'' (''Berlinguer ti voglio bene''), also by Bertolucci.

His popularity increased with ''[[L'altra domenica]]'' (1976/9), another TV show of Arbore's in which Benigni portrayed a lazy film critic who never watches the films he's asked to review. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] then cast him in a small speechless role as a window upholsterer in the film ''[[La Luna (1979 film)|La Luna]]'' which had limited American distribution due to its subject matter.

==Career==
In 1980 he met [[Cesena]]te actress [[Nicoletta Braschi]], who became his wife on 26 December 1991 and who has starred in most of the films he has directed.

In June 1983 he appeared during a public political demonstration by the [[Italian Communist Party]], with which he was a sympathiser, and on this occasion he lifted and cradled the party's national leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]]. It was an unprecedented act, given that until that moment Italian politicians were proverbially serious and formal. Benigni was censored again in the 1980s for calling [[Pope John Paul II]] something impolite during an important live TV show (&quot;Wojtylaccio&quot;, meaning &quot;Bad Wojtyla&quot; in Italian, but with a somewhat friendly meaning in Tuscan dialect).

Benigni's first film as director was ''[[Tu mi turbi]]'' (''You Upset Me'') in [[1983 in film|1983]]. This film was also his first collaboration with Braschi.

In 1984, he played in ''[[Nothing Left to Do But Cry|Non ci resta che piangere]]'' (&quot;Nothing Left to Do but Cry&quot;) with comic actor [[Massimo Troisi]]. The story was a fable in which the protagonists are suddenly thrown back in time to the 15th century, just a little before 1492. They start looking for [[Christopher Columbus]] in order to stop him from discovering the Americas (for very personal reasons), but are not able to reach him.

===Benigni in the United States and his collaboration with Cerami===
[[File:Benigni3.jpg|thumb|Benigni with [[Giorgio Gaber]] in 1990.]]

Beginning in 1986, Benigni starred in three films by American director [[Jim Jarmusch]]. In ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down By Law]]'' ([[1986 in film|1986]]) (which in Italy had its title spelled &quot;Daunbailò&quot;, in Italian phonetics) he played Bob, an innocent foreigner living in the United States, convicted of manslaughter, whose irrepressible good humour and optimism help him to escape and find love. (The film also starred Braschi as his beloved.) In ''[[Night on Earth]]'', ([[1991 in film|1991]]) he played a cabbie in Rome, who causes his passenger, a priest, great discomfort and a heart attack by confessing his bizarre sexual experiences. Later, he also starred in the first of Jarmusch's series of short films, ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' (2003).

In 1990, he was a member of the Jury at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlinale&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/04_jury_1990/04_Jury_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Juries |accessdate=2011-03-14 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he starred in ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'', directed by veteran [[Blake Edwards]]. Benigni played [[Peter Sellers]]' Inspector Clouseau's illegitimate son who is assigned to save the Princess of Lugash. The film bombed in the US, but was a hit in his homeland.

Benigni had a rare serious role in [[Federico Fellini]]'s last film, ''[[The Voice of the Moon|La voce della luna]]'' (&quot;The Voice of the Moon&quot;) (1989). In earlier years Benigni had started a long-lasting collaboration with screenwriter [[Vincenzo Cerami]], for a series of films which scored great success in Italy: ''[[The Little Devil|Il piccolo diavolo]]'' (&quot;The Little Devil&quot;) with [[Walter Matthau]], ''[[Johnny Stecchino]]'' (&quot;Johnny Toothpick&quot;), and ''[[The Monster (1994 film)|Il mostro]]'' (&quot;The Monster&quot;).

===''Life Is Beautiful''===
[[File:Roberto Benigni Nicoletta Braschi.jpg|thumb|upright|Benigni and wife [[Nicoletta Braschi]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Benigni is widely known outside Italy for his [[1997 in film|1997]] [[tragicomedy]] ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' (''La vita è bella''), filmed in [[Arezzo]], also written by Cerami. The film is about an Italian Jewish man who tries to protect his son's innocence during his internment at a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]], by telling him that [[the Holocaust]] is an elaborate game and he must adhere very carefully to the rules to win. Benigni's father had spent three years in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;brinson&quot;&gt;Claudia Smith Brinson. &quot;Live your life with exuberance, and happiness may come&quot; (editorial), ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' (Columbia, South Carolina), March 23, 1999, page A10.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La vita è bella'' is based in part on his father's experiences. Benigni was also inspired by the story of Holocaust survivor [[Rubino Romeo Salmonì]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Squires, &quot;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91],&quot; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 July 2011, URL accessed 11 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the story and presentation of the film had been discussed during production with different Jewish groups to limit the offense it might cause, the film was attacked by some critics who accused it of presenting the Holocaust without much suffering, and some who considered that &quot;laughing at everything&quot; was not appropriate. More favourable critics praised Benigni's artistic daring and skill to create a sensitive comedy involving the tragedy, a challenge that [[Charlie Chaplin]] confessed he would not have done with ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' had he been aware of the horrors of the Holocaust.

In 1998, the film was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]]. At the [[71st Academy Awards|1999 ceremony]], the film was awarded the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] (which Benigni accepted as the film's director), [[Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring)#1990s|Best Original Dramatic Score]] (the score by [[Nicola Piovani]]), and Benigni received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (the first for a male performer in a non-English-speaking role, and only the third overall acting Oscar for non-English-speaking roles).

Famously, giddy with delight after ''Life Is Beautiful'' was announced as the Best Foreign Language Film, Benigni climbed over and then stood on the backs of the seats in front of him and applauded the audience before proceeding to the stage.  After winning his Best Actor Oscar later in the evening, he said in his acceptance speech, &quot;This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English!&quot;  To close his speech, Benigni quoted the closing lines of Dante's ''Divine Comedy'', referencing &quot;the love that moves the sun and all the stars.&quot; At the [[72nd Academy Awards|following year's ceremony]], when he read the nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (won by [[Hilary Swank]] for ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''), host [[Billy Crystal]] playfully appeared behind him with a large net to restrain Benigni if he got excessive with his antics again.  On a 1999 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', host [[Ray Romano]] played him in a sketch parodying his giddy behavior at the ceremony.

===Beyond ''Life Is Beautiful''===
[[File:Benigni.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Benigni receiving a prize in [[Terni]], February 2006]]
Benigni played one of the main characters in ''[[Asterix &amp; Obelix Take On Caesar|Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar]]'' as Detritus, a corrupt Roman provincial governor who wants to kill Julius Caesar, thereby seizing control of the [[Roman Republic]].

As a director, his [[2002 in film|2002]] film ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]],'' the most expensive film in Italian cinema, performed well in Italy, but it bombed in North America, with a 0% critics' score at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. He was also named as the [[2002 Golden Raspberry Awards#Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for his role as [[Pinocchio]], in the 23rd [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]. The original Italian version received six nominations at the [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]], winning two, as well as winning one of the two awards it was nominated for at the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255477/awards|title=Pinocchio|date=25 December 2002|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, he gave a typically energetic and revealing interview to Canadian filmmaker [[Damian Pettigrew]] for ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2002), a cinematic portrait of the maestro that was nominated for Best Documentary at the [[European Film Awards]], Europe's equivalent of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. The film went on to win the prestigious Rockie Award for Best Arts Documentary at the [[Banff World Media Festival|Banff World Television Festival]] (2002) and the ''Coup de Coeur'' at the International Sunnyside of the Doc Marseille (2002).

In 2003, Benigni was honored by the [[National Italian American Foundation]] (NIAF), receiving the Foundation's NIAF Special Achievement Award in Entertainment.

His film ''La tigre e la neve'' (''[[The Tiger and the Snow]],'' 2005) is a love story set during the initial stage of the [[Iraq War]].

[[File:Roberto Benigni-5765.jpg|thumb|Benigni at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] 2020]]

On 15 October 2005, he performed an impromptu [[strip tease]] on Italy's most watched evening news program, removing his shirt and draping it over the newscaster's shoulders. Prior to removing his shirt, Benigni had already hijacked the opening credits of the news program, jumping behind the newscaster and announcing: &quot;Berlusconi has resigned!&quot; (Benigni is an outspoken critic of media tycoon and then former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]].) The previous day, he had led a crowd of thousands in Rome on Friday in protest at the center-right government's decision to cut state arts funding by 35 percent.

On 2 February 2007, he was awarded the degree of [[Honorary Degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]] by the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Belgium. On 22 April 2008, the degree of [[Honorary Degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]] was conferred on him by the [[University of Malta]], celebrated by a ''Settimana Dantesca'' including Benigni's first stage appearance at a university and the premiere of his performing with Dante scholar Robert Hollander.

In 2012, he starred in the [[Woody Allen]] film, ''[[To Rome with Love (film)|To Rome with Love]]''.

Much of the Grand Canal south of the Yellow River was ruined for several years after 1128 when Du Chong decided to break the dykes and dams holding back the waters of the Yellow River in order to decimate the oncoming [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] invaders during the [[Jin–Song Wars|Jin–Song wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] continually battled with the Song in the region between the Huai River and the Yellow River; this warfare led to the dilapidation of the canal until the [[Mongols]] invaded in the 13th century AD and began necessary repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 311&quot;/&gt;

During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) the capital of China was moved to Beijing, eliminating the need for the canal arm flowing west to Kaifeng or Luoyang.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 227&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; A summit section was dug across the foothills of the Shandong massif during the 1280s, shortening the overall length by as much as {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} (making the total length about {{convert|1800|km|abbr=on}}) and linking Hangzhou and Beijing with a direct north-south waterway for the first time. As in the Song and Jin era, the canal fell into disuse and dilapidation during the Yuan dynasty's decline.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ming dynasty restoration===
[[Image:Yongle-Emperor1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The [[Yongle Emperor]] (r. 1402–1424) restored the Grand Canal in the Ming era.]]
The Grand Canal was renovated almost in its entirety between 1411 and 1415 during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). A magistrate of [[Jining, Shandong]] sent a memorandum to the throne of the [[Yongle Emperor]] protesting the current inefficient means of transporting 4,000,000 ''dan'' (428,000,000 [[liter]]s) of grain a year by means of transferring it along several different rivers and canals in barge types that went from deep to shallow after the [[Huai River]], and then transferred back onto deep barges once the shipment of grain reached the [[Yellow River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 46 47&quot;&gt;Brook, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese engineers built a [[dam]] to divert the [[Wen River]] to the southwest in order to feed 60% of its water north into the Grand Canal, with the remainder going south.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 47&quot;&gt;Brook, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; They dug four large [[reservoir]]s in [[Shandong]] to regulate water levels, which allowed them to avoid pumping water from local sources and water tables.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 47&quot;/&gt; Between 1411 and 1415 a total of 165,000 laborers dredged the canal bed in Shandong and built new channels, embankments, and [[canal lock]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 47&quot;/&gt;

The Yongle Emperor moved the Ming capital from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing in 1403{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This move deprived Nanjing of its status as chief political center of China. The reopening of the Grand Canal also benefited [[Suzhou]] over Nanjing since the former was in a better position on the main artery of the Grand Canal, and so it became Ming China's greatest economic center.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 74 75&quot;&gt;Brook, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The only other viable contender with Suzhou in the [[Jiangnan]] region was Hangzhou, but it was located {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} further down the Grand Canal and away from the main delta.&lt;ref name = &quot;brook 75&quot;/&gt; Even the shipwrecked Korean [[Choe Bu]] (1454–1504)—while traveling for five months throughout China in 1488—acknowledged that Hangzhou served not as a competitor but as an economic feeder into the greater Suzhou market.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 75&quot;&gt;Brook, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Grand Canal served to make or break the economic fortunes of certain cities along its route and served as the economic lifeline of indigenous trade within China.

The scholar [[Gu Yanwu]] of the early [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) estimated that the previous Ming dynasty had to employ 47,004 full-time laborers recruited by the ''lijia'' [[corvée]] system in order to maintain the entire canal system.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 48&quot;&gt;Brook, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that 121,500 soldiers and officers were needed simply to operate the 11,775 government grain barges in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 48&quot;/&gt;

Besides its function as a grain shipment route and major vein of river-borne indigenous trade in China, the Grand Canal had long been a government-operated [[courier]] route as well. In the Ming dynasty, official courier stations were placed at intervals of {{convert|35|to|45|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 48&quot;/&gt; Each courier station was assigned a different name, all of which were popularized in travel songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing dynasty and modern China===
The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] invaded China in the mid-17th century, allowed through the northern passes by the Chinese general [[Wu Sangui]] once the Ming capital at Beijing had fallen into the hands of a rebel army. The Manchus established the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912), and under their leadership, the Grand Canal was overseen and maintained just as in earlier times.

In 1855, the Yellow River flooded and changed its course, severing the course of the canal in Shandong. This was foreseen by a Chinese official in 1447, who remarked that the flood-prone Yellow River made the Grand Canal like a throat that could be easily strangled (leading some officials to request restarting the grain shipments through the [[East China Sea]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;brook 47&quot;/&gt; In 1855 the dikes of the canal were opened to flood advancing troops of the [[Taiping Rebellion]]'s [[Northern Expedition (Taiping Rebellion)|Northern Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Maochun |last=Yu|title=The Taiping Rebellion: A Military Assessment of Revolution and Counterrevolution, printed in A Military History of China|publisher= David A. Graff &amp; Robin Higham eds.|page=138|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of various factors—the difficulty of crossing the Yellow River, the increased development of an alternative sea route for grain-ships, and the opening of the [[Tianjin-Pukou Railway]] and the [[Jingguang Railway|Beijing-Hankou Railway]]—the canal languished and for decades the northern and southern parts remained separate. Many of the canal sections fell into disrepair, and some parts were returned to flat fields. Even today, the Grand Canal has not fully recovered from this disaster. After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the need for economic development led the authorities to order heavy reconstruction work.

By the 1990s, pollution in the canal had reached the point where boat and barge crews could tell when they were nearing Hangzhou by the stench of the visibly black water. A $250 million restoration project begun in 2001 has improved water quality to the point where it no longer smells and is once again capable of supporting some fauna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/world/asia/24canal.html On an Ancient Canal, Grunge Gives Way to Grandeur]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic importance of the canal likely will continue. The governments of the Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Provinces planned dredging meant to increase shipping capacity by 40 percent by 2012.

On June 22, 2014, The Grand Canal was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]], at the 2014 [[World Heritage Committee|Conference on World Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/jsbd/2014-06/22/c_1111256629.htm  中国大运河获准列入世界遗产名录] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064005/http://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/jsbd/2014-06/22/c_1111256629.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical sections===
As well as its present-day course, fourteen centuries of canal-building have left the Grand Canal with a number of historical sections. Some of these have disappeared, others are still partially extant, and others form the basis for the modern canal. The following are the most important but do not form an exhaustive list.

====Jia Canal====
In 12 BC, in order to solve the problem of the Grand Canal having to use {{convert|160|km|mi||round=5|sp=us}} of the perilous course of the Yellow River in Northern Jiangsu, a man named Li Hualong created the Jia Canal. Named after the Jia River whose course it followed, it ran {{convert|140|km|mi|sp=us}} from Xiazhen (modern Weishan) on the shore of Shandong's [[Weishan Lake]] to Suqian in Jiangsu. The construction of the Jia Canal left only {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} of Yellow River navigation on the Grand Canal, from Suqian to Huai'an, which by 1688 had been removed by the construction of the Middle Canal by Jin Fu.

====Nanyang New Canal====
In 1566, to escape the problems caused by flooding of the Yellow River around Yutai (now on the western shore of Weishan Lake), the Nanyang New Canal was opened. It ran for {{convert|75|km|mi|sp=us}} from Nanyang (now Nanyang Town, located in the center of Weishan Lake) to the small settlement of Liucheng (in the vicinity of modern Gaolou Village, Weishan County, Shandong) north of Xuzhou City. This change in effect moved the Grand Canal from the low-lying and flood-prone land west of Weishan Lake onto the marginally higher land to its east. It was fed by rivers flowing from east to west from the borders of the Shandong massif.

====Huitong Canal====
North of the Jizhou Canal summit section, the Huitong Canal ran downhill, fed principally by the River Wen, to join the Wei River in the city of Linqing. In 1289, a geological survey preceded its one-year construction. The Huitong Canal, built by an engineer called Ma Zhizhen, ran across sharply sloping ground and the high concentration of locks gave it the nicknames ''chahe'' or ''zhahe'', i.e. 'the river of locks'. Its great number of feeder springs (between two and four hundred, depending on the counting method and season of the year) also led to it being called the ''quanhe'' or 'river of springs'.

====Jizhou Canal====
This, the Grand Canal's first true summit section, was engineered by the Mongol Oqruqči in 1238 to connect Jining to the southern end of the Huitong Canal. It rose to a height of 42 meters (138&amp;nbsp;ft) above the Yangtze, but environmental and technical factors left it with chronic water shortages until it was re-engineered in 1411 by Song Li of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. Song Li's improvements, recommended by a local man named Bai Ying, included damming the rivers Wen and Guang and drawing lateral canals from them to feed [[Nanwang water division system|reservoir lakes at the very summit, at a small town called Nanwang]].

====Duke Huan's Conduit====
In 369 AD, General [[Huan Wen]] of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty]] connected the shallow river valleys of the Huai and the Yellow. He achieved this by joining two of these rivers' tributaries, the Si and the Ji respectively, at their closest point, across a low watershed of the Shandong massif. Huan Wen's primitive summit canal became a model for the engineers of the Jizhou Canal.

====Yilou Canal====
The Shanyang Canal originally opened onto the Yangtze a short distance south of [[Yangzhou]]. As the north shore of the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realized that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would reduce the journey time and thus make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.

==Modern course==
The Grand Canal nominally runs between Beijing and Hangzhou over a total length of {{convert|1,794|km|mi|abbr=on}}, however, only the section from [[Hangzhou]] to [[Jining, Shandong|Jining]] is currently navigable. Its course is today divided into seven sections. From south to north these are the Jiangnan Canal, the Inner Canal, the Middle Canal, the Lu Canal, the South Canal, the North Canal, and the Tonghui River.

===Jiangnan Canal===
[[Image:Gcjiangnan1.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The Jiangnan Canal]]
This southernmost section of the canal runs from Hangzhou in Zhejiang, where the canal connects with the Qiantang River, to [[Zhenjiang]] in Jiangsu, where it meets the Yangtze. After leaving Hangzhou the canal passes around the eastern border of [[Lake Tai]], through the major cities of [[Jiaxing]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], and [[Changzhou]] before reaching [[Zhenjiang]]. 
[[File:Grand Canal, tour boats, Suzhou, China.jpg|thumb|Grand Canal tour boats, Suzhou]]
The Jiangnan (or ‘South of the Yangtze’) Canal is heavily utilized by barge traffic bringing coal and construction materials to the booming delta. It is generally a minimum of 100 meters wide in the congested city centers, and often two or three times this width in the neighboring countryside. In recent years, broad bypass canals have been dug around the major cities to reduce ‘traffic jams’.

The [[Suzhou]] section of the Jiangnan Canal flows through the western part of the city. It includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved as well as temples and pavilions.

===Inner Canal===
This ‘Inner Canal’ runs between the Yangtze and [[Huai'an]] in Jiangsu, skirting the [[Shaobo]], [[Lake Gaoyou]], and [[Lake Hongze|Hongze]] lakes of central Jiangsu. Here the land lying to the west of the canal is higher than its bed while the land to the east is lower. Traditionally the Shanghe region west of the canal has been prone to frequent flooding, while the Xiahe region to its east has been hit by less frequent but immensely damaging inundations caused by the failure of the Grand Canal levees. Recent works have allowed floodwaters from Shanghe to be diverted safely out to sea.

===Middle Canal===
[[Image:Gcjining.JPG|right|upright|thumb|The canal in Jining City]]
This ‘Middle Canal’ section runs from Huai'an to [[Weishan Lake]], passing through [[Luoma Lake]] and following more than one course, the result of the impact of centuries of Yellow River flooding. After [[Pizhou]], a northerly course passes through [[Tai'erzhuang]] to enter Weishan Lake at Hanzhuang bound for [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] and Jining (this course is the remnant of the New Nanyang Canal of 1566 – see below). A southerly course passes close by [[Xuzhou]] and enters Weishan Lake near [[Peixian]]. This latter course is less used today.

===Lu Canal===
At Weishan Lake, both courses enter Shandong province. From here to [[Linqing]], the canal is called the Lu or ‘Shandong’ Canal. It crosses a series of lakes—Zhaoyang, Dushan, and Nanyang—which nominally form a continuous body of water. At present, diversions of water mean that the lakes are often largely dry land. North of the northernmost Nanyang Lake is the city of [[Jining, Shandong|Jining]]. Further on, about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} north of Jining, the highest elevation of the canal ({{convert|38.5|m|disp=or|abbr=on}} above sea level) is reached at the town of [[Nanwang]]. In the 1950s a new canal was dug to the south of the old summit section. The old summit section is now dry, while the new canal holds too little water to be navigable. About {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} further north, passing close by [[Dongping Lake]], the canal reaches the Yellow River. By this point waterless, it no longer connects to the river. It reappears again in [[Liaocheng]] City on the north bank where, intermittently flowing through a renovated stone channel, it reaches the city of Linqing on the [[Shandong]] – [[Hebei]] border.

===Southern Canal===
[[Image:Gcnanyunhe.JPG|right|thumb|The junction of the Lu Canal and South Canal]]
The fifth section of the canal extends for a distance of {{convert|524|km|sp=us}} from [[Linqing]] to [[Tianjin]] along the course of the canalized [[Wei River (Shandong)|Wei River]]. Though one of the northernmost sections, its name derives from its position relative to Tianjin. The Wei River at this point is [[water pollution in China|heavily polluted]] while drought and industrial water extraction have left it too low to be navigable. The canal, now in Hebei province, passes through the cities of [[Dezhou]] and [[Cangzhou]]. Although to spectators, the canal appears to be a deep waterway in these city centers, its depth is maintained by [[weirs]] and the canal is all but dry where it passes through the surrounding countryside. At its terminus, the canal joins the Hai River in the center of Tianjin City before turning north-west.

===Northern Canal and Tonghui River===
In Tianjin, the canal heads northwest, for a short time following the course of the Yongding, a tributary of the [[Hai River]], before branching off toward [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou]] on the edge of the municipality of Beijing. It is here that the modern canal stops and that a [[Grand Canal Cultural Park]] has been built. During the Yuan dynasty, a further canal on the [[Tonghui River]] connected Tongzhou with a wharf called the [[Houhai]] or &quot;rear sea&quot; in central Beijing. In the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, however, the water level in the Tonghui River dropped and ships could not travel from Tongzhou to Beijing. Tongzhou then became the northern shipping terminus of the canal. Cargo was unloaded at Tongzhou and transported to Beijing by land. The Tonghui river still exists as a wide, concrete-lined storm-channel and drain for the suburbs of Beijing.

===Eastern Zhejiang Canal===
{{Main|Eastern Zhejiang Canal}}The Eastern Zhejiang Canal ({{zh|s=浙东运河; |t=浙東運河; |p=zhèdōng yùnhé}}), also known as the Hangzhou&amp;ndash;Ningbo Canal ({{zh|labels=no |s=杭甬运河}}) is located in Zhejiang. Its west end is in Xixing Street, Binjiang District, Hangzhou City, crossing Cao'e River and Shaoxing City to its east end, the Yong River estuary in Ningbo City. The canal is 239 kilometers (149&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Early canal construction took place in the Shanyin old canal in Shaoxing City, in the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC). In the third century AD, an official named He Xun supervised the construction of the Xixing Canal, establishing the complete Eastern Zhejiang Canal.

In the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279), the capital was established at Linan, which meant that the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became an important shipping channel. From the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) to the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the Eastern Zhejiang Canal lost its privilege but remained navigable. In recent years, because of newer modes of transportation, the canal has been gradually replaced. The reconstruction of the canal began in 2002, by 2007 it was partially navigable, and the renovation project finished in 2009, though the Ningbo section was not navigable until the end of 2013.

In May 2013, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was listed in the seventh group of Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level and was included in the Grand Canal. In November 2008, as an extension of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and the passage between the Grand Canal and the Maritime Silk Road, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was placed into the nomination file in the UNESCO World Heritage program. In 2014, with Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and Sui &amp; Tang Grand Canal, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became one World Heritage site.

==Elevations==
Though the canal nominally crosses the watersheds of five river systems, in reality, the variation between these is so low that it has only a single summit section. The elevation of the canal bed varies from 1 m below sea level at Hangzhou to 38.5 m above at its summit. At Beijing, it reaches 27 m, fed by streams flowing downhill from the mountains to the west. The water flows from Beijing toward Tianjin, from Nanwang north toward Tianjin, and from Nanwang south toward Yangzhou. The water level in the Jiangnan Canal remains scarcely above sea level (the Zhenjiang ridge is 12 meters higher than that of the Yangtze River).

==Uses==

=== Transportation ===

[[File:Pekin hutong i fragment Wielkiego Kanalu Chinskiego 05.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Grand Canal at its northern terminus at Houhai in Beijing.]]

From the Tang to Qing dynasties, the Grand Canal served as the main artery between northern and southern China and was essential for the transport of grain to Beijing. Although it was mainly used for shipping grain, it also transported other commodities and the corridor along the canal developed into an important economic belt. Records show that, at its height, every year more than 8,000 boats&lt;ref&gt;''China at War: An Encyclopedia'' {{ISBN|978-1-598-84415-3}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; transported four to six million [[Chinese units of measurement#Mass|dan]] (240,000–360,000 metric tons) of grain. The convenience of transport also enabled rulers to lead inspection tours to southern China. In the Qing dynasty, the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] and [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] emperors made twelve trips to the south, on all occasions but one reaching Hangzhou.

The Grand Canal also enabled cultural exchange and political integration to occur between the north and south of China. The canal even made a distinct impression on some of China's early European visitors. [[Marco Polo]] recounted the Grand Canal's arched bridges as well as the warehouses and prosperous trade of its cities in the 13th century. The famous Roman Catholic missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] traveled from Nanjing to Beijing along the canal at the end of the 16th century.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the canal has been used primarily to transport vast amounts of bulk goods such as bricks, gravel, sand, diesel, and coal. The Jianbi ship locks on the Yangtze are currently handling some 75,000,000 tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} each year, and the Li Canal is forecast to reach 100,000,000 tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} in the next few years.

Currently, ships can only travel up to [[Jining]]. The section from Jining to Beijing is not available for transport due to the silt deposit buildup from the Yellow River and lack of water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=京杭运河 |url=http://www.mwr.gov.cn/szs/slgc/zmfhgc/201612/t20161229_783406.html |website=Ministry of Water Sources |accessdate=5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans for restoring transportation up to [[Tai'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=京杭运河山东泰安段预计2019年初全面复航 |url=http://sd.people.com.cn/n2/2017/1104/c166192-30887187.html |accessdate=5 March 2019 |agency=Dazhong Ribao |publisher=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South-North Water Transfer Project===
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=March 2012}}
[[Image:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-boats-3353.JPG|thumb|Barges on the modern Grand Canal (&quot;Li Canal&quot; section) near Yangzhou]]
The Grand Canal is currently being upgraded to serve as the Eastern Route of the [[South-North Water Transfer Project]]. Additional amounts of water from the Yangtze will be drawn into the canal in [[Jiangdu]] City, where a giant {{convert|400|m3/s|abbr=on}} pumping station was already built in the 1980s, and is then fed uphill by pumping stations along the route and through a tunnel under the Yellow River, from where it can flow downhill to reservoirs near Tianjin. Construction on the Eastern Route officially began on December 27, 2002, and water was supposed to reach Tianjin by 2012. However, water pollution has affected the viability of this project.

==Notable travelers==
In 1169, with China divided between the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in the north and the [[Southern Song]] dynasty in the south, the Southern Song Emperor [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song|Xiaozong]] sent a delegation to the Jurchen to wish their ruler well for the New Year. A scholar-official named Lou Yue, secretary to the delegation, recorded the journey, much of which was made upon the Grand Canal, and submitted his ''Diary of a Journey to the North'' to the emperor on his return.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Brown, Liam, ''The Emperor's River: Travels to the Heart of a Resurgent China'' Eye Books, February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1170 the poet, politician, and historian [[Lu You]] traveled along the Grand Canal from [[Shaoxing]] to the river [[Yangtze]], recording his progress in a diary.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Philip, ''Grand Canal, Great River'' (Frances Lincoln, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1200s, [[Marco Polo]] traveled extensively through China and his trips included time on the Grand Canal, then a major artery for shipping silk, porcelain, and wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/4sub8/entry-5456.html|title=Marco Polo's Descriptions of China|publisher=Facts and Details|author=Jeffrey Hayes|date=8 August 2013|accessdate=7 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1345 Arab traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] traveled China and journeyed through the Abe Hayat river (Grand Canal) up to the capital Khanbalik (Beijing).

In 1488, the shipwrecked Korean scholar [[Choe Bu]] traveled the entire length of the Grand Canal on his way from [[Zhejiang]] to Beijing (and on to Korea) and left a detailed account of his trip.

In 1600, [[Matteo Ricci]] traveled to Beijing from Nanjing via the Grand Canal waterway to gain the support of the [[Wanli Emperor]] of the Ming dynasty with the help of Wang Zhongde, the Director of the Board of Rites in the central government of China at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mildchina.com/hangzhou-attractions/beijing-hangzhou-grand-canal.html The missionaries traveled along The Grand Canal – MildChina.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, after a largely fruitless diplomatic mission to [[Chengde|Jehol]], a large part of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]]'s embassy returned south to the Yangtze delta via the Grand Canal.&lt;ref&gt;Peyrefitte, Alan, ''The Collision of Two Civilisations'' (Harvill, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848  [[Robert Fortune]] reached Hang Chow Foo by the Grand Canal in his quest for tea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coles |first1=Peter |title=Mulberry |date=15 October 2019 |isbn=9781789141740 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhS5DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=robert+fortune+grand+canal&amp;pg=PT91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-great-british-tea-heist-9866709/ |website=The Great British Tea Heist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

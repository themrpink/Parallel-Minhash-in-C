====History====
Until 1964, only three restaurants in the county had liquor licenses to serve liquor by the drink.&lt;ref name=&quot;search.proquest.com&quot;&gt;Kendrick, Thomas R. &quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/142097239/ New Montgomery Liquor Permits Start 6 Restaurants Serving Drinks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510081500/http://search.proquest.com/docview/142097239/ |date=May 10, 2017 }}&quot;. ''The Washington Post''. December 8, 1964. p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The county stopped issuing liquor licenses to all other restaurants under a law that had existed since [[prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref name= liquor&gt;Barnes, Bart. &quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/142126338/ County's Liquor Laws Liberalized] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510081456/http://search.proquest.com/docview/142126338/ |date=May 10, 2017 }}&quot;. ''The Washington Post''. November 8, 1964. p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a voter referendum,&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick, Thomas R. &quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/142103587/ D.C., Maryland Party Aides Ponder Vote Results: Liquor Question in Montgomery Depends on Absentee Ballots] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510081504/http://search.proquest.com/docview/142103587/ |date=May 10, 2017 }}&quot;. ''The Washington Post''. November 5, 1964. p.

Anchor Inn in [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]] was the first establishment to serve liquor in the county under the new law.&lt;ref name=&quot;search.proquest.com&quot;/&gt;

===Federal representation===

Poor transportation was a hindrance for Montgomery County's farmers who wanted to transport their crops to market in the early 18th century. Montgomery County's first roads, often barely adequate, were built by the 18th century.

[[Maryland Route 355|One early road]] connected [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] and [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]]. There was [[Maryland Route 190|a road]] that connected Georgetown and the [[Monocacy Aqueduct|mouth]] of the [[Monocacy River]]. Plans to continue the road to [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] did not come to fruition. Another road connected the Montgomery County Courthouse with [[Sandy Spring, Maryland|Sandy Spring]] and [[Baltimore]], and one other road connected the courthouse with [[Bladensburg, Maryland|Bladensburg]] and [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;centuries&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–83}}

The county's first turnpike was chartered in 1806, but its construction began in 1817. In 1828, the turnpike was completed, running from Georgetown to [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]]. It was the first paved road in Montgomery County.&lt;ref name= centuries/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–83}}

In 1849, the Seventh Street Turnpike (now called [[Maryland Route 97|Georgia Avenue]]) was extended from Washington to [[Brookeville, Maryland|Brookeville]]. The Colesville–Ashton Turnpike was built in 1870 (now parts of [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|Colesville Road, Columbia Pike]], and [[Maryland Route 650|New Hampshire Avenue]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–83}}

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] built the [[Washington Aqueduct]] between 1853 and 1864, to supply water from [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]] to Washington. The aqueduct was covered in 1875, and it became known as Conduit Road. The [[Union Arch Bridge]], which carries the aqueduct across [[Cabin John Creek]], was the longest single-arch bridge in the world at the time it was completed in 1864. The road is now named [[MacArthur Boulevard (Washington, D.C.)|MacArthur Boulevard]].&lt;ref name=centuries/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THS Boyd&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–83}}

The county began building a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system along [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] in 2018. The system will provide service between [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] and [[Burtonsville, Maryland|Burtonsville]] and is scheduled to begin operation in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/transit/county-officials-break-ground-on-14-mile-bus-rapid-transit-line/ |title=County Officials Break Ground on 14-Mile Bus Rapid Transit Line |last=Schere |first=Dan |date=2018-10-25 |website=Bethesda Beat |publisher=Bethesda Magazine |access-date=October 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027143119/https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/transit/county-officials-break-ground-on-14-mile-bus-rapid-transit-line/ |archive-date=October 27, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/brt/us29project.html |title=US 29 Project |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-04-02 |website=Bus Rapid Transit Project |publisher=MCDOT |access-date=October 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027143022/https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/brt/us29project.html |archive-date=October 27, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corridor Cities Transitway]] is a proposed BRT line that would provide an extension of the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] corridor from [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]] to [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]], and eventually to Frederick County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cctmaryland.com |title=Corridor Cities Transitway |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Maryland Transit Administration |location=Baltimore, MD |access-date=2018-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227012707/http://cctmaryland.com/ |archive-date=December 27, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
Montgomery County is served by three passenger rail systems, with a fourth line under construction.

[[Amtrak]], the U.S. national passenger rail system, operates its ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak)|Capitol Limited]]'' to Rockville, between [[Union Station (Washington, DC)|Washington Union Station]] and [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago Union Station]].

The Brunswick line of the [[MARC Train|MARC]] [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system makes stops at Silver Spring, Kensington, Garrett Park, Rockville, Washington Grove, Gaithersburg, Metropolitan Grove, Germantown, Boyds, Barnesville, and Dickerson, where the line splits into its Frederick and Martinsburg branches.

Both suburban arms of the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]] serve Montgomery County. It follows the [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] right of way to the west, roughly paralleling Route 355 from [[Friendship Heights (Washington Metro)|Friendship Heights]] to [[Shady Grove (Washington Metro)|Shady Grove]].

Unincorporated areas are also considered as towns by many people and listed in many collections of towns, but they lack local government. Various organizations, such as the [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[United States Postal Service]], and local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau recognizes the following [[census-designated place]]s in the county:

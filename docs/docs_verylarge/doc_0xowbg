Between 1943 and 1945, Veneto belonged to the [[Italian Social Republic]], while the province of Belluno was part of the [[Prealpine Operations Zone]]. Many towns in the region were bombed by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] during the Second World War. The most hit were Treviso and Vicenza, as well as the industrial area around [[Marghera]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Veneto}}

Veneto is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy]]. The [[Government of Veneto|President of the Region]], colloquially nicknamed Governor or even ''Doge'' in remembrance of Venice's traditional head of state, is also the head of the [[Government of Veneto|Regional Government]]. [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is exerted by the [[Regional Council of Veneto|Regional Council]], the local parliament. The [[Statute of Veneto|Statute]] (i.e. the law establishing and regulating the regional institution, which was first promulgated on 22 May 1971), uses the term &quot;people&quot; for Venetians, but, like in the case of [[Sardinian people|Sardinians]], this is not a legal recognition of any differences from other Italian citizens. Moreover, the region is not granted a form of autonomy comparable to that of neighbouring [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/leggi/1971/71ls0340.html |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Leggi Regionali |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason why many municipalities have held referendums in order to be united to these regions.

Traditionally a very [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] region, Veneto was once the heartland of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], which won a record 60.5% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 1948 (Veneto)|1948 general election]], polled above 50% in each and every general and regional election until 1983 and governed the region since its establishment in 1970 to 1994. After that, Veneto has been a stronghold of the [[centre-right]] coalition, which has governed the region since 1995, first under President [[Giancarlo Galan]] ([[Forza Italia]]/[[The People of Freedom]]) and, since 2010, [[Luca Zaia]] ([[Liga Veneta]]–[[Lega Nord]]). In the [[2020 Venetian regional election|2020 regional election]] Liga Veneta–Lega Nord won a combined 61.5% of the vote (sum of party list and Zaia's personal list), followed by the three main Italian parties of the time, the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (11.9%), the [[Brothers of Italy]] (9.6%) and [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] (3.6%).

According to [[Robert D. Putnam]], the &quot;institutional performance&quot; of Veneto's regional government is higher than average in Italy and Veneto belongs to the &quot;civic North&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R. D. ''[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work. Civic traditions in modern Italy]]''. Princeton, NJ: [[Princeton University Press]], 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venetian nationalism===
[[Venetian nationalism]] is a regionalist/nationalist [[political movement]] which gained prominence in Veneto during the 1970s and 1980s, demanding more autonomy, a [[Autonomous regions with special statute|special statute]] or even independence, and promoting Venetian culture, [[Venetian language|language]] and history. This is the political background in which the [[Liga Veneta]] was launched in 1980. Other regionalist/nationalist groupings, including [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]], [[North-East Project]] and the avowed separatist [[Veneto State]], [[Venetian Independence]] and ''[[Plebiscito.eu]]'', emerged but they have never touched the popularity of Liga Veneta, which was a founding member of [[Lega Nord]] in 1991.

Venetian Independence and other alike groups have been long proposing a referendum on the independence of Veneto from [[Italy]]. After the [[Regional Council of Veneto|Regional Council]] approved a resolution on self-determination (with an explicit reference to a referendum) in November 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?p=84&amp;n=81&amp;c=5&amp;e=91&amp;t=0&amp;idEvento=4466|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Sala stampa|website=consiglioveneto.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/attisp/RIS/Anno_2012/RIS_0044/testo_presentato.html|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Progetti di legge e proposte|website=consiglioveneto.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; a referendum bill was proposed in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?n=80&amp;p=84&amp;c=5&amp;e=88&amp;t=0&amp;idNotizia=23517|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Sala stampa|website=consiglioveneto.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2017 an official [[2017 Venetian autonomy referendum|autonomy referendum]] took place in Veneto: 57.2% of Venetians participated and 98.1% voted &quot;yes&quot;.

== Administrative divisions ==

[[File:Provinces of Veneto map.png|thumb|350px|Veneto's provinces.]]

Veneto is divided into the [[Metropolitan City of Venice]] and 6 provinces and also divided in 581 municipalities.&lt;ref name=vennum/&gt;&lt;ref name=tav0ZN1_2007/&gt; Of the seven provinces of the region, the [[Province of Padua]] is the most populous and has the greatest density, with 424. 81 persons per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, reaching 2268. 58 in the city of [[Padua]]. In contrast the capital city, Venice, has a moderate density of 646. 71.&lt;ref name=tav0ZN1_2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendice: Tavole anagrafiche: Tavola I – Comuni del Veneto: superficie, densità, altimetria, zona altimetrica, aggregazione territoriale (Ulss, Stl, Comunità montane): 2007 |url=http://statistica.regione.veneto.it/Pubblicazioni/VenetoInCifre/2007-2008/index.jsp |language=it |year=2008 |publisher=Regione del Veneto Sistema Statistico Regionale |access-date=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601203957/http://statistica.regione.veneto.it/Pubblicazioni/VenetoInCifre/2007-2008/index.jsp |archive-date=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of least density is [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] (58. 08), which is the largest in area and the most mountainous.

The region has about 4.8 million inhabitants, ranking Veneto as the fifth most populated region in Italy. Veneto has one of the highest [[population density|population densities]] among the Italian regions (265 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2008). This is particularly true in the provinces of [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Treviso]], where the inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are above 300. [[Belluno]] is the least densely populated province, with 57 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Like the other regions of [[Northern Italy]] and [[Central Italy]], though with a certain time lag, Veneto has been experiencing a phase of very slow population growth caused by the dramatic fall in fertility. The overall population has so far been increasing – though only slightly – due to the net immigration started at the end of the 1980s, after more than 20 years of massive exodus from the poorer areas of the region.

Nearly 3 million Venetians were forced to leave their country between 1861 and 1961 to escape poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucemi.it/Notizie/Emigrazione_veneta_041007.pdf |title={{title case|L'EMIGRAZIONE VENETA NEL RAPPORTO 2007 DELLA MIGRANTES PRESENTATO OGGI A VENEZIA}} |publisher=Editrice SOGEDI s.r.l. – Reg. Trib. Roma n°15771/75 |access-date=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many emigrated to [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. After [[World War II]], they moved to other European countries. In 2008, there were 260,849 Venetian citizens living outside of Italy (5.4% of the region's population), the largest number was found in Brazil, with 57,052 Venetians, followed by [[Switzerland]], with 38,320, and [[Argentina]], with 31,823. There are several million people of Venetian descent around the world, particularly in Brazil, in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Local names in [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] such as Nova Schio, [[Nova Bassano]], [[Nova Bréscia]], Nova Treviso, [[Nova Veneza, Santa Catarina|Nova Veneza]], Nova Pádua and Monteberico indicate the Venetian origin of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiannetwork.it/news.aspx?ln=it&amp;id=4697 |title={{title case|ITALIANI ALL'ESTERO – PROGETTO &quot;STORIE DI GENTE VENETA NEL MONDO&quot;.

Due to the impressive [[economic growth]] of the last two decades, Veneto has turned into a land of immigration and has been attracting more and more immigrants since the 1990s. In 2008, the Italian [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|national institute of statistics]] ISTAT estimated that 403,985 foreign-born immigrants live in Veneto, equal to 8.3% of the total regional population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vincenzo Patruno |author2=Marina Venturi |author3=Silvestro Roberto |url=http://demo.istat.it/ |title=Demo-Geodemo. – Mappe, Popolazione, Statistiche Demografiche dell'ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Venedig Basilika.jpg|thumb|[[St Mark's Basilica]], the seat of the [[Patriarch of Venice]].]]
Veneto converted to [[Christianity]] during Roman rule. The region venerates as its patrons the 2nd-century bishop [[Hermagoras of Aquileia|St. Hermagoras]] and his deacon St. Fortunatus, both of Aquileia and both martyrs. [[Aquileia]] became the metropolitan see of Venetia. Aquileia had its own [[Christian liturgy|liturgical rites]] which were used throughout the dioceses of Veneto until the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]] when the [[Roman Rite]] replaced the [[Aquileian Rite]]. By the 6th century the [[bishop of Aquileia]] claimed the title of [[patriarch]]. Rejection of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553) led to a [[Schism of the Three Chapters|schism]] wherein the bishops of [[Aquileia]], [[Liguria]], [[Aemilia (Roman province)|Aemilia]], [[Milan]] and of the [[Istrian]] peninsula all refused to condemn [[Three-Chapter Controversy|the Three Chapters]] leading to the churches of Veneto to break communion with the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Aquileia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the non-Catholic Lombards in 568 only served to prolong the schism until 606 and then finally 699 when the [[Carmen de synodo ticinensi|Synod of Pavia]] definitively ended the schism.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Everett (2003), ''Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568–774'' (Cambridge), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, over 95% of the population claimed to be [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. The region of Veneto along with the regions of Friuli and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol form the ecclesiastical region of Triveneto under the [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchate of Venice]]. The Patriarchate of Venice is an archdiocese and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan see]] of an ecclesiastical region which includes suffragan episcopal sees of Adria-Rovigo, Belluno-Feltre, Chioggia, Concordia-Pordenone, Padua, Treviso, Verona, Vicenza, and [[Vittorio Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|r15it|Triveneto Region|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of Venice was elevated to an honorary [[Patriarchate]] by the pope on 8 October 1457 when the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], a successor to the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], was suppressed. The first patriarch of Venice was St. [[Lorenzo Giustiniani|Laurence]], a nobleman of the Giustiniani family.

During the 20th century the patriarchs were usually appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and three cardinal patriarchs, [[Pope Pius X|Giuseppe Sarto]], [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]], and [[Pope John Paul I|Albino Luciani]], were elected pope: Pius X, John XXIII, and John Paul I, respectively. The [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchate of Venice]] claims [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] the Evangelist as its patron. The same saint, symbolised by a winged lion, had become the typical symbol of the Venetian Republic and is still represented on many civic symbols.

==Economy==
Under Austrian rule, Veneto's agriculturally based economy suffered, which later led to mass emigration. But, since the 1970s it has seen impressive development, thanks to the so-called &quot;Veneto development model&quot; that is characterised by strong [[export-oriented]] entrepreneurship in traditional [[economy|economic sectors]] (€64.47 billion of exports in 2019 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nordesteconomia.gelocal.it/economia/2020/03/11/news/export-nordest-locomotiva-chiude-il-2019-a-2-3-1.38772302|title=Export, Nordest locomotiva chiude il 2019 a +2,3%|date=11 March 2020|website=Nord Est Economia|access-date=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and close social cohesion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805181218/http://www.circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_geo.htm |archive-date=2007-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – making it actually the third richest region in terms of total GDP (€166.4 billion) after [[Lombardy]] and [[Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat [[Press release|News Release]] 19/2008: Regional GDP per inhabitant in [[European Union|the EU]] 2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eds-destatis.de/de/press/download/08_02/019-2008-02-12.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – 19-2008 – de – ins.doc |access-date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geography and historical events have determined the present social and economic structure of the region, centred on a broad belt running from east to west. The plain and the Alpine foothills are the most developed areas in contrast to the [[Po (river)|Po delta]] and the mountainous areas, with the exception of the surroundings of [[Belluno]]. This is why the [[Alps]] and the province of [[Rovigo]] are suffering more than other areas, from a trend of declining and [[population ageing|ageing population]].

===Agriculture===
Though its importance has been decreasing for the past 20–30 years, agriculture continues to play a significant role in the regional economy. The [[agriculture|agricultural sector]] of Veneto is among the most productive in Italy. However, it is still characterised by an intensive use of labour rather than capital, due to the specialisation in [[market gardening]], fruit-growing and vine-growing throughout the plain and the foothills, requiring very much handicraft. In the south and in the extreme east of the region, [[Cereal|grain crops]] are more common and land holdings are larger than in the rest of the region; mechanisation is more advanced here. The cattle stock, although declining, still represented 15% of the national stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526183748/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_eco.htm |archive-date=2013-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fishing]] is also still important in coastal areas.

The main agricultural products include [[maize]], [[pea|green peas]], vegetables, apples, cherries, [[sugar beet]]s, forage, tobacco, hemp. Moreover, Veneto is one of Italy's most important wine-growing areas, producing [[Venetian wine|wines]], such as [[Prosecco]], [[Valpolicella]], and [[Soave (wine)|Soave]]. Overall, Veneto produces more bottles of [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC wine]] than any other area in Italy. The [[Amarone della Valpolicella]], a wine from the hills around Verona, is made with high-selected grapes and is among the more expensive red wines in the world.

===Industry===
In the last 30–40 years industrialisation transformed the appearance of the landscape, especially in the plains.

The regional [[Manufacturing|industry]] is especially made of small and medium-sized businesses, which are active in several sectors: food products, wood and furniture, leather and footwear, textiles and clothing, gold jewelry, but also chemistry, metal-mechanics and electronics. This has led to the establishment of a strongly export-orientated system of industries.

Typical of Veneto is the partition of the territory into industrial districts, which means that each area tends to specialise in a specific sector. The province of Venice hosts large metallurgical and chemical plants in [[Marghera]] and [[Mestre]], but is also specialised in glass handicraft ([[Murano]]).
The province of Belluno hosts the so-called eyeglasses district, being the largest world manufacturer [[Luxottica]] a firm domiciled at Agordo. Other important firms are [[Safilo]], De Rigo, Marcolin.

[[Fashion|Fashion industry]] is extremely strong all over the region: [[Benetton Group|Benetton]], [[Bottega Veneta]], [[Geox]], [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]], [[Calzedonia]], [[Pal Zileri]], [[Dainese]], [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]], [[Marzotto]] are all Venetian brands.

During the last 20 years, a large number of Venetian companies relocated their plants (especially the most dangerous and polluting productions) in [[Eastern Europe]], especially [[Romania]]. The Romanian city of [[Timișoara]] is also called &quot;the newest Venetian province&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/febbraio/01/Timisoara_nuova_provincia_industriale_veneta_co_0_0102011149.shtml |title=Timişoara, la nuova provincia industriale veneta |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2007-01-02 |access-date=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206115743/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/febbraio/01/Timisoara_nuova_provincia_industriale_veneta_co_0_0102011149.shtml |archive-date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Punta San Vigilio.jpg|thumb|The Punta San Vigilio on the [[Lake Garda]]]]
Although being a heavily industrialised region, tourism is one of its main economic resources; one-fifth of Italy's foreign tourism gravitates towards Veneto, which is the first region in Italy in terms of tourist presence, attracting over 60 million visitors every year, second after [[Emilia-Romagna]] in terms of hotel industry structures; the business volume of tourism in Veneto is estimated to be in the vicinity of 12 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regione.veneto.it/Notizie/Comunicati+Stampa/Febbraio+2008/294.htm |title=Comunicato Nr 294 – Sito Ufficiale della Regione Veneto |publisher=Regione.veneto.it |date=2008-02-22 |access-date=2009-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501191954/http://www.regione.veneto.it/Notizie/Comunicati+Stampa/Febbraio+2008/294.htm |archive-date=1 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and architecture===
[[File:Detail of Jesus and Judas by Giotto.jpg|thumb|300px|''Kiss of Judas'' by [[Giotto]], in Padua.]]

The Middle Ages stimulated the creation of monumental works such as the complex of churches on the island of [[Torcello]], in the Venetian lagoon, with the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] founded in 639, its bell tower erected in the 11th century and the adjacent ''Martyrium of Santa Fosca'' built around the 1100, notable for the mosaics.
They saw the construction of the [[Basilica di San Zeno|Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore]] in [[Verona]], which was Veneto's main centre for that esthetic movement and we note, by the mixture of styles that Verona was an important crossroads to the north of [[Europe]].
Examples of [[Gothic art]], in addition to the Venetian church of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] and that of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, are the [[Scaliger Tombs]] in the historical centre of [[Verona]].

While in Veneto [[Byzantine Art|Byzantine art]] was important, an element of innovation was brought to Padua by [[Giotto]], bearer of a new pictorial tradition: that of Tuscany. Towards the 1302 he was commissioned by [[Enrico Scrovegni]] to paint the family chapel, now known just by the name of [[Scrovegni Chapel]], one of the most important artistic monuments of [[Padua]] and Veneto. The influences of the contribution of Giotto were felt immediately, as in the frescoes of [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]] in the [[Baptistry]] near the [[Cathedral of Padua]] and those of [[Altichiero]] in the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua|Basilica of Saint Anthony]].

[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb |[[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]''.]]

After a phase of development of [[Gothic art]], with the creation of important works including the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]], and the churches of [[Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] and of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Saints John and Paul]] in Venice, the influence of the [[Renaissance]] ushered in a new era. In addition to [[Donatello]], an important Venetian Renaissance artist was [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506), whose most important work in Veneto is perhaps the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]]'', found in Verona. With the mainland expansion of the Venetian Republic and the consolidation of its institutions, there was also an artistic development of exceptional stature: Mantegna, [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini (painter)|Giovanni Bellini]], [[Cima da Conegliano]], [[Pordenone]] laid the foundations for what would be the age of Venetian painting.

[[Padua]] was a cradle of the Venetian Renaissance, Where influences from [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]] filtered north. Amongst the Renaissance artists who worked there were [[Donatello]], who worked on an altar of the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony]], and [[Pisanello]], whose works are mainly in [[Verona]], for example, the fresco of [[Saint George]] in the [[Church of St. Anastasia]].

[[File:Padua 2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Prato della Valle]] in Padua, a work of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture.]]
In the first phase with Carpaccio and Bellini, the influences of international painting were still evident and the references to [[Flemish art]] were numerous. Artists of the successive phase included [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] and [[Lorenzo Lotto]]. Giorgione and Titian developed an original and innovative style, which characterised the painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] rather than other traditions. Giorgione's enigmatic style infused his work with allegory, and he created his paintings with less reliance on a preparatory drawing than previous painters. This innovation was looking for the imitation of natural phenomena by creating atmospheres with the colours and shifting the emphasis from the pursuit of artistic perfection. ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The storm]]'' (1506–1508), now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]] in Venice, is an example of this use of colour, where the mixture colour and texture continue indefinitely without preparatory drawing for the painting work gives a special atmosphere.

Titian, born in Belluno [[Pieve di Cadore]], brought forward the use of this technique without pictorial design, creating masterpieces such as the ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (1516–1518),&lt;ref name=&quot;dteofmkng&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fineartprintsondemand.com/artists/titian/assumption_of_the_virgin.htm | title=Date of Completion | access-date=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[altar]] made by imposing visible sizes on the main altar of the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice, a work whose suggestion is due to the use of colour. At the end of his long life, he had acquired fame and commissions across the continent.

[[Tintoretto]] (1518–1594) recast Roman Mannerism in a Venetian style, less linear, and with more use of colour to distinguish forms, highlighting the bright prospects for its operations, giving unusual deformations of perspective, to increase the sense of tension in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuffi|first=Stefano|title=One Thousand Years of Painting|year=2004|publisher=Electa|location=Milan, Italy|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studio was prolific. Palaces and churches of Venice abound with his paintings. The [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] alone sports 66 paintings by this painter. The [[Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio Maggiore]] houses a huge canvas by him depicting the ''Last Supper''.

Kirk's musical career spans from 1955 until his death in 1977. He preferred to lead his own bands and rarely performed as a sideman, although he did record with arranger [[Quincy Jones]], drummer [[Roy Haynes]] and worked with bassist [[Charles Mingus]]. One of his best-known recorded performances is the lead flute and solo on Jones' &quot;[[Soul Bossa Nova]]&quot;, a 1964 hit song repopularized in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=Clarence Bernard|title=Let's Make Some Noise: Axé and the African Roots of Brazilian Popular Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiNoYC8pZA8C&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=July 13, 2020|date=2008-08-21|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781604730821|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk's multi-instrumentality was credited as having a substantial musical conception. This inclusivity included blues music, a love of stride piano and early jazz, and an appreciation for pop tunes. But his vision was much wider than most of his contemporaries. According to producer Joel Dorn, he was also hugely knowledgeable about classical music. Pieces by [[Saint-Saens]], [[Hindemith]], [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvorak]] and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] would all feature on his albums over the years, alongside standards, pop songs and original compositions. Rahsaan's influences went beyond jazz and consequentially, he preferred the term 'Black Classical Music.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Heining&quot; /&gt;

His playing was generally rooted in [[soul jazz]] or [[hard bop]], but Kirk's knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw from many elements of the music's past, from [[ragtime]] to [[Swing (genre)|swing]] and [[free jazz]]. Kirk also absorbed [[classical music|classical]] influences, and his artistry reflected elements of [[pop music]] by composers such as [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Burt Bacharach]], as well as [[Duke Ellington]], [[John Coltrane]] and other jazz musicians. The live album ''[[Bright Moments (Rahsaan Roland Kirk album)|Bright Moments]]'' (1973) is an example of one of his shows.

Kirk played and collected many musical instruments, mainly multiple [[saxophone]]s, [[clarinet]]s and [[flute]]s. His primary saxophones were a standard [[tenor saxophone]], [[stritch (saxophone)|stritch]] (a straight alto sax lacking the instrument's conventional upturned bell), and a [[manzello]] (a modified [[saxello]] soprano sax, with a larger, upturned bell). A number of his instruments were exotic or homemade. Kirk modified instruments himself to accommodate his simultaneous playing technique.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;With one instrument functioning as a drone and keywork modification to the other two, Kirk was able to play in three part harmony with himself.&quot; Stephen Cottrell (2012). The Saxophone, Yale University Press p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Gary Giddins]] wrote that Kirk's tenor playing alone was enough to bring him &quot;renown&quot;.&lt;ref name=Giddins/&gt;

Usually, he appeared on stage with all three horns hanging around his neck, and at times he would play a number of these horns at once, harmonizing with himself, or sustain a note for lengthy durations by using [[circular breathing]]. He used the multiple horns to play true chords, essentially functioning as a one-man saxophone section. Kirk insisted that he was only trying to emulate the sounds he heard in his head. Even while playing two or three saxophones at once, the music was intricate, powerful jazz with a strong feel for the blues.&lt;ref name=Giddins/&gt;

Kirk was also an influential flute player, including [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]]. According to Giddins, Kirk was the first major jazz innovator on flute after [[Eric Dolphy]] (who died in 1964).&lt;ref name=Giddins/&gt; Kirk employed several techniques, including singing or humming into the flute at the same time as playing. Another was to play the standard transverse flute at the same time as a [[nose flute]].

He played a variety of other instruments, including whistles; often kept a gong within reach; the [[clarinet]], [[harmonica]], [[English horn]], and was a competent [[trumpeter]].&lt;ref&gt;See his version of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; on ''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' (1975) in which he introduces the theme on trumpet before switching to saxophones for the remainder of the song.&lt;/ref&gt; He utilized unique approaches, such as playing a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece.

He also made use of non-musical devices, such as alarm clocks, sirens, or a section of common garden hose (dubbed &quot;the black mystery pipes&quot;). From the early 1970s, his studio recordings used tape-manipulated ''[[musique concrète]]'' and primitive electronic sounds before such things became commonplace.&lt;ref name=Giddins/&gt;

''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' was a unique album in the annals of recorded jazz and popular music. It was a two-LP set, with Side 4 apparently &quot;blank&quot;, the label not indicating any content. However, once word of &quot;the secret message&quot; got around among Rahsaan's fans, one would find that about 12 minutes into Side 4 appeared the first of two telephone answering machine messages recorded by Kirk, the second following soon thereafter (but separated by more blank grooves). The surprise impact of these segments appearing on &quot;blank&quot; Side 4 was lost on the CD reissue of this album.

He gleaned information on what was happening in the world via radio and TV. His later recordings often incorporated his spoken commentaries on current events, including [[Richard Nixon]]'s involvement in the [[Watergate scandal]]. The ''3-Sided Dream'' album was a &quot;concept album&quot; which incorporated &quot;found&quot; or environmental sounds and [[tape loops]], tapes being played backwards, etc. Snippets of [[Billie Holiday]] singing are also heard briefly. The album even confronts the rise of influence of computers in society, as Rahsaan threatens to pull the plug on the machine trying to tell him what to do.

In the album ''[[Other Folks' Music]]'' the spoken words of [[Paul Robeson]], another outspoken black artist, can be briefly heard.

==Material loss==
On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Rahsaan Roland Kirk among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and influence ==
* [[Ian Anderson]], leader and flautist of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] recorded a version of Kirk's &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo&quot; on their first album ''[[This Was]]'' (1968). Roland Kirk was the very reason Anderson thought he could bring a flute into rock music. Anderson learned Kirk’s vocalizing style on the flute and Anderson's flute playing became the signature element of Jethro Tull's sound. Kirk and Anderson took the flute's refined upper crust classical nature and commonized it. Anderson got to know Kirk at the 1969 [[Newport Jazz Festival]] where they both performed the same night. Anderson said of Kirk &quot;There’s something about these colourful shamans. They can tease us, but we go along with it, because we know they’re touched by genius, but at the same time there’s a little bit of the snake oil for sale.”&lt;ref name=&quot;jazztimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Himes |first1=Geoffrey |title=Rahsaan Roland Kirk: The Cult of Kirk |url=https://jazztimes.com/features/rahsaan-roland-kirk-the-cult-of-kirk/ |website=jazztimes |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jeff Coffin]], the saxophonist in [[Béla Fleck]] and the Flecktones was heavily influenced by Kirk's music and says he learned through Kirk that it's OK to experiment with an instrument. He used Kirk's multi-horn inventions with the Flecktones and on his solo album ''Mutopia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jazztimes.com&quot;/&gt;
* Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] &quot;idolized&quot; Kirk, and even hoped to collaborate with him one day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders&quot;&gt;Saunders, William (2010), ''Jimi Hendrix London'', Roaring Forties Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9843165-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Frank Zappa]] had been influenced by Kirk's music to a considerable extent early in his career. In the liner notes to his 1966 debut album with [[The Mothers of Invention]], ''[[Freak Out!]]'', Zappa cites Kirk as one of many in a lengthy list of personal musical influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Category:Freak_Out!_%28The_List%29 Freak out wiki] killuglyradio.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corcelli, John,

*[[Derek Trucks]], a huge Kirk fan, recorded Kirk’s composition “Volunteered Slavery” with [[The Derek Trucks Band|his namesake group]] for the 2004 album ''Live at Georgia Theatre'', the 2006 studio album ''Songlines'', and the DVD ''Songlines Live''. He said that hearing Kirk's music &quot;felt much the same way those Hendrix records felt, that he was blowing the rules wide open...&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;jazztimes.com&quot;/&gt;
* [[David Jackson (rock musician)|David Jackson]], of [[Van der Graaf Generator]], was also highly influenced by the style and technique of Kirk, and he plays multiple saxophones simultaneously since at least 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Christopulos, J., and P. Smart, ''Van der Graaf Generator – The Book'', Phil and Jim Publishers, 2005, p. 55. {{ISBN|0-9551337-0-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guitarist [[Michael Angelo Batio]] said in a 2008 interview with ''[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]'' that Kirk's playing of two saxophones at once inspired him to create his &quot;double guitar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/michael_angelo_batio_i_always_wanted_my_guitars_to_be_different_and_unique.html &quot;Michael Angelo Batio: I always wanted my guitars to be different and unique&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406202147/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/michael_angelo_batio_i_always_wanted_my_guitars_to_be_different_and_unique.html |date=2010-04-06 }}, Joe Matera interview, 2008, [[Ultimate Guitar Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* T.J. Kirk was a band named after the three artists it tributed: Thelonious Monk, James Brown, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Formed by eight-string guitarist [[Charlie Hunter]] as a side group to his own self-titled band, the band's other members include [[Scott Amendola]], [[Will Bernard]], and John Schott.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Meredith [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tj-kirk-p165793 T.J. Kirk – Biography], ''[[AllMusic]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paul Weller]] cited the Kirk album ''[[I Talk with the Spirits]]'' (1964) as one of his &quot;Most Influential Albums&quot; in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6738732.ece|title=Guest List: Paul Weller|newspaper=The Times|date=8 August 2009|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Davey Payne]]'s twin saxophone solo on &quot;[[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick]]&quot; (Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads, 1978) was inspired by Kirk.&lt;ref&gt;Balls, Richard, ''Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock 'N' Roll'', Omnibus Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''John McLoughlin''', baptized '''Jean-Baptiste McLoughlin''', (October 19, 1784 &amp;ndash; September 3, 1857) was a French-Canadian, later American, [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] and Superintendent of the [[Columbia District]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] at [[Fort Vancouver]] from 1824 to 1845. He was later known as the &quot;Father of Oregon&quot; for his role in assisting the American cause in the [[Oregon Country]]. In the late 1840s, his general store in [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] was famous as the last stop on the [[Oregon Trail]].

==Childhood==
McLoughlin was born in October 1784 in [[Rivière-du-Loup]], [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Quebec]],{{sfn|Lamb|1985}} of Irish (his grandfather came from Sharagore (Desertegny) in the [[Inishowen]] peninsula of [[County Donegal]]), Scottish, and French Canadian descent. However, as the surname [[McLoughlin]] is of Irish origin originating in Donegal it's likely his Scottish ancestors may have originally been of Irish extraction&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donegaldiaspora.ie/programme/mclaughlin-clan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Master Book of Irish Surnames: Locations, Ethnic Origins, Variant Spellings &amp; Sources by Michael C. O'Laughlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clanmaclochlainn.com/dna.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with his great uncle, Colonel William Fraser, for a while as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20613754|language=en|title=John McLoughlin, Reluctant Fur Trader|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=81|issue=4|pages=377–389|last1=Morrison|first1=Dorothy|last2=Morrison|first2=Jean|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though baptized [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], he was raised [[Anglican]]. In his later life, he returned to the Roman Catholic faith.

In 1798, he began to study medicine under Sir [[James Fisher (physician)|James Fisher]] of Quebec.{{sfn|Lamb|1985}}

In 1803, McLoughlin was granted a license to practice medicine in [[Lower Canada]] (now Quebec).{{sfn|Lamb|1985}} He was hired as a physician at [[Fort William, Ontario#History|Fort William]], the inland headquarters and a fur trade post of the [[North West Company]] on [[Lake Superior]]. There he became a trader and mastered several [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] languages. In 1814, he became a partner in the company.

In 1816, McLoughlin was charged with complicity in the massacre at the [[Red River Colony]] after the [[Battle of Seven Oaks (1816)|Battle of Seven Oaks]]. He and all the other parties from the North West Company were exonerated. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was found culpable by the appointed Royal Commissioner at their trial on 30&amp;nbsp;October 1818, and in the later prosecutions by Lord Selkirk and the successful counter-suits.{{sfn|Lamb|1985}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Canadiana |volume=6 |publisher=Grolier Limited |year=1970 |location=Toronto, ON |pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DFHD|962|Grant, Cuthbert National Historic Person|9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=George |last=Woodcock |title=Grant, Cuthbert |volume=8 |accessdate=2014-01-12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/grant_cuthbert_1854_8E.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLoughlin was instrumental in the negotiations leading to the North West Company's 1821 merger with the Hudson's Bay Company. He was promoted to head the [[Rainy Lake|Lac la Pluie district]] temporarily shortly after the merger.

In 1824, the Hudson's Bay Company appointed McLoughlin, already a [[Chief Factor]], as Superintendent of the [[Columbia Department]] (roughly parallel to what Americans know as the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon Country]]), and [[Peter Skene Ogden]] was appointed to assist him.  At the time, the region was under joint occupation of both the United States and Britain pursuant to the [[Treaty of 1818]]. Upon his arrival, McLoughlin determined that the headquarters of the company at [[Fort Astoria]] (now [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Oregon]]), at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], was unfit.  The [[York Factory Express]] trade route had evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the [[North West Company]] between [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]], founded in 1811 by [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]]) at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], to [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] on [[Lake Superior]].

In the 1821 merger with the North West Company, the Hudson's Bay Company gained control of North West Company trading posts west of the Rocky Mountains. They established headquarters at Fort George (formerly Astoria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Red River Settlement|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0841356.html|encyclopedia=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.

He investigated a quicker route than previously used, following the [[Saskatchewan River]] and crossing the mountains at [[Athabasca Pass]]. This route was thereafter followed by the [[York Factory Express]] brigades.

===Fort Vancouver===
{{main|Fort Vancouver}}

McLoughlin built [[Fort Vancouver]] as a replacement for Fort George, on the north side of the [[Columbia River]], a few miles upstream from the confluence of the Columbia and  [[Willamette River]]s.  The site was chosen by Sir [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]]. The post was opened for business on March 19, 1825. From his [[Columbia Department]] headquarters in Fort Vancouver, McLoughlin supervised trade and kept peace with the Indians, inaugurated salmon and timber trade with Mexican-controlled California and [[Hawaii]], and supplied [[Russian America]] with produce.

Fort Vancouver became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to drop off supplies and trade goods in exchange for the furs. It was the nexus for the [[fur trade]] on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled [[California]]. From Fort Vancouver, at its pinnacle, McLoughlin watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Under McLoughlin's management, the Columbia Department remained highly profitable, in part due to the ongoing high demand for [[beaver]] hats in Europe. John McLoughlin was worried Fort Vancouver would be attacked and plundered of its heavy stock of supplies, due to its proximity to the [[Willamette Valley]], in which there was already an American settlement of some size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rich |editor1-first=E.E. |title=The Letters of John McLoughlin from Fort Vancouver to the Governor and Committee.

===York Factory Express===
{{main|York Factory Express}}

By 1825 there were usually two brigades from opposite ends of the route, ([[Fort Vancouver]] in the [[Columbia District]] on the lower [[Columbia River]] and the other from [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]]), that set out in spring and passed each other in the middle of the continent. Each brigade consisted of about forty to seventy-five men and two to five specially made boats that travelled at breakneck speed (for the time). These brigades often needed help from Indians, who would help the men portage around falls and unnavigable rapids; in return, the Indians were paid with trade goods. An 1839 report cites the travel time as three months and ten days—almost 26 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) per day on average. The brigades used boat, horseback, and backpacks to bring the supplies in and furs out to the forts and trading posts along the route.

===Puget Sound Agricultural Company===
{{main|Puget Sound Agricultural Company}}

The Hudson Bay Company officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. Two developments in the late 1830s made a reappraisal of Hudson's Bay Company operations in the Columbia Department necessary. Apprehensions about American antagonism rose due to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Lewis F. Linn]], who in 1838 called for a naval force to be dispatched to the Columbia River, although the measure never passed. Favorable relations with the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) were established with the signing of the [[RAC-HBC Agreement]] in 1839.

To meet the new commercial obligations and to support British claims in the Oregon Question, the Hudson's Bay Company formally incorporated the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]] (PSAC) subsidiary in 1840. The new venture, while nominally independent, was administratively included within the Columbia Department. McLoughlin criticized the idea of a fur trading [[monopoly]] maintaining agricultural operations, as he felt independent farmers would be efficient.{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=241}} Nonetheless, he was appointed as the PSAC supervisor.

The fertile plains near the [[Cowlitz River]] were selected as a suitable location for [[Cowlitz Farm]], the principal PSAC farm. [[Fort Nisqually]] was also assigned to the PSAC, where numerous livestock herds were maintained. Several locations were considered for potential farmers, including among the French-Canadian and Métis farmers of the Willamette Valley,{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=247}} [[Scotland]],{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=249}} and the [[Red River colony]].{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=252}}

In November 1839 Sir [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] instructed [[Duncan Finlayson (fur trader)|Duncan Finlayson]] to begin promoting the PSAC among the Red River colonists.{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=252}} James Sinclair was appointed by [[Duncan Finlayson (fur trader)|Duncan Finlayson]] to guide the mostly Métis settler families to Fort Vancouver.{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=254}} In June 1841, the party left [[Fort Garry]] with 23 families consisting of 121 people.{{sfn|Simpson|1847|p=62}} When they arrived at Fort Vancouver, they numbered 21 families of 116 people.{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|p=254}} Fourteen families were relocated to [[Fort Nisqually]], while the remaining seven families were sent to [[Fort Cowlitz]].{{sfn|Galbraith|1954|pp=254-255}}

==Context and maps==
{{wide image|File:Everest-3D-Map-Type-EN.jpg|512px|3D rendering of Mount Everest and surrounding terrain}}
Nearby peaks include [[Lhotse]], {{convert|8516|m|ft|abbr=on}}; [[Nuptse]], {{convert|7855|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and [[Changtse]], {{convert|7580|m|ft|abbr=on}} among others. Another nearby peak is [[Khumbutse]], and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.

'''Glasnevin Cemetery''' ({{lang-ga|Reilig Ghlas Naíon}}) is a large cemetery in [[Glasnevin]], Dublin, Ireland which opened in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/funeral-services/glasnevin-cemeteries-crem/ |title=Glasnevin Trust – Cemetery History |publisher=Glasnevintrust.ie |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It holds the graves and memorials of several notable figures, and has a museum.

==History and description==
Prior to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery, [[Irish Catholic]]s had no cemeteries of their own in which to bury their dead and, as the repressive [[Penal Laws]] of the eighteenth century placed heavy restrictions on the public performance of Catholic services, it had become normal practice for Catholics to conduct a limited version of their own funeral services in Protestant churchyards or graveyards. This situation continued until an incident at a funeral held at [[St. Kevin's Church, Camden Row, Dublin|St. Kevin's Churchyard]] in 1823 provoked public outcry when a Protestant [[sexton (office)|sexton]] reprimanded a Catholic priest for proceeding to perform a limited version of a funeral mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/glasnevin/|title=Glasnevin – Daniel O'Connell|year=2010 |publisher= Glasnevin Trust |accessdate=15 February 2010}} pg 2 of 3&lt;/ref&gt;
The outcry prompted [[Daniel O'Connell]], champion of Catholic rights, to launch a campaign and prepare a legal opinion proving that there was actually no law passed forbidding praying for a dead Catholic in a graveyard. O'Connell pushed for the opening of a burial ground in which both Irish Catholics and Protestants could give their dead dignified burial.

Glasnevin Cemetery was consecrated and opened to the public for the first time on 21 February 1832. The first burial, that of eleven-year-old Michael Carey from Francis Street in Dublin,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/ten-most-famous-people-buried-in-dublins-glasnevin-cemetery &quot;Dublin’s Glasnevin Cemetery held its first burial on this day in 1832&quot;, ''Irish Central'', June 6, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; took place on the following day in a section of the cemetery known as Curran's Square. The cemetery was initially known as Prospect Cemetery, a name chosen from the townland of Prospect, which surrounded the cemetery lands. Besides the famous interred at Glasnevin, nearly 800,000 people have been buried in Glasnevin in unmarked mass graves due to the death toll from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s and a later cholera epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.ie/life/the-final-resting-place-of-the-nations-great-and-good-30477728.html Corless, Damian. &quot;The final resting place of the nation's great and good&quot;, ''Independent'', August 6, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally covering nine acres of ground, the area of the cemetery has now grown to approximately 124 acres. This includes its expansion on the southern side of the [[Finglas]] Road with the section called St. Paul's. The option of [[cremation]] has been provided since March 1982.
Glasnevin Cemetery remains under the care of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee. The development of the cemetery is an ongoing task with major expansion and refurbishment work being carried out at the present time.

The [[Mass (liturgy)|Catholic Mass]] is celebrated by members of the parish clergy every Sunday at 9.45&amp;nbsp;am. The annual blessing of the graves takes place each summer as it has done since the foundation of the cemetery in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionaroadparish.ie/our-parish/glasnevin-cemetery|publisher=Iona Road Parish Website |title=Our Parish – Glasnevin Cemetery|accessdate= 22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The cemetery is located in Glasnevin, Dublin, in two parts.  The main part, with its trademark high walls and watchtowers, is located on one side of the road from Finglas to the city centre, while the other part, &quot;St. Paul's,&quot; is located across the road and beyond a green space, between two railway lines.

A gateway into the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)|National Botanic Gardens]] adjacent to the cemetery was reopened in recent years.

==Features==

===Memorials and graves===
{{further|Burials in Glasnevin Cemetery}}
The cemetery contains historically notable monuments and the graves of many of Ireland's most prominent national figures. These include the graves of [[Daniel O'Connell]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Éamon de Valera]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Maude Gonne]], [[Kevin Barry]], [[Roger Casement]], [[Constance Markievicz]], [[Patrick O'Donnell (Invincible)|Pádraig Ó Domhnaill]], [[Seán MacBride]], [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]], [[James Larkin]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[Christy Brown]] and [[Luke Kelly]] of [[the Dubliners]].

The grave of Michael Collins, the nationalist leader who was killed in the [[Irish Civil War]] in 1922, is among the most visited sites in Glasnevin. Around him were buried at least 183 soldiers of the Irish Free State. In 1967 their names were recorded on memorial around Collin's grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theirishstory.com/2017/05/16/the-free-states-forgotten-soldiers-the-national-army-monument-at-glasnevin/ | website = TheIrishStory.com | title = The Free State's forgotten soldiers: The National Army monument at Glasnevin | date = 16 May 2017 | accessdate = 29 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 a mass grave at the site of a [[Magdalene laundries in Ireland|Magdalene laundry]], institutions used to house &quot;fallen women&quot;, was discovered after the convent which ran the laundry sold the land to a property developer.  The Sisters from the Convent arranged to have the remains cremated and reburied in a mass grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, splitting the cost of the reburial with the developer who had bought the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/irealnd-magdalene-laundries-scandal-un|title=Ireland's Magdalene laundries scandal must be laid to rest|work=The Guardian|author=Mary Raftery|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery also offers a view of the changing style of death monuments in Ireland over the last 200 years: from the austere, simple, high stone erections of the period up until the 1860s, to the elaborate [[Celtic cross]]es of the nationalistic revival from the 1860s to the 1960s, to the plain Italian marble of the late 20th century.

[[File:Crossglasnevin.jpg|thumb|Typical Glasnevin cemetery mid 19th century plain and Celtic cross gravestones.]]
[[File:Glasnevin Cemetery - More than 1,000,000 Graves (4164589746).jpg|thumb|20th century gravestones.]]
The high wall with watch-towers surrounding the main part of the cemetery was built to deter [[Body-snatching|bodysnatchers]], who were active in Dublin in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The watchmen also had a pack of blood-hounds who roamed the cemetery at night.

In 2009, Glasnevin Trust in co-operation with the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) began identifying the graves of Irish service personnel who died while serving in the Commonwealth forces during the two [[world war]]s. These names are inscribed on two memorials, rededicated and relocated in 2011 to near the main entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasnevin Trust &amp; Commonwealth War Graves Commission erect 39 gravestones...|url=http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/index.cfm/fuseaction/notice_board.content/id/B2E9B4F8-0B0E-69D4-0B4E547D84B2D5CB|publisher=Glasnevin Trust|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104014749/http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/index.cfm/fuseaction/notice_board.content/id/B2E9B4F8-0B0E-69D4-0B4E547D84B2D5CB |archivedate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cross of Sacrifice]] was erected in the cemetery, in a joint Irish-British commemoration ceremony, to mark the [[First World War centenary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=31 July 2014: Dedication of Cross of Sacrifice, Glasnevin Cemetery|url=http://www.decadeofcentenaries.com/31-july-2014-dedication-of-cross-of-sacrifice-glasnevin-cemetery/|website=Decade of Centenaries|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2019, there are 215 service personnel of the Commonwealth of both wars identified as buried here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasnevin (or Prospect) Cemetery, with list of casualties|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/91205/GLASNEVIN%20(OR%20PROSPECT)%20CEMETERY|publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]|accessdate = 30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angels plot===
Glasnevin is one of the few cemeteries that allowed stillborn babies to be buried in [[consecrated ground]] and contains an area called the Angels Plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isands.ie/angels-memory-garden-glasnevin-mainmenu-36|title=Angels Memory Garden – Glasnevin|work=Infant Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society|accessdate=13 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414111730/http://www.isands.ie/angels-memory-garden-glasnevin-mainmenu-36|archive-date=14 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crematorium===
In 1982, a crematorium was constructed within the cemetery grounds by Glasnevin Trust. Since then, the service has been used for people of various religious denominations who wished to be cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/glasnevin_crematorium/|title=Glasnevin Crematorium |year=2010|publisher=Glasnevin Trust|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum and tours===
An unusual feature of the cemetery is the Glasnevin Trust Museum, designed by [[A&amp;D Wejchert &amp; Partners Architects]] and opened in 2010.  It includes a café.

The cemetery also runs tours, hosts educational groups and has support for genealogists and those studying family history.

Glasnevin Cemetery is the setting for the [[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 6, Hades|&quot;Hades&quot; episode]] in [[James Joyce]]'s 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', and is mentioned by [[Idris Davies]] in his poem ''Eire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ulysses (Annotated)|last=James|first=Joyce|isbn=978-3736813762|location=München|oclc=943829505|date = 2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The complete poems of Idris Davies|last=Idris.|first=Davies|date=1994|publisher=University of Wales Press|others=Johnston, Dafydd, 1955-|isbn=0708312721|location=Cardiff|oclc=34951713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haskell Brooks Curry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|k|əl}}; September 12, 1900&amp;nbsp;– September 1, 1982) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian. Curry is best known for his work in [[combinatory logic]]. While the initial concept of combinatory logic was based on a single paper by [[Moses Schönfinkel]],&lt;ref&gt;1924. &quot;Über die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik&quot;, ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''92''', pp.&amp;nbsp;305–316. Translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg as &quot;On the building blocks of mathematical logic&quot; in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 355–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Curry did much of the development. Curry is also known for [[Curry's paradox]] and the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]]. There are three [[programming language]]s named after him, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[BrookGPU|Brook]] and [[Curry (programming language)|Curry]], as well as the concept of ''[[currying]]'', a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science.

== Life ==
Curry was born on September 12, 1900, in [[Millis, Massachusetts]], to [[Samuel Silas Curry]] and [[Anna Baright Curry]], who ran a school for [[elocution]]. He entered [[Harvard University]] in 1916 to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in 1920. After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], he returned to Harvard to study physics, earning an MA in 1924. Curry's interest in mathematical logic started during this period when he was introduced to the [[Principia Mathematica]], the attempt by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] to ground mathematics in symbolic logic. Remaining at Harvard, Curry pursued a Ph.D. in mathematics. While he was directed by [[George David Birkhoff]] to work on differential equations, his interests continued to shift to logic. In 1927, while an instructor at Princeton University, he discovered the work of [[Moses Schönfinkel]] in combinatory logic. Schönfinkel's work had anticipated much of Curry's own research, and as a consequence, he moved to [[University of Göttingen]] where he could work with [[Heinrich Behmann]] and [[Paul Bernays]], who were familiar with Schönfinkel's work. Curry was supervised by [[David Hilbert]] and worked closely with Bernays, receiving a Ph.D. in 1930 with a dissertation on combinatory logic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldin 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seldin|first=Jonathan|title=The Logic of Curry and Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, before leaving for Göttingen, Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley. The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation, then, in 1929, moved to [[State College, Pennsylvania]] where Curry accepted a position at [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State College]]. They had two children, Anne Wright Curry (July 27, 1930) and Robert Wheatley Curry (July 6, 1934). Curry remained at Penn State for the next 37 years. He spent one year at [[University of Chicago]] in 1931–1932 under a [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine#Program units|National Research Fellowship]] and one year in 1938–1939 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton. In 1942 he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the United States government during [[World War II]], notably at the [[Frankford Arsenal]]. Immediately after the war he worked on the [[ENIAC]] project, in 1945 and 1946. Under a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]], he collaborated with [[Robert Feys]] in [[Leuven|Louvain]], Belgium. After retiring from Penn State in 1966, Curry accepted a position at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. In 1970, after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic, Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College, Pennsylvania.

Haskell Curry died on September 1, 1982 in State College, Pennsylvania.

== Work ==
The focus of Curry's work were attempts to show that combinatory logic could provide a foundation for mathematics. Towards the end of 1933, he learned of the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]] from correspondence with [[J. Barkley Rosser|John Rosser]]. The paradox, developed by Rosser and [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]], had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems, including one proposed by [[Alonzo Church]] (a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem) and Curry's own system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seldin 2006&quot; /&gt;  However, unlike Church, Kleene, and Rosser, Curry did not give up on the foundational approach, saying that he did not want to &quot;run away from paradoxes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barendregt|first=H.P.|title=The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics|publisher=Elsevier|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career, Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field. Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of [[functional programming]] language. The power and scope of combinatory logic are quite similar to that of the [[lambda calculus]] of Church, and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades.

In 1947 Curry also described one of the first high-level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one-address computer.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Donald E.; Pardo, Luis Trabb (1976). &quot;Early development of programming languages&quot;. Stanford University, Computer Science Department, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at Harvard, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and from 1929 to 1966, at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. In 1942, he published [[Curry's paradox]]. In 1966 he became professor of logic and its history and philosophy of exact sciences at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the successor of [[Evert Willem Beth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://albumacademicum.uva.nl/id/id001294 Album Academicum], University of Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Curry also wrote and taught [[mathematical logic]] more generally; his teaching in this area culminated in his 1963 ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''. His preferred philosophy of mathematics was [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formalism]] (cf. his 1951 book), following his mentor Hilbert, but his writings betray substantial philosophical curiosity and a very open mind about [[intuitionistic logic]].

Like the other strains of the species, O157:H7 is [[gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] and [[oxidase|oxidase-negative]]. Unlike many other strains, it does not ferment [[sorbitol]], which [[#Diagnosis|provides a basis for clinical laboratory differentiation of the strain]]. [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Strains of ''E. coli'' that express Shiga and Shiga-like toxins]] gained that ability via [[transduction (genetics)|infection with a prophage]] containing the structural gene coding for the toxin, and nonproducing strains may become infected and produce shiga-like toxins after incubation with shiga toxin positive strains. The [[prophage]] responsible seems to have infected the strain's ancestors fairly recently, as viral particles have been observed to replicate in the host if it is stressed in some way (e.g. antibiotics).&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien_1984_65&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien AD, Newland JW, Miller SF, Holmes RK, Smith HW, Formal SB | title = Shiga-like toxin-converting phages from Escherichia coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis or infantile diarrhea | journal = Science | volume = 226 | issue = 4675 | pages = 694–96 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6387911 | doi = 10.1126/science.6387911 | bibcode = 1984Sci...226..694O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strockbine_1986_91&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strockbine NA, Marques LR, Newland JW, Smith HW, Holmes RK, O'Brien AD | title = Two toxin-converting phages from Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 933 encode antigenically distinct toxins with similar biologic activities | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–40 | date = July 1986 | pmid = 3522426 | pmc = 260087 | doi =  10.1128/IAI.53.1.135-140.1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural habitat===
While it is relatively uncommon, the ''E. coli'' serotype O157:H7 can naturally be found in the intestinal contents of some cattle, goats, and even sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2571/Escherichia-coli.html|title=Escherichia coli|access-date=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digestive tract of cattle lack the Shiga toxin receptor [[globotriaosylceramide]], and thus, these can be asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium.&lt;ref name=Pruimboom-Brees2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pruimboom-Brees IM, Morgan TW, Ackermann MR, Nystrom ED, Samuel JE, Cornick NA, Moon HW | title = Cattle lack vascular receptors for Escherichia coli O157:H7 Shiga toxins | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 19 | pages = 10325–29 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10973498 | pmc = 27023 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.190329997 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...9710325P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 in North American [[feedlot]] cattle herds ranges from 0 to 60%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23405204&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeon SJ, Elzo M, DiLorenzo N, Lamb GC, Jeong KC | title = Evaluation of animal genetic and physiological factors that affect the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in cattle | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e55728 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23405204 | pmc = 3566006 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0055728 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...855728J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some cattle may also be so-called “super-shedders” of the bacterium. Super-shedders may be defined as cattle exhibiting rectoanal junction colonization and excreting &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;3 to 4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; feces. Super-shedders have been found to constitute a small proportion of the cattle in a feedlot (&lt;10%) but they may account for &gt;90% of all ''E. coli'' O157:H7 excreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chase-Topping M, Gally D, Low C, Matthews L, Woolhouse M | title = Super-shedding and the link between human infection and livestock carriage of Escherichia coli O157 | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Transmission==
Infection with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 can come from ingestion of contaminated food or water, or oral contact with contaminated surfaces. Examples of this can be undercooked ground beef but also leafy vegetables and raw milk. Fields often get contaminated with the bacterium through irrigation processes or contaminated water naturally entering the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/health/e-coli-lettuce-explainer/index.html|title=Why deadly E. coli loves leafy greens|last=Scutti|first=Susan |work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly [[virulence|virulent]], with a low [[infectious dose]]: an inoculation of fewer than 10 to 100 [[colony-forming unit|CFU]] of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 is sufficient to cause infection, compared to over one-million CFU for other pathogenic ''E. coli'' strains.&lt;ref&gt;J.D.

==Diagnosis==
A [[stool test|stool culture]] can detect the bacterium, although it is not a routine test and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on [[sorbitol-MacConkey agar|sorbitol-MacConkey]] (SMAC) [[agar]], or the variant cefixime potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.solabia.com/solabia/produitsDiagnostic.nsf/0/27DFE62DDA44AF3AC12574C7003A6377/$file/TDS_BK147_v5.pdf |title=MACCONKEY SORBITOL AGAR (CT-SMAC) |access-date=2010-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716102617/http://www.solabia.com/solabia/produitsDiagnostic.nsf/0/27DFE62DDA44AF3AC12574C7003A6377/$file/TDS_BK147_v5.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;). On SMAC agar, O157:H7 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment sorbitol, while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of ''E. coli'' appear red. Sorbitol nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as ''E. coli'' O157:H7. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using quick ''E. coli'' DNA extraction method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fortiusbio.com/Food_Pathogen_E-coli_DNA_Extraction_Strip_Card.html |title=Quick ''E. coli'' DNA extraction filter paper card |access-date=2014-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717100350/http://www.fortiusbio.com/Food_Pathogen_E-coli_DNA_Extraction_Strip_Card.html |archive-date=2014-07-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] techniques. Newer technologies using [[fluorescent]] and [[antibody]] detection are also under development.

==Surveillance==
''E. coli'' O157:H7 infection is nationally [[reportable disease]] in the US, Great Britain, and Germany, and most US states. It is also reportable in most states of Australia including Queensland.{{cn|date=October 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/69/3/428/5146342?redirectedFrom=fulltext|title=Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
While fluid replacement and blood pressure support may be necessary to prevent death from dehydration, most patients recover without treatment in 5–10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and treatment with [[antibiotic]]s may precipitate [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walterspiel JN, Ashkenazi S, Morrow AL, Cleary TG | title = Effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on extracellular Shiga-like toxin I | journal = Infection | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–29 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1563808 | doi = 10.1007/BF01704889 | s2cid = 39513818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibiotics are thought to trigger prophage induction, and the prophages released by the dying bacteria infect other susceptible bacteria, converting them into toxin-producing forms. Antidiarrheal agents, such as [[loperamide]] (imodium), should also be avoided as they may prolong the duration of the infection.

Certain novel treatment strategies, such as the use of anti-induction strategies to prevent toxin production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keen EC | title = Paradigms of pathogenesis: targeting the mobile genetic elements of disease | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 2 | pages = 161 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23248780 | pmc = 3522046 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2012.00161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of anti-Shiga toxin antibodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tzipori S, Sheoran A, Akiyoshi D, Donohue-Rolfe A, Trachtman H | title = Antibody therapy in the management of shiga toxin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 926–41, table of contents | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15489355 | pmc = 523565 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.17.4.926-941.2004 | name-list-style = amp }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been proposed.

==Costs==
The pathogen results in an estimated 2,100 hospitalizations annually in the United States. The illness is often misdiagnosed; therefore, expensive and invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed. Patients who develop HUS often require prolonged hospitalization, [[dialysis]], and long-term followup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Berkenpas|first1=E.|last2=Millard|first2=P.|last3=Pereira da Cunha|first3=M.|date=2005-12-13|title=Detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 with langasite pure shear horizontal surface acoustic wave sensors|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|language=en|volume=21|issue=12|pages=2255–2262|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2005.11.005|pmid=16356708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Proper [[hand washing]] after using the lavatory or changing a diaper, especially among children or those with diarrhea, reduces the risk of transmission. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others and even avoiding raw milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&amp;ContentID=P02019|title=Viruses, Bacteria, and Parasites in the Digestive Tract - Health Encyclopedia - University of Rochester Medical Center|website=www.urmc.rochester.edu|access-date=2020-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[U.S.D.A.]] banned the sale of ground beef contaminated with the O157:H7 strain in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ban on E.

'''Frumenty''' (sometimes ''frumentee'', ''furmity'', ''fromity'', or ''fermenty'') was a popular dish in [[Western European]] [[medieval cuisine]]. It is a [[porridge]], a thick boiled grain dish—hence its name, which derives from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''frumentum'', &quot;grain&quot;. It was usually made with cracked [[wheat]] boiled with either [[milk]] or [[broth]] and was a [[peasant]] staple. More luxurious recipes include [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[almond]]s, [[Zante currant|currants]], [[sugar]], [[saffron]] and [[orange flower water]]. Frumenty was served with meat as a [[pottage]], traditionally with [[venison]] or even [[porpoise]] (considered a &quot;fish&quot; and therefore appropriate for [[Lent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godecookery.com/goderec/grec24.htm Frumente yn lentyn]&lt;/ref&gt;). It was also frequently used as a [[subtlety]], a dish between courses at a banquet.

==In England==
===History===
[[Florence White (writer)|Florence White]], founder of the [[English Folk Cookery Association]], wrote in ''[[Good Things in England]]'' (1932) that frumenty is England's &quot;oldest national dish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;White, Florence (1932) ''Good things in England'', London: Jonathan Cape, reprinted London:Persephone, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For several centuries, frumenty was part of the traditional Celtic Christmas meal. According to an 1822 ''Time's Telescope'', in Yorkshire, on Christmas Eve:
{{quote|Supper is served, of which one dish, from the lordly mansion to the humblest shed, is, invariably, furmety; yule cake, one of which is always made for each individual in the family, and other more substantial viands are also added. [[Poor Robin]], in his Almanack for the year 1676, (speaking of the winter quarter,) says, 'and lastly, who would but praise it, because of Christmas, when good cheer doth so abound, as if all the world were made of minced pies, plum-pudding, and furmety.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Time's Telescope for 1822, Or, a Complete Guide to the Almanack|date=1822|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAt-8Dsb6oYC|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was often eaten on [[Mothering Sunday]], the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]], i.e. late spring. On that day many servants were allowed to visit their mothers and were often served frumenty to celebrate and give them a wholesome meal to prepare them for their return journey.  The use of eggs would have been a brief respite from the Lenten fast. In Lincolnshire, frumenty was associated with [[sheep-shearing]] in June. A diarist recalled of his youth in the 1820s that &quot;almost every farmer in the village made a large quantity of frumenty on the morning they began to clip; and every child in the village was invited to partake of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James Obelkevich, Religion and Rural Society: South Lindsey 1825-1875 (Oxford, 1976), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;   A second batch, of better quality, was produced later and taken round in buckets to every house in the village.

Food historian [[Polly Russell]] describes one of the first English recipes for it in the 1390 manuscript ''[[The Forme of Cury]]'', and how this served as the inspiration for the 2013 Christmas menu at [[Dinner by Heston Blumenthal]], transforming Victorian [[workhouse]] food for paupers into modern luxurious dining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Polly|title=The history cook: frumenty|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f983f7e2-57ca-11e3-86d1-00144feabdc0|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=Financial Times|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary references===
''Frumentee'' is served with [[venison]] at a banquet in the mid-14th century North Midlands poem ''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'': &quot;Venyson with the frumentee, and fesanttes full riche / Baken mete therby one the burde sett&quot;, i.e. in modern English, &quot;Venison with the frumenty and [[pheasant]]s full rich; baked meat by it on the table set&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(334-5)&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish also appears, likewise paired with venison, at the New Year feast in the Middle English poem known as ''The [[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'' (c.1400): &quot;Flesh flourisht of fermison, with frumentee noble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Death of King Arthur: A New Verse Translation.'' Trans. Simon Armitage. New York: W. W. Norton, 2012. Line 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dish, described as 'furmity' and served with fruit and a slug of [[rum]] added under the counter, plays a role in the plot of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]''. It is also mentioned in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' as a food that snapdragon flies live on. Snapdragon was a popular game at Christmas, and Carroll’s mention of frumenty shows it was known to him as a holiday food.

===Recipes===
[[Steve Roud]], librarian and folklorist, compiled a compendium of ''The English Year'' including three recipes for frumenty.&lt;ref&gt;Roud, Steve (2006) ''The English Year''{{ISBN|978-0-141-02106-5}}; p.536&lt;/ref&gt; They show considerable variation with place and time.
* 1 : ''The typical method of preparation was to [[parboil]] whole grains of wheat in water, then strain off and boil in milk, sweeten the boiled product with sugar, and flavour with [[cinnamon]] and other spices.''
* 2 : ''Take clean wheat and bray it'' (beat it into small pieces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nares|first1=Robert|title=A Glossary: Or, Collection of Words, Phrases, Names, and Allusions to Customs, Proverbs, &amp;c., which Have Been Thought to Require Illustration, in the Works of English Authors, Particularly Shakespeare, and His Contemporaries|date=1822|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvdBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=bray+it+in+a+mortar&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] well that the hulls go all off, '' (this means that the [[Wheat#Hulled versus free-threshing wheat|hulls]] are broken off) ''and seethe'' (boil) '' it till it burst, and take it up'' (drain it by taking it out of the water) ''and let it cool; and take fair fresh broth and sweet milk of almonds, or sweet milk of [[Cattle|kine]] '' (cow's milk) ''and temper it all, and take yolks of eggs. Boil it a little and set it down and mess it forth'' (&quot;mess&quot; here in the sense of &quot;plate and serve to table&quot;, the same root as naval [[mess]]) ''with fat venison and fresh mutton.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Douce 257&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3 : ''[[Somerset]]-[[Wiltshire]]: About forty years ago '' (from an unspecified date) ''country women in shawls and sun bonnets used to come to the market at [[Weston-super-Mare]] in little carts carrying little basins of new wheat boiled to a jelly, which was put into a large pot with milk, eggs, and [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]], and was lightly cooked; the resulting mixture was poured into pie-dishes and served on mid-Lent Sunday and during the ensuing week. Frumenty is still prepared at [[Devizes]] for [[Mothering Sunday]]''
A healthy dose of [[distilled beverage|spirit]] is often mentioned as accompanying the frumenty.

==Elsewhere==
A dish made with boiled cracked wheat and soured milk was made in [[Ancient Iran (Persia)|antiquity]] in Persia, and is still used, often as the basis for a soup, in Greece and Cyprus (as ''trahanas''), and in Turkey (''[[tarhana]]''). [[Kutia]] is an Eastern European dish of a similar recipe.

An '''L-system''' or '''Lindenmayer system''' is a [[wikt:parallel|parallel]] [[rewriting system]] and a type of [[formal grammar]]. An L-system consists of an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be used to make [[string (computer science)|string]]s, a collection of [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial &quot;[[axiom]]&quot; string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by [[Aristid Lindenmayer]], a Hungarian theoretical [[biologist]] and [[botanist]] at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenmayer|first=Aristid|date=March 1968|title=Mathematical models for cellular interactions in development II. Simple and branching filaments with two-sided inputs|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=300–315|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(68)90080-5|pmid=5659072|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of [[plant development]]. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Rozenberg and Arto Salomaa. The mathematical theory of L systems (Academic Press, New York, 1980). {{ISBN|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to generate self-similar [[fractal]]s.

==Origins==
[[File:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|'Weeds', generated using an L-system in 3D.]]
As a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of [[bacteria]], such as the cyanobacteria ''[[Anabaena|Anabaena catenula]]''. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.&lt;ref name = &quot;NKS note a&quot;&gt;''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' [https://wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-5--history-of-substitution-systems/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==L-system structure==
The [[recursion|recursive]] nature of the L-system rules leads to [[self-similarity]] and thereby, [[fractal]]-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system.   Plant models and natural-looking organic forms are easy to define, as by increasing the recursion level the form slowly 'grows' and becomes more complex. Lindenmayer systems are also popular in the generation of [[artificial life]].

L-system grammars are very similar to the [[semi-Thue grammar]] (see [[Chomsky hierarchy]]).  L-systems are now commonly known as ''parametric'' L systems, defined as a [[tuple]]

:'''G''' = (''V'', ω, ''P''),

where

* '''V''' (the ''alphabet'') is a set of symbols containing both elements that can be replaced (''variables'') and those which cannot be replaced (&quot;constants&quot; or &quot;terminals&quot;)
* '''ω''' (''start'', ''axiom'' or ''initiator'') is a string of symbols from '''V''' defining the initial state of the system
* '''P''' is a set of ''[[Production (computer science)|production rules]]'' or ''productions'' defining the way variables can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. A production consists of two strings, the ''predecessor'' and the ''successor''. For any symbol A which is a member of the set V which does not appear on the left hand side of a production in P, the identity production A → A is assumed; these symbols are called ''constants'' or ''terminals''. (See [[Law of identity]]).

The rules of the L-system grammar are applied iteratively starting from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a [[formal language]] generated by a [[formal grammar]], which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would quite simply generate a language, rather than an L-system. {{clarify|reason=I would like to see some more clarification among the terms &quot;L-system,&quot; &quot;formal language,&quot; and &quot;formal grammar.&quot; I understand that the logical difference between L-systems and a formal grammar is whether they use as many rules as possible per iteration or not, but I'm not exactly sure what the ramifications are from this statement. This is not my field to be able to explain. |date=December 2015}}Thus, L-systems are strict subsets of languages.{{clarify|reason=Are L-system languages or not? The last sentence state that they are, while the sentence just before seems to differentiate between languages and L-systems.|date=January 2014}}

An L-system is ''context-free'' if each production rule refers only to an individual symbol and not to its neighbours. Context-free L-systems are thus specified by a [[context-free grammar]]. If a rule depends not only on a single symbol but also on its neighbours, it is termed a ''context-sensitive'' L-system.

If there is exactly one production for each symbol, then the L-system is said to be ''deterministic'' (a deterministic context-free L-system is popularly called a ''[[D0L system]]''). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a ''stochastic'' L-system.

Using L-systems for generating graphical images requires that the symbols in the model refer to elements of a drawing on the computer screen. For example, the program ''[[Fractint]]'' uses [[turtle graphics]] (similar to those in the [[Logo programming language]]) to produce screen images. It interprets each constant in an L-system model as a turtle command.

==Examples of L-systems==

===Example 1: Algae===
Lindenmayer's original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.

:'''variables''' :   A B
:'''constants''' :   none
:'''axiom'''     :   A
:'''rules'''     :   (A → AB), (B → A)

which produces:

:     ''n'' = 0 : A
:     ''n'' = 1 : AB
:     ''n'' = 2 : ABA
:     ''n'' = 3 : ABAAB
:     ''n'' = 4 : ABAABABA
:     ''n'' = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB
:     ''n'' = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA
:     ''n'' = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB

==== Example 1: Algae, explained ====
 n=0:               A             start (axiom/initiator)
                   / \
 n=1:             A   B           the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A → AB), rule (B → A) couldn't be applied
                 /|     \
 n=2:           A B      A        former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A
              / | |       | \
 n=3:         A B A       A B     note all A's producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...
            / | | | \     | \ \
 n=4:       A B A A B     A B A   ... into an A one generation later, starting to spawn/repeat/recurse then

The result is the sequence of [[Fibonacci word]]s. If we count the length of each string, we obtain the famous [[Fibonacci sequence]] of numbers (skipping the first 1, due to our choice of axiom):

:    1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55 89 ...

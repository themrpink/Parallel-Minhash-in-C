* Techniques known since the 1940s and used in military communication systems since the 1950s &quot;spread&quot; a radio signal over a wide frequency range several magnitudes higher than minimum requirement. The core principle of spread spectrum is the use of noise-like carrier waves, and, as the name implies, bandwidths much wider than that required for simple point-to-point communication at the same data rate.
* Resistance to [[radio jamming|jamming]] (interference). Direct sequence (DS) is good at resisting continuous-time narrowband jamming, while frequency hopping (FH) is better at resisting pulse jamming. In DS systems, narrowband jamming affects detection performance about as much as if the amount of jamming power is spread over the whole signal bandwidth, where it will often not be much stronger than background noise.  By contrast, in narrowband systems where the signal bandwidth is low, the received signal quality will be severely lowered if the jamming power happens to be concentrated on the signal bandwidth.
* Resistance to [[eavesdropping]].  The spreading sequence (in DS systems) or the frequency-hopping pattern (in FH systems) is often unknown by anyone for whom the signal is unintended, in which case it obscures the signal and reduces the chance of an adversary making sense of it. Moreover, for a given noise [[power spectral density]] (PSD), spread-spectrum systems require the same amount of energy per bit before spreading as narrowband systems and therefore the same amount of power if the bitrate before spreading is the same, but since the signal power is spread over a large bandwidth, the signal PSD is much lower &amp;mdash; often significantly lower than the noise PSD &amp;mdash; so that the adversary may be unable to determine whether the signal exists at all. However, for mission-critical applications, particularly those employing commercially available radios, spread-spectrum radios do not provide adequate security unless, at a minimum, long nonlinear spreading sequences are used and the messages are encrypted. 
* Resistance to [[fading]].  The high bandwidth occupied by spread-spectrum signals offer some frequency diversity; i.e., it is unlikely that the signal will encounter severe [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] fading over its whole bandwidth. In direct-sequence systems, the signal can be detected by using a [[rake receiver]].
* Multiple access capability, known as [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) or code-division multiplexing (CDM).  Multiple users can transmit simultaneously in the same frequency band as long as they use different spreading sequences.

==Invention of frequency hopping==
{{further|Frequency-hopping spread spectrum}}

The idea of trying to protect and avoid interference in radio transmissions dates back to the beginning of radio wave signaling. In 1899 [[Guglielmo Marconi]] experimented with frequency-selective reception in an attempt to minimize interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;kahn&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=35ClAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Marconi+1899 David Kahn, How I Discovered World War II's Greatest Spy and Other Stories of Intelligence and Code, CRC Press - 2014, pages 157-158]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Frequency-hopping]] was adopted by the German radio company [[Telefunken]] and also described in part of a 1903 US patent by [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Rothman, Random Paths to Frequency Hopping, American Scientist, January-February 2019

The commission did, however, see fit to grant me 5,000 ''[[złoty]]ch'' for executing a model and as encouragement to further work.&quot; Cited in [[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War II'', 1984, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; showed up in a patent in the 1930s by Willem Broertjes ({{US Patent|1,869,659}}, issued Aug. 2, 1932), and in the top-secret [[US Army Signal Corps]] [[World War II]] communications system named [[SIGSALY]].

During World War II, [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]] actress [[Hedy Lamarr]] and avant-garde [[composer]] [[George Antheil]] developed an intended jamming-resistant radio guidance system for use in Allied [[torpedo]]es, patenting the device under [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2292387 US Patent 2,292,387] &quot;Secret Communications System&quot; on August 11, 1942. Their approach was unique in that frequency coordination was done with paper player piano rolls - a novel approach which was never put into practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Ben-Menahem, Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2009, pages 4527-4530&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clock signal generation ==
{{ref improve section|date=January 2020}}
[[Image:Aaronia Spectrum Analyzer Software.jpg|thumb|Spread spectrum of a modern switching power supply (heating up period) incl. waterfall diagram over a few minutes. Recorded with a NF-5030 EMC-Analyzer]]
Spread-spectrum clock generation (SSCG) is used in some [[synchronous circuit|synchronous digital systems]], especially those containing microprocessors, to reduce the spectral density of the [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) that these systems generate.  A synchronous digital system is one that is driven by a [[clock signal]] and, because of its periodic nature, has an unavoidably narrow frequency spectrum.  In fact, a perfect clock signal would have all its energy concentrated at a single frequency (the desired clock frequency) and its harmonics.  Practical synchronous digital systems radiate electromagnetic energy on a number of narrow bands spread on the clock frequency and its harmonics, resulting in a frequency spectrum that, at certain frequencies, can exceed the regulatory limits for electromagnetic interference (e.g. those of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] in the United States, [[JEITA]] in Japan and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] in Europe).

Spread-spectrum clocking avoids this problem by using one of the methods previously described to reduce the peak radiated energy and, therefore, its electromagnetic emissions and so comply with [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) regulations.

It has become a popular technique to gain regulatory approval because it requires only simple equipment modification. It is even more popular in portable electronics devices because of faster clock speeds and increasing integration of high-resolution LCD displays into ever  smaller devices. As these devices are designed to be lightweight and inexpensive, traditional passive, electronic measures to reduce EMI, such as capacitors or metal shielding, are not viable. [[Active EMI reduction]] techniques such as spread-spectrum clocking are needed in these cases.

However, spread-spectrum clocking, like other kinds of [[dynamic frequency change]], can also create challenges for designers. Principal among these is clock/data misalignment, or [[clock skew]]. Consequently, an ability to disable spread-spectrum clocking in computer systems is considered useful.

Note that this method does not reduce total [[radiation|radiated]] energy, and therefore systems are not necessarily less likely to cause interference. Spreading energy over a larger bandwidth effectively reduces electrical and magnetic readings within narrow bandwidths. Typical [[measuring receiver]]s used by EMC testing laboratories divide the electromagnetic spectrum into frequency bands approximately 120&amp;nbsp;kHz wide.&lt;ref&gt;American National Standard for Electromagnetic Noise and Field Strength Instrumentation, 10 Hz to 40 GHz—Specifications, ANSI C63.2-1996, Section 8.2 Overall Bandwidth&lt;/ref&gt; If the system under test were to radiate all its energy in a narrow bandwidth, it would register a large peak. Distributing this same energy into a larger bandwidth prevents systems from putting enough energy into any one narrowband to exceed the statutory limits. The usefulness of this method as a means to reduce real-life interference problems is often debated, as it is perceived that spread-spectrum clocking hides rather than resolves higher radiated energy issues by simple exploitation of loopholes in EMC legislation or certification procedures. This situation results in electronic equipment sensitive to narrow bandwidth(s) experiencing much less interference, while those with broadband sensitivity, or even operated at other higher frequencies (such as a radio receiver tuned to a different station), will experience more interference.

FCC certification testing is often completed with the spread-spectrum function enabled in order to reduce the measured emissions to within acceptable legal limits.  However, the spread-spectrum functionality may be disabled by the user in some cases. As an example, in the area of personal computers, some [[BIOS]] writers include the ability to disable spread-spectrum clock generation as a user setting, thereby defeating the object of the EMI regulations. This might be considered a [[loophole]], but is generally overlooked as long as spread-spectrum is enabled by default.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2019}}

In [[telecommunications]], '''squelch''' is a [[Telecommunication circuit|circuit]] function that acts to suppress the [[sound reproduction|audio]] (or [[video]]) output of a [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] in the absence of a strong input [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual |edition=3rd |page=[https://archive.org/details/TheARRLHamRadioLicenseManual/page/n168 123] |publisher=American Radio Relay League |url=https://archive.org/details/TheARRLHamRadioLicenseManual| access-date=September 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, squelch is a specialized type of [[noise gate]] designed to suppress weak signals. Squelch is used in [[two-way radio]]s and VHF/UHF [[radio scanner]]s to eliminate the sound of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] when the radio is not receiving a desired transmitter. 

==Carrier squelch==
A '''carrier squelch''' or '''noise squelch''' is the most simple variant of all. It operates strictly on the [[signal strength]], such as when a [[television]] [[Silence|mute]]s the audio or blanks the video on &quot;empty&quot; [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]], or when a [[walkie-talkie]] mutes the audio when no signal is present. In some designs, the squelch threshold is preset. For example, television squelch settings are usually preset. Receivers in [[base station]]s, or [[repeater]]s at remote mountain top sites, are usually not adjustable remotely from the control point.

In [[two-way radio]]s (also known as [[radiotelephone]]s), the received signal level required to unsquelch (un-mute) the receiver may be fixed or adjustable with a knob or a sequence of button presses. Typically the operator will adjust the control until noise is heard, and then adjust in the opposite direction until the noise is squelched.  At this point, a weak signal will unsquelch the receiver and be heard by the operator.  Further adjustment will increase the level of signal required to unsquelch the receiver. 

A typical [[Frequency modulation|FM]] two-way radio carrier squelch circuit is noise-operated. To minimize the effects of voice audio on squelch operation, the audio from the receiver's detector is passed through a [[high-pass filter]], typically passing 4,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (4&amp;nbsp;kHz) and above, leaving only high frequency noise. The squelch control adjusts the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of an [[amplifier]] which varies the level of the noise coming out of the filter. This noise is [[rectifier|rectified]], producing a [[Direct current|DC voltage]] when [[Electronic noise|noise]] is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage is reduced and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage, as a &quot;signal present&quot; indication; for example, in a [[repeater]] the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter. Squelch can be ''opened'' (turned off), which allows all signals to be heard, including radio frequency noise on the receiving frequency. This can be useful when trying to hear distant or otherwise weak signals, for example in [[DXing]].


==Tone squelch and selective calling==
{{main|Selective calling}}

Tone squelch, or another form of selective calling, is sometimes used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (''co-channel'' users), selective calling addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receiver audio for any signal, the audio turns on only in the presence of the correct selective calling code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. Selective calling locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).

In non-critical uses, selective calling can also be used to hide the presence of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present, and will still degrade system performance, but by using selective calling the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.

Four different techniques are commonly used. Selective calling can be regarded as a form of [[in-band signaling]].

===CTCSS===
{{main|Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System}}

'''CTCSS''' (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System) continuously superimposes any one of about 50 low-pitch audio [[pitch (music)|tone]]s on the transmitted signal, ranging from 67 to 254 [[Hertz|Hz]]. The original tone set was 10, then 32 tones, and has been expanded even further over the years. CTCSS is often called ''PL tone'' (for ''Private Line'', a [[trademark]] of [[Motorola]]), or simply ''tone squelch''. [[General Electric]]'s implementation of CTCSS is called ''Channel Guard'' (or ''CG''). [[RCA|RCA Corporation]] used the name ''Quiet Channel'', or ''QC''. There are many other company-specific names used by radio vendors to describe compatible options. Any CTCSS system that has compatible tones is interchangeable. Old and new radios with CTCSS and radios across manufacturers are compatible.

===SelCall===
{{main|Selcall}}

'''Selcall''' (Selective Calling) transmits a burst of up to five in-band audio tones at the beginning of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called &quot;tone burst&quot;) is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called &quot;Tone Burst&quot;). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two-tone system was devised—one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a &quot;1+1&quot; system). Motorola later marketed a system called &quot;Quik-Call&quot; that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a &quot;2+2&quot; system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the USA. Later selective call systems used paging system technology that made use of a burst of five sequential tones.

'''DCS''' (Digital-Coded Squelch), generically known as ''CDCSS'' (Continuous Digital-Coded Squelch System), was designed as the digital replacement for CTCSS. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, the same DCS code is used in a group of radios. DCS is also referred to as ''Digital Private Line'' (or ''DPL''), another trademark of Motorola, and likewise, General Electric's implementation of DCS is referred to as ''Digital Channel Guard'' (or ''DCG''). DCS is also called ''DTCS'' (Digital Tone Code Squelch) by [[Icom Incorporated|Icom]], and other names by other manufacturers. Radios with DCS options are generally compatible, provided the radio's encoder-decoder will use the same code as radios in the existing system.

DCS adds a 134.4 [[bits per second|bps]] (sub-audible) bitstream to the transmitted audio. The code word is a 23-bit [[Binary_Golay_code|Golay]] (23,12) code which has the ability to detect and correct errors of 3 or fewer bits. The word consists of 12 data bits followed by 11 check bits. The last 3 data bits are a fixed '001', this leaves 9 code bits (512 possibilities) which are conventionally represented as a 3-digit [[octal]] number. Note that the first bit transmitted is the LSB, so the code is &quot;backwards&quot; from the transmitted bit order. Only 83 of the 512 possible codes are available, to prevent falsing due to alignment collisions.

DCS tones are standardized by the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] with the following 83 tones being found in their most recent standard, however, some systems use non-standard tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|title=Land Mobile FM or PM – Communications Equipment – Measurement and Performance Standards, TIA-603-E|page=10|institution=[[Telecommunications Industry Association]] (TIA)|publication-date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===XTCSS===
'''XTCSS''' is the newest signalling technique, and provides 99 codes with the added advantage of &quot;silent operation&quot;. XTCSS-fitted radios are purposed to enjoy more privacy and flexibility of operation. XTCSS is implemented as a combination of CTCSS and in-band signalling.

==Uses==
{{howto|section|date=August 2012}}
Squelch was invented first and is still in wide use in two-way radio, especially in the [[amateur radio]] world. Squelch of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal, which is used to keep commercial and [[amateur radio repeater]]s from continually [[transmitting]]. Since a carrier squelch receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal (noise, etc.), CTCSS is often used as well, as it avoids false keyups. Use of CTCSS is especially helpful on congested frequencies or on frequency bands prone to [[Skip (radio)|skip]] and during band openings.

It is a bad idea to use any coded squelch system to hide co-channel transmitter interference issues in systems with life-safety or public-safety uses such as police, fire, search and rescue or ambulance company dispatching. Adding tone or digital squelch to a radio system does not solve interference issues, it just covers them up. The presence of interfering signals should be corrected rather than masked. Interfering signals masked by tone squelch will produce apparently random missed messages. The intermittent nature of interfering signals will make the problem difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot. Users will not understand why they cannot hear a call, and will lose confidence in their radio system.

Professional [[wireless microphone]]s use squelch to avoid reproducing noise when the receiver does not receive enough signal from the microphone. Most professional models have adjustable squelch, usually set with a screwdriver adjustment or front-panel control on the receiver.

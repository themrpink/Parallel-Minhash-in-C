The leaves are also used by the [[Adelgidae|woolly conifer aphid]] ''[[Adelges cooleyi]]''; this 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm long [[Sap (plant)|sap]]-sucking [[insect]] is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white &quot;fluff spots&quot; of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among [[Lepidoptera]], apart from some that feed on ''Pseudotsuga'' in general (see there) the [[gelechiid moth]]s ''Chionodes abella'' and ''C. periculella'' as well as the cone scale-eating [[tortrix moth]] ''[[Cydia illutana]]'' have been recorded specifically on ''P. menziesii''.

The coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.

[[Poriol]] is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by ''P. menziesii'' in reaction to infection by ''[[Poria weirii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barton GM|year=1972|title=New C-methylflavanones from Douglas-fir|journal=Phytochemistry|volume=11|issue=1|pages=426–429|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(00)90036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The species is extensively used in [[forestry]] as a [[plantation]] tree for softwood [[timber]]. The timber is used for joinery, veneer, flooring and construction due to its strength, hardness and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wood-database.com/douglas-fir/|title=Douglas-Fir |work=Wood Database|access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] throughout Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.62.154.38/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Pseudotsuga&amp;SPECIES_XREF=menziesii&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK=|title=Distribution of Douglas-fir|publisher=Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina and Chile (called ''Pino Oregón''). In New Zealand it is considered to be an invasive species, called a [[wilding conifer]], and subject to control measures.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The species has ornamental value in large parks and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=6316|title=''Pseudotsuga menziesii '' |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buds have been used to flavor [[eau de vie]], a clear, colorless fruit brandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/dining/15pour.html|title=An Orchard in a Bottle, at 80 Proof|first=Eric|last=Asimov|author-link=Eric Asimov|date=August 15, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native Hawaiian]]s built ''waʻa kaulua'' ([[Outrigger canoe|double-hulled canoes]]) from coast Douglas-fir logs that had [[Driftwood|drifted]] ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pseudotsuga_menziesii_menziesii.php|title=''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

The Hawaiians, of course, did not log the trees; they had to rely on driftwood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas-fir has been commonly used as a [[Christmas tree]] since the 1920s, and the trees are typically grown on plantations.&lt;ref name=christmas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realchristmastrees.org/dnn/Education/Tree-Varieties/DouglasFir|title=Douglas-Fir|publisher=National Christmas Tree Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas-fir pine leaves can be used to make [[pine needle tea|pine-needle tea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.growforagecookferment.com/foraging-for-pine-needles/|title=Foraging for Pine Needles (and other conifer needles)|date=December 23, 2015|website=Grow Forage Cook Ferment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different Native American groups used the bark, resin, and pine needles to make herbal treatments for various diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_psme.pdf |title=Douglas Fir |access-date=2020-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''glauca''''', or '''Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir''', is an [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|conifer]] native to the interior [[mountain]]ous regions of western North America, from central [[British Columbia]] and southwest [[Alberta]] in Canada southward through the United States to the far north of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008). ''Douglas-fir: &quot;Pseudotsuga menzesii&quot;'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg {{cite web |url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44736 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604021155/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44736 |archivedate=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The range is continuous in the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] south to eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]], eastern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], western and south-central [[Montana]] and western [[Wyoming]], but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to &quot;[[sky island]]s&quot; on the higher mountains in [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], with only very isolated small populations in eastern [[Nevada]], westernmost [[Texas]], and northern Mexico. It occurs from 600&amp;nbsp;m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000&amp;nbsp;m, rarely 3,200&amp;nbsp;m, in the south. Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related [[coast Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), and to the south, it is replaced by [[Mexican Douglas-fir]] in high mountains as far south as [[Oaxaca (state)|Oaxaca]].

Some botanists have further split Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir into two varieties,&lt;ref&gt;Dallimore, W., &amp; Jackson, A. B. (1966). ''A Handbook of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae'', 4th ed. Arnold, London.&lt;/ref&gt; but these are not widely acknowledged and have only limited support from genetic testing.&lt;ref name=newtrees /&gt;&lt;ref name=li /&gt;&lt;ref name=gugger /&gt;

==Characteristics==
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a large [[tree]], typically reaching {{convert|35|–|45|m|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, with exceptional specimens known to {{convert|67|m|abbr=on}} tall, and {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The [[bark (biology)|bark]] on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick ({{convert|3|–|6|cm|frac=4|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.

[[File:2013-07-14 09 27 54 Douglas fir foliage along Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage]]
The shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as [[fir]] shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The [[bud]]s are a distinctive narrow conic shape, {{convert|3|–|6|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, {{convert|2|–|3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad [[stomata]]l patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.

The male ([[pollen]]) cones are {{convert|2|–|3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and are typically restricted to, or more abundant on, lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.

[[Image:Pseudotsuga glauca cones.jpg|right|thumb|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones&lt;br/&gt;Left: [[Shuswap Lake]], [[British Columbia]], Canada&lt;br/&gt;Right: [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Arizona]], U.S.]]

The mature female [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are pendent, {{convert|4|–|7|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|3|–|4|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5–7 months later. The seeds are {{convert|5|–|6|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|–|4|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} broad, with a {{convert|12|–|15|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2–11&amp;nbsp;years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.

==Growth==
[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii Thompson-Nicola BC.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas-fir, [[British Columbia]]]]
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=J.|author2=Marshall, J.D. |author3=Jaquish, B.C. |title=Genetic differentiation in carbon isotope discrimination and gas exchange in ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''|journal=Oecologia|year=1993|volume=93|issue=1|pages=80–87|doi=10.1007/BF00321195|pmid=28313778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rehfeldt|first=G.E.|title=Ecological adaptations in Douglas-Fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''glauca''): a synthesis|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|year=1989|volume=28|issue=3–4|pages=203–215|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(89)90004-2|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258535/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Root]] morphology is variable, but when unimpeded, a [[taproot]] forms within several years. &quot;Platelike&quot; root morphologies occur where growth is impeded. The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are &quot;long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin&quot;. Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.

Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12–15 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and [[gravity]]. In western [[Montana]] clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} uphill from their source, but seedfall between {{convert|180|–|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in [[clearcutting|clearcuts]] beyond {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources {{convert|1|–|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, [[chipmunk]]s, and [[squirrel]]s. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of [[ponderosa pine]].

==Longevity==
The oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in [[New Mexico]]. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.

In the dry-belt forests of central [[British Columbia]], ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.

==Pathology==
It is affected by the diseases ''[[Phaeolus schweinitzii]]'', ''[[Armillaria]]'', ''[[Phellinus weirii]]'', ''[[Fomes annosus]]'', [[dwarf mistletoe]], [[Dasyscypha canker]] and [[Rhabdocline pseudotsugae|Rhabdocline needle cast]].&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patterson |first1=Patricia A. |title=Field Guide to the Forest Plants of Northern Idaho |url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr180.pdf |date=1985 |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insects==
It attracts the [[Dendroctonus pseudotsugae|Douglas fir beetle]], [[Choristoneura freemani|western budworm]] and [[tussock moth]].&lt;ref name=USDA/&gt;

==Ecology==
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within [[bunchgrass]] communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.
[[File:USA 10638 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], Utah]]
In spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) [[elk]] browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain [[lodgepole pine]], [[subalpine fir]], [[western larch]], or [[grand fir]] with high canopy cover.

In parts of [[Yellowstone National Park]], elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at {{convert|1|–|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]]. [[Moose]] winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.

[[Chipmunk]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, and [[shrew]]s eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. [[American marten]] commonly den in hollow logs.

Numerous species of [[songbird]]s extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the [[Clark's nutcracker]], [[black-capped chickadee]], [[mountain chickadee]], [[boreal chickadee]], [[red-breasted nuthatch]], [[pygmy nuthatch]], [[red crossbill]], [[Two-barred crossbill|white-winged crossbill]], [[dark-eyed junco]], and [[pine siskin]]. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. [[Woodpecker]]s commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. [[Blue grouse]] forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.

The Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a [[Eriosomatidae|woolly]] [[aphid]], ''[[Gall Adelgid|Adelges cooleyi]]'' that also infects the [[Engelmann spruce]] to complete its [[Gall Adelgid#Life cycle|lifecycle]].

==Uses==
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, [[plywood]], pulp, dimensional [[lumber]], railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include &quot;machine-stress-rated lumber&quot;, glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.

'''Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRS|FBA|FSA}} (10 September 1890&amp;nbsp;– 22 July 1976) was a British [[archaeologist]] and officer in the [[British Army]]. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the [[National Museum of Wales]] and [[London Museum]], Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], and the founder and Honorary Director of the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]] in [[London]], in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects.

Born in [[Glasgow]] to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in [[Yorkshire]] before moving to London in his teenage years. After studying [[classics]] at [[University College London]] (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] period. During [[World War I]] he volunteered for service in the [[Royal Artillery]], being stationed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where he rose to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at the Roman forts of [[Segontium]], [[Y Gaer]], and [[Isca Augusta]] with the aid of his first wife, [[Tessa Wheeler]]. Influenced by the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]], Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphic context]] required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the &quot;[[Wheeler-Kenyon method|Wheeler method]]&quot;. In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal [[University of London]], adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at [[Lydney Park]] and [[Verulamium]] and the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[Hillforts in Britain|hill fort]] of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]]. During [[World War II]], he re-joined the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] and rose to the rank of [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]], serving in the [[North African Campaign]] and then the [[Allied invasion of Italy]]. In 1944 he was appointed Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, through which he oversaw excavations of sites at [[Harappa]], [[Arikamedu]], and [[Brahmagiri archaeological site|Brahmagiri]], and implemented reforms to the subcontinent's archaeological establishment. Returning to Britain in 1948, he divided his time between lecturing for the Institute of Archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to Pakistan's government. In later life, his popular books, [[cruise ship]] lectures, and appearances on radio and television, particularly the [[BBC]] series ''[[Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?]]'', helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience. Appointed Honorary Secretary of the [[British Academy]], he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects, and was appointed British representative for several [[UNESCO]] projects.

Wheeler is recognised as one of the most important British archaeologists of the twentieth century, responsible for successfully encouraging British public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording. Furthermore, he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of South Asian archaeology. However, many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted and he was often criticised for bullying colleagues and sexually harassing young women.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1890–1907===
Mortimer Wheeler was born on 10 September 1890 in the city of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=15}} He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler (''née'' Baynes).{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=15}} The son of a tea merchant based in [[Bristol]], in youth Robert had considered becoming a [[Baptist]] minister, but instead became a staunch [[Freethought|freethinker]] while studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Initially working as a lecturer in [[English literature]] Robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=15, 18}} His second wife, Emily, shared her husband's interest in English literature, and was the niece of [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], a [[Shakespeare's reputation|Shakespearean]] scholar at [[St. Andrews University]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=15}} Their marriage was emotionally strained,{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=20}} a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=19}} Within two years of their son's birth, the family moved to [[Edinburgh]], where a daughter named Amy was born.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=15}} The couple gave their two children nicknames, with Mortimer being &quot;Boberic&quot; and Amy being &quot;Totsy&quot;.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=19}}

[[File:Ilkley Moor Swastika Stone.jpg|left|thumb|250px|During childhood, Wheeler took an interest in the prehistoric carvings of Ilkley Moor.]]

When Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief [[Editorial|leader]] writer for the ''[[Newspapers of Yorkshire#Defunct newspapers|Bradford Observer]]''. The family relocated to [[Saltaire]], a village northwest of [[Bradford]], a cosmopolitan city in [[Yorkshire]], northeast England,  which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=16|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=75}} Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area's archaeology. He later wrote about discovering [[Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art in the British Isles|a late prehistoric cup-marked stone]], searching for [[stone tool|lithics]] on [[Ilkley Moor]], and digging into a [[tumulus|barrow]] on Baildon Moor.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=17, 23}} Although suffering from ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a [[maid]] up to the age of seven or eight.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=19}} Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father,{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=20}} whose company he favoured over that of other children.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=22}} His father had a keen interest in [[natural history]] and a love of fishing and shooting, rural pursuits in which he encouraged Mortimer to take part.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=18}} Robert acquired many books for his son, particularly on the subject of [[art history]],{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=18, 29}} with Wheeler loving to both read and paint.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=21}}

In 1899, Wheeler joined [[Bradford Grammar School]] shortly before his ninth birthday, where he proceeded straight to the second form.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2p=26|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=75}} In 1902 Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=26}} In 1905, Robert agreed to take over as head of the London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the ''Yorkshire Daily Observer'', and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, [[West Dulwich]].{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1y=1977|1p=623|2a1=Hawkes|2y=1982|2pp=31–32|3a1=Carr|3y=2012|3p=75}} In 1908 they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby [[Herne Hill]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=38}} Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented the [[National Gallery]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|pp=32–33}}

When disorder arose among some members of the societies, Wesley adopted giving tickets to members, with their names written by his own hand. These were renewed every three months. Those deemed unworthy did not receive new tickets and dropped out of the society without disturbance. The tickets were regarded as commendatory letters.{{sfn |Parkinson |1898}}

[[File:WesleyStatue.jpg|thumb |upright |Wesley on horseback in the courtyard of the &quot;[[New Room, Bristol |New Room]]&quot; chapel in [[Bristol]]. Bristol was Wesley's base for much of the 1740s and 1750s.]]

When the debt on a chapel became a burden, it was proposed that one in 12 members should collect offerings regularly from the 11 allotted to him. Out of this grew the Methodist class-meeting system in 1742. To keep the disorderly out of the societies, Wesley established a probationary system. He undertook to visit each society regularly in what became the quarterly visitation, or conference. As the number of societies increased, Wesley could not keep personal contact, so in 1743 he drew up a set of &quot;General Rules&quot; for the &quot;United Societies&quot;.
{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |loc=Chapter IX – Society and Class}} These were the nucleus of the Methodist ''Discipline'', still the basis.

Wesley laid the foundations of what now constitutes the [[Governance of the Methodist Church of Great Britain |organisation of the Methodist Church]]. Over time, a shifting pattern of societies, circuits, quarterly meetings, annual Conferences, classes, bands, and select societies took shape.{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |loc=Chapter IX – Society and Class}} At the local level, there were numerous societies of different sizes which were grouped into circuits to which [[Itinerant preacher |travelling preachers]] were appointed for two-year periods. Circuit officials met quarterly under a senior travelling preacher or &quot;assistant.&quot; Conferences with Wesley, travelling preachers and others were convened annually for the purpose of co-ordinating doctrine and discipline for the entire connection. Classes of a dozen or so society members under a leader met weekly for spiritual fellowship and guidance. In early years, there were &quot;bands&quot; of the spiritually gifted who consciously pursued perfection. Those who were regarded to have achieved it were grouped in select societies or bands. In 1744, there were 77 such members. There also was a category of penitents which consisted of backsliders.{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |loc=Chapter IX – Society and Class}}

[[File:Wesley's House.jpg|thumb |left |[[John Wesley's House &amp; Methodist Museum |Wesley's house]], next to Wesley's Chapel, [[City Road]], London]]

As the number of preachers and preaching-places increased, doctrinal and administrative matters needed to be discussed; so John and Charles Wesley, along with four other clergy and four lay preachers, met for consultation in London in 1744. This was the first Methodist conference; subsequently, the conference (with Wesley as its president) became the ruling body of the Methodist movement.{{sfn |Graves |2007}} Two years later, to help preachers work more systematically and societies receive services more regularly, Wesley appointed &quot;helpers&quot; to definitive [[Methodist Circuit |circuits]]. Each circuit included at least 30 appointments a month. Believing that the preacher's efficiency was promoted by his being changed from one circuit to another every year or two, Wesley established the &quot;[[Wiktionary:itinerant |itinerancy]]&quot; and insisted that his preachers submit to its rules.{{sfn |Spiak |2011}}

John Wesley had strong links with the North West of England, visiting [[Manchester]] on at least fifteen occasions between 1733 and 1790. In 1733 and 1738 he preached at [[St Ann's Church, Manchester |St Ann's Church]] and Salford Chapel, meeting with his friend [[John Clayton (divine) |John Clayton]]. In 1781 Wesley opened the Chapel on [[Oldham Street]] – part of the [[Manchester and Salford Wesleyan Methodist Mission]],{{sfn |Hindle |1975}} now the site of Manchester's Methodist Central Hall.{{sfn |Manchester City Council |2019}}

Following an illness in 1748 John Wesley was nursed by a classleader and housekeeper, Grace Murray, at an orphan house in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Taken with Grace, he invited her to travel with him to Ireland in 1749 where he believed them to be betrothed though they were never married. It has been suggested that his brother Charles Wesley objected to the engagement,{{sfn |Collins |2003}} though this is disputed. Subsequently, Grace married John Bennett, a preacher.{{sfn |Bunting |1940}}

==Ordination of ministers==
[[File:Wesley at asbury.jpg|right |thumb |Life-size statue at [[Asbury Theological Seminary]] in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]], United States]]

As the societies multiplied, they adopted the elements of an [[ecclesiology |ecclesiastical system]]. The divide between Wesley and the Church of England widened. The question of division from the Church of England was urged by some of his preachers and societies, but most strenuously opposed by his brother Charles. Wesley refused to leave the Church of England, believing that Anglicanism was &quot;with all her blemishes, [...] nearer the Scriptural plans than any other in Europe&quot;.{{sfn |Thorsen |2005 |p=97}} In 1745 Wesley wrote that he would make any concession which his conscience permitted, to live in peace with the clergy. He could not give up the doctrine of an inward and present salvation by faith itself; he would not stop preaching, nor dissolve the societies, nor end preaching by lay members. As a cleric of the [[established church]] he had no plans to go further.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}}

When, in 1746, Wesley read [[Peter King, 1st Baron King |Lord King]]'s account of the primitive church, he became convinced that [[apostolic succession]] could be transmitted through not only bishops, but also priests. He wrote that he was &quot;a scriptural ''episkopos'' as much as many men in England.&quot; Although he believed in apostolic succession, he also once called the idea of uninterrupted succession a &quot;fable&quot;.{{sfn |Holden |1870}}

Many years later, [[Edward Stillingfleet]]'s ''Irenicon'' led him to decide that [[ordination]] (and [[holy orders]]) could be valid when performed by a [[presbyter]] (priest) rather than a bishop. Nevertheless, some believe that Wesley was secretly consecrated a bishop in 1763 by [[Erasmus of Arcadia]],{{sfn |Wesleyan Methodist Magazine |1836 |ps=. Mr. Wesley thus became a Bishop, and consecrated Dr. Coke, who united himself with ... who gave it under his own hand that Erasmus was Bishop of Arcadia,&amp;nbsp;...}} and that Wesley could not openly announce his episcopal consecration without incurring the penalty of the [[Praemunire |Præmunire Act]].{{sfn |Cooke |1896 |p=145 |ps=. Dr. Peters was present at the interview, and went with and introduced Dr. Seabury to Mr. Wesley, who was so far satisfied that he would have been willingly consecrated by him in Mr. Wesley would have signed his letter of orders as bishop, which Mr. Wesley could not do without incurring the penalty of the ''Præmunire'' Act.}}

In 1784, he believed he could no longer wait for the [[Bishop of London]] to ordain someone for the American Methodists, who were without the sacraments after the [[American Revolutionary War |American War of Independence]].{{sfn |UMC of Indiana |2019}} The Church of England had been disestablished in the United States, where it had been the state church in most of the southern colonies. The Church of England had not yet appointed a United States bishop to what would become the [[Episcopal Church (United States) |Protestant Episcopal Church]] in America. Wesley ordained [[Thomas Coke (bishop) |Thomas Coke]] as [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical) |superintendent]]{{sfn |Wesley |1915 |p=264 |ps=. I have accordingly appointed Dr. Coke and Mr. Francis Asbury to be joint superintendents over our brethren in North America...}} of Methodists in the United States by the [[laying on of hands]], although Coke was already a priest in the Church of England. He also ordained [[Richard Whatcoat]] and [[Thomas Vasey]] as presbyters. Whatcoat and Vasey sailed to America with Coke. Wesley intended that Coke and [[Francis Asbury]] (whom Coke ordained as superintendent by direction of Wesley) should ordain others in the newly founded [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the United States. In 1787, Coke and Asbury persuaded the American Methodists to refer to them as bishops rather than superintendents,{{sfn |Lee |1810 |p=128 |ps=. This was the first time that our superintendents ever gave themselves the title of Bishops in the minutes. They changed the title themselves without the consent of the conference; and at the next conference they asked the preachers if the word Bishop might stand in the minutes; seeing that it was a scripture name, and the meaning of the word Bishop, was the same with that of Superintendent. Some of the preachers opposed the alteration... but a majority of the preachers agreed to let the word Bishop remain.}} overruling Wesley's objections to the change.{{sfn |Wesley |1915 |ps=. How can you, how dare you, suffer yourself to be called Bishop? I shudder, I start at the very thought! Men may call me a knave or a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel, and I am content; but they shall never, by my consent, call me Bishop! For my sake, for God's sake, for Christ's sake, put a full end to this! }}

His brother, Charles, was alarmed by the ordinations and Wesley's evolving view of the matter. He begged Wesley to stop before he had &quot;quite broken down the bridge&quot; and not embitter his [Charles'] last moments on earth, nor &quot;leave an indelible blot on our memory.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |2000}} Wesley replied that he had not separated from the church, nor did he intend to, but he must and would save as many souls as he could while alive, &quot;without being careful about what may possibly be when I die.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |1931 |loc=letter 1785b}} Although Wesley rejoiced that the Methodists in America were free, he advised his English followers to remain in the established church and he himself died within it.

==Doctrines, theology and advocacy==
[[File:John Wesley preaching in the City Chapel. Engraving by T. Bl Wellcome V0006869 (Cropped).jpg|thumb |upright=1.2 |Wesley preaching to his assistants in the City Road Chapel (now Wesley's Chapel), London. Detail of a stipple engraving by T. Blood, 1822.]]
{{Further |Wesleyan theology}}

The 20th-century Wesley scholar [[Albert Outler]] argued in his introduction to the 1964 collection ''John Wesley'' that Wesley developed his [[Christian theology |theology]]  by using a method that Outler termed the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]].{{sfn |Mellor |2003}} In this method, Wesley believed that the living core of Christianity was revealed in Scripture; and the Bible was the sole foundational source of theological development. The centrality of Scripture was so important for Wesley that he called himself &quot;a man of one book&quot;{{sfn |Craik |1916}}—meaning the Bible—although he was well-read for his day. However, he believed that [[doctrine]] had to be in keeping with Christian [[Orthodoxy |orthodox]] tradition. So, tradition was considered the second aspect of the Quadrilateral.{{sfn |Mellor |2003}}

[[File:John Wesley at St Paul's.jpg|thumb |left |upright |[[Statue of John Wesley, St Paul's Churchyard |Bronze statue of Wesley in St Paul's Churchyard]], London. A marble version exists inside [[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster]].]]

Wesley contended that a part of the theological method would involve experiential faith. In other words, truth would be vivified in personal experience of Christians (overall, not individually), if it were really truth. And every doctrine must be able to be defended rationally. He did not divorce [[faith]] from [[reason]]. Tradition, experience and reason, however, were subject always to Scripture, Wesley argued, because only there is the Word of God [[Revelation |revealed]] &quot;so far as it is necessary for our salvation.&quot;{{sfn |Patterson |1984}}

The doctrines which Wesley emphasised in his [[sermon]]s and writings are [[prevenient grace]], present personal salvation by faith, the witness of the Spirit, and [[sanctification]].{{sfn |McDonald |2012}} Prevenient grace was the theological underpinning of his belief that all persons were capable of being saved by faith in Christ. Unlike the Calvinists of his day, Wesley did not believe in [[predestination]], that is, that some persons had been elected by God for salvation and others for damnation. He understood that Christian orthodoxy insisted that salvation was only possible by the sovereign grace of God. He expressed his understanding of humanity's relationship to God as utter dependence upon God's grace. God was at work to enable all people to be capable of coming to faith by empowering humans to have actual existential freedom of response to God.

Wesley defined the witness of the Spirit as: &quot;an inward impression on the soul of believers, whereby the Spirit of God directly testifies to their spirit that they are the children of God.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |Outler |1984}} He based this doctrine upon certain Biblical passages (see Romans 8:15–16 as an example). This doctrine was closely related to his belief that salvation had to be &quot;personal.&quot; In his view, a person must ultimately believe the [[The gospel |Good News]] for himself or herself; no one could be in relation to God for another.

Sanctification he described in 1790 as the &quot;grand ''depositum'' which God has lodged with the people called 'Methodists'.&quot;{{sfn |Miller |2012}} Wesley taught that sanctification was obtainable after [[Justification (theology) |justification]] by faith, between justification and death. He did not contend for &quot;sinless perfection&quot;; rather, he contended that a Christian could be made &quot;[[Christian perfection |perfect in love]]&quot;. (Wesley studied [[Eastern Orthodox Church |Eastern Orthodoxy]] and embraced particularly the doctrine of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology) |Theosis]]'').{{sfn |McCormick |1991}} This love would mean, first of all, that a believer's motives, rather than being self-centred, would be guided by the deep desire to please God. One would be able to keep from committing what Wesley called, &quot;sin rightly so-called.&quot; By this he meant a conscious or intentional breach of God's will or laws. A person could still be able to [[sin]], but intentional or wilful sin could be avoided.{{sfn |Miller |2012}}

Secondly, to be made perfect in love meant, for Wesley, that a Christian could live with a primary guiding regard for others and their welfare. He based this on Christ's quote that the second great command is &quot;to love your neighbour as you love yourself.&quot; In his view, this orientation would cause a person to avoid any number of sins against his neighbour. This love, plus the love for God that could be the central focus of a person's faith, would be what Wesley referred to as &quot;a fulfilment of the law of Christ.&quot;

===Advocacy of Arminianism===
[[File:John Wesley by William Hamilton.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]], 1788. Currently on display in [[John Wesley's House]], City Road, London.]]

Wesley entered controversies as he tried to enlarge church practice. The most notable of his controversies was that on [[Calvinism]]. His father was of the [[Arminianism in the Church of England |Arminian]] school in the church. Wesley came to his own conclusions while in college and expressed himself strongly against the doctrines of Calvinistic election and [[reprobation]]. His system of thought has become known as [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism |Wesleyan Arminianism]], the foundations of which were laid by Wesley and fellow preacher [[John William Fletcher]].

Whitefield inclined to Calvinism. In his first tour in America, he embraced the views of the New England School of Calvinism. When in 1739 Wesley preached a sermon on ''Freedom of Grace'', attacking the Calvinistic understanding of [[predestination]] as blasphemous, as it represented &quot;God as worse than the devil,&quot; Whitefield asked him not to repeat or publish the discourse, as he did not want a dispute. Wesley published his sermon anyway. Whitefield was one of many who responded. The two men separated their practice in 1741. Wesley wrote that those who held to [[unlimited atonement]] did not desire separation, but &quot;those who held 'particular redemption' would not hear of any accommodation.&quot;{{sfn |Stevens |1858}}

[[File:Methodist George Whitefield 1714-1770.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Whitefield (depicted in an engraving) opposed Wesley's advocacy of Arminianism, though the two maintained a strained friendship.]]

Whitefield, [[Howell Harris |Harris]], [[John Cennick |Cennick]], and others, became the founders of [[Presbyterian Church of Wales |Calvinistic Methodism]]. Whitefield and Wesley, however, were soon back on friendly terms, and their friendship remained unbroken although they travelled different paths. When someone asked Whitefield if he thought he would see Wesley in heaven, Whitefield replied, &quot;I fear not, for he will be so near the eternal throne and we at such a distance, we shall hardly get sight of him.&quot;{{sfn |Wiersbe |1984}}

In 1770, the controversy broke out anew with violence and bitterness, as people's view of God related to their views of men and their possibilities. [[Augustus Toplady]], [[Daniel Rowland (preacher) |Rowland]], [[Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet |Richard Hill]] and others were engaged on one side, while Wesley and Fletcher stood on the other. Toplady was editor of ''[[The Gospel Magazine]]'', which had articles covering the controversy.

In 1778, Wesley began the publication of ''[[Wesleyan Methodist Magazine |The Arminian Magazine]]'', not, he said, to convince Calvinists, but to preserve Methodists. He wanted to teach the truth that &quot;God willeth all men to be saved.&quot;{{sfn |Gunter |2011}} A &quot;lasting peace&quot; could be secured in no other way.

===Support for abolitionism===

Later in his ministry, Wesley was a keen [[Abolitionism |abolitionist]],{{sfn |Carey |2002}}{{sfn |Carey |2003}} speaking out and writing against the [[slave trade]]. Wesley denounced slavery as &quot;the sum of all villainies,&quot; and detailed its abuses.{{sfn|Wesley|1774|p=}} He published a pamphlet on slavery, titled ''Thoughts Upon Slavery,'' in 1774.{{sfn |Wesley |1774}} He wrote, &quot;Liberty is the right of every human creature, as soon as he breathes the vital air; and no human law can deprive him of that right which he derives from the law of nature&quot;.{{sfn |Yrigoyen |1996}} Wesley influenced George Whitefield to journey to the colonies, spurring the transatlantic debate on slavery.{{sfn |Yoon |2012}} Wesley was a friend and mentor to [[John Newton]] and [[William Wilberforce]], who were also influential in the abolition of slavery in Britain.{{sfn |Valentine |1997}}

It is thanks to John Wesley's [[Abolitionism |Abolitionist]] message that a young [[African-Americans |African-American]], [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], converted to Christianity in 1777 and later founded, in 1816, the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME), in the Methodist tradition.{{sfn|ASAALH|1941|p=62}}{{sfn|EB|2020}}

===Support for women preachers===
Women had an active role in Wesley's Methodism, and were encouraged to lead classes. In 1761, he informally allowed [[Sarah Crosby]], one of his converts and a class leader, to preach.{{sfn |English |1994}} On an occasion where over 200 people attended a class she was meant to teach, Crosby felt as though she could not fulfill her duties as a class leader given the large crowd, and decided to preach instead.{{sfn |Burge |1996}}{{sfn |Jensen |2013}} She wrote to Wesley to seek his advice and forgiveness.{{sfn |Lloyd |2009 |p=33 }} He let Crosby to continue her preaching so long as she refrained from as many of the mannerisms of preaching as she could.{{sfn |Chilcote |1991 }} Between 1761 and 1771, Wesley wrote detailed instructions to Crosby and others, with specifics on what styles of preaching they could use. For instance, in 1769, Wesley allowed Crosby to give exhortations.{{sfn |Tucker |Liefeld |2010 }}

In the summer of 1771, [[Mary Bosanquet Fletcher |Mary Bosanquet]] wrote to John Wesley to defend hers and Sarah Crosby's work preaching and leading classes at her orphanage, Cross Hall.{{sfn |Chilcote |1993 |p=78}}{{sfn |Burton |2008 }} Bosanquet's letter is considered to be the first full and true defense of women's preaching in Methodism.{{sfn |Chilcote |1993 |p=78}} Her argument was that women should be able to preach when they experienced an 'extraordinary call,' or when given permission from God.{{sfn |Chilcote |1993 |p=78}}{{sfn |Lloyd |2009 |p=34}} Wesley accepted Bosanquet's argument, and formally began to allow women to preach in Methodism in 1771.{{sfn |Eason |2003 }}{{sfn |Lloyd |2009 |p=34}}

==Personality and activities==
[[File:Electrical machine designed by John Wesley, 18th c. Wellcome L0003006.jpg|thumb |left |150px |Sketch of an electrical machine designed by Wesley]]

Wesley [[Itinerant preacher |travelled widely]], generally on horseback, preaching two or three times each day. Stephen Tomkins writes that &quot;[Wesley] rode 250,000 miles, gave away 30,000 pounds, ... and preached more than 40,000 sermons... &quot;{{sfn |Oakes |2004 }} He formed societies, opened chapels, examined and commissioned preachers, administered aid charities, prescribed for the sick, helped to pioneer the use of [[electroconvulsive therapy |electric shock]] for the treatment of illness,{{sfn |Johnstone |2000 }} superintended schools and [[orphanage]]s and published his sermons.

Wesley practised a [[Christian vegetarianism |vegetarian]] diet and in later life abstained from wine for health reasons.{{sfn |Preece |2008 |p=239 |ps=. Thanks be to God, since the time I gave up flesh meals and wine I have been delivered from all physical ills.}} Wesley warned against the dangers of [[alcohol abuse]] in his famous sermon, ''The Use of Money,''{{sfn |Wesley |Jackson |1979 |loc=Sermon #50: The Use Of Money}} and in his letter to an alcoholic.{{sfn |Anderson |2001 }} In his sermon, ''On Public Diversions'', Wesley says: &quot;You see the wine when it sparkles in the cup, and are going to drink of it. I tell you there is poison in it! and, therefore, beg you to throw it away&quot;.{{sfn |Wesley |Jackson |1979 |loc=Sermon #140: On Public Diversions}} However, other materials show less concern with consumption of alcohol.{{sfn |Wesley |1931 |loc=1735, To his mother}} He encourages experimentation in the role of hops in the brewing of beer in a letter which dates from 1789.{{sfn |Wesley |1931 |loc=1789, To the Printer of the 'Bristol Gazette'}} Despite this, some Methodist churches became pioneers in the teetotal [[Temperance movement]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, and later it became ''de rigueur'' in all.

After attending a performance in Bristol Cathedral in 1758, Wesley said: &quot;I went to the cathedral to hear [[George Frideric Handel |Mr. Handel's]] ''[[Messiah (Handel) |Messiah]]''. I doubt if that congregation was ever so serious at a sermon as they were during this performance. In many places, especially several of the choruses, it exceeded my expectation.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |Emory |1835 }}

[[File:John Wesley. Stipple engraving by F. Bartolozzi after J. Zof Wellcome V0006236.jpg|thumb |Stipple engraving by [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], 1760]]

He is described as below medium height, well proportioned, strong, with a bright eye, a clear complexion, and a saintly, intellectual face.{{sfn |Carroll |1953 }} Though Wesley favoured celibacy rather than marital bond,{{sfn |Coe |1996 }}{{sfn |Lawrence |2011 }} he married very unhappily at the age of 48 to a widow, Mary Vazeille, described as &quot;a well-to-do widow and mother of four children.&quot;{{sfn |Busenitz |2013}} The couple had no children. Vazeille left him 15 years later. John Singleton writes: &quot;By 1758 she had left him – unable to cope, it is said, with the competition for his time and devotion presented by the ever-burgeoning Methodist movement. Molly, as she was known, was to return and leave him again on several occasions before their final separation.&quot;{{sfn |Busenitz |2013}} Wesley wryly reported in his journal, &quot;I did not forsake her, I did not dismiss her, I will not recall her.&quot;

In 1770, at the death of George Whitefield, Wesley wrote a memorial sermon which praised Whitefield's admirable qualities and acknowledged the two men's differences: &quot;There are many doctrines of a less essential nature ... In these we may think and let think; we may '[[agree to disagree]].' But, meantime, let us hold fast the essentials...&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |Jackson |1979 |loc=Sermon #53: On The Death of The Rev. Mr. George Whitefield}} Wesley may have been the first to use &quot;agree to disagree&quot; in print{{sfn|Martin|2019}} — in the modern sense of tolerating differences — though he himself attributed the saying to Whitefield, and it had appeared in other senses previously.

==Death==

Wesley's health declined sharply towards the end of his life and he ceased preaching. On 28 June 1790, less than a year before his death, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This day I enter into my eighty-eighth year. For above eighty-six years, I found none of the infirmities of old age: my eyes did not wax dim, neither was my natural strength abated. But last August, I found almost a sudden change. My eyes were so dim that no glasses would help me. My strength likewise now quite forsook me and probably will not return in this world.{{sfn |Williams |2012 }}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:John Wesley's Death Mask.jpg|thumb |right |Wesley's [[death mask]], exhibited in the [[Wesley's Chapel |Museum of Methodism]], London]]

Wesley died on 2 March 1791, at the age of 87. As he lay dying, his friends gathered around him, Wesley grasped their hands and said repeatedly, &quot;Farewell, farewell.&quot; At the end, he said, &quot;The best of all is, God is with us&quot;, lifted his arms and raised his feeble voice again, repeating the words, &quot;The best of all is, God is with us.&quot;{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |p=298}} He was entombed at his chapel on City Road, London.

Because of his charitable nature he died poor, leaving as the result of his life's work 135,000 members and 541 itinerant preachers under the name &quot;Methodist&quot;. It has been said that &quot;when John Wesley was carried to his grave, he left behind him a good library of books, a well-worn clergyman's gown&quot; and the Methodist Church.{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |p=298}}

==Literary work==
[[File:John Wesley's shorthand writing.jpg|thumb|Wesley's [[shorthand]] writing]]

Wesley wrote, edited or abridged some 400 publications. As well as theology he wrote about music, marriage, medicine, [[abolitionism]] and politics.{{sfn |The Methodist Church |2019 }} Wesley was a logical thinker and expressed himself clearly, concisely and forcefully in writing. His written sermons are characterised by spiritual earnestness and simplicity. They are doctrinal but not [[dogma]]tic. His ''Forty-Four Sermons'' and the ''[[Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament]]'' (1755) are Methodist doctrinal standards.{{sfn |Methodist Church (Great Britain)|2019}} Wesley was a fluent, powerful and effective preacher; he usually preached spontaneously and briefly, though occasionally at great length.

In his ''Christian Library'' (1750), he writes about [[List of Christian mystics |mystics]] such as [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Ephrem the Syrian]], [[Madame Guyon]], [[François Fénelon]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[John of Ávila]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Antoinette Bourignon]]. The work reflects the influence of [[Christian mysticism]] in Wesley's ministry from the beginning to the end,{{sfn |Wesley |Whaling |1981 |p=10}} although he ever rejected it after the failure in Georgia mission.{{sfn |Heath |2010 }}

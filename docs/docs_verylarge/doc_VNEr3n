== History ==
[[File:Papyrus Ebers.png|thumb|left|''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'' detailing treatment of asthma]]
[[File:Grimaults cigarette ad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1907 advertisement for Grimault's Indian Cigarettes, promoted as a means of relieving asthma. They contained [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] and [[cannabis]].]]
Asthma was recognized in [[ancient Egypt]] and was treated by drinking an [[incense]] mixture known as [[kyphi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manniche1999&quot;/&gt; It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by [[Hippocrates]] circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for &quot;panting&quot; forming the basis of our modern name.&lt;ref name=M38/&gt; In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions.&lt;ref name=Andrew2010/&gt; In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher [[Maimonides]] wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf |first=Fred |last=Rosner |author-link=Fred Rosner |title=The Life of Moses Maimonides, a Prominent Medieval Physician |journal=Einstein Quart J Biol Med |year=2002 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=125–28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305065423/http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the [[pathophysiology]] of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with [[A.B.C. Liniment|chloroform liniment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20747287&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thorowgood JC | title = On Bronchial Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 673 | pages = 600 | date = November 1873 | pmid = 20747287 | pmc = 2294647 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.673.600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20746575&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaskoin G | title = On the Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 587 | pages = 339 | date = March 1872 | pmid = 20746575 | pmc = 2297349 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.587.339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharmaceutical drug|Medical treatment]] in 1880 included the use of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] doses of a drug called [[pilocarpine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20749537&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkart JB | title = The Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1016 | pages = 917–8 | date = June 1880 | pmid = 20749537 | pmc = 2240555 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1016.917 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkart JB | title = The Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1017 | pages = 960–2 | date = June 1880 | pmid = 20749546 | pmc = 2240530 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1017.960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, F.

A notable and well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young [[Theodore Roosevelt#Early life and family|Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1981|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=93–108|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407004947/http://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|archive-date=2015-04-07|isbn=978-0-7432-1830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the &quot;holy seven&quot; [[psychosomatic illness]]es. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other [[talking cure]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16185365&quot;/&gt; As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16185365&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Opolski M, Wilson I | title = Asthma and depression: a pragmatic review of the literature and recommendations for future research | journal = Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health | volume = 1 | pages = 18 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16185365 | pmc = 1253523 | doi = 10.1186/1745-0179-1-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds}}
{{Contains special characters|IPA}}
A '''syllable''' is a unit of organization for a sequence of [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. It is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a [[vowel]]) with optional initial and final margins (typically, [[consonant]]s). Syllables are often considered the [[Phonology|phonological]] &quot;building blocks&quot; of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Jong|first=Kenneth|year=2003|chapter=Temporal constraints and characterising syllable structuring|editor1-last=Local|editor1-first=John|editor1-link=John Local|editor2-last=Ogden|editor2-first=Richard|editor3-last=Temple|editor3-first=Rosalind|title=Phonetic Interpretation: Papers in Laboratory Phonology VI|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=253–268|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511486425.015|isbn=978-0-521-82402-6}} Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; They can influence the [[Isochrony|rhythm]] of a language, its [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], its [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metre]] and its [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns. Speech can usually be divided up into a whole number of syllables: for example, the word ''ignite'' is composed of two syllables: ''ig'' and ''nite''.

[[Syllabic writing]] began several hundred years before the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|first letters]]. The earliest recorded syllables are on tablets written around 2800 BC in the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]]. This shift from [[pictogram]]s to syllables has been called &quot;the most important advance in the [[history of writing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Short History of the World (Geoffrey Blainey)|A Short History of the World]]'', p.87, citing J.T. Hooker et al., ''Reading the Past: Ancient Writing from Cuneiform to the Alphabet'', [[British Museum]], 1993, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A word that consists of a single syllable (like [[English language|English]] ''dog'') is called a '''monosyllable''' (and is said to be ''monosyllabic''). Similar terms include '''disyllable''' (and ''disyllabic''; also ''bisyllable'' and ''bisyllabic'') for a word of two syllables; '''trisyllable''' (and ''trisyllabic'') for a word of three syllables; and '''polysyllable''' (and ''polysyllabic''), which may refer either to a word of more than three syllables or to any word of more than one syllable.

==Etymology==
''Syllable'' is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] variation of [[Old French]] ''sillabe'', from [[Latin]] ''syllaba'', from [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|συλλαβή}} ''syllabḗ'' ({{IPA-grc|sylːabɛ̌ː}}).&lt;!-- This is actually a Classical-era, not Koine, pronunciation, because Help:IPA/Greek only supports Classical pronunciation at the moment. --&gt; {{lang|grc|συλλαβή}} means &quot;what is taken together&quot;, referring to letters that are taken together to make a single sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|syllable|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|grc|συλλαβή}} is a verbal noun from the verb {{lang|grc|συλλαμβάνω}} ''syllambánō'', a compound of the preposition {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''sýn'' &quot;with&quot; and the verb {{lang|grc|λαμβάνω}} ''lambánō'' &quot;take&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lamba/nw|λαμβάνω|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun uses the [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] {{lang|grc|λαβ-}}, which appears in the [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]] tense; the [[Ancient Greek verbs#Present tense|present tense]] stem {{lang|grc|λαμβάν-}} is formed by adding a [[nasal infix]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|μ}}}} ''{{angbr|m}}'' before the {{lang|grc|β}} ''b'' and a [[suffix]] {{lang|grc|-αν}} ''-an'' at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=§523: present stems formed by suffixes containing {{lang|grc|ν}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription==
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the period {{angbr IPA|.}} marks syllable breaks, as in the word &quot;astronomical&quot; {{angbr IPA|/ˌæs.trəˈnɒm.ɪk.əl/}}.

In practice, however, IPA transcription is typically divided into words by spaces, and often these spaces are also understood to be syllable breaks. In addition, the stress mark {{angbr IPA|ˈ}} is placed immediately before a stressed syllable, and when the stressed syllable is in the middle of a word, the stress mark also marks a syllable break, for example in the word &quot;understood&quot; {{angbr IPA|/ʌndərˈstʊd/}}.

When a word space comes in the middle of a syllable (that is, when a syllable spans words), a tie bar {{angbr IPA|‿}} can be used for [[liaison (French)|liaison]], as in the French combination ''les amis'' {{angbr IPA|/le.z‿a.mi/}}. The liaison tie is also used to join lexical words into [[phonological word]]s, for example ''hot dog'' {{angbr IPA|/ˈhɒt‿dɒɡ/}}.

A Greek sigma, {{angbr|σ}}, is used as a wild card for 'syllable', and a dollar/peso sign, {{angbr|$}}, marks a syllable boundary where the usual period might be misunderstood. For example, {{angbr|σσ}} is a pair of syllables, and {{angbr|V$}} is a syllable-final vowel.

=== Typical model ===

In the typical theory{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of syllable structure, the general structure of a syllable (σ) consists of three segments. These segments are grouped into two components:

; [[#Onset|Onset]] (ω): a [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]], obligatory in some languages, optional or even restricted in others
; [[#Rime|Rime]] (ρ): right branch, contrasts with onset, splits into nucleus and coda
:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (ν): a [[vowel]] or [[syllabic consonant]], obligatory in most languages
:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (κ): consonant, optional in some languages, highly restricted or prohibited in others

The syllable is usually considered right-branching, i.e. nucleus and coda are grouped together as a &quot;rime&quot; and are only distinguished at the second level.

The ''nucleus'' is usually the vowel in the middle of a syllable. The ''onset'' is the sound or sounds occurring before the nucleus, and the ''coda'' (literally 'tail') is the sound or sounds that follow the nucleus. They are sometimes collectively known as the ''shell''. The term ''rime'' covers the nucleus plus coda. In the one-syllable English word ''cat'', the nucleus is ''a'' (the sound that can be shouted or sung on its own), the onset ''c'', the coda ''t'', and the rime ''at''. This syllable can be abstracted as a ''consonant-vowel-consonant'' syllable, abbreviated ''CVC''.  Languages vary greatly in the restrictions on the sounds making up the onset, nucleus and coda of a syllable, according to what is termed a language's [[phonotactics]].

Although every syllable has supra-segmental features, these are usually ignored if not semantically relevant, e.g. in [[tonal language]]s.

; [[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]] (τ): may be carried by the syllable as a whole or by the rime

=== Chinese model ===
{{anchor|initial}}{{anchor|medial}}{{anchor|final}}
[[Image:Chinese syllable tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Traditional Chinese syllable structure]]

In [[Sinitic Languages|Chinese]] syllable structure, the onset is replaced with an initial, and a semivowel or liquid forms another segment, called the medial. These four segments are grouped into two slightly different components:{{example needed |date=September 2017}}&lt;!-- Example needed, like the examples of &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;sing&quot;. --&gt;

; [[#Initial|Initial]] (ι): optional onset, excluding sonorants
; [[#Final|Final]] (φ): medial, nucleus, and final consonant&lt;ref&gt;More generally, the letter φ indicates a prosodic [[foot (prosody)|foot]] of two syllables&lt;/ref&gt;
:; [[#Medial|Medial]] (μ): optional semivowel or liquid&lt;ref&gt;More generally, the letter μ indicates a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (ν): a [[vowel]] or syllabic consonant
:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (κ): optional final consonant

In many languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the syllable structure is expanded to include an additional, optional segment known as a '''medial''', which is located between the onset (often termed the ''initial'' in this context) and the rime.  The medial is normally a [[semivowel]], but reconstructions of [[Old Chinese]] generally include [[liquid consonant|liquid]] medials ({{IPA|/r/}} in modern reconstructions, {{IPA|/l/}} in older versions), and many reconstructions of [[Middle Chinese]] include a medial contrast between {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, where the {{IPA|/i/}} functions phonologically as a glide rather than as part of the nucleus.  In addition, many reconstructions of both Old and Middle Chinese include complex medials such as {{IPA|/rj/}}, {{IPA|/ji/}}, {{IPA|/jw/}} and {{IPA|/jwi/}}.  The medial groups phonologically with the rime rather than the onset, and the combination of medial and rime is collectively known as the '''final'''.

Some linguists, especially when discussing the modern Chinese varieties, use the terms &quot;final&quot; and &quot;rime/rhyme&quot; interchangeably.  In [[historical Chinese phonology]], however, the distinction between &quot;final&quot; (including the medial) and &quot;rime&quot; (not including the medial) is important in understanding the [[rime dictionary|rime dictionaries]] and [[rime table]]s that form the primary sources for [[Middle Chinese]], and as a result most authors distinguish the two according to the above definition.

=== Grouping of components ===

[[Image:Syllable illustration 2.svg|thumb|Hierarchical model for ''cat'' and ''sing'']]
[[Image:Syllable body coda.png|thumb|upright=2.5]]

In some theories of phonology, syllable structures are displayed as [[Parse tree|tree diagrams]] (similar to the trees found in some types of syntax). Not all phonologists agree that syllables have internal structure; in fact, some phonologists doubt the existence of the syllable as a theoretical entity.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cunyphonologyforum.net/syllable.php CUNY Conference on the Syllable] for discussion of the theoretical existence of the syllable.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many arguments for a hierarchical relationship, rather than a linear one, between the syllable constituents. One hierarchical model groups the syllable nucleus and coda into an intermediate level, the ''rime''.  The hierarchical model accounts for the role that the ''nucleus''+''coda'' constituent plays in verse (i.e., rhyming words such as ''cat'' and ''bat'' are formed by matching both the nucleus and coda, or the entire rime), and for the [[Syllable weight|distinction between heavy and light syllables]], which plays a role in phonological processes such as, for example, [[sound change]] in [[Old English]] ''scipu'' and ''wordu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Prosodic Grammar of Chinese | last = Feng | first = Shengli | page = 3 | publisher = University of Kansas | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Elucidate|date=November 2016}}

==== Body ====

In some traditional descriptions of certain languages such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], the syllable is considered left-branching, i.e. onset and nucleus group below a higher-level unit, called a &quot;body&quot; or &quot;core&quot;. This contrasts with the coda.

==== Rime ====

The '''rime''' or '''rhyme''' of a syllable consists of a [[#Nucleus|nucleus]] and an optional [[#Coda|coda]].  It is the part of the syllable used in most [[Rhyme|poetic rhyme]]s, and the part that is lengthened or stressed when a person elongates or stresses a word in speech.

The rime is usually the portion of a syllable from the first [[vowel]] to the end.  For example, {{IPA|/æt/}} is the rime of all of the words ''at'', ''sat'', and ''flat''.  However, the nucleus does not necessarily need to be a vowel in some languages.  For instance, the rime of the second syllables of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' is just {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].

Just as the rime branches into the nucleus and coda, the nucleus and coda may each branch into multiple [[phoneme]]s. The limit for the number of phonemes which may be contained in each varies by language.  For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and most [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] do not have consonant clusters at the beginning or end of syllables, whereas many Eastern European languages can have more than two consonants at the beginning or end of the syllable.  In English, the onset, nucleus, and coda may all have two phonemes, as in the word ''flouts'': [fl] in the onset, the [[diphthong]] [aʊ] in the nucleus, and [ts] in the coda.

''Rime'' and ''rhyme'' are variants of the same word, but the rarer form ''rime'' is sometimes used to mean specifically ''syllable rime'' to differentiate it from the concept of poetic [[rhyme]]. This distinction is not made by some linguists and does not appear in most dictionaries.

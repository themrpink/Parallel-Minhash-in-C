In 2016 the Norfolk Orbital Railway secured the section of the M&amp;GNJR formation immediately beyond that owned and operated by the North Norfolk Railway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolk-orbital-railway.co.uk/holt.html First section of land for the line to Holt bought]&lt;/ref&gt;  Earthworks have been completed on this section, with the initial goal of laying a display section of track to advertise the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/dream_of_restoring_railway_to_holt_moves_nearer_to_reality_1_4765034 Dream of restoring railway to Holt moves nearer to reality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rolling stock==
{{main article|List of rolling stock preserved on the North Norfolk Railway}}
There is a variety of preserved steam and diesel locomotives and [[diesel multiple units]], passenger coaches and goods wagons. Most of these are typical of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) branch lines in Norfolk. Some are owned by the railway itself but most are owned by various individuals or voluntary groups. The line is also regularly visited by locomotives based elsewhere. Some come for a day on a railtour, others for a few days or weeks to take part in a special gala, but a few stay for many months and form part of the stock working scheduled trains.

==Accidents==
On 30 October 1984 a volunteer died after falling from bridge 303 during the rebuilding of the structure, which crosses the [[A149 road|Coast Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.northnorfolknews.co.uk/news/tragic-rail-engineer-remembered-1-534483 |title= Tragic rail engineer remembered |newspaper=North Norfolk News| date=2 November 2009 | author= Richard Batson|accessdate= 4 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2015 [[London &amp; North Eastern Railway]] [[LNER Class B12|Class B12]] 4-6-0 locomotive 8572, running [[light engine]], was in collision with the buffers at the Holt terminus of the line.  The buffers were partially demolished, and the fire service attended.  No persons were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/locomotive-crashes-into-buffers-at-north-norfolk-railway-1940s-weekend-1-4240279 |title= Locomotive crashes into buffers at North Norfolk Railway 1940s weekend |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press| date=20 September 2015 | author= Sophie Biddle|accessdate= 2 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2018 [[Great Eastern Railway]] [[GER Class Y14|Class Y14]] 0-6-0 locomotive 564 was in collision with a car on the level crossing accessing Sheringham golf course, while travelling at about 10mph. The car was badly damaged, but nobody was hurt and the train and rail infrastructure was not damaged. This automatic open level crossing, controlled by lights which were working properly at the time, is the only one in regular use on the railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/sheringham-level-crossing-car-train-crash-1-5784057 |title=Car collides with train at Sheringham level crossing |newspaper=Eastern Daily Press|date=17 November 2018  |author=Daniel Bennett|accessdate= 17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The car driver was later fined for his involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.northnorfolknews.co.uk/news/driver-fined-after-crash-involving-steam-train-on-norfolk-railway-line-1-6064487 |title=Driver fined after his Mercedes collided with steam train |newspaper=North Norfolk News|date=22 May 2019  |author=David Bale|accessdate= 2 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and associated bodies==
The railway relies on a variety of sources to fund its operation.  Funding sources have included: 

A £419,000 carriage store (Bridge Road Carriage Sheds) was constructed close to Holt with the help of a 2006 grant of £308,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. A path from Holt station was included, but stops just before the sheds, with no public access to the site being possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mandgn.org/post/bridge-road-carriage-sheds-commissioned Bridge Road Carriage Sheds Commissioned]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 the line was awarded £99,500 from the [[National Lottery Heritage Fund]] (NLHF) to further its restoration and education programmes, specifically to show the impact railways had on the development of the London suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-22281739 North Norfolk Railway awarded £99,500 lottery funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the line was celebrating the completion of a new Tourist Information Centre at Sheringham, and a new boiler shop at Weybourne, which were made possible by a £498,000 award from the government’s '''Coastal Community Fund'''.  North Norfolk District Council also awarded £154,000 towards the work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/north-norfolk-railway-celebrating-double-success-1-4816109 North Norfolk Railway celebrating double success]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2020 the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway Society, backers of the North Norfolk Railway, purchased Hunslet 0-6-0ST locomotive No. 1982, &quot;Ring Haw&quot; and a crane from the company in order to release funds for the line and ensure that the vehicles remained on the North Norfolk Railway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.therailwayhub.co.uk/11079/north-norfolk-railway-lifeline-after-society-support-package/ North Norfolk Railway lifeline after society support package]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2020 the line was given a grant of £46,500 towards reinstating train services from the NLHF Emergency appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edp24.co.uk/features/heritage/north-norfolk-railway-receives-46-500-grant-1-6727413 Popular Poppy Line back and receives £46,500 grant ahead of reopening]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2020 the line was awarded £360,000 from the [[Culture Recovery Fund]] (from the Heritage and the Heritage Stimulus Fund), funded by the government and administered by [[Historic England]] and the NLHF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/government-culture-cash-to-protect-norfolk-steam-train-services-1-6875954 Two heritage railways given £550,000 to help them survive Covid]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Creation of protective or decorative metallic coating on other metal with electric current}}
[[File:PCB copper layer electroplating machine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Copper electroplating machine for layering [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]]]]

'''Electroplating''' is a general name for processes that create a [[metal]] coating on a solid substrate through the [[redox|reduction]] of [[cation]]s of that metal by means of a [[direct current|direct electric current]].  The part to be coated acts as the [[cathode]] (negative [[electrode]]) of an [[electrolytic cell]]; the [[electrolyte]] is a [[solution (chemistry)|solution]] of a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the metal to be coated; and the [[anode]] (positive electrode) is usually either a block of that metal, or of some inert [[electrical conductor|conductive]] material.  The current is provided by an external [[power supply]].

Electroplating is widely used in industry and [[decorative art]]s to improve the surface qualities of objects—such as resistance to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] and [[corrosion]], [[lubrication|lubricity]], [[reflectivity]], [[electrical conductivity]], or appearance.  It may also be used to build up thickness on undersized or worn-out parts, or to manufacture metal plates with complex shape, a process called [[electroforming]].  It is also used to purify metals such as [[copper]].

The term &quot;electroplating&quot; may also be used occasionally for processes that use an electric current to achieve [[redox|oxidation]] of [[anion]]s on to a solid substrate, as in the formation of [[silver chloride]] on silver wire to make [[silver chloride electrode|silver/silver-chloride electrodes]].

[[Electropolishing]], a process that uses an electric current to remove metal cations from the surface of a metal object, may be thought of as the opposite of electroplating.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electro-glo.com/faqs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Copper electroplating principle (multilingual).svg|thumb|upright|Simplified diagram for electroplating copper (orange) on a conductive object (the cathode, &quot;Me&quot;, gray). The electrolyte is a solution of copper sulfate, {{chem|CuSO|4}}.  A copper anode is used to replenish the electrolyte with copper cations {{chem|Cu|2+}} as they are plated out at the cathode.]]
{{See also|Electrotyping|Electroforming}}

The electrolyte should contain positive ions (cations) of the metal to be deposited.  These cations are reduced at the cathode to the metal in the zero valence state. For example, the electrolyte for [[copper plating]] can be a solution of [[copper(II) sulphate]], which dissociates into Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and {{chem|SO|4|2-}} anions. At the cathode, the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to metallic copper by gaining two electrons.

When the anode is made of the coating metal, the opposite reaction may occur there, turning it into dissolved cations.  For example, [[copper]] would be oxidized at the anode to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by losing two electrons. In this case, the rate at which the anode is dissolved will be equal to the rate at which the cathode is plated and thus the ions in the electrolyte bath are continuously replenished by the anode. The net result is the effective transfer of metal from the anode source to the cathode.{{sfn|Dufour|2006|p=IX-1}}

The anode may instead be made of a material that resists electrochemical oxidation, such as [[lead]] or [[carbon]]. [[Oxygen]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], or some other byproducts are then produced at the anode instead.  In this case, ions of the metal to be plated must be periodically replenished in the bath as they are drawn out of the solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dufour, IX-2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dufour|2006|p=IX-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plating is most commonly a single metallic [[chemical element|element]], not an [[alloy]]. However, some alloys can be electrodeposited, notably [[brass]] and [[solder]]. Plated &quot;alloys&quot; are not true alloys, i.e. solid solutions, but rather discrete tiny crystals of the metals being plated.  In the case of plated solder, it is sometimes deemed necessary to have a &quot;true alloy&quot;, and the plated solder is melted to allow the Tin and Lead to combine to form a true alloy.  The true alloy is more corrosion resistant than the as-plated alloy.

Many plating baths include [[cyanide]]s of other metals (such as [[potassium cyanide]]) in addition to cyanides of the metal to be deposited. These free cyanides facilitate anode corrosion, help to maintain a constant metal ion level and contribute to conductivity. Additionally, non-metal chemicals such as [[carbonate]]s and [[phosphate]]s may be added to increase conductivity.

When plating is not desired on certain areas of the substrate, stop-offs are applied to prevent the bath from coming in contact with the substrate. Typical stop-offs include tape, foil, [[lacquer]]s, and [[wax]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;dufour3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dufour |2006|p=IX-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a plating to cover uniformly is called ''{{visible anchor|throwing power}}''; the better the throwing power the more uniform the coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Pollution Prevention Technology Profile Trivalent Chromium Replacements for Hexavalent Chromium Plating |publisher=Northeast Waste Management Officials’ Association |date=2003-10-18 |url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/p2tech/TriChromeFinal.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720153833/http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/p2tech/TriChromeFinal.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike===
Initially, a special plating deposit called a ''strike'' or ''flash'' may be used to form a very thin (typically less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;μm thick) plating with high quality and good adherence to the substrate. This serves as a foundation for subsequent plating processes. A strike uses a high current density and a bath with a low ion concentration. The process is slow, so more efficient plating processes are used once the desired strike thickness is obtained.

The striking method is also used in combination with the plating of different metals. If it is desirable to plate one type of deposit onto a metal to improve corrosion resistance but this metal has inherently poor adhesion to the substrate, a strike can be first deposited that is compatible with both. One example of this situation is the poor adhesion of electrolytic [[nickel]] on [[zinc]] alloys, in which case a copper strike is used, which has good adherence to both.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dufour, IX-2&quot;/&gt;

===Electrochemical deposition===
Electrochemical deposition is generally used for the growth of metals and conducting metal oxides because of the following advantages: the thickness and morphology of the nanostructure can be precisely controlled by adjusting the electrochemical parameters; relatively uniform and compact deposits can be synthesized in template-based structures; higher deposition rates are obtained; and the equipment is inexpensive due to the non-requirements of either a high vacuum or a high reaction temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|inventor1-last=Coyle|inventor1-first=R.

===Pulse electroplating===
The pulse electroplating or pulse electrodeposition (PED) process involves the swift alternating of the [[electrical potential]] or [[Electric current|current]] between two different values resulting in a series of pulses of equal amplitude, duration and polarity, separated by zero current. By changing the pulse amplitude and width, it is possible to change the deposited film's composition and thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=kunji durai|first1=M. S.|first2=Mathy|last2=chaala|title=Pulse and pulse reverse plating—Conceptual, advantages and applications|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=53|issue=8|year=2008|pages=3313–3322|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2007.11.054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental parameters of pulse electroplating usually consist of peak current/potential, duty cycle, frequency and effective current/potential. Peak current/potential is the maximum setting of electroplating current or potential. Duty cycle is the effective portion of time in certain electroplating period with the current or potential applied. The effective current/potential is calculated by multiplying the duty cycle and peak value of current or potential. Pulse electroplating could help to improve the quality of electroplated film and release the internal stress built up during fast deposition. Combination of the short duty cycle and high frequency could decrease the surface cracks. However, in order to maintain the constant effective current or potential, a high performance power supply may be required to provide high peak current/potential and fast switch. Another common problem of pulse electroplating is that the anode material could get plated and contaminated during the reverse electroplating, especially for the high cost, inert electrode such as [[platinum]].

Other factors that could affect the pulse electroplating include temperature, anode-to-cathode gap and stirring. Sometimes the pulse electroplating can be performed in heated electroplating bath to increase the depositing rate since the rate of almost all the chemical reaction increases exponentially with temperature per Arrhenius law. The anode-to-cathode gap is related to the current distribution between anode and cathode. Small gap to sample area ratio may cause uneven distribution of current and affect the surface topology of plated sample. Stirring may increase the transfer/diffusion rate of metal ions from bulk solution to the electrode surface. Stirring setting varies for different metal electroplating processes.

===Brush electroplating===
A closely related process is brush electroplating, in which localized areas or entire items are plated using a brush saturated with plating solution. The brush, typically a [[stainless steel]] body wrapped with an absorbent [[cloth]] material that both holds the plating solution and prevents direct contact with the item being plated, is connected to the [[anode]] of a low voltage [[direct current]] power source, and the item to be plated connected to the [[cathode]]. The operator dips the brush in plating solution then applies it to the item, moving the brush continually to get an even distribution of the plating material.

Brush electroplating has several advantages over tank plating, including portability, ability to plate items that for some reason cannot be tank plated (one application was the plating of portions of very large decorative support columns in a building restoration), low or no masking requirements, and comparatively low plating solution volume requirements. Disadvantages compared to tank plating can include greater operator involvement (tank plating can frequently be done with minimal attention), and inability to achieve as great a plate thickness.

==== Hard chrome in brush electroplating ====
Hard chrome is one of the most common plating materials used for hard plating and electroplating, due to its strength, resistance and sleek finish. However, chromium is very dangerous in its [[hexavalent chromium|hexavalent]] state. When inhaled or consumed, airborne Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;[JT2] has been linked to lung cancer and causes damage to the throat, mouth and nose.

This is because, in its hexavalent state, chromium has [[carcinogen]]ic and [[teratogenic]] properties, which has a mutagenic effect on cells.

Every year, 558,000 US technicians are exposed to hexavalent chromium in the workplace, with those working in the electroplating, welding and painting industries are most at risk, due to increased exposure to high levels of Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Deborah M|date=2016|title=Inhalation cancer risk assessment of hexavalent chromium based on updated mortality for Painesville chromate production workers |journal=Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=224–31|doi=10.1038/jes.2015.77|pmid=26669850|pmc=4756268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the dangers linked to hexavalent chromium, finding safer, eco-friendly alternatives has been a main driver of brush electroplating research for the last decade. One alternative that has been developed is [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMC). MMC offers unique and superior characteristics to metal plating solutions including hardness, wear resistance, and oxidation protection at high temperatures. This chrome alternative MMC includes [[cobalt chromium carbide]], [[nickel tungsten carbide]] and [[nickel chromium carbide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Milosevic-Popovich|first=Danijela|date=2018|title=Advancements in Brush Plated Metal Matrix Composites|url=https://www.sifcoasc.com/metal-matrix-composites/|website=SIFCO ASC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrel plating===
{{main article|Barrel plating}}
This technique of electroplating is one of the most common used in the industry for large numbers of small objects.  The objects are placed in a barrel-shaped non-conductive cage, and then immersed in the chemical bath containing suspended atoms of the metal that is to be plated onto them.  The barrel is then rotated, and electrical currents are run through the various pieces in the barrel which complete circuits as they touch one another.  The result is a very uniform and efficient plating process, though the finish on the end products will likely suffer from abrasion during the plating process.  It is unsuitable for highly ornamental or precisely engineered items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tan1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=A.C. Tan|title=Tin and Solder Plating in the Semiconductor Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyrohYlFCiYC&amp;pg=PA122|date=30 November 1992|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-412-48240-3|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cleanliness ===
[[Parts cleaning|Cleanliness]] is essential to successful electroplating, since molecular layers of [[oil]] can prevent adhesion of the coating. [[ASTM]] B322 is a standard guide for cleaning metals prior to electroplating. Cleaning includes solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, electrocleaning, and acid treatment etc. The most common industrial test for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. [[Hydrophobic]] contaminants such as oils cause the water to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are [[hydrophilic]] and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes a version of this test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but electroplating can displace these easily since the solutions are water-based. [[Surfactant]]s such as [[soap]] reduce the sensitivity of the test and must be thoroughly rinsed off.

==Effects==
Electroplating changes the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the workpiece. An example of a chemical change is when [[nickel]] plating improves corrosion resistance. An example of a physical change is a change in the outward appearance. An example of a mechanical change is a change in [[tensile strength]] or surface [[hardness]] which is a required attribute in tooling industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert H. | last1 = Todd | first2 = Dell K. | last2 = Allen | first3 = Leo | last3 = Alting | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | chapter = Surface Coating | publisher = Industrial Press | isbn = 0-8311-3049-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | pages = 454–458 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131009082958/http://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | archive-date = 2013-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electroplating of acid gold on underlying copper- or nickel-plated circuits reduces contact resistance as well as surface hardness. Copper-plated areas of mild steel act as a mask if case hardening of such areas are not desired. Tin-plated steel is chromium-plated to prevent dulling of the surface due to oxidation of tin.

Electroplating, or electroless plating may be used as a way to render a metal part [[radioactive]], by using an aqueous solution prepared from nickel–[[phosphorus]] concentrates which contain radioactive [[hypophosphite]] [[phosphorus-32|&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P]] ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|inventor1-last=Hampikian|inventor1-first=Janet|inventor2-last=Scott|inventor2-first=Neal|title=Radioactive coating solutions methods, and substrates |country=US|number=6475644|granted-date=November 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

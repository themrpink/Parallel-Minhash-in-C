A '''lyrebird''' is either of two [[species]] of ground-dwelling [[Australian]] [[bird]]s that compose the genus '''''Menura''''', and the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Menuridae'''. They are most notable for their superb ability to [[mimicry|mimic]] natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display.  Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
[[File:Menura superba - Thomas Davies.jpg|thumb|''Menura superba'' – superb lyrebird (1800) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]]]]

The classification of lyrebirds was the subject of much debate after the first specimens reached European scientists after 1798. The superb lyrebird was first illustrated and described scientifically as ''Menura superba'' by Major-General [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]] in 1800 to the [[Linnean Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Thomas|chapter=[[s:Transactions of the Linnean Society of London/Volume 6/Description of Menura superba, a bird of New South Wales|Description of Menura superba, a Bird of New South Wales]]|title=Transactions of the Linnean Society|location=London|publication-date=1802|date=4 November 1800|pages=207–10|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Lyre-Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his work on specimens sent from [[New South Wales]] to England.

Lyrebirds were thought to be [[Galliformes]] like the broadly similar looking [[partridge]], [[junglefowl]], and [[pheasant]]s familiar to Europeans, reflected in the early names given to the superb lyrebird, including native pheasant. They were also called peacock-wrens and Australian birds-of-paradise. The idea that they were related to the pheasants was abandoned when the first chicks, which are [[altricial]], were described. They were not classed with the passerines until a paper was published in 1840, 12 years after they were assigned a discrete family, Menuridae. Within that family they compose a single genus, ''Menura''.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan | last = Lill | editor-first = Josep | editor-last = del Hoyo | editor2-first = Andrew | editor2-last = Elliott | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Christie | contribution = Family Menuridae (Lyrebirds) | title = Handbook of the Birds of the World.

It is generally accepted that the lyrebird family is most closely related to the [[scrubland|scrub]]-birds ([[Atrichornithidae]]) and some authorities combine both in a single family, but evidence that they are also related to the [[bowerbird]]s remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Christidis |first1=L. |last2=Norman |first2=J.A. |year=1996 |title=Molecular Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Affinities of Lyrebirds (Menuridae) and Treecreepers (Climacteridae) |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=215–222 |doi=10.1071/zo9960215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Lyrebird Albert f 20091125 flash.JPG|thumb|Female Albert's lyrebird]]
The lyrebirds are large [[passerine]] birds, amongst the largest in the order. They are ground living birds with strong legs and feet and short rounded wings. They are generally poor fliers and rarely take to the air except for periods of downhill gliding.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt; The superb lyrebird is the larger of the two species. Females are 74–84&amp;nbsp;cm long, and the males are a larger 80–98&amp;nbsp;cm long—making them the third-largest [[passerine]] bird after the [[thick-billed raven]] and the [[common raven]].  Albert's lyrebird is slightly smaller at a maximum of 90&amp;nbsp;cm (male) and 84&amp;nbsp;cm (female) (around 30–35&amp;nbsp;inches) They have smaller, less spectacular lyrate feathers than the superb lyrebird, but are otherwise similar.

==Distribution and habitat==
The superb lyrebird is found in areas of rainforest in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], and south-east [[Queensland]].  It is also found in [[Tasmania]] where it was introduced in the 19th century. Many superb lyrebirds live in the [[Dandenong Ranges National Park]] and [[Kinglake National Park]] around [[Melbourne]], the [[Royal National Park]] and [[Illawarra]] region south of Sydney, in many other parks along the east coast of Australia, and non protected bushland. Albert's lyrebird is found only in a small area of [[Queensland|Southern Queensland]] [[rainforest]].

==Behaviour and ecology==
Lyrebirds are shy and difficult to approach, particularly the Albert's lyrebird, with the result that little information about its behaviour has been documented. When lyrebirds detect potential danger, they pause and scan the surroundings, sound an alarm, and either flee the area on foot, or seek cover and freeze.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt; Firefighters sheltering in mine shafts during [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]] have been joined by lyrebirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Amazing Facts about Australian Birds |last=Parish |first=Steve |author2=Slater, Pat  |authorlink=Steve Parish |year=1997 |publisher=Steve Parish Publishing |location=Oxley, QLD |isbn=1-875932-34-8 |page= |url= }}{{page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet and feeding===
[[File:Albert's Lyrebird OR.ogv|thumb|Albert's Lyrebird]]
Lyrebirds feed on the ground and as individuals. A range of invertebrate prey is taken, including [[insect]]s such as [[cockroach]]es, [[beetle]]s (both adults and larvae), [[earwigs]], fly larvae, and the adults and larvae of moths. Other prey taken includes [[centipede]]s, [[spider]]s, [[earthworm]]s. Less commonly taken prey includes stick insects, bugs, [[amphipod]]s, [[lizard]]s, frogs and occasionally, [[seed]]s. They find food by scratching with their feet through the [[leaf]]-litter.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Superb Lyrebird mound dance.jpg|thumb|250px|Superb lyrebird in courtship display]]

===Breeding===
The breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds, capable of living as long as thirty years. They also start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female superb lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males, and those territories may contain the breeding territories of up to eight females. Within the male territories, the males create or use display platforms; for the superb lyrebird, this is a mound of bare soil; for the Albert's lyrebird, it is a pile of twigs on the forest floor.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt;

Male lyrebirds call mostly during winter, when they construct and maintain an open arena-mound in dense [[The Bush|bush]], on which they sing and dance in [[courtship display]], to display to potential mates, of which the male lyrebird has several. The female builds an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where she lays a single [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The egg is [[Avian incubation|incubated]] over 50 days solely by the female, and the female also fosters the chick alone.

===Vocalizations and mimicry===
[[File:Superb lyrebird mimicking Australian native birds.ogg|thumb|left|Superb lyrebird mimicking Australian native birds]]
A lyrebird's [[bird vocalization|song]] is one of the more distinctive aspects of its behavioural biology. Lyrebirds sing throughout the year, but the peak of the breeding season, from June to August, is when they sing with the most intensity. During this peak they may sing for four hours of the day, almost half the hours of daylight. The song of the superb lyrebird is a mixture of elements of its own song and any number of other mimicked songs and noises. The lyrebird's [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]] is the most complexly-muscled of the [[passerine]]s (songbirds), giving the lyrebird extraordinary ability, unmatched in vocal repertoire and mimicry.  Lyrebirds render with great fidelity the individual songs of other birds and the chatter of flocks of birds, and also mimic other animals such as [[koala]]s and [[dingo]]es.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt; The lyrebird is capable of imitating almost any sound and they have been recorded mimicking human sounds such as a mill whistle, a cross-cut saw, [[chainsaw]]s, [[car engine]]s and [[car alarm]]s, [[fire|fire alarms]], [[rifle]]-shots, [[camera]] shutters, [[dog]]s barking, crying babies, music, mobile phone ring tones, and even the human voice. However, while the mimicry of human noises is widely reported, the extent to which it happens is exaggerated and the phenomenon is unusual.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt; In fact, this behaviour has to date been documented only in captive specimens. Parts of the lyrebird's own song can resemble human-made [[Sound effect|sound effects]], which has given rise to the [[urban legend]] that they frequently imitate video game or film sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-07-28|title=Lyre, lyre, pants on fire: The truth about one of our showiest songbirds|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-07-28/lyrebird-myths-busted-bird-calls/11342208|access-date=2020-10-23|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Hollis|title=Lyrebirds mimicking chainsaws: fact or lie?|url=http://theconversation.com/lyrebirds-mimicking-chainsaws-fact-or-lie-22529|access-date=2020-10-23|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superb lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including from other superb lyrebirds. An instructive example is the population of superb lyrebirds in Tasmania, which have retained the calls of species not native to Tasmania in their repertoire, with some local Tasmanian endemic bird songs added. Young birds take about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics capable of complex vocalisations. Superb lyrebird females are often silent during courtship; however, they regularly produce sophisticated vocal displays during foraging and nest defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Welbergen |first1=Justin A. |last2=Dalziell |first2=Anastasia H. |date=20 April 2016 |title= Elaborate Mimetic Vocal Displays by Female Superb Lyrebirds |journal= Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution |volume=4 |doi=10.3389/fevo.2016.00034 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recording of a superb lyrebird mimicking sounds of an electronic shooting game, workmen and chainsaws was added to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]]'s [[Sounds of Australia]] registry in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;National Film and Sound Archive: [http://nfsa.gov.au/collection/sound/sounds-australia/complete-list/ Sounds of Australia].&lt;/ref&gt;

One researcher, Sydney Curtis, has recorded flute-like lyrebird calls in the vicinity of the [[New England National Park]].  Similarly, in 1969, a park ranger, Neville Fenton, recorded a lyrebird song which resembled flute sounds in the New England National Park, near Dorrigo in northern coastal New South Wales.  After much detective work by Fenton, it was discovered that in the 1930s, a flute player living on a farm adjoining the park used to play tunes near his pet lyrebird.  The lyrebird adopted the tunes into his repertoire, and retained them after release into the park.  Neville Fenton forwarded a tape of his recording to [[Frank Norman Robinson|Norman Robinson]].  Because a lyrebird is able to carry two tunes at the same time, Robinson filtered out one of the tunes and put it on the phonograph for the purposes of analysis.  One witness suggested that the song represents a modified version of two popular tunes in the 1930s:  &quot;The Keel Row&quot; and &quot;Mosquito's Dance&quot;.  Musicologist David Rothenberg has endorsed this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=4206 |title=In conversation with David Rothenberg |author=Sheridan, Molly |year=2005 |publisher=NewMusicBox.org |accessdate=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Lyrebird: A Natural History |last=Reilly |first=P.N. |authorlink=Pauline Neura Reilly |year=1988 |publisher=New South Wales University Press |location=Kensington, NSW |isbn= 0-86840-083-1 |page= |url= }}{{page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a “flute lyrebird” research group (including Curtis and Fenton) formed to investigate the veracity of this story found no evidence of “Mosquito Dance” and only remnants of “Keel Row” in contemporary and historical lyrebird recordings from this area. Neither were they able to prove that a lyrebird chick had been a pet, although they acknowledged compelling evidence on both sides of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powys|first=Vicki|last2=Taylor|first2=Hollis|last3=Probets|first3=Carol|date=2013|title=A Little Flute Music: Mimicry, Memory, and Narrativity|url=http://environmentalhumanities.dukejournals.org/content/3/1/43|journal=Environmental Humanities|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=43–70|doi=10.1215/22011919-3611230|issn=2201-1919|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and conservation==
Until the [[2019-2020 Australian bushfire season]], lyrebirds were not considered threatened in the short to medium term. Concern has since grown as early analyses have shown the extent of destruction of the lyrebird's preferred wet-forest habitats, which in less intense previous bushfire seasons have been spared, in large part due to their moisture content.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc_20191206&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-27/bushfires-devastate-ancient-forests-and-rare-wildlife/11733956 |title=Bushfires devastate rare and enchanting wildlife as 'permanently wet' forests burn for first time |last=Arnold |first=Ann |date=6 December 2019 |website=www.abc.net.au |access-date=25 January 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200120175714/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-27/bushfires-devastate-ancient-forests-and-rare-wildlife/11733956 |archivedate=20 January 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's lyrebird has a very restricted habitat and had been listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[IUCN]], but because the species and its habitat were carefully managed, the species was re-assessed to [[near threatened]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUCN Albert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=[[BirdLife International]]|title=''Menura alberti''|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005161/0|work=IUCN Red List|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=18 November 2011|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superb lyrebird had already been seriously threatened by [[habitat destruction]] in the past. Its population had since recovered, but the 2019-2020 bushfires damaged much of its habitat, which may lead to a reclassification of its status from 'common' to 'threatened'.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_20200124&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/lyrebird-threatened-species-scale-bird-habitat-bushfires-emerges |title=Lyrebird may join threatened species, as scale of bird habitat lost to bushfires emerges |last=Morton |first=Adam |date=24 January 2020 |website=www.theguardian.com |access-date=25 January 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124104235/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/lyrebird-threatened-species-scale-bird-habitat-bushfires-emerges |archivedate=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this new threat are the long term vulnerabilities to predation by [[cat]]s and [[fox]]es, as well as human population pressure on its habitat.&lt;ref name = &quot;HBW&quot;/&gt;

==Lyrebird emblems and logos==
[[File:Australia-Stamp-1932-Lyrebird.jpg|thumb|75px|Superb lyrebird on a 1932 Australian postage stamp.]]

[[File:Lyre bird.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Gould]]'s early 1800s painting of a [[superb lyrebird]] specimen at the [[British Museum]]]]

==Painting by John Gould==
The lyrebird is so called because the male bird has a spectacular tail, consisting of 16 highly modified [[feather]]s (two long slender ''lyrates'' at the centre of the plume, two broader ''medians'' on the outside edges and twelve ''filamentaries'' arrayed between them), which was originally thought to resemble a [[lyre]]. This happened when a superb lyrebird specimen (which had been taken from Australia to [[England]] during the early 19th century) was prepared for display at the [[British Museum]] by a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] who had never seen a live lyrebird. The taxidermist mistakenly thought that the tail would resemble a lyre, and that the tail would be held in a similar way to that of a [[peacock]] during [[courtship]] display, and so he arranged the feathers in this way. Later, [[John Gould]] (who had also never seen a live lyrebird), painted the lyrebird from the British Museum specimen.

The male lyrebird's tail is not held as in John Gould's painting. Instead, the male lyrebird's tail is fanned over the lyrebird during courtship display, with the tail completely covering his head and back—as can be seen in the image in the 'breeding' section of this page, and also the image of the 10-cent coin, where the superb lyrebird's tail (in courtship display) is portrayed accurately.

A computer '''simulation language''' is used to describe the operation of a [[simulation]] on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Ole-Johan, and Kristen Nygaard. &quot;[http://folk.uio.no/simula67/Archive/artikkel1966cacm.pdf SIMULA: an ALGOL-based simulation language].&quot; Communications of the ACM 9.9 (1966): 671-678.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritzson, Peter, and Vadim Engelson. &quot;[http://extras.springer.com/2000/978-3-540-67660-7/papers/1445/14450067.pdf Modelica—A unified object-oriented language for system modeling and simulation].&quot; European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major types of simulation: [[continuous simulation|continuous]] and [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] though more modern languages can handle more complex combinations.  Most languages also have a graphical interface and at least a simple statistic gathering capability for the analysis of the results. An important part of discrete-event languages is the ability to generate [[Pseudo-random number generator|pseudo-random numbers]] and variants from different [[probability distribution]]s.

The '''atomic radius''' of a [[chemical element]] is a measure of the size of its [[atom]]s, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] to the boundary of the surrounding [[Electron shell|shells]] of [[electron]]s.  Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius. Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are:  [[Van der Waals radius]], [[ionic radius]], and [[covalent radius]].

Depending on the definition, the term may apply only to isolated atoms, or also to atoms in [[condensed matter]], [[covalent bonding|covalently bonding]] in [[molecule]]s, or in [[ionization|ionized]] and [[excited state]]s; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements, or computed from theoretical models. The value of the radius may depend on the atom's state and context.&lt;ref&gt;

Electrons do not have definite orbits, or sharply defined ranges. Rather, their positions must be described as [[probability distribution]]s that taper off gradually as one moves away from the nucleus, without a sharp cutoff; these are referred to as [[atomic orbital]]s or electron clouds. Moreover, in condensed matter and molecules, the electron clouds of the atoms usually overlap to some extent, and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms.

Under most definitions the radii of isolated neutral atoms range between 30 and 300 [[picometre|pm]] ([[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#10.E2.88.9212|trillionths]] of a meter), or between 0.3 and 3 [[ångström]]s. Therefore, the radius of an atom is more than 10,000 times the [[nuclear radius|radius of its nucleus]] (1–10 [[femtometre|fm]]),&lt;ref name=Basdevant&gt;

For many purposes, atoms can be modeled as spheres. This is only a crude approximation, but it can provide quantitative explanations and predictions for many phenomena, such as the [[density]] of liquids and solids, the [[diffusion]] of fluids through [[molecular sieves]], the arrangement of atoms and ions in [[crystal]]s, and the [[space-filling model|size and shape of molecules]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explicable manner across the [[periodic table]]. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period (row) of the table, from the [[alkali metal]]s to the [[noble gases]]; and increase down each group (column).  The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period.  These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the [[electron shell]] theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. The atomic radii decrease across the Periodic Table because as the atomic number increases, the number of protons increases across the period, but the extra electrons are only added to the same quantum shell. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge towards the outermost electrons increases, drawing the outermost electrons closer. As a result, the electron cloud contracts and the atomic radius decreases.

==History==

In 1920, shortly after it had become possible to determine the sizes of atoms using [[X-ray crystallography]], it was suggested that all atoms of the same element have the same radii.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1923, when more crystal data had become available, it was found that the approximation of an atom as a sphere does not necessarily hold when comparing the same atom in different crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;

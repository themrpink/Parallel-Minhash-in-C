The first 206 Chinese-born arrived in Havana on June 3, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubahora.cu/index.php?tpl=principal/ver-noticias/ver-not_cult.tpl.html&amp;newsid_obj_id=1033916 Cuba Culture] &quot;Aportes de los chinos en Cuba&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood was booming with Chinese restaurants, laundries, banks, pharmacies, theaters and several Chinese-language newspapers, the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime.&lt;ref name=chinatown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hist_immigration/&gt; The heart of Barrio Chino is on ''el Cuchillo de Zanja'' (or The Zanja Canal). The strip is a pedestrian-only street adorned with many red lanterns, dancing red paper dragons and other Chinese cultural designs, there is a great number of restaurants that serve a full spectrum of Chinese dishes – unfortunately that 'spectrum' is said by many{{who|date=October 2013}} not to be related to real Chinese cuisine.

The district has two [[paifang]] (Chinese arches), the larger one located on ''Calle Dragones''. [[China]] donated the materials in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012163235/http://radiohc.cu/espanol/turismo/especiales/barriochino.htm El Barrio Chino de la Habana] – Havana's Barrio Chino {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a well defined written welcoming sign in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and Spanish. The smaller arch is located on Zanja strip. The Cuban's Chinese boom ended when Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution seized private businesses, sending tens of thousands of business-minded Chinese fleeing, mainly to the United States. Descendants are now making efforts to preserve and revive the culture.&lt;ref name=chi_cuba/&gt;

The [[Museum of the Revolution (Cuba)|Museum of the Revolution]] ''(Museo de la Revolución)'', designed in Havana by Cuban architect Carlos Maruri, and the [[Belgium|Belgian]] Paul Belau, who came up with an [[eclecticism in art|eclectic]] design, harmoniously combines Spanish, French and German architectural elements. The museum was the [[Presidential Palace]] in the capital; today, its displays and documents outline Cuba's history from the beginning of the ''neo-colonial period''. The building was the site of the [[Havana Presidential Palace Attack (1957)]] by the [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil]].

The neo-classical mansion of the ''Countess of Revilla de Camargo'', today it is the [[Havana Museum of Decorative Arts|Museum of Decorative Arts]] ''(Museo de Artes Decorativas)'', known as the ''&quot;small French Palace of Havana&quot;'' built between 1924 and 1927, it was designed in Paris inspired in [[French Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080112140502/http://www.mytravel.com/AniteNextPage.asp?p=SPECIFICGUIDE_42938%2F Museo de Artes Decorativos]- José Gómez Mena, one of Cuba's wealthiest aristocrats, built this house in 1927 to hold his staggering collection of antique furniture, rugs, paintings and vases.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has been exhibiting more than 33,000 works dating from the reigns of [[Louis XV]], [[Louis XVI]], and [[Napoleon III]]; as well as 16th to 20th century [[Oriental]] pieces, among many other treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/articles.asp?cID=51&amp;sID=380&amp;aID=1281 Paseos por La Habana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007001624/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/articles.asp?cID=51&amp;sID=380&amp;aID=1281 |date=October 7, 2007 }}-El museo guarda en su interior mobiliario antiguo, porcelana y ceramica, cristalerias, espejos, bronces y objetos ornamentales.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum has ten permanent exhibit halls.

The furniture comes from [[Stéphane Boudin]], [[Jean Henri Riesener]] and several others.

Several museums in Old Havana houses furniture, [[Food utensil|silverware]], [[pottery]], glass and other items from the colonial period. One of these is the [[Palacio de los Capitanes Generales]], where Spanish governors once lived. The ''Casa de Africa'' presents another aspect of Cuba's history, it houses a large collection of [[Afro-Cuban]] religious artifacts.

Other museums in the city include ''Casa de los Árabes'' (House of Arabs) and the ''Casa de Asia'' (House of Asia) with [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Far Eastern]] collections. Havana's ''Museo del Automobil'' has an impressive collection of vehicles dating back to a 1905 [[Cadillac]].

==Tourism==
[[File:Havana sightseeing bus.jpg|thumb|right|Sight-seeing busses at the [[Parque Central, Havana|Parque Central]]]]
Havana attracts over a million tourists annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;Havana Tourism&quot;/&gt; the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Havana Tourism&quot;/&gt; a 20% increase from 2005.

The city has long been a popular attraction for [[tourism|tourists]]. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miguel&quot;&gt;[http://world-tourism.org/quality_/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy Miguel Alejandro Figueras]  {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.

With the deterioration of [[Cuba – United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.

Through the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).

Havana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=January 28, 2010 }} Caribbean News Net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm |title = Cuba sells its medical expertise|work = BBC News|first = Tom |last = Fawthrop|date = 21 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

===Industry===
[[File:Leyden freighter, Havana Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|M V Leyden freighter in the harbor]]
[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]
Havana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.

The city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.

The traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.

In 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archive-date = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AP|title=Lack of Customers Dooms Many Cuban Businesses|url=http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228034327/http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 December 2013|publisher=Weekly Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and finance===
After the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.

In Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the [[National Bank of Cuba]], headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.

In the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, [[casino]]s, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De una casa colonial a una mansión del Vedado |url=http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013131209/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedado]] is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165946/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2007 |work=britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Havana is located in Vedado.

Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Factbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656&amp;crid=192|title= Millennium Indicators |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.&lt;ref name=Official_census /&gt;

The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure.

===Religion===
[[Roman Catholic]]s form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río. Its patron saint is San Cristobal ([[Saint Christopher]]), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a [[minor basilica]], [[Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre]] and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: [[Pope John Paul II]] (January 1998), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (March 2012) and [[Pope Francis]] (September 2015).

The [[Jewish]] community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170701152154/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Cuba.htm Present-Day Jewish Life in Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom had fled [[Nazi]] persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or moved to [[Israel]] after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five [[synagogue]]s, but only three remain (one [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and two [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]: one Conservative [[Ashkenazi]] and one Conservative [[Sephardic]]), [[Beth Shalom Temple (Havana, Cuba)|Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue]] is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the [[New York Times]] estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/travel/04journeys.html?em&amp;ex=1170824400&amp;en=254a263b2686376e&amp;ei=5087%0A 1,500 Jews who live in Cuba; 1,100 reside in Havana, and the remaining 400 are spread among the provinces.] In Cuba, Finding a Tiny Corner of Jewish Life.&lt;/ref&gt;

The years after the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including [[Special Period]] of 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba - Overview|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/cuba/index.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=1 December 2011|first=Victoria|last=Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national government does not have an official definition of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=Cub_eco&gt;Angela, Ferriol Maruaga; et al: ''Cuba crisis, ajuste y situación social (1990–1996)'', La Habana, Cuba : Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 1998, Champter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The government researchers argue that &quot;poverty&quot; in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as &quot;at risk&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; using internationally accepted measures.&lt;ref name=Cub_eco /&gt;

The generic term &quot;[[slum]]&quot; is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in ''solares'' (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families)&lt;ref name=cuarteria_def /&gt; and [[shanty towns]] to be the &quot;precarious housing stock&quot; and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of [[Old Havana]] and [[Centro Habana]], as well as such neighbourhoods as ''Atarés'' in [[Regla]].&lt;ref name=Problemas_socioambientales&gt;González Rego, R. 1999. &quot;Una Primera Aproximación al Análisis Espacial de los Problemas Socioambientales en los Barrios y Focos Insalubres de Ciudad de La Habana&quot;. Facultad de Filosofía e Historia. Departamento de Sociología, Universidad de La Habana. 250 p.&lt;/ref&gt; People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighbourhoods. [[Shanty towns]] are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.&lt;ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /&gt;

Over 9% of Havana's population live in ''cuartería'' (''solares, ciudadela''), 3.3% in [[shanty towns]], and 0.3% in refugee shelters.&lt;ref name=Censo_vivienda /&gt;&lt;ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /&gt; This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to ''Instituto Nacional de Vivienda'' (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in &quot;good&quot; condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in &quot;fair&quot; condition and 16% in &quot;poor&quot; condition.&lt;ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /&gt; Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, specially the highly-populated districts, are in [[urban decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2007-03-24|title=Havana's former grandeur decays and crumbles|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-havana-idUSN2034616720070324|access-date=2020-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Airport lies about {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} south of the city center, in the municipality of [[Boyeros]], and is the main hub for the country's [[flag carrier]] [[Cubana de Aviación]]. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]] and one destination in [[Africa]].

The city is also served by [[Playa Baracoa Airport]] which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily [[Aerogaviota]].

Holbein had deftly survived the downfall of his first two great patrons, Thomas More and [[Anne Boleyn]], but Cromwell's sudden arrest and execution on trumped-up charges of heresy and treason in 1540 undoubtedly damaged his career.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 265; Schofield, 260–64. Cromwell's reluctance to arrange a divorce for Henry lay naked behind his fall, though the matter was not mentioned in the bill of [[attainder]].&lt;/ref&gt; Though Holbein retained his position as King's Painter, Cromwell's death left a gap no other patron could fill. It was, ironically, Holbein's portrait of [[Anne of Cleves]] which largely led to Cromwell's downfall: furious at being saddled with a wife he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell.  Granted, Cromwell had exaggerated her beauty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0C1LAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20her%20charms&amp;pg=PA118 | title=Thomas Cranmer and the English Reformation, 1489-1556| isbn=9781592448654| last1=Pollard| first1=Alfred W| date=14 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no evidence that Henry blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne's looks.

Pen and black ink on paper with grey wash, and red wash on the compass, [[British Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Foister, 76–77. A clock salt was a complex instrument, including a clock, hourglass, sundial and compass.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Apart from routine official duties, Holbein now occupied himself with private commissions, turning again to portraits of Steelyard merchants. He also painted some of his finest miniatures, including those of [[Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk|Henry Brandon]] and [[Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk|Charles Brandon]], sons of Henry VIII's friend [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] and his fourth wife, [[Catherine Willoughby]]. Holbein managed to secure commissions among those courtiers who now jockeyed for power, in particular from [[Anthony Denny]], one of the two chief gentlemen of the bedchamber. He became close enough to Denny to borrow money from him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 273, 276; North, 31. Holbein asked in his will for &quot;Mr Anthony, the king's servant of Greenwich&quot;, to be repaid; scholars have usually presumed this to be Denny.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted Denny's portrait in 1541 and two years later designed a clock-salt for him. Denny was part of a circle that gained influence in 1542 after the failure of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine Howard]]. The king's marriage in July 1543 to the reformist [[Catherine Parr]], whose brother Holbein had painted in 1541, established Denny's party in power.

Holbein may have visited his wife and children in late 1540, when his leave-of-absence from Basel expired. None of his work dates from this period, and the Basel authorities paid him six months salary in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 267. Also, his uncle, the painter Sigmund Holbein, had died that autumn in [[Bern]], leaving him substantial moneys and effects.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Holbein's marriage has intrigued scholars, who base their speculations on fragmentary evidence. Apart from one brief visit, Holbein had lived apart from Elsbeth since 1532. His will reveals that he had two infant children in England, of whom nothing is known except that they were in the care of a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 245, 269; North, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's unfaithfulness to Elsbeth may not have been new. Some scholars believe that Magdalena Offenburg, the model for the ''Darmstadt Madonna'' and for two portraits painted in Basel, was for a time Holbein's mistress.&lt;ref&gt;North, 26; Wilson, 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Others dismiss the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Claussen, 50. Claussen dismisses the theory as &quot;pure nonsense&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the portraits was of [[Lais of Corinth]], mistress of [[Apelles]], the famous artist of Greek antiquity after whom Holbein was named in humanist circles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, it is likely that Holbein always supported his wife and children.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, ''et al'', 13; Wilson, 253, 268. Franz Schmid, Elsbeth's son by her first husband, travelled to Berne to take possession of Sigmund Holbein's estate in 1540. This implies that Hans Holbein's finances were still shared with his wife. Franz Schmid succeeded to the estate in Berne on 4 January 1541.&lt;/ref&gt; When Elsbeth died in 1549, she was well off and still owned many of Holbein's fine clothes; on the other hand, she had sold his portrait of her before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 253–54, 268, 278. Philipp and Jakob Holbein later became goldsmiths, the first moving to Augsburg, the second to London, where he died in 1552. The two daughters married merchants in Basel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Holbein died between 7 October and 29 November 1543 at the age of 45.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 277 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Karel van Mander]] stated in the early 17th century that he died of the plague. Wilson regards the story with caution, since Holbein's friends attended his bedside; and Peter Claussen suggests that he died of an infection.&lt;ref&gt;Claussen, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing himself as &quot;servant to the king's majesty&quot;, Holbein had made his will on 7 October at his home in [[Aldgate]]. The goldsmith John of Antwerp and a few German neighbours signed as witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein may have been in a hurry, because the will was not witnessed by a lawyer. On 29 November, John of Antwerp, the subject of several of Holbein's portraits, legally undertook the administration of the artist's last wishes. He presumably settled Holbein's debts, arranged for the care of his two children, and sold and dispersed his effects, including many designs and preliminary drawings that have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of Holbein's grave is unknown and may never have been marked. The churches of [[St Katherine Cree]] or [[St Andrew Undershaft]] in London are possible locations, being located near to his house.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 277; Foister, 168; Bätschmann and Griener, 10. From the location of his house, scholars deduce that Holbein was buried in either the church of [[St Katherine Cree]] or in that of [[St Andrew Undershaft]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences ===
[[File:Lais of Corinth, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|Holbein's ''[[Lais of Corinth (Hans Holbein the Younger)|Lais of Corinth]]'', 1526, reveals the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]. Oil and tempera on limewood, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]].]]

The first influence on Holbein was his father, [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], an accomplished religious artist and portraitist&lt;ref&gt;Ganz, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; who passed on his techniques as a religious artist and his gifts as a portraitist to his son.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, ''et al'', 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Holbein learned his craft in his father's workshop in [[Augsburg]], a city with a thriving book trade, where [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] flourished. Augsburg also acted as one of the chief &quot;ports of entry&quot; into Germany for the ideas of the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 16; North, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Holbein began his apprenticeship under Hans Herbster in Basel, he was already steeped in the late Gothic style, with its unsparing realism and emphasis on line, which influenced him throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, he was favoured by [[humanism|humanist]] patrons, whose ideas helped form his vision as a mature artist.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Swiss years, when he may have visited Italy, Holbein added an Italian element to his stylistic vocabulary. Scholars note the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s &quot;[[sfumato]]&quot; (smoky) technique on his work, for example in his ''Venus and Amor'' and ''Lais of Corinth''.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 41–43; Bätschmann and Griener, 135; Ganz, 4; Claussen, 50. ''Venus and Amor'' is sometimes considered a workshop portrait. Holbein also painted his own, very different, version of ''The Last Supper'', based on Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' in Milan.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Italians, Holbein learned the art of single-point [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and the use of antique motifs and architectural forms. In this, he may have been influenced by [[Andrea Mantegna]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 9–10; North, 14; Sander, 17–18. The influence of [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Andrea Solari]] has also been detected in Holbein's work, as well as that of the Venetian [[Giovanni Bellini]].&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative detail recedes in his late portraits, though the calculated precision remains. Despite assimilating Italian techniques and Reformation theology, Holbein's art in many ways extended the Gothic tradition. His portrait style, for example, remained distinct from the more sensuous technique of [[Titian]], and from the [[Mannerism]] of [[William Scrots]], Holbein's successor as King's Painter.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's portraiture, particularly his drawings, had more in common with that of [[Jean Clouet]], which he may have seen during his visit to France in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann and Griener, 134. His two drawings, done in France, of statues of [[John, Duke of Berry|Duc Jean de Berry]] (1340–1416) and his wife [[Joan II, Countess of Auvergne|Jeanne de Boulogne]] (d. 1438) &quot;suggest that Holbein learned the new technique in France&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted Clouet's method of drawing with coloured chalks on a plain ground, as well as his care over preliminary portraits for their own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 8–10; Bätschmann and Griener, 134–35; Müller, ''et al'', 30, 317. Bätschmann and Griener are not convinced that Holbein learned this directly from Clouet; they suggest he learned it from a mixture of French and Italian models. And Müller points out that, in any case, the technique was not unknown in Augsburg and Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; During his second stay in England, Holbein learned the technique of [[limning]], as practised by [[Lucas Horenbout]]. In his last years, he raised the art of the [[portrait miniature]] to its first peak of brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 7; North, 30; Rowlands, 88–90. [[Karel van Mander]] wrote in the early 17th century that &quot;Lucas&quot; taught Holbein illumination, but John Rowlands downplays Horenbout's influence on Holbein's miniatures, which he believes follow the techniques of Jean Clouet and the French school.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious works ===
[[File:The Abbot, from The Dance of Death, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|''The [[Abbot]]'', woodcut from the ''[[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]'' series, 1523–26, {{nowrap|6.5 x 4.8&amp;nbsp;cm}} inside frame]]

Holbein followed in the footsteps of Augsburg artists like his father and [[Hans Burgkmair]], who largely made their living from religious commissions. Despite calls for reform, the church in the late 15th century was [[Middle Ages|medieval]] in tradition. It maintained an allegiance to Rome and a faith in pieties such as pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and prayer for dead souls. Holbein's early work reflects this culture. The growing reform movement, led by humanists such as Erasmus and Thomas More, began, however, to change religious attitudes. Basel, where [[Martin Luther]]'s major works were published, became the main centre for the transmission of Reformation ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion can be charted in Holbein's work. His [[The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb|''Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb'']] of 1522 expresses a [[Humanism|humanist]] view of Christ in tune with the reformist climate in Basel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 32–33; Wilson, 88, 111; Ganz, 8; Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 88–90. Holbein knew Grünewald's ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece|Lamentation and Burial of Christ]]'' at [[Issenheim]], not far from Basel, where his father had worked in 1509 and between 1516 and 1517.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dance of Death'' (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval [[allegory]] of the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' as a reformist satire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 96–103. The prints were not published until 1538, perhaps because they were thought too subversive at a time of peasants' revolts. The series was left incomplete by the death of the blockcutter [[Hans Lützelburger]] in 1526, and was eventually published with 41 woodcuts by his heirs without mention of Holbein. The ten further designs were added in later editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's series of [[woodcut]]s shows the figure of &quot;Death&quot; in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death's skeleton clutches, even the pious.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 56–58, and Landau &amp; Parshall, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the '' Dance of Death'' Holbein completed '' Icones'' or ''Series of the Old Gosspel'' (It contains two works: ''The images of the stories of the Old Gospel'' and ''Portraits or printing boards of the story of the Old Gospel''). These works were arranged by Holbein with Melchior &amp; Gaspar Trechsel near 1526, later printed and edited in Latin by Jean &amp; Francois Frellon with 92 woodcuts. These two works also share the first four figures with the ''Dance of Death''.

It appears that the Trechsel brothers initially intended to hire Holbein for illustrating Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;9 September, Francisco González Echeverría VI International Meeting for the History of Medicine, (S-11: Biographies in History of Medicine (I)), Barcelona.

Holbein painted many large religious works between 1520 and 1526, including the ''Oberried Altarpiece'', the ''Solothurn Madonna'', and the ''Passion''. Only when Basel's reformers turned to iconoclasm in the later 1520s did his freedom and income as a religious artist suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbein continued to produce religious art, but on a much smaller scale. He designed satirical religious woodcuts in England. His small painting for private devotion, ''Noli Me Tangere'',&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 129; Foister, 127; Strong, 60; Rowlands, 130; Claussen, 49. Scholars are unsure of the exact date of ''Noli Me Tangere'', usually given as between 1524 and 1526, or whether it was painted in England, Basel, or even France. The traditional view that Henry VIII owned the painting is discounted by Strong and Rowlands.&lt;/ref&gt; has been taken as an expression of his personal religion. Depicting the moment when the risen Christ tells [[Mary Magdalene]] not to touch him, Holbein adheres to the details of the bible story.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 129–30. Wilson contrasts Holbein's treatment with the earlier, freer, interpretation by [[Titian]].&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century diarist [[John Evelyn]] wrote that he &quot;never saw so much reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Wilson, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbein has been described as &quot;the supreme representative of German Reformation art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;North, 24&quot; /&gt; The Reformation was a varied movement, however, and his position was often ambiguous. Despite his ties with Erasmus and More, he signed up to the revolution begun by [[Martin Luther]], which called for a return to the Bible and the overthrow of the papacy. In his woodcuts ''Christ as the Light of the World'' and ''The Selling of Indulgences'', Holbein illustrated attacks by Luther against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 116; Wilson, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he continued to work for Erasmians and known traditionalists. After his return from England to a reformed Basel in 1528, he resumed work both on Jakob Mayer's Madonna and on the murals for the Council Chamber of the Town Hall. The Madonna was an icon of traditional piety, while the [[Old Testament]] murals illustrated a reformist agenda.

Holbein returned to England in 1532 as [[Thomas Cromwell]] was about to transform religious institutions there. He was soon at work for Cromwell's propaganda machine, creating images in support of the [[Supreme Head|royal supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 5; Rowlands, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], he produced a series of small woodcuts in which biblical villains were dressed as monks.&lt;ref&gt;Foister, 140–41; Strong, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His reformist painting [http://www.christianmind.org/illus/Holbein/ ''The Old and the New Law''] identified the Old Testament with the &quot;Old Religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have detected subtler religious references in his portraits. In ''The Ambassadors'', for example, details such as the Lutheran [[hymn]] book and the crucifix behind the curtain allude to the context of the French mission.&lt;ref&gt;North, 94–95; Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein painted few religious images in the later part of his career.&lt;ref&gt;North, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on secular designs for decorative objects, and on portraits stripped of inessentials.

=== Portraits ===
[[File:Margaret, Lady Elyot by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Margaret à Barrow|Margaret, Lady Elyot'']], ''c.''&amp;nbsp;1532–34. [[Royal Collection]], Windsor Castle.]]
[[File:Sir Thomas Elyot by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Sir [[Thomas Elyot]]'', ''c.''&amp;nbsp;1532–34. [[Royal Collection]], [[Windsor Castle]].]]

For Holbein, &quot;everything began with a drawing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strong, 7&quot;&gt;Strong, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A gifted draughtsman, he was heir to a German tradition of line drawing and precise preparatory design. Holbein's chalk and ink portraits demonstrate his mastery of outline. He always made preparatory portraits of his sitters, though many drawings survive for which no painted version is known, suggesting that some were drawn for their own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 8; Rowlands, 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein produced relatively few portraits during his years in Basel. Among these were his 1516 studies of Jakob and Dorothea Meyer, sketched, like many of his father's portrait drawings, in [[silverpoint]] and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbein painted most of his portraits during his two periods in England. In the first, between 1526 and 1528, he used the technique of Jean Clouet for his preliminary studies, combining black and coloured chalks on unprimed paper. In the second, from 1532 to his death, he drew on smaller sheets of pink-primed paper, adding pen and brushwork in ink to the chalk.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 24–29; Foister, 103. Many of these studies have been coloured in or outlined in ink by later hands (&quot;made worse by mending&quot;), obstructing the analysis of Holbein's technique.&lt;/ref&gt; Judging by the three-hour sitting given to him by Christina of Denmark, Holbein could produce such portrait studies quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strong, 7&quot; /&gt; Some scholars believe that he used a mechanical device to help him trace the contours of his subjects' faces.&lt;ref&gt;Ganz, 11; Foister, 103. Foister, however, is doubtful, owing to &quot;the inconsistency in the sizes of the drawn heads&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein paid less attention to facial tones in his later drawings, making fewer and more emphatic strokes, but they are never formulaic.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 28; Rowlands, 118–20.&lt;/ref&gt; His grasp of spatial relationships ensures that each portrait, however sparely drawn, conveys the sitter's presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foister15&quot; /&gt;

Holbein's painted portraits were closely founded on drawing. Holbein transferred each drawn portrait study to the panel with the aid of geometrical instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganz, 5&quot;&gt;Ganz, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He then built up the painted surface in [[tempera]] and oil, recording the tiniest detail, down to each stitch or fastening of costume. In the view of art historian Paul Ganz, &quot;The deep glaze and the enamel-like lustre of the colouring were achieved by means of the metallic, highly polished crayon groundwork, which admitted of few corrections and, like the preliminary sketch, remained visible through the thin layer of colour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganz, 5&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Hans Holbein der Jüngere - Der Kaufmann Georg Gisze - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''Portrait of the Merchant [[Georg Giese]]'', 1532. Oil and tempera on oak, [[Berlin State Museums]].]]
The result is a brilliant portrait style in which the sitters appear, in Foister's words, as &quot;recognisably individual and even contemporary-seeming&quot; people, dressed in minutely rendered clothing that provides an unsurpassed source for the history of Tudor costume.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 5, 8; Foister, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's humanist clients valued individuality highly.&lt;ref&gt;North, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strong, his portrait subjects underwent &quot;a new experience, one which was a profound visual expression of humanist ideals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators differ in their response to Holbein's precision and objectivity as a portraitist. What some see as an expression of spiritual depth in his sitters, others have called mournful, aloof, or even vacant.  &quot;Perhaps an underlying coolness suffuses their countenances,&quot; wrote Holbein's 19th-century biographer [[Alfred Woltmann]], &quot;but behind this outward placidness lies hidden a breadth and depth of inner life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Michael, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics see the iconic and pared-down style of Holbein's later portraits as a regression. Kenyon Cox, for example, believes that his methods grew more primitive, reducing painting &quot;almost to the condition of medieval illumination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Michael, 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erna Auerbach]] relates the &quot;decorative formal flatness&quot; of Holbein's late art to the style of illuminated documents, citing the group portrait of Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons' Company.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts detect no loss of powers in Holbein's last phase.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the later 1530s, Holbein often placed his sitters in a three-dimensional setting. At times, he included classical and biblical references and inscriptions, as well as [[drapery]], architecture, and symbolic props. Such portraits allowed Holbein to demonstrate his virtuosity and powers of allusion and metaphor, as well as to hint at the private world of his subjects. His 1532 portrait of Sir [[Brian Tuke]], for example, alludes to the sitter's poor health, comparing his sufferings to those of [[Job (Bible)|Job]]. The depiction of the [[Holy Wounds|Five wounds of Christ]] and the inscription &quot;[[INRI]]&quot; on Tuke's crucifix are, according to scholars Bätschmann and Griener, &quot;intended to protect its owner against ill-health&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 177–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein portrays the merchant [[Georg Giese|Georg Gisze]] among elaborate symbols of science and wealth that evoke the sitter's personal [[iconography]]. However, some of Holbein's other portraits of Steelyard merchants, for example that of Derich Born, concentrate on the naturalness of the face. They prefigure the simpler style that Holbein favoured in the later part of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles de Solier]], Sieur de Morette, 1534. [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], [[Dresden]].]]
Study of Holbein's later portraits has been complicated by the number of copies and derivative works attributed to him. Scholars now seek to distinguish the true Holbeins by the refinement and quality of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 118–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The hallmark of Holbein's art is a searching and perfectionist approach discernible in his alterations to his portraits. In the words of art historian John Rowlands:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This striving for perfection is very evident in his portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush for just the right line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an unrivalled mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Miniatures ===

[[File:Holbein, Hans (II) - Mrs Jane Small, formerly Mrs Pemberton - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Jane Small]]'', portrait miniature, ''c.'' 1540. [[Gouache|Bodycolour]] on [[vellum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.]]

During his last decade, Holbein painted a number of [[portrait miniature|miniatures]]; small portraits worn as a kind of jewel. His miniature technique derived from the medieval art of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. His small panel portrait of Henry VIII shows an inter-penetration between his panel and miniature painting.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's large pictures had always contained a miniature-like precision. He now adapted this skill to the smaller form, somehow retaining a monumental effect.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve or so certain miniatures by Holbein that survive reveal his mastery of &quot;limning&quot;, as the technique was called.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 7; Gaunt, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; His miniature portrait of [[Jane Small]], with its rich blue background, crisp outlines, and absence of shading, is considered a masterpiece of the genre. According to art historian Graham Reynolds, Holbein &quot;portrays a young woman whose plainness is scarcely relieved by her simple costume of black-and-white materials, and yet there can be no doubt that this is one of the great portraits of the world. With remarkable objectivity Holbein has not added anything of himself or subtracted from his sitter's image; he has seen her as she appeared in a solemn mood in the cold light of his painting-room&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designs ===
[[File:Chimney-piece design, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|Design for a chimney-piece, ''c''. 1538–40. Pen and black ink with grey, blue, and red wash on paper, [[British Museum]], London.]]

Throughout his life, Holbein designed for both large-scale decorative works such as murals and smaller objects, including plate and jewellery. In many cases, his designs, or copies of them, are the sole evidence for such works. For example, his murals for the Hertenstein House in Lucerne and for the House of the Dance in Basel are known only through his designs. As his career progressed, he added Italian Renaissance motifs to his Gothic vocabulary.

Many of the intricate designs etched into suits of [[Greenwich armour]], including King Henry's own personal tournament harnesses, were based on designs by Holbein. His style continued to influence the unique form of English armour for nearly half a century after his death.

Holbein's cartoon for part of the dynastic Tudor wall painting at Whitehall reveals how he prepared for a large mural. It was made of 25 pieces of paper, each figure cut out and pasted onto the background.&lt;ref&gt;Foister, 95; Rowlands, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Holbein's designs for glass painting, metalwork, jewellery, and weapons also survive. All demonstrate the precision and fluidity of his draughtsmanship. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, &quot;These qualities so animate his decorative designs, whether individual motifs, such as his favoured serpentine mermen and women, or the larger shapes of cups, frames, and fountains, that they scintillate on paper even before their transformation into precious metal and stone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foister15&quot; /&gt;

Holbein's way of designing objects was to sketch preliminary ideas and then draw successive versions with increasing precision. His final draft was a presentation version. He often used traditional patterns for ornamental details such as foliage and branches. When designing precious objects, Holbein worked closely with craftsmen such as goldsmiths. His design work, suggests art historian John North, &quot;gave him an unparalleled feel for the textures of materials of all kinds, and it also gave him the habit of relating physical accessories to face and personality in his portraiture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;North, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although little is known of Holbein's workshop, scholars assume that his drawings were partly intended as sources for his assistants.

== Legacy and reputation ==
[[File:Study for portrait of the More family, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|300px|''Study for the Family Portrait of [[Thomas More]]'', ''c.'' 1527. Pen and brush in black on chalk sketch, Kunstmuseum Basel.]]
Holbein's fame owes something to that of his sitters. Several of his portraits have become [[cultural icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; He created the standard image of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;North, 29; Waterhouse, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In painting Henry as an iconic hero, however, he also subtly conveyed the tyranny of his character.&lt;ref&gt;North, 29; Ackroyd, 191; Brooke, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein's portraits of other historical figures, such as [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Thomas Cromwell]], have fixed their images for posterity. The same is true for the array of English lords and ladies whose appearance is often known only through his art. For this reason, John North calls Holbein &quot;the cameraman of Tudor history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;North, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, on the other hand, Holbein is regarded as an artist of the Reformation, and in Europe of humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Basel, Holbein's legacy was secured by his friend Amerbach and by Amerbach's son Basilius, who collected his work. The Amerbach-Kabinett later formed the core of the Holbein collection at the [[Kunstmuseum Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;Müller, ''et al'', 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Holbein's art was also valued in England, few 16th-century English documents mention him. Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]] (1504–75) observed that his portraits were &quot;dilineated and expressed to the resemblance of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 16th century, the miniature portraitist [[Nicholas Hilliard]] spoke in his treatise ''Arte of Limning'' of his debt to Holbein: &quot;Holbein's manner have I ever imitated, and hold it for the best&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; No account of Holbein's life was written until [[Karel van Mander]]'s often inaccurate &quot;Schilder-Boeck&quot; (Painter-Book) of 1604.&lt;ref&gt;North, 33–34; Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 146, 199–201. Among Van Mander's dubious anecdotes is the story that Holbein angrily threw a nobleman downstairs for pestering him.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man in a Black Cap, by John Bettes the Elder.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Man in a Black Cap'', by [[John Bettes the Elder]], 1545. Oil on oak, [[Tate Britain]], London.]]
Holbein's followers produced copies and versions of his work, but he does not seem to have founded a school.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 280–81; Gaunt, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Derek Wilson calls him one of the great &quot;one-offs&quot; of art history.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; The only artist who appears to have adopted his techniques was [[John Bettes the Elder]], whose ''Man in a Black Cap'' (1545) is close in style to Holbein.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars differ about Holbein's influence on English art. In Foister's view: &quot;Holbein had no real successors and few imitators in England. The disparity between his subtle, interrogatory portraits of men and women whose gazes follow us, and the stylised portraits of Elizabeth I and her courtiers can seem extreme, the more so as it is difficult to trace a proper stylistic succession to Holbein's work to bridge the middle of the century&quot;.&lt;ref name =Foister15&gt;Foister, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, &quot;modern&quot; painting in England may be said to have begun with Holbein.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; That later artists were aware of his work is evident in their own, sometimes explicitly. [[Hans Eworth]], for example, painted two full-length copies in the 1560s of Holbein's Henry VIII derived from the Whitehall pattern and included a Holbein in the background of his ''Mary Neville, Lady Dacre''.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 194–95; Brooke, 52–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Holbein's &quot;monumentality and attention to texture&quot; has been detected in Eworths' work.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian Erna Auerbach: &quot;Holbein's influence on the style of English portraiture was undoubtedly immense. Thanks to his genius, a portrait type was created which both served the requirements of the sitter and raised portraiture in England to a European level. It became the prototype of the English Court portrait of the Renaissance period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Holbein Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|upright|18th-century Holbein Chamber in [[Strawberry Hill House]].]]
The fashion for Old Masters in England after the 1620s created a demand for Holbein, led by the connoisseur [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel]]. The Flemish artists [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]] discovered Holbein through Arundel.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 202. [[Philip Fruytiers]] depicted Howard and his family with Holbein's portraits of his ancestors [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], and [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], in the background.&lt;/ref&gt; Arundel commissioned engravings of his Holbeins from the Czech [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], some of works now lost. From this time, Holbein's art was also prized in the Netherlands, where the picture dealer Michel Le Blon became a Holbein connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of Holbein's work was produced by the Frenchman Charles Patin and the Swiss Sebastian Faesch in 1656. They published it with Erasmus's [[The Praise of Folly|''Encomium moriæ'' (''The Praise of Folly'')]] and an inaccurate biography that portrayed Holbein as dissolute.

In the 18th century, Holbein found favour in Europe with those who saw his precise art as an antidote to the [[Baroque]]. In England, the connoisseur and antiquarian [[Horace Walpole]] (1717–97) praised him as a master of the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole hung his [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] house at [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] with copies of Holbeins and kept a Holbein room. From around 1780, a re-evaluation of Holbein set in, and he was enshrined among the canonical masters.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 208–209; Borchert, 191. Borchert terms this process the &quot;Romantic sacralization of the arts&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; A new cult of the sacral art masterpiece arose, endorsed by the German Romantics. This view suffered a setback during the famous controversy known as the &quot;''Holbein-Streit''&quot; (Holbein dispute) in the 1870s. It emerged that the revered Meyer ''Madonna'' at Dresden was a copy, and that the little-known version at Darmstadt was the Holbein original.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, 187–88. The copy at Dresden was made by Bartholomäus Sarburgh in about 1637.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, scholars have gradually removed the attribution to Holbein from many copies and derivative works. The current scholarly view of Holbein's art stresses his versatility, not only as a painter but as a draughtsman, printmaker, and designer.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, &quot;Introduction&quot;, in Roskill &amp; Hand, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Erika Michael believes that &quot;the breadth of his artistic legacy has been a significant factor in the sustained reception of his oeuvre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albrecht Giese''' (10 February, 1524 &amp;ndash; 1 August, 1580) was a councilman and diplomat of the city of [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk). He was a member of the Hanseatic League, and part of an important merchant family who had offices in London and Danzig. 

==Biography==
Giese was born in [[Danzig]], in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], to the influential and wealthy merchant [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] family Giese (or Gisze). The Giese family had emigrated from Unna, near Giesen, Cologne in 1430. &lt;ref&gt;Holman, T.S., &quot;Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,&quot; ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' vol. 14, 1980, pp  139-158&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of the [[Hanseatic League]], that had come to dominate European trade in the 14th and 15th-centuries.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Giese family maintained offices in [[London]], at the ''[[Steelyard]]'', where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated and his sons appear to have managed the London branch. &lt;ref&gt;Fudge, J.D., ''Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation,'' BRILL, 2007, p 110; Knight, C., ''London,'' Volumes 5-6, London, Charles Knight &amp; Company, 1851, pp 53-54; His son, Georg Giese was definitely there during the 1520s and 1530s, while another person by the name of Francis Guyse, possibly another son, is also mentioned in contemporary documents.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Albrecht studied at the Universities of [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]], [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] and [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. As was the custom of the time for [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants, he toured [[Europe]] for several years to learn different languages after his formal studies, as was necessary for a long-distance trader.  In 1564, on his return to Danzig, he married Elisabeth Langenbeck, whose uncle, Johann Ferber, had been the Mayor of Danzig. &lt;ref&gt;Ostdeutsche Familienkunde, [East German Family Studies], Volumes 10-12, Degener &amp; Company, 1962, p. 330; Gassendi, P. and Thill, O., ''The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543),'' 1945, p. 179; these authors suggest that his sons, Georg Tiedemann Giese may have been cousins to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], but the precise nature of the relationship is unclear&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Giese became a councilman. Over the next six years, he was Danzig's delegate at several Hanse meetings in [[Lübeck]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ostdeutsche Familienkunde, [East German Family Studies], Volumes 10-12, Degener &amp; Company, 1962, p. 330; His name is often mentioned in the Hanseatic Courts.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Open conflict between the Polish king and the city council broke out when the city council was arrested for opposing the loss of certain privileges according to the terms of the declared [[Union of Lublin]], which the city had not agreed to. Negotiations between the city and the king took place in 1568/69, initially at [[Piotrków Trybunalski]]. Giese was a member of a delegation, led by the mayor of the city, [[Johann Brandes]] in negotiations. Despite being subjected to severe pressure and incarceration for a year at [[Kraków]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, the delegation refused to submit to the king's terms, thereby upholding independence, Giese and Councilor [[Georg Kleefeld]] were eventually released in 1570 against a ransom of 100,000 [[guilder]]s.

Giese ultimately became Mayor of Danzig. In 1579, Giese was named royal [[burgrave]] of Danzig by the Polish king, a position that entailed the supervision of the judiciary system of the city. 

Albrect and Elisabeth Giese had at least seven children.&lt;ref&gt;Gassendi, P. and Thill, O., ''The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543),'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his sons enjoyed prominent careers. One of his older sons, [[Tiedemann Giese]], became the [[Bishop of Chełm]] (Culm) and later, [[Prince-Bishop of Warmia]] (Ermland), while one of the younger sons, [[Georg Giese]] became a merchant and who is noted for having his portrait painted by [[Hans Holbein the younger]].

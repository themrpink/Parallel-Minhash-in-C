In such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes called [[positive action]].

=====Apartheid=====
The [[apartheid]] government, as a matter of state policy, favoured white-owned, especially [[Afrikaner]]-owned companies. The aforementioned policies achieved the desired results, but in the process, they marginalised and excluded black people. Skilled jobs were also reserved for white people, and blacks were largely used as unskilled labour, enforced by legislation including the [[Mines and Works Act]], the [[Job Reservations Act]], the [[Native Building Workers Act]], the [[Apprenticeship Act]] and the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southendmuseum.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=20 |title=Job Reservations Act |publisher=South End Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating and extending the &quot;colour bar&quot; in South African labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/luli-35 |title=White Workers and the Colour Bar |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |accessdate=31 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319002102/http://www.sahistory.org.za/luli-35 |archivedate=19 March 2014 |date=3 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the blacks' employment opportunities.

Since the 1960s the apartheid laws had been weakened. Consequently, from 1975 to 1990 the real wages of black manufacturing workers rose by 50%, while those of whites rose by 1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;africa&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/244570 Race, law and poverty in the new South Africa], The Economist, 30 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The variation in skills and productivity between groups of people ultimately caused disparities in employment, occupation and income within labour markets, which provided advantages to certain groups and characteristics of people. This in due course was the motivation to introduce affirmative action in South Africa, following the end of apartheid.&lt;ref name=prob&gt;{{cite web |last=Stokes|first= G. |date=15 March 2010 |title=The problem with affirmative action |url=http://www.fanews.co.za/article.asp?Front_Page_Features~25,Stokes_Stage~1145,The_problem_with_affirmative_action~7618 |publisher=Fanews.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Post-apartheid – the Employment Equity Act=====
Following the transition to democracy in 1994, the [[African National Congress]]-led government chose to implement affirmative action legislation to correct previous imbalances (a policy known as employment equity). As such, all employers were compelled by law to employ previously disenfranchised groups (blacks, [[Indian South Africans|Indians]], and [[Coloureds]]). A related, but distinct concept is [[Black Economic Empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318215653/http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Employment Equity Act]] and the [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] Act aim to promote and achieve equality in the workplace (in South Africa termed &quot;equity&quot;), by advancing people from designated groups. The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[people with disabilities]] (including white people). Employment Equity legislation requires companies employing more than 50 people to design and implement plans to improve the representativity of workforce demographics, and report them to the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |title=Employment Equity FAQ |publisher=Southafrica.info |accessdate=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401103321/http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |archivedate=1 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment Equity also forms part of a company's [[Black Economic Empowerment]] scorecard: in a relatively complex scoring system, which allows for some flexibility in the manner in which each company meets its legal commitments, each company is required to meet minimum requirements in terms of representation by previously disadvantaged groups. The matters covered include equity ownership, representation at employee and management level (up to the board of director level), procurement from black-owned businesses and social investment programs, amongst others.

The policies of Employment Equity and, particularly, Black Economic empowerment have been criticised both by those who view them as discriminatory against white people, and by those who view them as ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-02-03-bees-glass-slipper |title=BEE's Glass Slipper |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page292679?oid=346519&amp;sn=2009+Detail+no+image&amp;pid=295799 |title=BEE: A man made disaster |publisher=Moneyweb.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fin24.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |title='SAB deal to enrich black elite': Fin24: Companies |publisher=Fin24 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093857/http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |archivedate=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516113211/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2016 |title=Business Report – Home – Motlanthe warns BEE council has failed |publisher=Busrep.co.za |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-20-manyi-vows-to-get-tough-over-bee |title=Manyi vows to get tough over BEE – Mail &amp; Guardian Online: The smart news source |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws cause disproportionally high costs for small companies and reduce economic growth and employment.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt; The laws may give the black middle-class some advantage but can make the worse-off blacks even poorer.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt; Moreover, the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] has ruled that in principle blacks may be favored, but in practice this should not lead to unfair discrimination against the others.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt;

=====Affirmative action purpose=====
Affirmative action was introduced through the Employment Equality Act, 55 in 1998, 4 years after the end of apartheid. This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy. This idea was to eliminate unfair discrimination in employment, to ensure the implementation of employment equity to redress the effects of discrimination, to achieve a diverse workforce broadly representative of our people, to promote economic development and efficiency in the workforce and to give effects to the obligations of the Republic as a member of the International Labour Organisation.&lt;ref name=prob/&gt;&lt;ref name=aff&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergmann |first=B. |year=1999 |title=The continuing need for affirmative action |journal=The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=757–768 |doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(99)00027-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many embraced the act; however some concluded that the act contradicted itself.  The act eliminates unfair discrimination in certain sectors of the national labour market by imposing similar constraints on another.&lt;ref name=prob/&gt;

With the introduction of Affirmative Action, [[black economic empowerment]] (BEE) rose further in South Africa.  The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential.  The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy.  This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, &quot;As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth&quot;.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment. (n.d.) |url=http://www.southafrica.info/business/trends/empowerment/bee.htm |publisher=Southafrica.info |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101222356/http://southafrica.info/business/trends/empowerment/bee.htm |archivedate=1 November 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franchi|first= V. |year=2003 |title=The racialization of affirmative action in organizational discourses: A case study of symbolic racism in post-apartheid South Africa |volume= 27 |issue= 2 |pages= 157–187 |journal= International Journal of Intercultural Relations |doi= 10.1016/S0147-1767(02)00091-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarities between the BEE and affirmative action are apparent; however there is a difference.  BEE focuses more on employment equality rather than taking wealth away from the skilled white labourers.&lt;ref name=info/&gt;

The main goal of affirmative action is for the country to reach its full potential.  This would result in a completely diverse workforce in economic and social sectors, thus broadening the economic base and stimulating economic growth.&lt;ref name=dem&gt;{{cite web|last=Edigheji |first=O. |year=2006 |title=Affirmative action and state capacity in a democratic South Africa.

=====Outcomes=====
{{debate|section|date=May 2018}}
Once applied within the country, many different outcomes arose, some positive and some negative. This depended on the approach to and the view of The Employment Equality Act and affirmative action.

'''Positive:'''
Pre-Democracy, the apartheid governments discriminated against non-white races, so with affirmative action, the country started to redress past discriminations. Affirmative action also focused on combating structural racism and racial inequality, hoping to maximize diversity in all levels of society and sectors.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;Goga, F. (n.d.). ''A critique of affirmative action: The concept''. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622114513/http://ccms.ukzn.ac.za/index.php |archivedate=22 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving this would elevate the status of the perpetual underclass and to restore equal access to the benefits of society.&lt;ref name=prob/&gt;

'''Negative:'''
As with all policies, there have also been negative outcomes. A quota system was implemented, which aimed to achieve targets of diversity in a workforce. This target affected the hiring and level of skills in the workforce, ultimately impacting the free market.&lt;ref name=dem/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; Affirmative action created marginalization for coloured and Indian races in South Africa, as well as developing and aiding the middle and elite classes, leaving the lower class behind. This created a bigger gap between the lower and middle class, which led to class struggles and a greater segregation.&lt;ref name=aff/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; Entitlement began to arise with the growth of the middle and elite classes, as well as race entitlement. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} assert that affirmative action is discrimination in reverse. Negative consequences of affirmative action, specifically the quota system, drove skilled labour away, resulting in bad economic growth. This is due to very few international companies wanting to invest in South Africa.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt; As a result of the outcomes of affirmative action, the concept is continually evolving.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture&quot; /&gt;

South African jurist [[Martin van Staden]] argues that the way affirmative action and transformation policies have been implemented in South Africa has eroded state institutions, grown [[Corruption in South Africa|corruption]], and undermined the [[rule of law]] in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-opinion/columnists/a-government-unhinged-2/|title=A government unhinged|last=Ryan|first=Ciaran|date=16 September 2019|website=Moneyweb|access-date=17 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ruleoflaw.org.za/the-constitution-and-the-rule-of-law/|title=The Constitution and the Rule of Law: An Introduction|last=van Staden|first=Martin|date=8 February 2019|website=Rule of Law Project|language=en-US|isbn=978-0-9921788-6-4|access-date=17 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is affirmative action in education for minority nationalities. This may equate to lowering minimum requirements for the National University Entrance Examination, which is a mandatory exam for all students to enter university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.cn/edoas/website18/30/info26630.htm Graduate Student Admission Ordainment – Ministry of Education, PRC]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzzjw.gd.gov.cn/mzjy/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=541 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105011631/http://www.mzzjw.gd.gov.cn/mzjy/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=541 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 January 2009 |title=Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province |publisher=Mzzjw.gd.gov.cn |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities set quotas for minority (non-Han) student intake. Further, minority students enrolled in ethnic minority-oriented specialties (e.g. language and literature programs) are provided with scholarships and/or pay no tuition, and are granted a monthly stipend.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Israel====
A class-based affirmative action policy was incorporated into the admission practices of the four most selective universities in [[Israel]] during the early to mid-2000s. In evaluating the eligibility of applicants, neither their financial status nor their national or ethnic origins are considered. The emphasis, rather, is on structural disadvantages, especially neighborhood socioeconomic status and high school rigor, although several individual hardships are also weighed. This policy made the four institutions, especially the echelons at the most selective departments, more diverse than they otherwise would have been. The rise in geographic, economic and demographic diversity of a student population suggests that the plan's focus on structural determinants of disadvantage yields broad diversity dividends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alon, Sigal |year=2011 |title=The Diversity Dividends of a Need-blind and Color-blind Affirmative Action Policy |pages=1494–1505 |journal= Social Science Research |volume=40 |issue=6 |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2011.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli citizens who are women, Arabs, Blacks or people with disabilities are supported by affirmative action in the civil service employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;moital.gov.il&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/8C492E47-135C-4B82-84D7-C62254B8BFEF.htm|title=משרד הכלכלה והתעשייה|website=משרד הכלכלה והתעשייה|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Israeli citizens who are Arabs, Blacks or people with disabilities are entitled to full university scholarships by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;che.org.il&quot;&gt;http://che.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A1-1-%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%93.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In her study of gender politics in Israel, Dafna Izraeli showed that the paradox of affirmative action for women directors is that the legitimation for legislating their inclusion on boards also resulted in the exclusion of women's interested as a legitimate issue on the boards' agendas. &quot;The new culture of the men's club is seductive token women are under the pressure to become &quot;social males&quot; and prove that their competence as directors, meaning that they are not significantly different from men. In the negotiation for status as worthy peers, emphasizing gender signals that a woman is an &quot;imposter&quot;, someone who does not rightfully belong in the position she is claiming to fill.&quot; And once affirmative action for women is fulfilled, and then affirmative action shares the element, as Izraeli put it, the &quot;group equality discourse,&quot; making it easier for other groups to claim for a fairer distribution of resources. This suggests that affirmative action can have applications for different groups in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dafna |last=Izraeli |title=Gender Politics in Israel: The Case of Affirmative Action for Women Directors |journal=Women's Studies International Forum |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |date=March–April 2003 |doi=10.1016/S0277-5395(03)00043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu}}

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of ethical affirmative action. Malaysia provides affirmative action to the majority to those that are deemed &quot;Bumiputera&quot;, which includes the Malay population/Orang Asli as well as to the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak. However, the indigenous people of Malaysia (Orang Asli) do not have the same special rights of the rest of the Bumiputera as granted under Article 153, as the Orang Asli are not referenced within the article 153 itself.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.usm.my/km/KM%2021,2003/21-i.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical/common argument is that the Malays have lower incomes than the Chinese and Indians, who have traditionally been involved in businesses and industries, who were also general migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecineq.org/ecineq_paris19/papers_EcineqPSE/paper_406.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Malaysia-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html |title=Encyclopedia of the Nations, &quot;Malaysia Poverty and Wealth&quot; |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority of close to 52% of the population. About 23% of the population is [[Chinese Malaysian|of Chinese descent]], while [[Indian Malaysian|those of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) has been dubbed a failure as of recent years, as evidence has pointed to the ever-growing wealth disparity among Malays, that have widened the gap between the rich and poor Malays, while the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] has been shown to benefit the existing rich Malays instead of achieving its intention of helping poor Malays.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In 1981 the [[Policy of standardisation|Standardization policy]] of [[Sri Lanka]]n universities was introduced as an affirmative action program for students from areas which had lower rates of education than other areas due to missionary activity in the north and east, which essentially were the Tamil areas. Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact, showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide &amp; Rule Ceylon? &amp;#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
Greenlanders have special advantages when applying for university, college or vocation university degrees in Denmark. With these specific rules, Greenlanders can get into degrees without the required grade averages by fulfilling certain criteria. They need to have a grade average of over 6,0 and have lived a certain amount of years in Greenland. These rules have been in force since 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=lok|title=Optagelse af grønlandske ansøgere — Uddannelses- og Forskningsministeriet|url=https://ufm.dk/uddannelse/videregaende-uddannelse/sogning-optag-og-vejledning/optagelse/optagelse-af-gronlandske-ansogere|access-date=2020-08-29|website=ufm.dk|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Finland ====
In certain university education programs, including legal and medical education, there are quotas for persons who reach a certain standard of skills in the [[Swedish language]]; for students admitted in these quotas, the education is partially arranged in Swedish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helsinki med&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hakuopas 2011.

In addition to these linguistic quotas, women may get preferential treatment in recruitment for certain public sector jobs if there is a gender imbalance in the field.

==== France ====
No distinctions based on race, religion or sex are allowed under the 1958 [[French Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan D. Mott, PhD |url=http://thisnation.com/library/france.html |title=The French Constitution of 1958 and its Amendments |publisher=Thisnation.com |date=7 February 1992 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, a French version of affirmative action based on neighborhood is in place for primary and secondary education. Some schools, in neighborhoods labeled &quot;Priority Education Zones&quot;, are granted more funds than the others. Students from these schools also benefit from special policies in certain institutions (such as [[Sciences Po]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.3989/chdj.2015.016|title = Esencia colonial de una política contemporánea: Por un enfoque fanoniano de la discriminación positiva en Francia| journal=Culture &amp; History Digital Journal| volume=4| issue=2| pages=e016|year = 2015|last1 = Ghorbal|first1 = Karim| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Ministry of Defence tried in 1990 to make it easier for young French soldiers of North-African descent to be promoted in rank and obtain driving licenses. After a strong protest by a young French lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Steinhofer, &quot;Beur ou ordinaire&quot;, ''Armée d'ajourd'hui'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Ministry of Defence newspaper (''Armées d'aujourd'hui''), the driving license and rank plan was cancelled. After the Sarkozy election, a new attempt in favour of Arab-French students was made, but Sarkozy did not gain enough political support to change the French constitution. However, some French schools do implement affirmative action in that they are obligated to take a certain number of students from impoverished families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/12/17/le-plan-sarkozy-pour-favoriser-l-egalite-reelle-des-chances_1132074_823448.html#ens_id=1128487° |title=Le Plan Sarkozy |work=Le Monde  |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=11 April 2012|last1=Eeckhout |first1=Laetitia Van }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, following the Norwegian example, after 27 January 2014, women must represent at least 20% of board members in all stock exchange listed or state-owned companies. After 27 January 2017, the proportion will increase to 40%. All appointments of males as directors will be invalid as long as the quota is not met, and monetary penalties may apply for other directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/panorama/texte-discussion/proposition-loi-relative-representation-equilibree-femmes-hommes-au-sein-conseils-administration-surveillance-egalite-professionnelle.html |title=Vie Publique |publisher=Vie-publique.fr |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Article 3 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides for equal rights of all people regardless of sex, race or social background. There are programs stating that if men and women have equal qualifications, women have to be preferred for a job; moreover, the disabled should be preferred to non-disabled people. This is typical for all positions in state and university service {{as of|2007|lc=y}}, typically using the phrase &quot;We try to increase diversity in this line of work&quot;. In recent years, there has been a long public debate about whether to issue programs that would grant women a privileged access to jobs in order to fight discrimination. Germany's ''[[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]]'' brought up the discussion about affirmative action in [[Education in Germany|Germany's school system]]. According to [[Stefan Zillich]], quotas should be &quot;a possibility&quot; to help working class children who did not do well in school gain access to a ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' (University-preparatory school).&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Vieth-Entus (29. December 2008): &quot;Sozialquote: Berliner Gymnasien sollen mehr Schüler aus armen Familien aufnehmen&quot;. Der Tagesspiegel&lt;/ref&gt; Headmasters of ''Gymnasien'' have objected, saying that this type of policy would &quot;be a disservice&quot; to poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klesmann (23 February 2009). &quot;'Kinder aus Neukölln würden sich nicht integrieren lassen' – Ein Politiker und ein Schulleiter streiten über Sozialquoten an Gymnasien&quot;. Berliner Zeitung&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
In all [[Allmennaksjeselskap|public stock companies (ASA)]] boards, either gender should be represented by at least 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19970613-045-032.html#6-3 |title=LOV-1997-06-13-45 Lov om allmennaksjeselskaper (allmennaksjeloven) |publisher=Lovdata.no |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects roughly 400 companies of over 300,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/27-000-flere-bedrifter-i-norge/1874337.html |title=27.000 flere bedrifter i Norge |publisher=nettavisen.no |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seierstad &amp; Opsahl in their study of the effects of affirmative action on presence, prominence, and social capital of women directors in Norway found that there are few boards chaired by a woman, from the beginning of the implementation of the affirmative action policy period to August 2009, the proportion of boards led by a woman has increased from 3.4% to 4.3%. This suggests that the law has had a marginal effect on the sex of the chair and the boards remain internally segregated. Although at the beginning of our observation period, only 7 of 91 prominent directors were women. The gender balance among prominent directors has changed considerably throughout the period, and at the end of the period, 107 women and 117 men were prominent directors. By applying more restrictive definitions of prominence, the proportion of directors who are women generally increases. If only considering directors with at least three directorships, 61.4% of them are women. When considering directors with seven or more directorships, all of them are women. Thus, affirmative action increases the female population in the director position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seierstad |first1=Cathrine |last2=Opsahl |first2=Tore |title=For the few not the many?

A 2016 study found no effect of the ASA representation requirement on either valuation or profits of the affected companies, and also no correlation between the requirement and the restructuring of companies away from ASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e24.no/makro-og-politikk/norges-handelshoeyskole/studie-kjoennskvotering-ingen-effekt-paa-loennsomhet/23783217 |title=Studie: Kjønnskvotering ingen effekt på lønnsomhet |publisher=e24.no |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckbo|first1=Espen|last2=Nygaard|first2=Knut|last3=Thorburn|first3=Karin|title=How Costly Is Forced Gender-Balancing of Corporate Boards?|journal=European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI) – Finance Working Paper No. 463/2016; Tuck School of Business Working Paper No. 2746786|date=26 December 2016|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2746786|s2cid=211708386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romani people]] are allocated quotas for access to public schools and state universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmuncii.ro/old/ro/domenii-politici-familiale-incluziune-si-asistenta-sociala-romii---progrese-inregistrate-in-romania-in-perioada-2007---2008-540-view.html |title=Romii – PROGRESE ÎNREGISTRATE ÎN ROMÂNIA ÎN PERIOADA 2007–2008 |accessdate=30 January 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Quota systems existed in the [[USSR]] for various social groups including [[ethnic minorities]] (as compensation of their &quot;[[cultural backwardness]]&quot;), women and factory workers. 

Soon after the 1918 revolution, [[Inessa Armand]], [[Lenin]]'s secretary and lover, was instrumental in creating [[Zhenotdel]], which functioned until the 1930s as part of the international egalitarian and affirmative action movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stites |first1=Richard |title=Zhenotdel: Bolshevism and Russian Women, 1917-1930 |journal=Russian History |date=1976 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=174–193 |doi=10.1163/187633176X00107 |jstor=24649711 |quote=These egalitarian and affirmative action movements—in other words, early &quot;communism&quot;—receive short shrift in most Western studies... }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Patterson |first1=Michelle Jane |title=Red 'Teaspoons of Charity': Zhenotdel, Russian Women, and the Communist Party, 1919-1930 |date=29 February 2012 |hdl=1807/32159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1057/9780230501799_11 |chapter=Socialism in One Gender: Masculine Values in the Stalin Revolution |title=Russian Masculinities in History and Culture |year=2002 |last1=Schrand |first1=Thomas G. |pages=194–209 |isbn=978-1-349-42592-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotas for access to university education, offices in the Soviet system and the Communist Party existed: for example, the position of First Secretary of a Soviet Republic's (or Autonomous Republic's) Party Committee was always filled by a representative of this republic's &quot;[[titular ethnicity]]&quot;.

Modern Russia retains this system partially. Quotas are abolished, but preferences for some ethnic minorities and inhabitants of certain territories remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sakhapress.ru/archives/207211|title=Представители коренных малочисленных народов Севера имеют право получить бесплатную юридическую помощь|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

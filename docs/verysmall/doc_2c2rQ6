Some transcriptions are [[Broad transcription|broader]] or [[Narrow transcription|narrower]] (less precise or more precise phonetically) than others. Transcribing the English diphthongs in ''high'' and ''cow'' as {{angbr IPA|aj aw}} or {{angbr IPA|ai̯ au̯}} is a less precise or broader transcription, since these diphthongs usually end in a vowel sound that is [[Vowel#Height|more open]] than the semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}} or the [[close vowel]]s {{IPA|[i u]}}. Transcribing the diphthongs as {{angbr IPA|aɪ̯ aʊ̯}} is a more precise or narrower transcription, since the English diphthongs usually end in the [[near-close vowel]]s {{IPA|[ɪ ʊ]}}.

The non-syllabic [[diacritic]], the [[inverted breve]] below {{angbr|◌̯}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fileformat.info FileFormat.Info], page on [https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/032f/index.htm combining inverted breve below]&lt;/ref&gt; is placed under the less prominent part of a diphthong to show that it is part of a diphthong rather than a vowel in a separate syllable: {{IPA|[aɪ̯ aʊ̯]}}. When there is no contrastive vowel sequence in the language, the diacritic may be omitted. Other common indications that the two sounds are not separate vowels are a superscript, {{angbr IPA|aᶦ aᶷ}},&lt;ref&gt;Used e.g. by {{Citation|last=Donaldson|first=Bruce C.|year=1993|title=A Grammar of Afrikaans|chapter=1. Pronunciation|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|pages=8–9|isbn=9783110134261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC}} The author states that the Afrikaans diphthongs {{IPA|/eə øə oə/}} can be transcribed {{IPA|/eᵊ øᵊ oᵊ/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a tie bar, {{angbr IPA|a͡ɪ a͡ʊ}} or {{angbr IPA|a͜ɪ a͜ʊ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Used e.g. by {{Citation|last=Mangold|first=Max|authorlink=Max Mangold|year=2005|title=Das Aussprachewörterbuch|publisher=Duden|edition=6th|pages=36–37|isbn=978-3411040667}}. The author transcribes the diphthongs {{angbr|ai au eu}} as {{IPA|[a͜i a͜u ɔ͜y]}}. However, on page 36, he admits that phonetically, {{IPA|[aɪ̯ aʊ̯ ɔʏ̯]}} are more precise symbols.&lt;/ref&gt; The tie bar can be useful when it is not clear which symbol represents the syllable nucleus, or when they have equal weight.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti (2000) ''Fonetica generale'', p 224&lt;/ref&gt; Superscripts are especially used when an on- or off-glide is particularly fleeting.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Allen &amp; Hawkins (1978) ''Development of Phonological Rhythm'' contranst {{angbr IPA|aɪ}} from {{angbr IPA|a͜ɪ}} from {{angbr IPA|aᶦ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period {{angbr IPA|.}} is the opposite of the non-syllabic diacritic: it represents a syllable break. If two vowels next to each other belong to two different [[syllable]]s ([[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]), meaning that they do not form a diphthong, they can be transcribed with two vowel symbols with a period in between. Thus, ''lower'' can be transcribed {{angbr IPA|ˈloʊ.ər}}, with a period separating the first syllable, {{IPAc-en|l|oʊ}}, from the second syllable, {{IPAc-en|ər}}.

The non-syllabic diacritic is used only when necessary. It is typically omitted when there is no ambiguity, as in {{angbr IPA|haɪ kaʊ}}. No words in English have the vowel sequences {{IPA|*[a.ɪ a.ʊ]}}, so the non-syllabic diacritic is unnecessary.

==Types==

===Falling and rising===
'''Falling''' (or '''descending''') diphthongs start with a vowel quality of higher [[prominence (phonetics)|prominence]] (higher pitch or volume) and end in a semivowel with less prominence, like {{IPA|[aɪ̯]}} in ''eye'',  while '''rising''' (or '''ascending''') diphthongs begin with a less prominent semivowel and end with a more prominent full vowel, similar to the {{IPA|[ja]}} in ''yard''. (Note that &quot;falling&quot; and &quot;rising&quot; in this context do ''not'' refer to [[vowel height]]; for that, the terms &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot; are used instead.  See below.) The less prominent component in the diphthong may also be transcribed as an [[approximant]], thus {{IPA|[aj]}} in ''eye'' and {{IPA|[ja]}} in ''yard''. However, when the diphthong is analysed as a single [[phoneme]], both elements are often transcribed with vowel symbols ({{IPA|/aɪ̯/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ̯a/}}). Semivowels and approximants are not equivalent in all treatments, and in the [[English (language)|English]] and [[Italian (language)|Italian]] languages, among others, many [[phonetician]]s do not consider rising combinations to be diphthongs, but rather sequences of approximant and vowel. There are many languages (such as [[#Romanian|Romanian]]) that contrast one or more rising diphthongs with similar sequences of a glide and a vowel in their phonetic inventory&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiorana&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2002a|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[semivowel]] for examples).

===Closing, opening, and centering===
[[File:Belgian Dutch diphthongs chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Vowel diagram]] illustrating closing diphthongs of Belgian Standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]], from {{Harvcoltxt|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}]]
[[File:Orsmaal-Gussenhoven Dutch centering diphthongs chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Vowel diagram illustrating centering diphthongs of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialect of [[Orsmaal-Gussenhoven dialect|Orsmaal-Gussenhoven]], from {{Harvcoltxt|Peters|2010|p=241}}]]
In '''closing''' diphthongs, the second element is more [[close vowel|close]] than the first (e.g. {{IPA|[ai]}}); in '''opening''' diphthongs, the second element is more [[open vowel|open]] (e.g. {{IPA|[ia]}}). Closing diphthongs tend to be falling ({{IPA|[ai̯]}}), and opening diphthongs are generally rising ({{IPA|[i̯a]}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=diphthong}}&lt;/ref&gt; as open vowels are more [[sonorant|sonorous]] and therefore tend to be more prominent. However, exceptions to this rule are not rare in the world's languages. In [[Finnish phonology|Finnish]], for instance, the opening diphthongs {{IPA|/ie̯/}} and {{IPA|/uo̯/}} are true falling diphthongs, since they begin louder and with higher pitch and fall in prominence during the diphthong.

A third, rare type of diphthong that is neither opening nor closing is '''height-harmonic''' diphthongs, with both elements at the same vowel height.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Hogg, [[Norman Blake (academic)|Norman Blake]], R. W. Burchfield, ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', CUP 1992, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  These occurred in [[Old English]]:
* ''beorht'' {{IPA|[beo̯rxt]}} &quot;bright&quot;
* ''ċeald'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃæɑ̯ld]}} &quot;cold&quot;

A '''centering''' diphthong is one that begins with a more peripheral vowel and ends with a more central one, such as {{IPA|[ɪə̯]}}, {{IPA|[ɛə̯]}}, and {{IPA|[ʊə̯]}} in [[Received Pronunciation]] or {{IPA|[iə̯]}} and {{IPA|[uə̯]}} in [[Irish language|Irish]]. Many centering diphthongs are also opening diphthongs ({{IPA|[iə̯]}}, {{IPA|[uə̯]}}).

Diphthongs may contrast in how far they open or close. For example, [[Samoan language|Samoan]] contrasts low-to-mid with low-to-high diphthongs:
* ''’ai'' {{IPA|[ʔai̯]}} 'probably'
* ''’ae'' {{IPA|[ʔae̯]}} 'but'
* ''’auro'' {{IPA|[ʔau̯ɾo]}} 'gold'
* ''ao'' {{IPA|[ao̯]}} 'a cloud'

===Narrow and wide===
'''Narrow''' diphthongs are the ones that end with a vowel which on a vowel chart is quite close to the one that begins the diphthong, for example Northern Dutch {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, {{IPA|[øʏ]}} and {{IPA|[oʊ]}}. '''Wide''' diphthongs are the opposite - they require a greater tongue movement, and their offsets are farther away from their starting points on the vowel chart. Examples of wide diphthongs are RP/GA English {{IPA|[aɪ]}} and {{IPA|[aʊ]}}.

===Length===
Languages differ in the length of diphthongs, measured in terms of [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]].  In languages with phonemically short and long vowels, diphthongs typically behave like long vowels, and are pronounced with a similar length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd_6DAAAQBAJ&amp;q=diphthongs+typically+behave+like+long+vowels%2C+and+are+pronounced+with+a+similar+length&amp;pg=PA75|title=The Morphology of Loanwords in Urdu: The Persian, Arabic and English Strands|last=Mangrio|first=Riaz Ahmed|date=2016-06-22|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443896634|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In languages with only one phonemic length for pure vowels, however, diphthongs may behave like pure vowels.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}  For example, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], both monophthongs and diphthongs are pronounced long before single consonants and short before most consonant clusters.

Some languages contrast '''short''' and '''long''' diphthongs.  In some languages, such as [[Old English]], these behave like short and long vowels, occupying one and two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]], respectively. Languages that contrast three quantities in diphthongs are extremely rare, but not unheard of; [[Northern Sami]] is known to contrast long, short and &quot;finally stressed&quot; diphthongs, the last of which are distinguished by a long second element.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Phonology==
In some languages, diphthongs are single [[phoneme]]s, while in others they are analyzed as sequences of two vowels, or of a vowel and a semivowel.

==Sound changes==
Certain sound changes relate to diphthongs and [[monophthong]]s. [[Vowel breaking]] or diphthongization is a [[vowel shift]] in which a monophthong becomes a diphthong. [[Monophthongization]] or smoothing is a vowel shift in which a diphthong becomes a monophthong.

==Difference from semivowels and vowel sequences==

While there are a number of similarities, diphthongs are not the same phonologically as a combination of a vowel and an approximant or glide.  Most importantly, diphthongs are fully contained in the syllable nucleus&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kaye|Lowenstamm|1984|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schane|1995|p=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a semivowel or glide is restricted to the syllable boundaries (either the onset or the coda). This often manifests itself phonetically by a greater degree of constriction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2007|p=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the phonetic distinction is not always clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schane|1995|p=606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''yes'', for example, consists of a palatal glide followed by a monophthong rather than a rising diphthong. In addition, the segmental elements must be different in diphthongs {{IPA|[ii̯]}} and so when it occurs in a language, it does not contrast with {{IPA|[iː]}}. However, it is possible for languages to contrast {{IPA|[ij]}} and {{IPA|[iː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schane|1995|pp=589, 606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diphthongs are also distinct from sequences of simple vowels. The [[Bunaq language]] of Timor, for example, distinguishes {{IPA|/sa͡i/ [saj]}} 'exit' from {{IPA|/sai/ [saʲi]}} 'be amused', {{IPA|/te͡i/ [tej]}} 'dance' from {{IPA|/tei/ [teʲi]}} 'stare at', and {{IPA|/po͡i/ [poj]}} 'choice' from {{IPA|/loi/ [loʷi]}} 'good'.&lt;ref&gt;Antoinette Schapper (2017), ''The Papuan Languages of Timor, Alor and Pantar'', vol. 2, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In words coming from [[Middle English]], most cases of the Modern English diphthongs {{IPA|[aɪ̯, oʊ̯, eɪ̯, aʊ̯]}} originate from the Middle English long monophthongs {{IPA|[iː, ɔː, aː, uː]}} through the [[Great Vowel Shift]], although some cases of {{IPA|[oʊ̯, eɪ̯]}} originate from the [[Middle English phonology#Diphthongs|Middle English diphthongs]] {{IPA|[ɔu̯, aɪ̯]}}. Due to complex regional variation [[Hiberno-English#Gliding vowels (diphthongs)|Hiberno-English diphthongs]] are not enumerated below.

=====Standard German=====
Phonemic diphthongs in [[German phonology|German]]:
*{{IPA|/aɪ̯/}} as in ''Ei'' ‘egg’
*{{IPA|/aʊ̯/}} as in ''Maus'' ‘mouse’
*{{IPA|/ɔʏ̯/}} as in ''neu'' ‘new’

In the varieties of German that [[Speech production|vocalize]] the {{IPA|/r/}} in the [[syllable coda]], other diphthongal combinations may occur. These are only phonetic diphthongs, not phonemic diphthongs, since the vocalic pronunciation {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}} alternates with consonantal pronunciations of {{IPA|/r/}} if a vowel follows, cf. ''du hörst'' {{IPA|[duː ˈhøːɐ̯st]}} ‘you hear’ – ''ich höre'' {{IPA|[ʔɪç ˈhøːʀə]}} ‘I hear’. These phonetic diphthongs may be as follows:

:{{note|1|1}}{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}} notes that the length contrast is not very stable before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/r/}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiese198&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;{{Harvcoltxt|Meinhold|Stock|1980|p=180}}, following the pronouncing dictionaries ({{Harvcoltxt|Mangold|1990}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Krech|Stötzer|1982}}) judge the vowel in ''Art'', ''Schwert'', ''Fahrt'' to be long, while the vowel in ''Ort'', ''Furcht'', ''hart'' is supposed to be short. The factual basis of this presumed distinction seems very questionable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiese198&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also supported by {{Harvcoltxt|Tröster-Mutz|2011|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on stating that in his own dialect, there is no length difference in these words, and that judgements on vowel length in front of non-prevocalic {{IPA|/r/}} which is itself vocalized are problematic, in particular if {{IPA|/a/}} precedes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiese198&quot;/&gt;

:According to the 'lengthless' analysis, the aforementioned 'long' diphthongs are analyzed as {{IPA|[iɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[yɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[uɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[eɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[øɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[oɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ɛɐ̯]}} and {{IPA|[aɐ̯]}}. This makes non-prevocalic {{IPA|/aːr/}} and {{IPA|/ar/}} homophonous as {{IPA|[aɐ̯]}} or {{IPA|[aː]}}. Non-prevocalic {{IPA|/ɛːr/}} and {{IPA|/ɛr/}} may also merge, but the vowel chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Kohler|1999|p=88}} shows that they have somewhat different starting points.

:{{Harvcoltxt|Wiese|1996}} also states that &quot;laxing of the vowel is predicted to take place in shortened vowels; it does indeed seem to go hand in hand with the vowel shortening in many cases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiese198&quot;/&gt;

=====Bernese German=====
The diphthongs of some [[German dialects]] differ from standard German diphthongs. The [[Bernese German]] diphthongs, for instance, correspond rather to the [[Middle High German]] diphthongs than to standard German diphthongs:
*{{IPA|/iə̯/}} as in ''lieb'' ‘dear’
*{{IPA|/uə̯/}} as in ''guet'' ‘good’
*{{IPA|/yə̯/}} as in ''müed'' ‘tired’

Apart from these phonemic diphthongs, Bernese German has numerous phonetic diphthongs due to [[L-vocalization]] in the syllable coda, for instance the following ones:
*{{IPA|[au̯]}} as in ''Stau'' ‘stable’
*{{IPA|[aːu̯]}} as in ''Staau'' ‘steel’
*{{IPA|[æu̯]}} as in ''Wäut'' ‘world’

==== Yiddish ====
[[Yiddish phonology|Yiddish]] has three diphthongs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kleine|2003|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|[ɛɪ̯]}} as in {{IPA|[plɛɪ̯tə]}} פּליטה ('refugee' f.)
*{{IPA|[aɛ̯]}} as in {{IPA|[naɛ̯n]}} נײַן ('nine')
*{{IPA|[ɔə̯]}} as in {{IPA|[ɔə̯fn̩]}} אופֿן ('way')

Diphthongs may reach a higher target position (towards {{IPA|/i/}}) in situations of coarticulatory phenomena or when words with such vowels are being emphasized.

====Norwegian====
There are five diphthongs in the Oslo dialect of [[Norwegian phonology|Norwegian]], all of them falling:

*{{IPA|[æɪ]}} as in ''nei'', &quot;no&quot;

*{{IPA|[ɑɪ]}} as in ''hai'', &quot;shark&quot;
*{{IPA|[ɔʷʏʷ]}} as in ''joik'', &quot;Sami song&quot;

An additional diphthong, {{IPA|[ʉ͍ɪ]}}, occurs only in the word ''hui'' in the expression ''i hui og hast'' &quot;in great haste&quot;. The number and form of diphthongs vary between dialects.

====Faroese====
Diphthongs in [[Faroese language|Faroese]] are:

*{{IPA|/ei̯/}} as in ''þeir'', &quot;they&quot;
*{{IPA|/ɔi/}} as in ''koja'', &quot;bunk bed&quot;, &quot;berth&quot; (rare, only in handful of words)

Combinations of semivowel {{IPA|/j/}} and a vowel are the following:
*{{IPA|/jɛ/}} as in ''éta'', &quot;eat&quot;
*{{IPA|/ja/}} as in ''jata'', &quot;manger&quot;
*{{IPA|/jau̯/}} as in ''já'', &quot;yes&quot;

===Romance languages===

====French====
In [[French phonology|French]], {{IPA|/wa/}}, {{IPA|/wɛ̃/}}, {{IPA|/ɥi/}} and {{IPA|/ɥɛ̃/}} may be considered true diphthongs (that is, fully contained in the syllable nucleus: {{IPA|[u̯a], [u̯ɛ̃], [y̯i], [y̯ɛ̃]}}). Other sequences are considered part of a glide formation process that turns a high vowel into a semivowel (and part of the syllable onset) when followed by another vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chitoran|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diphthongs
* {{IPA|/wa/}} {{IPA|[u̯a]}} as in ''roi'' &quot;king&quot;
* {{IPA|/wɛ̃/}} {{IPA|[u̯ɛ̃]}} as in ''groin'' &quot;muzzle&quot;
* {{IPA|/ɥi/}} {{IPA|[y̯i]}} as in ''huit'' &quot;eight&quot;
* {{IPA|/ɥɛ̃/}} {{IPA|[y̯ɛ̃]}} as in ''juin'' &quot;June&quot;

Semivowels
* {{IPA|/wi/}} as in ''oui'' &quot;yes&quot;
* {{IPA|/jɛ̃/}} as in ''lien'' &quot;bond&quot;
* {{IPA|/jɛ/}} as in ''Ariège''
* {{IPA|/aj/}} as in ''travail'' &quot;work&quot;
* {{IPA|/ɛj/}} as in ''Marseille''
* {{IPA|/ij/}} as in ''bille'' &quot;ball&quot;
* {{IPA|/œj/}} as in ''feuille'' &quot;leaf&quot;
* {{IPA|/uj/}} as in ''grenouille'' &quot;frog&quot;
* {{IPA|/jø/}} as in ''vieux'' &quot;old&quot;

=====Quebec French=====

In standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[w]}}) are possible only in the following contexts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iec.cat/institucio/seccions/Filologica/gramatica/fonetica/05diftongstriftongshiats.pdf Institut d'Estudis Catalans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930153153/http://www2.iec.cat/institucio/seccions/Filologica/gramatica/fonetica/05diftongstriftongshiats.pdf |date=30 September 2010 }} ''Els diftongs, els triftongs i els hiats – Gramàtica de la Llengua Catalana'' (provisional draft)&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPAblink|j}} in word initial position, e.g. '''''i'''ogurt''.
* Both occur between vowels as in ''fe'''i'''a'' and ''ve'''i'''em''.
* In the sequences {{IPA|[ɡw]}} or {{IPA|[kw]}} and vowel, e.g. ''g'''u'''ant'', ''q'''u'''ota'', ''q'''ü'''estió'', ''ping'''ü'''í'' (these exceptional cases even lead some scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Lleó|1970}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hypothesize the existence of rare labiovelar phonemes {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wheeler|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

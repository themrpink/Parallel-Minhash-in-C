===Gun's attempt to stop the flood===
{{See also|Great Flood (China)}}
[[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]], the father of [[Yu the Great]], is the earliest recorded member of the Xia clan. When the [[Yellow River]] flooded, many tribes united together to control and stop the flooding. Gun was appointed by Emperor [[Yao (ruler)|Yao]] to stop the flooding. He ordered the construction of large blockades ([[levee]]s) to block the path of the water. The attempt of Gun to stop the flooding lasted for nine years, but it was a failure because the floods became stronger. After nine years, Yao had already given his throne to [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]]. Gun was ordered to be imprisoned for life to reform the Eastern Barbarians by Shun at Yushan ({{CJKV|t=羽山|s=羽山|p=Yǔshān}}, ''Feather Mountain''), a mountain located between modern [[Donghai County]] in [[Jiangsu Province]] and [[Linshu County]] in [[Shandong Province]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Yu the Great's attempt to stop the floods===
[[Yu the Great|Yu]] was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish his father's work, which was to stop the flooding.  Yu's method was different from his father's: he organized people from different tribes and ordered them to help him build canals in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work. People praised his perseverance and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work. Legend says that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the floods, he never went back to his home village to stop and rest, even though he passed by his house three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.ancient.eu/china/|title=Ancient China|last=Mark|first=Joshua J.|encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
Yu's success in stopping the flooding increased agricultural production (since the floods were destructive). The Xia tribe's power increased and Yu became the leader of the surrounding tribes. Soon afterwards [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] sent Yu to lead an army to suppress the Sanmiao tribe, which continuously abused the border tribes. After defeating them, he exiled them south to the [[Hanshui|Han River]] area. This victory strengthened the Xia tribe's power even more. As Shun aged, he thought of a successor and relinquished the throne to [[Yu the Great|Yu]], whom he deemed worthy. Yu's succession marks the start of the Xia dynasty. As Yu neared death he passed the throne to his son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], instead of passing it to the most capable candidate, thus setting the precedent for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia dynasty began a period of family or clan control.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} It is believed that Zhenxun (modern [[Gongyi]]) and [[Yangcheng (historical city)|Yangcheng]] (modern [[Gaocheng, Henan|Gaocheng]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dating of the Wangchenggang Walled-site in Dengfeng County and Related Issues|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/uploads/soft/Chinese%20Archaeology/7/The%20Dating%20of%20the%20Wangchenggang%20Walled-site%20in%20Dengfeng%20County%20and%20Related%20Issues.pdf|publisher=Chinese Archaeology, Fang Yanming|accessdate=13 January 2020|language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; were two of the capitals of the dynasty.

===Overthrow===
[[Jie of Xia|Jie]], the last king, was said to be corrupt. He was overthrown by [[Tang of Shang|Tang]], the first king of the [[Shang dynasty]].
Tang is said to have given the small state of [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] as a [[fief]] to the remnants of the Xia ruling family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonghe.17xie.com/book/10826459/597233.html |title=夏朝遗民流布情况概说 |publisher=Zonghe.17xie.com |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HBSS200503017.htm |title=夏代是杜撰的吗——与陈淳先生商榷 沈长云 |publisher=Cnki.com.cn |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This practice was referred to as [[Head of the former Chinese imperial clan|&quot;the two crownings and the three respects&quot;]].

[[Zengzi]] was a descendant of the Xia dynasty Kings through [[Shao Kang]].&lt;ref&gt;《宗聖志》，（清）曾國荃續修，宗聖奉祀官府，1974年&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《武城曾氏重修族譜》，（清）曾繁墫纂，1807年&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kings of the [[State of Yue]] claimed descent from the Xia dynasty Kings through Shao Kang.

The time gap between the supposed time of the Xia and the first written references to it have meant that the historicity of the Xia dynasty itself and the traditional narrative of its history are at best uncertain. The [[Doubting Antiquity School|Skeptical School]] of early Chinese history, started by [[Gu Jiegang]] in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to systematically question the traditional story of its early history. By critically examining the development of the narrative of early Chinese history throughout history, Gu concluded &quot;the later the time, the longer the legendary period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2002&quot;&gt;Yun Kuen Lee, &quot;Building the Chronology of Early Chinese History&quot;. ''Asian Perspectives'', Vol. 41, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have suggested that the Zhou rulers invented the Xia as a pretext, to justify their conquest of the Shang, by noting that just as the Shang had supplanted the Xia, they had supplanted the Shang. The existence of the Xia remains unproven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link them with the [[Bronze Age]] [[Erlitou culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu, L. &amp; Xiu, H., &quot;Rethinking Erlitou: legend, history and Chinese archaeology&quot;, ''Antiquity'', 81:314 (2007) pp. 886–901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other points, Gu and other historians note certain parallels between the traditional narrative of Xia history and Shang history that would suggest probable Zhou-era fabrication or at least embellishment of Xia history. Yun Kuen Lee's criticism of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological versus historical research, in particular, the claim that the archaeological Erlitou culture is also the historical Xia dynasty. &quot;How to fuse the archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological studies of early civilization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2002&quot; /&gt;

In ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China'', [[Sarah Allan]] noted that many aspects of the Xia are simply the opposite of traits held to be emblematic of the [[Shang dynasty]].  The implied dualism between the Shang and Xia, Allan argues, is that while the Shang represents fire or the sun, birds and the east, the Xia represent the west and water.  The development of this mythical Xia, Allan argues, is a necessary act on the part of the [[Zhou dynasty]], who justify their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the Xia.

Other scholars also argue that Shang remnants still existed during the early Zhou dynasty; Zhou rulers could not simply justify their succession to pacify Shang remnants if it is entirely fabricated since they would not believe it in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;李宏飛. 「夏商世系探索」. 《甲骨學110年：回顧與展望——王宇信教授師友國際學術研討會論文集》 (中國北京: 中國社會科學出版社). 2009年11月1日 （中文（中國大陸））.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the powerful Song kingdom during the Zhou dynasty was the direct descendants of Shang people. During the later [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), an ancient bronze artifact, &quot;Shu Yi Zhong&quot;(叔夷鐘), was unearthed with an inscription describing how the founder of the Shang dynasty, Tang, overthrew the Xia dynasty. The owner of this artifact, Shu Yi, a high officer of the [[Qi (state)|Qi Kingdom]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600&amp;nbsp;BC), was actually a direct descendant of the Song Kingdom's kings, which means he himself was a descendant of Shang people. This bronze artifact was used to memorialize his Shang ancestors. The inscription contradicts the hypothesis that the Zhou dynasty manufactured the existence of the Xia dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Shang [[oracle bone]] inscriptions contain no mention of the Xia, some scholars have suggested that polities they mention might be remnants of the Xia.
[[Guo Moruo]] suggested that an enemy state called Tufang state mentioned in many inscriptions might be identified with the Xia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&amp;id=gmrxk201601011  |title=再论卜辞&quot;土方&quot;与夏人的相关问题 |publisher= 郭沫若学刊  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The historian Shen Changyun pointed to four inscriptions mentioning Qi, the same name as the Zhou-era state of [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]], which according to traditional accounts was established by the defeated royal house of Xia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Archaeological discoveries==
{{See also|Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project}}

[[File:Xia Dynasty pottery jue.jpg|thumb|upright|Pottery ''[[jue (vessel)|jue]]'' from the [[Erlitou culture]]]]

Archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not the [[Erlitou culture]] was the site of the Xia dynasty. [[Radiocarbon dating]] places the site at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia dynasty as described in Chinese historical works.&lt;ref&gt;[[John K. Fairbank|Fairbank, John K.]] ''China: A New History''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, a site located in the city of [[Yanshi]] was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have attributed to [[Historical capitals of China|capital of the Xia dynasty]].  Through the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;&lt;ref name=library/&gt; at a minimum, the era traditionally denoted as the Xia dynasty marked an evolutionary stage between the late [[Neolithic]] cultures and the urban civilization of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+cn0013%29|title=China – the ancient dynasties|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized palace—dated to about 1700 BC—at [[Erlitou]] in [[Henan]], further fueling the discussions about the existence of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China finds 3,600-year-old palace | url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/7675375.html | publisher=People's Daily Online | date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence of a large [[outburst flood]] that destroyed the [[Lajia]] site on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BC. This date is shortly before the rise of the Erlitou culture in the middle Yellow River valley and the [[Yueshi culture]] in Shandong, following the decline of the [[Longshan culture]] in the [[North China Plain]]. The authors suggest that this flood may have been the basis for the later myth, and contributed to the transition of cultures. They further argue that the timing is further evidence for the identification of the Xia with the Erlitou culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Sovereigns of the Xia dynasty==
The following table lists the rulers of Xia according to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]''.  Unlike Sima's list of [[Shang dynasty]] kings, which is closely matched by inscriptions on [[oracle bones]] from late in that period, records of Xia rulers have not yet been found in archaeological excavations of contemporary sites, or records on later Shang dynasty oracle bones.

[[Colonel (UK)| Colonel]] '''Thomas Edward Lawrence''', {{postnominals|country= GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CB|DSO}} (16 August 1888&amp;nbsp;– 19 May 1935), a British archaeologist, army-officer, diplomat, and writer, became renowned for his role in the [[Arab Revolt]] (1916–1918)  and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] (1915–1918) against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First World War]].  The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as '''Lawrence of Arabia''', a title used for [[Lawrence of Arabia (film) |the 1962 film]] based on his wartime activities.

He was born ([[Legitimacy (family law)|out of wedlock]]) in August 1888 to Sarah Junner (1861 - 1959), a governess, and [[Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet|Thomas Chapman]] (1846 - 1919), an [[Anglo-Irish]] nobleman. Chapman left his wife and family in Ireland to cohabit with Junner. Chapman and Junner called themselves Mr and Mrs Lawrence, using the surname of Sarah's likely father; her mother had been employed as a servant for a Lawrence family when she became pregnant with Sarah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Benson-Gyles |first1= Dick |title= The Boy in the Mask: The Hidden World of Lawrence of Arabia |date= 2016 |publisher= The Lilliput Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896 the Lawrences moved to [[Oxford]], where Thomas attended the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys | High School]] and then studied history at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] from 1907 to 1910. Between 1910 and 1914 he worked as an archaeologist for the [[British Museum]], chiefly at [[Carchemish]] in [[Ottoman Syria]].

Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914 he volunteered for the [[British Army during World War I | British Army]] and was stationed at the [[Arab Bureau]] (established in 1916) intelligence unit in Egypt. In 1916 he travelled to Mesopotamia and to Arabia on intelligence missions and quickly became involved with the Arab Revolt as a liaison to the Arab forces, along with other British officers, supporting the Arab [[Kingdom of Hejaz]]'s independence war against its former overlord, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He worked closely with [[Faisal I of Iraq| Emir Faisal]], a leader of the revolt, and he participated, sometimes as leader, in military actions against the [[Ottoman Armed Forces| Ottoman armed forces]], culminating in the capture of [[Damascus]] in October 1918.

After the First World War, Lawrence joined the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office| Foreign Office]], working with the British government and with Faisal. In 1922 he retreated from public life and spent the years until 1935 serving as an enlisted man, mostly in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), with a brief period in the Army. During this time he published (1926) his best-known work ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', an autobiographical account of his participation in the [[Arab Revolt]]. He also translated books into English and wrote [[The Mint (book)|''The Mint'']], which detailed his time in the [[Royal Air Force]] working as an ordinary [[aircraftman]]. He corresponded extensively and was friendly with well-known artists, writers, and politicians. For the RAF, he participated in the development of rescue motorboats.

Lawrence's public image resulted in part from the sensationalised reporting of the Arab revolt by American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], as well as from ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. In 1935, Lawrence was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident in [[Dorset]].

==Early life==
[[File:Thomas Edward Lawrence birth-place Gorphwysfa.jpg|thumb|Lawrence's birthplace, Gorphwysfa, [[Tremadog]], Carnarvonshire, Wales]]

Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in [[Tremadog]], Carnarvonshire,&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Wales, in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8x322-89x3MC&amp;q=T.+E.+Lawrence+%27Gorphwysfa%27&amp;pg=PA237 |title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact |page=237|author=Alan Axelrod|publisher=Fair Winds, 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2011|isbn=9781616734619 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Np_H_j3hXUEC&amp;pg=PA280 |title=The Companion Guide to Wales |author=David Barnes|page=280|publisher=Companion Guides, 2005|accessdate=1 May 2011|isbn=9781900639439 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowdon Lodge|url=http://snowdonlodge.co.uk/|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Anglo-Irish father [[Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet|Thomas Chapman]] had left his wife Edith after he had a son with Sarah Junner who had been governess to his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah had herself been an illegitimate child, having been born in [[Sunderland]] as the daughter of Elizabeth Junner, a servant employed by a family named Lawrence; she was dismissed four months before Sarah was born, and identified Sarah's father as &quot;John Junner, Shipwright journeyman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstudies.org/biography/biog_family.shtml |title=T.

[[File:Lawrence house, Oxford.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Lawrence family lived at 2, [[Polstead Road]], Oxford from 1896 to 1921]]

Lawrence's parents did not marry but lived together under the name Lawrence.  In 1914, his father inherited the [[Chapman baronets|Chapman baronetcy]] based at [[Killua Castle]], the ancestral family home in [[County Westmeath]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, Appendix 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They had five sons, Thomas (called &quot;Ned&quot; by his immediate family) being the second eldest. From Wales, the family moved to [[Kirkcudbright]], [[Galloway]], in southwestern Scotland, then to [[Dinard]] in Brittany, then to [[Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished) from 1894 to 1896, set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The residence was isolated, and young Lawrence had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian-Edwardian Britain was a very conservative society where the majority of people were Christians who considered premarital and extramarital sex to be shameful, and children born out of wedlock were born in disgrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;JeremyWilson1911&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last = Wilson | first = Jeremy | title = T.

[[File:Lawrence arabia.gif|thumb|upright=.9|Lawrence memorial plaque at [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]]]]
In the summer of 1896, the family moved to 2, [[Polstead Road]] in [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived until 1921. Lawrence attended the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]] from 1896 until 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; where one of the four [[House system|houses]] was later named &quot;Lawrence&quot; in his honour; the school closed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/resources/obs/boys_school_history.htm|title=Brief history of the City of Oxford High School for Boys, George Street|publisher=University of Oxford Faculty of History|access-date=25 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418140326/http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/resources/obs/boys_school_history.htm|archive-date=18 April 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence and one of his brothers became commissioned officers in the [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|Church Lads' Brigade]] at [[St Aldate's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence claimed that he ran away from home around 1905 and served for a few weeks as a boy soldier with the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] at [[St Mawes Castle]] in Cornwall, from which he was bought out. However, no evidence of this appears in army records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/legacy3/analysis/asher022.htm |title=T. E.

==Travels, antiquities, and archaeology==
[[File:Woolley &amp; Lawrence at Carchemish.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leonard Woolley]] (''left'') and Lawrence in their excavation house at [[Carchemish]], c. 1912]]

At age 15, Lawrence and his schoolfriend [[Cyril Beeson]] cycled around Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, visiting almost every village's parish church, studying their monuments and antiquities, and making [[Brass rubbing|rubbings]] of their monumental brasses.&lt;ref name=Beeson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beeson |first1=C.F.C. |authorlink1=Cyril Beeson |last2=Simcock |first2=A.V. |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |edition=3rd |title=Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Museum of the History of Science]] |isbn=978-0-903364-06-5 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence and Beeson monitored building sites in Oxford and presented the [[Ashmolean Museum]] with anything that they found.&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; The Ashmolean's ''Annual Report'' for 1906 said that the two teenage boys &quot;by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found.&quot;&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; In the summers of 1906 and 1907, Lawrence toured France by bicycle, sometimes with Beeson, collecting photographs, drawings, and measurements of medieval castles.&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; In August 1907, Lawrence wrote home: &quot;The Chaignons &amp; the [[Lamballe]] people complimented me on my wonderful French: I have been asked twice since I arrived what part of France I came from&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Larès, Maurice &quot;T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?&quot; pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1907 to 1910, Lawrence read history at [[Jesus College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In July and August 1908 he cycled 2,200 miles (3,500&amp;nbsp;km) solo through France to the Mediterranean and back researching French castles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penaud, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1909, he set out alone on a three-month walking tour of [[List of Crusader castles|crusader castles]] in [[Ottoman Syria]], during which he travelled {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989 pp. 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Jesus he was a keen member of the [[University Officers' Training Corps]] (OTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mack|first=John E.|authorlink=John E.

W. Lawrence|Arnold]] wrote in 1937 that &quot;medieval researches&quot; were a &quot;dream way of escape from bourgeois England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M.D. &quot;Lawrence's Medievalism&quot; pages 53–70 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1910, Lawrence was offered the opportunity to become a practising archaeologist at [[Carchemish]], in the expedition that [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] was setting up on behalf of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth arranged a &quot;Senior [[Demyship]]&quot; (a form of scholarship) for Lawrence at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], to fund his work at £100 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed for [[Beirut]] in December 1910 and went to [[Byblos]], where he studied Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to work on the excavations at Carchemish, near [[Jerablus]] in northern Syria, where he worked under Hogarth, [[Reginald Campbell Thompson|R. Campbell Thompson]] of the British Museum, and [[Leonard Woolley]] until 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 76–134.&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that everything which he had accomplished he owed to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1927/271207_d_knowles.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211151322/http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1927/271207_d_knowles.htm|url-status=dead|title=T.

At Carchemish, Lawrence was frequently involved in a high-tension relationship with a German-led team working nearby on the Baghdad Railway at Jerablus. While there was never open combat, there was regular conflict over access to land and treatment of the local workforce; Lawrence gained experience in Middle Eastern leadership practices and conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woolley |first1=Leonard |title=Dead Towns and Living Men |date=1954 |publisher=The Whitefriars Press |location=London and Tonbridge |isbn=978-0-13-601970-1 |pages=85–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military intelligence==
[[File:T._E._Lawrence_and_L._Woolley_at_Carchemish_(1913).jpg|thumb|upright|left|250px|Early Hittite artifact found by T. E. Lawrence and [[Leonard Woolley]] (right) in Carchemish.]]

In January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 136. Lawrence wrote to his parents &quot;We are obviously only meant as red herrings to give an archaeological colour to a political job.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the [[Negev]] Desert. They were funded by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] to search for an area referred to in the Bible as the ''[[Zin Desert|Wilderness of Zin]]'', and they made an archaeological survey of the Negev Desert along the way. The Negev was strategically important, as an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army attacking Egypt would have to cross it. Woolley and Lawrence subsequently published a report of the expedition's archaeological findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/WildZin.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018191000/http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/WildZin.htm |archivedate=18 October 2006 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a more important result was updated mapping of the area, with special attention to features of military relevance such as water sources. Lawrence also visited [[Aqaba]] and Shobek, not far from [[Petra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/articles/jordan-lawrence-of-arabia-adventure/|title=Adventure in the desert on the trail of Lawrence of Arabia|publisher=The Telegraph|date=24 October 2016|accessdate=19 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, Lawrence did not immediately enlist in the British Army. He held back until October on the advice of [[S. F. Newcombe]], when he was commissioned on the [[General List]].&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the year, he was summoned by renowned archaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. [[David George Hogarth|David Hogarth]], his mentor at Carchemish, to the new [[Arab Bureau]] intelligence unit in Cairo, and he arrived in Cairo on 15 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau's chief was General [[Gilbert Clayton]] who reported to Egyptian High Commissioner [[Henry McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 152, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was complex during 1915. There was a growing Arab-nationalist movement within the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; They were in contact with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], [[Sharif of Mecca|Emir of Mecca]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans.  In exchange, he wanted a British guarantee of an independent Arab state including the [[Hejaz]], Syria, and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an uprising would have been very helpful to Britain in its war against the Ottomans, greatly lessening the threat against the [[Suez Canal]]. However, there was resistance from French diplomats who insisted that Syria's future was as a French colony, not an independent Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also strong objections from the Government of India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently.  Its vision was of Mesopotamia under British control serving as a granary for India; furthermore, it wanted to hold on to its Arabian outpost in [[Aden]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Arab Bureau, Lawrence supervised the preparation of maps,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson, 1989, p. 189&quot;&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; produced a daily bulletin for the British generals operating in the theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; and interviewed prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson, 1989, p. 189&quot;/&gt; He was an advocate of a British landing at [[Alexandretta]] which never came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a consistent advocate of an independent Arab Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation came to a crisis in October 1915, as Sharif Hussein demanded an immediate commitment from Britain, with the threat that he would otherwise throw his weight behind the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; This would create a credible [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] message that could have been very dangerous for Britain, which was in severe difficulties in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].  The British replied with a [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence|letter from High Commissioner McMahon]] that was generally agreeable while reserving commitments concerning the Mediterranean coastline and [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Correspondence_between_Sir_Henry_McMahon_and_the_Sherif_Hussein_of_Mecca_Cmd_5957.pdf|title=Cmd.5957; Correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.M.G., His Majesty's High Commissioner at.

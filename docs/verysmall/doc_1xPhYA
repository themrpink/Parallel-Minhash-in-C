In contrast with her rival Stephen and his wife Matilda of Boulogne — styled respectively {{Lang-la|rex Anglorum|links=no|lit=King of the English|label=none}} and {{Lang-la|regina Anglorum|links=no|lit=Queen of the English|label=none}} — Empress Matilda employed the title {{Lang-la|domina Anglorum|links=no|label=none}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Several interpretations of the title ({{Lang-la|domina|links=no|lit=mistress}}), are possible. ''Domina'', is the feminine equivalent of the title [[Dominus (title)|''dominus'']], the meaning of which ranged from head of a household to an imperial title and translated as &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;. Whereas the {{Lang-oe|cwen|lit=queen}} carried the implication of a king's wife only, the {{Lang-oe|hlaefdige|lit=lady|link=none}} was used of a woman exercising temporal powers in her own right, as had [[Æthelflæd]] of Mercia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Notably, Matilda's husband Geoffrey never adopted the equivalent ''dominus Anglorum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Initially between 1139 and 1141 Matilda referred to herself as acting as a ''[[feme sole]]'', &quot;a woman [acting] alone&quot;, highlighting her autonomy and independence from her spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was also conventional that newly elected kings use ''{{Lang-la|dominus|links=no|label=none}}'' until their coronation as {{Lang-la|rex|links=no|lit=king|label=none}}, the interval being counted as an [[interregnum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beem|2016|pp=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since she was never crowned at Westminster, during the rest of the war she appears to have used this title rather than that of the Queen of England, although some contemporaries referred to her by the royal title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring and summer 1141, as Matilda was ''de facto'' queen regnant, some royal charters including titles of lands granted to [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury Abby]] and [[Reading Abbey]] described her as {{Lang-la|regina Anglorum|links=no|label=none}}, while another mentions {{Lang-la|coronae meae|links=no|lit=my crown|label=none}} and {{Lang-la|regni mei|links=no|lit=my kingdom|label=none}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While [[Marjorie Chibnall]] believed the Glastonbury and Reading Abbeys' instances of ''regina Anglorum'' are either errors for ''domina Anglorum'' or else inauthentic; [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]] judged this unlikely to be a scribal error and pointed out that Stephen's supporters had used ''rex Anglorum'' before his formal coronation, that she was hailed as ''regina et domina'' at Winchester in March 1141, and that she &quot;gloried in being called&quot; the royal title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crouch|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eALKAwAAQBAJ|title=The Reign of King Stephen: 1135-1154|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-89297-7|location=|pages=170-171, n. 6-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the style ''{{Lang-la|domina Anglorum|links=no|label=none}}'', now rendered as &quot;Lady of the English&quot;, remained more common in documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The chronicler William of Malmsebury calls her ''domina'' only.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Matilda presented herself as continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, and attempted to maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=40, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2000|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks went on to become bishops in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=40–41}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;White2000P39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first were initially minted in Oxford during her stay there, and the design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln.&lt;ref name=&quot;White2000P39&quot; /&gt; A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.&lt;ref name=&quot;White2000P39&quot; /&gt;

On returning to Normandy for the last time in 1148, Matilda ceased to use the title Lady of the English, simply styling herself as empress again; she never adopted the title of Countess of Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda's household became smaller, and often merged with Henry's own court when the two were co-located in Rouen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to play a special role in the government of the area around Argentan, where she held feudal rights from the grants made at the time of her second marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Church===
[[File:Normandie Eure Mortemer tango7174.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Mortemer Abbey|[[Mortemer Abbey]] in Normandy, which received financial support from Matilda]]

It is unclear how strong Matilda's personal piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other members of the Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the [[School of Saint Victor|Victorines]] and [[Premonstratensians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near [[Cherbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went by, Matilda directed more of her attention to the [[Cistercian]] order. This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], a figure of particular importance to Matilda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had close links to the Cistercian [[Mortemer Abbey]] in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
[[File:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpagetrimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the first page of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|The first page of the Peterborough element of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', written around 1150, one of the [[chronicler]] accounts that describe Matilda's role during [[the Anarchy]]]]
Contemporary chroniclers in England, France, Germany and Italy documented many aspects of Matilda's life, although the only biography of her, apparently written by Arnulf of Lisieux, has been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibnall 1991 3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chroniclers took a range of perspectives on her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibnall 1991 3&quot;/&gt; In Germany, the chroniclers praised Matilda extensively and her reputation as the &quot;good Matilda&quot; remained positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; During the years of the Anarchy, works such as the ''Gesta Stephani'' took a much more negative tone, praising Stephen and condemning Matilda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Henry II assumed the throne, the tone of the chroniclers towards Matilda became more positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends spread in the years after Matilda's death, including the suggestion that her first husband, Henry, had not died but had in fact secretly become a [[hermit]] – making Matilda's second marriage illegitimate – and a tale that Matilda had an affair with Stephen, resulting in the conception of Henry II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tudor period|Tudor]] scholars were interested in Matilda's right of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 16th century standards, Matilda had a clear right to the English throne, and academics therefore struggled to explain why Matilda had acquiesced to her son Henry's kingship at the end of the war, rather than ruling directly herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, historians such as [[David Hume]] had a much better understanding of the irregular nature of 12th century law and custom and this question became less relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, the archival sources on Matilda's life, including charters, foundation histories, and letters, were being uncovered and analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=3, 201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians [[Kate Norgate]], Sir James Ramsay and [[J. H. Round]] used these to produce new, richer accounts of Matilda and the civil war; Ramsay's account, using the ''Gesta Stephani'', was not complimentary, while Norgate, drawing on French sources, was more neutral in tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German academic Oskar Rössler's 1897 biography drew heavily on German charters, not extensively used by Anglophone historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2, 203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matilda has attracted relatively little attention from modern English academics, being treated as a marginal figure in comparison to other contemporaries, particularly her rival Stephen, in contrast to the work carried out by German scholars on her time in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular, but not always accurate, biographies were written by the [[Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow|Earl of Onslow]] in 1939 and [[Nesta Pain]] in 1978, but the only major academic biography in English remains [[Marjorie Chibnall]]'s 1991 work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Beem|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of Matilda's character have shifted over time, but there is, as Chibnall describes, a &quot;general agreement that she was either proud or at least keenly conscious of the high status of an empress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like both Henry I and Henry II, Matilda had a certain autocratic grandeur, which was combined with a firm moral belief in her cause; ultimately however she was limited by the political conventions of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of Matilda by modern historians has been challenged by feminist scholars, including Fiona Tolhurst, who believe some traditional assumptions about her role and personality show gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, Matilda has been unfairly criticised for showing qualities that have been considered praiseworthy when seen in her male contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=21}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war years of Matilda's life have been the subject of [[historical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortenberg|2006|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in [[Ellis Peters]]'s historical detective series about [[Brother Cadfael]], set between 1137 and 1145.&lt;ref name=RiellyP62&gt;{{Harvnb|Rielly|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rielly|2000|pp=68–69}}; {{Harvnb|Songer|1998|pp=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem &quot;[[Maud, and Other Poems|Maud]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovelace|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Spotsylvania Court House''', sometimes more simply referred to as the '''Battle of Spotsylvania''' (or the 19th-century spelling '''Spottsylvania'''), was the second major battle in [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]]'s 1864 [[Overland Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]]. Following the bloody but inconclusive [[Battle of the Wilderness]], Grant's army disengaged from [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army and moved to the southeast, attempting to lure Lee into battle under more favorable conditions. Elements of Lee's army beat the [[Union Army|Union army]] to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, and began entrenching. Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21, 1864, as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line. In the end, the battle was tactically inconclusive, but both sides declared victory.  The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses.  The United States declared victory because the [[Overland Campaign|Federal offensive continued]] and Lee's army suffered losses that could not be replaced.  With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides, Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign.

On May 8, Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gens.]] [[Gouverneur K. Warren]] and [[John Sedgwick]] unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]] from Laurel Hill, a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House. On May 10, Grant ordered attacks across the Confederate line of earthworks, which by now extended over {{convert|4|mi|km}}, including a prominent [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] known as the Mule Shoe. Although the Union troops failed again at Laurel Hill, an innovative assault attempt by Col. [[Emory Upton]] against the Mule Shoe showed promise.

Grant used Upton's assault technique on a much larger scale on May 12 when he ordered the 15,000 men of Maj. Gen. [[Winfield Scott Hancock]]'s corps to assault the Mule Shoe. Hancock was initially successful, but the Confederate leadership rallied and repulsed his incursion. Attacks by Maj. Gen. [[Horatio Wright]] on the western edge of the Mule Shoe, which became known as the &quot;Bloody Angle&quot;, involved almost 24 hours of desperate hand-to-hand fighting, some of the most intense of the Civil War. Supporting attacks by Warren and by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] were unsuccessful.

Grant repositioned his lines in another attempt to engage Lee under more favorable conditions and launched a final attack by Hancock on May 18, which made no progress. A reconnaissance in force by Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Richard S. Ewell]] at Harris farm on May 19 was a costly and pointless failure. On May 21, Grant disengaged from the Confederate Army and started southeast on another maneuver to [[turning movement|turn]] Lee's right flank, as the Overland Campaign continued toward the [[Battle of North Anna]].

[[File:SpotsylvaniaCourthouse1864p53crop.jpg|thumb|Spotsylvania Courthouse, 1864]]

In March 1864, Grant was summoned from the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], promoted to lieutenant general, and given command of all Union armies. He chose to make his headquarters with the [[Army of the Potomac]], although Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] remained the actual commander of that army. He left Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of the Confederacy from multiple directions, including attacks against Lee near [[Richmond, Virginia]], and in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[West Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Mobile, Alabama]]. This was the first time the Union armies would have a coordinated offensive strategy across a number of theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 251; Grimsley, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's campaign objective was not the Confederate capital of Richmond, but the destruction of Lee's army. Lincoln had long advocated this strategy for his generals, recognizing that the city would certainly fall after the loss of its principal defensive army. Grant ordered Meade, &quot;Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway &amp; Jones, p. 525; Trudeau, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he hoped for a quick, decisive battle, Grant was prepared to fight a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. Both Union and Confederate casualties could be high, but the Union had far greater resources to replace lost soldiers and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 661–62; Kennedy, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, after Grant's army crossed the Rapidan and entered the Wilderness of Spotsylvania, it was attacked by Confederate Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. Although Lee was outnumbered, about 60,000 to 100,000, his men fought fiercely and the dense foliage provided a terrain advantage. After two days of fighting and almost 29,000 casualties, the results were inconclusive and neither army was able to obtain an advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, p pp. 280&quot;&gt;Salmon, p. 253; Kennedy, pp. 280–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee had stopped Grant, but had not turned him back, and Grant had not destroyed Lee's army. Under similar circumstances, previous Union commanders had chosen to withdraw behind the Rappahannock, but Grant instead ordered Meade to move around Lee's right flank and seize the important crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House to the southeast, hoping that by interposing his army between Lee and Richmond, he could lure the Confederates into another battle on a more favorable field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon, p pp. 280&quot;/&gt;

As of May 7, Grant's Union forces totaled approximately 100,000 men.&lt;ref name=strength/&gt; They consisted of the '''[[Army of the Potomac]]''', under Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], and the '''[[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]]''' (until May 24 formally part of the [[Army of the Ohio]], reporting directly to Grant, not Meade). The five corps were:&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 957–58, 974–77; Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 330–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]], including the divisions of Maj. Gen. [[David B. Birney]] and Brig. Gens. [[Francis C. Barlow]], [[John Gibbon]], and [[Gershom Mott]]. (Mott's 4th Division was discontinued on May 13 and its brigades were distributed to other divisions in the corps. On May 18, a new 4th Division was constituted with reinforcements of heavy artillery regiments from Washington, D.C., under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Robert O. Tyler]], known informally as Tyler's Division of Heavy Artillery.)
* [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], including the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Charles Griffin]], [[John C. Robinson]], [[Samuel W. Crawford]], and [[Lysander Cutler]]. (Following the wounding of Robinson on May 8, his 2nd Division was temporarily disbanded and the brigades distributed to other divisions in the corps.)
* [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]], including the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Horatio G. Wright]], [[Thomas H. Neill]], and [[James B. Ricketts]]. (Sedgwick was killed on May 9 and replaced by Wright. Wright's 1st Division was then commanded by Brig. Gen. [[David Allen Russell|David A. Russell]].)
* [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]], including the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Thomas G. Stevenson]], [[Robert B. Potter]], [[Orlando B. Willcox]], and [[Edward Ferrero]]. (Stevenson was killed on May 10 and was replaced in command of the 1st Division by Col. [[Daniel Leasure]] then Maj. Gen. [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Thomas L. Crittenden]])
* Cavalry Corps, under Maj. Gen. [[Philip H. Sheridan]], including the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Alfred Thomas Torbert|Alfred T.A. Torbert]], [[David McM. Gregg]], and [[James H. Wilson]]. (During the period of May 9–24, Sheridan's Cavalry Corps was absent on detached duty and took no further part in the operations around Spotsylvania Court House.)

Early]], [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson]], and [[Robert E. Rodes]]. (On May 8, Jubal Early assumed temporary command of the Third Corps; his replacement in command of Early's Division was Brig. Gen. [[John B. Gordon]].)
* [[Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Third Corps]], under Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]], including the divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Henry Heth]] and [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]] and Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]]. (On May 8, Hill became ill and was replaced temporarily in corps command by Jubal Early.)
* [[Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Cavalry Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]], including the divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], [[Fitzhugh Lee]], and [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee]].

==Initial movements==

===May 7: The race to Spotsylvania===

{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}

{{See also|Battle of Todd's Tavern}}
Grant's orders to Meade were to march the night of May 7–8 over two routes, reaching Spotsylvania Court House, {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the southeast, with at least one corps the morning of May 8. Warren's V Corps would take the Brock Road, followed by Hancock's II Corps. Sedgwick's VI Corps would head toward Chancellorsville on the Orange Plank Road, and then turn south, followed by Burnside's IX Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', p. 46; Jaynes, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meade began by ordering Sheridan's Cavalry Corps to clear the Brock Road for the infantry, but the troopers soon bogged down. The brigade of Col. J. Irvin Gregg (David Gregg's division), was stopped at Corbin's Bridge on the Catharpin Road by cavalrymen under Wade Hampton and Rooney Lee. Gregg's men withdrew to a field west of Todd's Tavern, constructed rudimentary earthworks, and repulsed a series of Confederate attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhea, pp. 30&quot;&gt;Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 30–42; Welcher, pp. 959–61; Salmon, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley Merritt's Union division encountered Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry behind barricades on the Brock Road about a mile south of Todd's Tavern. Sharp fighting resulted in the late afternoon, and by nightfall, Sheridan decided against continuing in the dark and ordered his men to bivouac at Todd's Tavern. The first Union infantry began moving at 8 p.m. and their advance was plagued by traffic jams. When Meade reached Todd's Tavern after midnight he was infuriated to see Sheridan's sleeping cavalrymen and ordered them to resume their road clearing operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhea, pp. 30&quot;/&gt;

Lee was unsure of Grant's plan. Reconnaissance told him that the river crossing equipment had been removed from Germanna [[Ford (crossing)|Ford]], so Grant would not be withdrawing as his predecessors had. The Union Army could either be heading east to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] or moving south. In either event, the crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House would play an important role, so Lee ordered his artillery chief, Brig. Gen. [[William N. Pendleton]], to begin constructing a road through the woods from the Confederate position at the Wilderness due south to the Catharpin Road. He also ordered Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, who had replaced Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] in command of the First Corps following that officer's wounding on May 6, to move out along that road. Lee did not indicate any need for haste, but Anderson and his men desired to leave the stench of burning forest and dead bodies in the Wilderness, so they began marching about 10 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 22–23; Grimsley, p. 62; Salmon, pp. 270–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 8: Laurel Hill and cavalry troubles===
[[File:Spotsylvania Court House May 08.png|thumb|350px|Attacks on the Laurel Hill line, May 8]]
At dawn on May 8, [[Wesley Merritt]]'s cavalrymen attacked [[Fitzhugh Lee]]'s barricades on the Brock Road again, but were repulsed. Meade ordered Warren's V Corps to break through with infantry and the division of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Robinson]] led the way in overwhelming the cavalry obstacle. Fitzhugh Lee's horse artillery made a gallant stand around the Alsop farm and delayed the Union advance while the cavalrymen staked out a defensive line on a low ridge just south of the Spindle farm clearing, which they dubbed &quot;Laurel Hill.&quot; Lee sent for help to Anderson's infantry, which by now had reached the Block House Bridge on the [[Mattaponi River|Po River]] and were eating breakfast. Anderson immediately dispatched two infantry brigades and an artillery battalion, which arrived at Laurel Hill just as Warren's men pulled up within 100 yards to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 45–53; Welcher, p. 960; Salmon, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that only cavalry blocked his path, Warren ordered an immediate attack against Laurel Hill. Multiple attacks by the divisions of the V Corps were repulsed with heavy casualties, and by noon the Union troops began building earthworks on the northern end of the Spindle clearing. Meanwhile, the Union cavalry division under [[James H. Wilson]] had reached and occupied the town of Spotsylvania Court House at 8 a.m. Wilson sent a brigade under Col. [[John B. McIntosh]] up the Brock Road with the intention of striking the Confederate position at Laurel Hill from the rear. J.E.B. Stuart had only a single cavalry regiment available to send out against McIntosh, but Anderson's infantry division under [[Joseph B. Kershaw]] was marching in that direction. With orders from Sheridan to withdraw and with Confederate infantry in hot pursuit, Wilson withdrew up the Fredericksburg Road.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, pp. 86–87; Eicher, pp. 672–73; Grimsley, pp. 64–67; Welcher, pp. 960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generals Meade and Sheridan had quarreled about the cavalry's performance throughout the campaign and this incident with Wilson, compounding the frustration of the uncleared Brock Road, brought Meade's notorious temper to a boil. After a heated exchange laced with expletives on both sides, Sheridan told Meade that he could &quot;whip Stuart&quot; if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, &quot;Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.&quot; Meade deferred to Grant's judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to &quot;proceed against the enemy's cavalry.&quot; Sheridan's entire command of 10,000 cavalrymen departed the following day. They engaged with (and mortally wounded) Stuart at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] on May 11, threatened the outskirts of Richmond, refitted near the James River, and did not return to the army until May 24. Grant and Meade were left without cavalry resources during the critical days of the battle to come.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 286–87; Eicher, pp. 673–74; Grimsley, pp. 64, 68; Welcher, p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Warren was unsuccessfully attacking Laurel Hill the morning of May 8, Hancock's II Corps had reached Todd's Tavern and erected defenses to the west on the Catharpin Road, protecting the rear of the army. [[Jubal Early]], who had just replaced [[A.P. Hill]] as Third Corps commander because of his illness, decided to test the defenses and sent the division of [[William Mahone]] and some cavalry. After a short fight, Hancock's division under [[Francis C. Barlow]] withdrew back to Todd's Tavern and Early decided not to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, p. 961; Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 74–76, 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the afternoon, Sedgwick's VI Corps arrived near Laurel Hill and extended Warren's line to the east. By 7 p.m., both corps began a coordinated assault, but were repulsed by heavy fire. They attempted to move around Anderson's right flank, but were surprised to find that divisions from Ewell's Second Corps had arrived in that sector to repulse them again. Meade had not had a good day. He lost the race to Spotsylvania, he was dissatisfied with his cavalry, he judged Sedgwick to be &quot;constitutionally slow,&quot; and he was most disappointed that Warren had been unsuccessful at Laurel Hill, telling him that he had &quot;lost his nerve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 960–61; Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 71–74, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=With such entrenchments as these, having artillery throughout, with flank fire along the lines wherever practicable, and with the rifled musket then in use, which were effective at three hundred yards as the smooth-bore muskets at sixty yards, the strength of an army sustaining attack was more than quadrupled, provided they had force to man the entrenchments well.

Over the night of May 8–9, the Confederates were busy erecting a series of earthworks, more than {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} long, starting at the Po River, encompassing the Laurel Hill line, crossing the Brock Road, jutting out in a horseshoe shape and then extending south past the courthouse intersection. The earthworks were reinforced with timber and guarded by artillery placed to allow [[enfilade]] fire on any attacking force. There was only one potential weakness in Lee's line—the exposed [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] known as the &quot;Mule Shoe&quot; extending more than a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in front of the main trench line. Although Lee's engineers were aware of this problem, they extended the line to incorporate some minor high ground to Anderson's right, knowing that they would be at a disadvantage if the Union occupied it.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, pp. 143–44; Rhea, ''Spotsylvania Court House'', pp. 89–91; Welcher, pp. 963–64; Salmon, p. 272; Grimsley, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

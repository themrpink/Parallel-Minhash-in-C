When merchant ships sailed independently, a privateer could cruise a shipping lane and capture ships as they passed. Ships sailing in convoy presented a much smaller target: a convoy was as hard to find as a single ship. Even if the privateer found a convoy and the wind was favourable for an attack, it could still hope to capture only a handful of ships before the rest managed to escape, and a small escort of warships could easily thwart it. As a result of the convoy system's effectiveness, wartime insurance premiums were consistently lower for ships that sailed in convoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford_Companion_online&quot; /&gt;

Many [[naval battles]] in the [[Age of Sail]] were fought around convoys, including:
*The [[Battle of Portland]] (1653)
*The [[Battle of Ushant (1781)]]
*The [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]]
*[[The Glorious First of June]] (1794)
*The [[Battle of Pulo Aura]] (1804)

By the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the [[Royal Navy]] had in place a sophisticated convoy system to protect merchant ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford_Companion_online&quot; /&gt; Losses of ships travelling out of convoy however were so high that no merchant ship was allowed to sail unescorted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford_companion_ships_sea_convoy&quot; /&gt;

===World War I===
{{main|Convoys in World War I}}
In the early 20th century, the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|dreadnought]] changed the balance of power in convoy battles. Steaming faster than merchant ships and firing at long ranges, a single [[battleship]] could destroy many ships in a convoy before the others could scatter over the horizon. To protect a convoy against a capital ship required providing it with an escort of another capital ship, at very high [[opportunity cost]] (i.e. potentially tying down multiple capital ships to defend different convoys against one opponent ship).

Battleships were the main reason that the British [[Admiralty]] did not adopt convoy tactics at the start of the [[first Battle of the Atlantic]] in [[World War I]]. But the German capital ships had been bottled up in the North Sea, and the main threat to shipping came from [[U-boat]]s. From a tactical point of view, World War I–era [[submarine]]s were similar to privateers in the age of sail. These submarines were only a little faster than the merchant ships they were attacking, and capable of sinking only a small number of vessels in a convoy because of their limited supply of torpedoes and shells. The Admiralty took a long time to respond to this change in the tactical position, and in April 1917 convoys were trialled, before being officially introduced in the Atlantic in September 1917.

Other arguments against convoys were raised. The primary issue was the loss of productivity, as merchant shipping in convoy has to travel at the speed of the slowest vessel in the convoy and spent a considerable amount of time in ports waiting for the next convoy to depart. Further, large convoys were thought to overload port resources.

Actual analysis of shipping losses in World War I disproved all these arguments, at least so far as they applied to transatlantic and other long-distance traffic. Ships sailing in convoys were far less likely to be sunk, even when not provided with an escort. The loss of productivity due to convoy delays was small compared with the loss of productivity due to ships being sunk. Ports could deal more easily with convoys because they tended to arrive on schedule and so loading and unloading could be planned.

In his book ''[[On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]'', Norman Dixon suggested that the hostility towards convoys in the naval establishment were in part caused by a (sub-conscious) perception of convoys as effeminating, due to warships having to care for civilian merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Dr. Norman F. ''On the Psychology of Military Incompetence'' Jonathan Cape Ltd 1976 / Pimlico 1994 pp210–211&lt;/ref&gt; Convoy duty also exposes the escorting warships to the sometimes hazardous conditions of the North Atlantic, with only rare occurrences of visible achievement (i.e. fending off a submarine assault).

===World War II===

[[File:Convoy routes 1941.jpg|thumb|325px|Convoy Routes in the Atlantic Ocean during 1941]]

====Atlantic====
{{see also|Battle of the Atlantic}}
The British adopted a convoy system, initially voluntary and later compulsory for almost all merchant ships, the moment that [[World War II]] was declared. Each convoy consisted of between 30 and 70 mostly unarmed merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=248473 Convoy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719201429/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=248473 |date=2011-07-19 }} from ''History Television.''&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian, and later American, supplies were vital for Britain to continue its war effort. The course of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was a long struggle as the Germans developed anti-convoy tactics and the British developed counter-tactics to thwart the Germans.

The capability of a heavily armed warship against a convoy was dramatically illustrated by the fate of [[Convoy HX 84]]. On November 5, 1940, the German heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} encountered the convoy. ''Maiden'', ''Trewellard'', and ''Kenbame Head'' were quickly destroyed, and  ''Beaverford'' and ''Fresno City'' falling afterwards. Only the sacrifices of the [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]] {{HMS|Jervis Bay|F40|6}} and Freighter ''Beaverford'' to stall the ''Scheer'', in addition to failing light allowed the rest of the convoy to escape.

The deterrence value of a battleship in protecting a convoy was also dramatically illustrated when the German light battleships (referred by some as battlecruisers) {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, mounting {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} guns, came upon an eastbound British convoy ([[HX 106]], with 41 ships) in the North Atlantic on February 8, 1941. When the Germans detected the slow but well-protected battleship {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} escorting the convoy, they fled the scene rather than risk damage from her {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} guns.

The enormous number of vessels involved and the frequency of engagements meant that statistical techniques could be applied to evaluate tactics: an early use of [[operational research]] in war.

Prior to overt participation in World War II, the US was actively engaged in convoys with the British in the North Atlantic Ocean, primarily supporting British activities in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Western Hemisphere, Guarding the United States and Its Outposts|last=Conn|first=Stetson|publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army. US Government Printing Office|year=1964|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C&gt;|pages=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany declared war on the US, the US Navy decided not to instigate convoys on the American eastern seaboard. US Fleet Admiral [[Ernest King]] ignored advice on this subject from the British, as he had formed a poor opinion of the Royal Navy early in his career. The result was what the U-boat crews called their [[Second Happy Time]], which did not end until convoys were introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford_Companion_online&quot; /&gt;

====Pacific====
{{See also|Pacific War}}
In the Pacific Theater of World War II, [[Japan]]ese merchant ships rarely traveled in convoys. Japanese destroyers were generally deficient in antisubmarine weaponry compared to their Allied counterparts, and the Japanese navy did not develop an inexpensive convoy escort like the Allies' [[destroyer escort]]/[[frigate]] until it was too late. In the early part of the conflict, American submarines in the Pacific were ineffective as they suffered from timid tactics, faulty torpedoes, and poor deployment, while there were only small numbers of British and Dutch boats. U.S. Admiral [[Charles A. Lockwood]]'s efforts, coupled with strenuous complaints from his captains, rectified these problems and U.S. submarines became much more successful by war's end. As a result, the Japanese merchant fleet was [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|largely destroyed]] by the end of the war. Japanese submarines, unlike their U.S. and German equivalents, focused on U.S. battle fleets rather than merchant convoys, and while they did manage some early successes, sinking two U.S. carriers, they failed to significantly inhibit the invasion convoys carrying troops and equipment in support of the U.S. island-hopping campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford_Companion_online&quot; /&gt;

Several notable battles in the South Pacific involved Allied bombers interdicting Japanese troopship convoys which were often defended by Japanese fighters, notable [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#Other actions.2C November 13.E2.80.9314|Guadalcanal]] (13 November 1942), [[Kenneth Walker#Rabaul 5 January 1943|Rabaul]] (5 January 1943), and the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] (2–4 March 1943).

At the [[Battle off Samar]], the effectiveness of the U.S. Navy's escorts was demonstrated when they managed to defend their troop convoy from a much larger and more powerful Japanese battle-fleet. The Japanese force comprised four battleships and numerous heavy cruisers, while the U.S. force consisted of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts. Large numbers of American aircraft (albeit without much anti-ship ordnance other than torpedoes) and aggressive tactics of the destroyers (with their radar-directed gunfire) allowed the U.S. to sink three Japanese heavy cruisers at the cost of one escort carrier and three destroyers.

====Tactics====
The German anti-convoy [[Naval tactics in the Age of Steam|tactics]] included:
* long-range surveillance aircraft to find convoys;
* strings of U-boats ([[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s) that could be directed onto a convoy by radio;
* breaking the British naval codes;
* improved anti-ship weapons, including magnetic detonators and sonic homing torpedoes.

The Allied responses included:
* [[airstrike|air raids]] on the U-boat bases at [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[La Rochelle]];
* converted merchant ships, e.g., [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s, [[CAM ship|Catapult Aircraft Merchantman]] and [[Armed merchantmen#Armed merchant cruisers|armed merchant cruisers]]
* [[Q-ship]]s, submarine-hunters disguised as unarmed merchant ships to lure submarines into an attack
* more convoy escorts, including cheaply produced yet effective [[destroyer escorts]]/[[frigate]]s (as [[corvette]]s were meant as a stopgap),  and [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s;
* fighter aircraft (carried by escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers) that would drive off German bombers and attack U-boats
* long-range aircraft patrols to find and attack U-boats;
* improved anti-submarine weapons such as the [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]];
* larger convoys, allowing more escorts per convoy as well as the extraction of enough escorts to form hunter-killer support groups that were not attached to a particular convoy
* allocating vessels to convoys according to speed, so that faster ships were less exposed.

They were also aided by
* improved [[sonar]] ([[Sonar|ASDIC]]) allowing escort vessels to better track U-boats;
* breaking the [[Enigma machine|German naval cipher]];
* improved [[radar]] and [[radio direction finding]] allowing planes to find and destroy U-boats;

====Convoy battles====
Many naval battles of World War II were fought around convoys, including:
* [[Convoy PQ 16]], May 1942
* [[Convoy PQ 17]], June–July 1942
* [[Convoy PQ 18]], September 1942
* [[Operation Pedestal]], August 1942
* The [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], November 1942
* The [[Battle of the Barents Sea]], December 1942
* The [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], March 1943

The convoy prefix indicates the route of the convoy. For example, 'PQ' would be Iceland to Northern Russia and 'QP' the return route.

===Analysis===
The success of convoys as an anti-submarine tactic during the world wars can be ascribed to several reasons related to U-boat capabilities, the size of the ocean and convoy escorts.

In practice, [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]] and [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX U-boat]]s were limited in their capabilities. Submerged speed and endurance was limited and not suited for overhauling many ships. Even a surfaced U-boat could take several hours to gain an attack position. Torpedo capacity was also restricted to around fourteen (Type VII) or 24 (Type IX), thus limiting the number of attacks that could be made, particularly when multiple firings were necessary for a single target. There was a real problem for the U-boats and their adversaries in finding each other; with a tiny proportion of the ocean in sight, without intelligence or radar, warships and even aircraft would be fortunate in coming across a submarine. The Royal Navy and later the United States Navy each took time to learn this lesson. Conversely, a U-boat's radius of vision was even smaller and had to be supplemented by regular long-range reconnaissance flights.

For both major allied navies, it had been difficult to grasp that, however large a convoy, its &quot;footprint&quot; (the area within which it could be spotted) was far smaller than if the individual ships had traveled independently. In other words, a submarine had less chance of finding a single convoy than if it were scattered as single ships. Moreover, once an attack had been made, the submarine would need to regain an attack position on the convoy. If, however, an attack were thwarted by escorts, even if the submarine had escaped damage, it would have to remain submerged for its own safety and might only recover its position after many hours' hard work. U-boats patrolling areas with constant and predictable flows of sea traffic, such as the United States Atlantic coast in early 1942, could dismiss a missed opportunity in the certain knowledge that another would soon present itself.

The destruction of submarines required their discovery, an improbable occurrence on aggressive patrols, by chance alone. Convoys, however, presented irresistible targets and could not be ignored. For this reason, the U-boats presented themselves as targets to the escorts with increasing possibility of destruction. In this way, the Ubootwaffe suffered severe losses, for little gain, when pressing pack attacks on well-defended convoys.

===Post-World War II===

The largest convoy effort since World War II was [[Operation Earnest Will]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] 1987&amp;ndash;88 escort of reflagged [[Kuwait]]i [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

In the present day, convoys are used as a tactic by navies to deter [[Piracy in Somalia|pirates off the coast of Somalia]] from capturing unarmed civilian freighters who would otherwise pose easy targets if they sailed alone.

==Road convoys==

===Humanitarian aid convoys===
The word &quot;convoy&quot; is also associated with groups of road vehicles being driven, mostly by volunteers, to deliver [[humanitarian aid]], supplies, and—a stated objective in some cases—&quot;solidarity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidconvoy.net/links.htm|title=Aid Convoy (charitable organisation) information on partners|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428163748/http://www.aidconvoy.net/links.htm|archivedate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s these convoys became common traveling from [[Western Europe]] to countries of the former [[Yugoslavia]], in particular [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], to deal with the aftermath of the wars there. They also travel to countries where standards of care in institutions such as orphanages are considered low by Western European standards, such as [[Romania]]; and where other disasters have led to problems, such as around the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]].

The convoys are made possible partly by the relatively small geographic distances between the stable and affluent countries of Western Europe, and the areas of need in [[Eastern Europe]] and, in a few cases, [[North Africa]] and even [[Iraq]]. They are often justified because although less directly cost-effective than mass freight transport, they emphasise the support of large numbers of small groups, and are quite distinct from multinational organisations such as [[United Nations]] humanitarian efforts.

[[File:A military convoy of Hummers leaving DC the day after the Inauguration of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|237px|A military convoy of [[Humvee]]s leaving [[Washington, D.C.]] the day after the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration of Barack Obama]]]]

===Truckers' convoys===
Truckers' convoys consisting of [[semi-trailer truck]]s and/or [[tank truck|petrol tankers]] are more similar to a [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] than a military convoy.

Truckers' convoys were created as a byproduct of the USA's [[National Maximum Speed Law|national 55&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit]] and 18-wheelers becoming the prime targets of [[speed trap]]s. Most truckers had difficult schedules to keep and as a result had to maintain a speed above the posted speed limit to reach their destinations on time. Convoys were started so that multiple trucks could run together at a high speed with the rationale being that if they passed a speed trap the police would only be able to pull over one of the trucks in the convoy. When driving on a highway, convoys are also useful to conserve fuel by [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]].

The film [[Convoy (1978 film)|''Convoy'']], inspired by a 1975 [[Convoy (song)|song of the same name]], explores the camaraderie between [[truck driver]]s, where the culture of the [[CB radio]] encourages truck drivers to travel in convoys.

[[File:marschbung.jpg|thumb|3. Einsatzeinheit of German Red Cross Freiburg Land prepares for a march under special convoy rights]]

===Special convoy rights===
[[File:Spanish RG-31 Nyala in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A convoy of Spanish Army vehicles.]]
The Highway Code of several European countries (Norway, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, possibly more) includes special rights for marked convoys. They have to be treated like a single vehicle. If the first vehicle has passed an intersection, all others may do so without interruption. If other road users overtake the convoy, they aren't allowed to split into the queue. Clear and uniform marking has been required in court decisions for these rights to apply. Operating such convoy usually needs special permission, but there are exemptions for emergency and catastrophe intervention. Common practice is, to operate with the same style of marking as NATO convoys: [[STANAG]] 2154 marking plus country-specific augmentation listed in Annex B to the STANAG.&lt;ref&gt;Annex B to STANAG 2154, &quot;Differences in National Marking of Columns and Legal Rights&quot; can be found on page 161 ff. of [http://safety.korea.army.mil/Toolbox/Resources/Publications/fm55_30.pdf FM 55-30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504115026/http://safety.korea.army.mil/Toolbox/Resources/Publications/fm55_30.pdf |date=2015-05-04 }} Linking to STANAG 2154 directly would be preferable. Anybody, who finds it in the public part of the Internet, is welcome to improve this link.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Videos showing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Oo2xsZVHGQ a convoy departure to the Elbe flood in Germany 2013] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jkDgXu3uNM the return from EU exercise FloodEx 2009 in the Netherlands] illustrate this kind of operation practically. &lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] with its high number of military exercises, the military was the main user of convoy rights. Today, catastrophes like large-scale flooding might bring a high number of flagged convoys to the roads. Large-scale evacuations for the disarming of World War II bombs are another common reason for [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) unit movements under convoy rights.

===Storm convoys===
In Norway, &quot;convoy driving&quot; ({{lang-no|kolonnekjøring}}) is used during winter in case weather is too bad for vehicles to pass on their own. Convoy driving is initiated when the strong wind quickly fills the road with snow behind snowplows, particularly on mountain passes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegvesen.no/om+statens+vegvesen/presse/Pressemeldingsarkiv/Vegdirektoratet/kolonnekj%C3%B8ring-slipp-lang-ventetid-sjekk-vegmeldingene-se-video Kolonnekjøring] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208014509/http://www.vegvesen.no/om+statens+vegvesen/presse/Pressemeldingsarkiv/Vegdirektoratet/kolonnekj%C3%B8ring-slipp-lang-ventetid-sjekk-vegmeldingene-se-video |date=2016-02-08 }}, Statens Vegvesen (in Norwegian), published 19 March 2013, accessed 7 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a limited number of vehicles are allowed for each convoy and convoy leader is obliged to decline vehicles not fit for the drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kolonnekjøring er vinterens utfordring|url=https://www.naf.no/tips-og-rad/bilferie-og-reise/reisetips/kolonnekjoring/|publisher=NAF|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm convoys are prone to [[multiple-vehicle collision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kollisjon under kolonnekjøring|url=http://www.nrk.no/telemark/kjedekollisjon-under-kolonnekjoring-1.4570411|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=NRK|date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convoy driving is used through [[Hardangervidda]] pass on [[Norwegian National Road 7|road 7]] during blizzards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vegvesenet går for billig veiløsningen på Hardangervidda|url=http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/10/27/1532/vegvesenet-gr-for-billig-veilsningen-p-hardangervidda|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=Dagens Næringsliv|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convoy is sometimes used on road E134 at the highest and most exposed sections during bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kolonnekjøring mellom Hovden og Haukeli|url=http://www.fvn.no/lokalt/setesdal/Kolonnekjoring-mellom-Hovden-og-Haukeli-2768248.html|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=Fædrelandsvennen|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[European route E6]] through [[Saltfjellet]] pass convoy driving is often used when wind speed is over 15–20&amp;nbsp;m/s ([[Beaufort scale|fresh or strong gale]]) in winter conditions.

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2020}}
'''Father of the House''' is a title that has been traditionally bestowed, unofficially, on certain members of some [[legislature]]s, most notably the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In some legislatures the title refers to the longest continuously-serving member, while in others it refers to the oldest member. Recently, the title '''Mother of the House''' or Mother of Parliament has also been used, although the usage varies between countries; it is either the female alternative to Father of the House, being applied when the relevant member is a woman, or refers to the oldest or longest-serving woman without reference to male members.

The Father of the House is a title that is bestowed on the [[Seniority|senior]] member of the House of Commons who has the longest continuous service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Father of the House: House of Commons Background Paper|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06399|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hciom3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m03.pdf |title=The Father of the House |date=March 2009 |work=Factsheet M3 |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |accessdate=2009-10-05 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325142809/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m03.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If two or more members have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earlier, as listed in ''[[Hansard]]'', is named as Father of the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/02/labour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview | title=Labour’s Dennis Skinner at 83: 'Father of the House?

The only formal duty of the Father of the House is to preside over the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The Father of the House may also participate in ceremonial events, and is the second member to be sworn in after the Speaker. At the election of the Speaker and dissolution of parliament in November 2019, the Father of the House of Commons was [[Kenneth Clarke]] representing the Rushcliffe constituency, formerly a member of the Conservative Party before becoming an Independent MP in 2019, and not standing again in the subsequent election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/boris-johnson-suffers-commons-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-him|title=Boris Johnson to seek election after rebel Tories deliver Commons defeat|accessdate=4 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke began his continuous service at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]]. [[Dennis Skinner]], Labour MP for Bolsover, also began continuous service at the 1970 general election, but was sworn in minutes after Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jun/30/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=30 June 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/01/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=1 July 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot; /&gt;

The first recorded usage of the title dates back to 1816 an engraved portrait of [[Whitshed Keene]] by Charles Picart, dated 1 February. [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until soon before his death during April 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;hciom3&quot; /&gt; On 13 June 2017, [[Harriet Harman]] was dubbed &quot;Mother of the House&quot; by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], in recognition of her status as the longest-continuously-serving woman MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-06-13/debates/EC97CC8B-CEAB-4D1D-8AEE-12D83E9E0253/ElectionOfSpeaker|title=Election of Speaker|date=13 June 2017|publisher=Commons | location=UK | work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{Main|List of longest-serving members of the Parliament of Australia}}

The titles &quot;Father of the House&quot; and &quot;Father of the Senate&quot; are sometimes used to refer to the members of each chamber of the [[Parliament of Australia]] with the longest continuous service.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-10/who-will-be-the-father-of-the-house-when-philip-ruddock-retires/9388744|title=Who will be the Father of the House when Philip Ruddock Retires?|first=Antony|last=Green|publisher=ABC News|date=20 March 2018|access-date=14 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Father of the House is [[Kevin Andrews (politician)|Kevin Andrews]] (MP since 1991) and the current Father of the Senate is [[Kim Carr]] (senator since 1993). Incumbent MP [[Warren Snowdon]] was first elected to parliament in 1987, but his service has not been consecutive and as such he is not granted the title.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

According to ''House of Representatives Practice'', the title Father of the House is a &quot;completely informal designation&quot; with &quot;no functions attached to it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter5&amp;section=10|chapter=Titles accorded to members|title=House of Representatives Practice (6th edition)|publisher=Parliament of Australia|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent publication for the Senate, ''Odgers' Australian Senate Practice'', describes the title Father of the Senate as &quot;now seldom referred to or used&quot;. It also notes that &quot;as no woman senator has ever been in this situation, it is not clear what the title would be in that circumstance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_06|chapter=Seniority of senators|title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice (14th edition)|publisher=Parliament of Australia|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{Main|Dean of the House (Canada)}}
The longest-serving member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] who is not a cabinet minister is known as the Dean of the House, and presides over the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]] at the beginning of each Parliament. As of September 2019, the current Dean of the House is Bloc Québécois MP [[Louis Plamondon]], who was first elected to the Commons as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1984.

==Germany==
Starting with the Frankfurter Nationalversammlung ([[Frankfurt Parliament]]) of 1848, all German parliaments had a father of the House, usually called ''Alterspräsident'' (President by right of age). This tradition was continued into the [[Weimar Republic]] and, after being discontinued in [[Nazi Germany]], was resumed by the present Parliament ([[Bundestag]]) in the [[Germany|Federal Republic]], whose rules of procedure mandate that the father of the house presides over the Parliament ([[Bundestag]]) at the start of each legislative period.

In accordance with tradition, the ''Alterspräsident'' first ascertains himself that he is indeed the oldest member of the Bundestag by stating his date of birth and asking if anyone is present, who was born before this date. If no older member of the Bundestag is present he will formally declare that he indeed is the Alterspräsident and will start proceedings. (In 2017, as explained below, the position was changed to refer to the longest sitting member. Accordingly, a prospective Alterspräsident states the number of years he or she has served in the Bundestag and asking if anyone has served more years.)

The ''Alterspräsident'' then delivers the first programmatic speech and supervises the election of the [[President of the Bundestag]], to whom he then immediately yields his power. The newly elected President will in turn supervise the elections of the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Vice Presidents of the Bundestag]].

The rules of order of the Bundestag also state that the ''Alterspräsident'' shall preside over sessions of the Bundestag at any given time during a legislative period, if the whole Presidium (i.e. the President and the Vice Presidents of the Bundestag) is altogether unable to perform its duties.

As the ''Alterspräsident'''s opening speech usually draws a certain amount of public attention, the position has recently attracted controversy, when the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (the succcesor of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]) obtained the position by including aged independents ([[Stefan Heym]] in 1994, [[Fred Gebhardt]] in 1998) in their party lists. In 2017, the Bundestag changed its rules of procedure to have the member with the longest service in the Bundestag serve as father of the house, rather than the oldest member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/aufgaben/rechtsgrundlagen/go_btg/go01/245154|title=Deutscher Bundestag - I.

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Senior Unofficial Member}}
In Hong Kong, there is no such term as &quot;Father of the House&quot;. Instead, the longest-serving member was termed the [[Senior Unofficial Member]] and was the highest-ranking unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] until the title was abolished during 1995 and 1992 respectively.

After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]], [[James To]] became the ''de facto'' longest-serving member of the Legislative Council since 2016 after several members who had been served since the [[1st Legislative Council of Hong Kong|1st Legislative Council]] retired.

== Hungary ==
In Hungary, the term {{lang|hu|országgyűlés korelnöke}} refers to the oldest member of the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] (previously [[Diet of Hungary|House of Representatives]], the lower house).

The original [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] building, known as [[Tudor Hall, Chipping Barnet|Tudor Hall]], was erected in 1577 opposite the Church of St John the Baptist on Wood Street, with money raised by the first governors of the school and by collections in London churches. It was repaired in 1597 and again in 1637. During the 17th century, further extensive repairs were carried out, in spite of a poor financial situation following the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Financial conditions became progressively more comfortable during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/about-us/our-history/ |title=Our History |date=2019 |website=Queen Elizabeth's School |language=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506003455/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/about-us/our-history/ |archive-date=6 May 2019 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trustees of Elizabeth Allen's Charity, which had been established by her will dated 10 February 1725, gave financial assistance to save it from a state &quot;very ruinous and unfit for habitation&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''The London Encyclopedia'': Weinreb, Hibbert, Keay and Keay (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; It then became a private boarding school.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; It was closed in 1872 and restored in 1874 with many additions. In 1885 a governor, H. E. Chetwynd Stapleton, bought a plot of land behind the Jesus Hospital, a building in Wood Street dating back to 1679; today the Stapylton field stands in front of the main School building and is used for rugby and cricket.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;&quot;[http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/who_we_are/our_history Queen Elizabeth's School â€“ Our history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304061312/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/who_we_are/our_history |date=4 March 2017 }}&quot;. www.qebarnet.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of pupils outgrew the capacity of Tudor Hall, so the school was transferred in 1932 to a new site in Queen's Road, which backed on to the Stapylton field. It was administered by the South Herts Division of [[Hertfordshire County Council]], until 1965 when it became part of the borough of Barnet. In the 1960s, there were around 550 boys with 150 in the sixth form. Tudor Hall was completely restored in 1968 by the [[London Borough of Barnet]], and is now part of [[Barnet and Southgate College]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Two plaques are located on the walls of the original school building, Tudor Hall. Inscribed on the stone plaque is: &lt;blockquote&gt;This is to commemorate the original school founded here by Queen Elizabeth and built in 1573. The school was removed in 1932 to new building in Queens Road, Barnet. This plaque was erected by the Visitors of Jesus Hospital Charity, the owners in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/tudor-hall-stone/ |title=Tudor Hall - stone |date=1952 |website=London Remembers |language=en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209012316/http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/tudor-hall-stone |archive-date=9 February 2017 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A more recent blue plaque was erected by the London borough of Barnet which dictates: &lt;blockquote&gt; This Tudor Hall housed the free grammar school of Queen Elizabeth I who granted its charter in 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/tudor-hall-blue/ |title=Tudor Hall - blue |website=London Remembers |language=en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209012354/http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/tudor-hall-blue |archive-date=9 February 2017 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Grammar school reinstatement===
Under Eamonn Harris (Headmaster 1984 - 1999), who took over the school when earmarked for closure, it returned to its previous selective [[grammar school]] status in August 1994, having opted out of the London borough and become a [[grant-maintained school]] in 1989. Other schools in Greater London did this, and many became [[Partially selective school (England)|partially selective]] (up to 50%) at this time. In the 1990s it went on to become England's top state school for A Levels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/leadership-courage-and-commitment-reforming-headmaster-eamonn-harris-1984-1999-has-passed-away/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4183309/Queen-Elizabeths-boys-show-the-girls-they-too-can-excel.html |title=Queen Elizabeth's boys show the girls they too can excel |last=Lightfoot |first=Liz |date=2002-08-15 |website=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111092736/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4183309/Queen-Elizabeths-boys-show-the-girls-they-too-can-excel.html |archive-date=11 January 2018 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls|girls' school]] remained a comprehensive.

From 1999 to 2011, the headmaster was Dr John Marincowitz, who commissioned the new Martin [[swimming pool]], opened in 2006, the Shearly Hall, opened in 2009, and a library. In 2011 Neil Enright became the 40th headmaster, and the completion and use of the Queen's library took place.

QE has been criticized by many current and former pupils for a very strict approach to discipline. In April 2000, this led a group of current and former pupils to create a website where they could talk about their experiences. This was known as 'QE Boys: The Truth'. It gained more hits than the official website, and the school excluded three pupils for posting messages on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/haze129/faq.html |title=FAQ |date=2000-04-20 |website=QE Boys: The Truth |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208103354/http://geocities.com/haze129/faq.html |archive-date=8 February 2009 |access-date=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current system uses 'bad notes' sent directly to parents via e-mail if a pupil repeatedly shows poor behaviour or organization. If too many accumulate, the issue is referred to the pupil's tutor and then to their year head. Very uncommon punishments are Saturday detentions, but the discipline in QE is highly exaggerated by the public who believe that in order to attain such high results, the school must also be very strict.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Culture and sports==
Queen Elizabeth's School is divided into six houses, named after famous old boys, patrons and former teachers. They are Broughton, Harrisons', Leicester, Pearce, Stapylton and Underne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/beyond-the-classroom/qe-houses/ |title=QE Houses |date=2019 |website=Queen Elizabeth's School |language=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506004448/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/beyond-the-classroom/qe-houses/ |archive-date=6 May 2019 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In years 7 to 10, there are six [[tutor group]]s per year, one per house. They are named by the academic year and the first letter of the house, for example year 10 students in Underne belong to the tutor group 10U. Students stay in the same tutor groups as they progress during these four years. In year 11, each tutor group is split into two, and the number 1 or 2 is added to the tutor group name. For example, 10U is split into 11U1 and 11U2. In years 12 and 13, the tutor groups are much smaller and run alphabetically instead. Year 13 tutor groups take letters 13A to 13J and year 12 tutor groups take letters 12K to 12T.

There are many inter-house competitions, from rugby to creative writing. The inter-house debating tournaments, for years 7 to 9, take place in English lessons in the Summer term and are probably the most fiercely contested non-physical inter-house competition.

[[Rugby union]], played during the winter and spring terms, is compulsory for boys in their first four years at the school, as are [[cross country running]] and most other school sports, which include [[orienteering]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]], [[cricket]], [[Eton Fives]] and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clubs &amp; Extra-Curricular&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/beyond-the-classroom/clubs-extra-curricular/ |title=Clubs &amp; Extra-Curricular |date=2019 |website=Queen Elizabeth's School |language=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506004211/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/beyond-the-classroom/clubs-extra-curricular/ |archive-date=6 May 2019 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; QE is well known for not playing [[association football|football]] competitively against other schools, although it is occasionally played internally in friendly games. Students also take part in cross country runs semi-annually, at the start of the autumn and spring terms. A particularly muddy part of the cross-country route, suitably nicknamed the 'Elephant Dip', owing to its extreme depth in wet weather, links the Byng Road Open Space (Barnet RFC) and the north-west gate of the bottom fields, however there is also a paved route turning right from the gate and going down Byng Road towards the Open Space. Students regularly use the Barnet RFC's fields (the Byng Road Open Space) which are a short run from the back field gate.

There is much competition in the summer term when frequent competitions between houses are held before the summer examinations begin in June, including the QE Sevens Tournament which takes place in the school for the U14s and U16s. It is normally held at the end of the Spring Term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/academic_departments/physical_education |title=qebarnet.co.uk: PE |access-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624111733/http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/academic_departments/physical_education |archive-date=24 June 2013 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A level and Essential Skills assessments==
Boys usually choose four [[Course (education)|subjects]] which will be studied for [[GCE Advanced Level|AS]], but may drop one for [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]], either voluntarily, or because it does not appear that they can continue with outstanding performance in the subject. These subjects can, liable to some controversy, only be chosen after receiving offers of study, commonly referred to as 'recommendations', in those particular subjects. Given the large number of students who achieve many, sometimes straight, grades 8 or 9 at [[GCSE]], achieving an outstanding grade in a given subject at GCSE level is not sufficient to judge suitability for A Level. Instead, students must show that they have the 'essential skills' required to thrive at A Level in the subjects. Once departments are confident that a student possesses the required 'essential skills', only then will they issue a recommendation. To judge this, criteria are set by each department which must be met either in regular end-of-topic tests during the GCSE course, or by 'Essential Skills' tests which are sat exclusively to measure performance against these criteria. A minority of recommendations are issued to those who have met the criteria in November of year 11, but most will have an opportunity to meet further criteria in further tests, often including the GCSE [[Test preparation|mock exams]], to then get a recommendation in February. If a boy does not receive a minimum of four recommendations, the school may effectively kick the boy out by advising that a subject will not be feasible for them to continue studying. In some exceptional cases, boys who achieve a Grade 9 at GCSE may be able to continue study in the sixth form.

One of the main focuses of sixth form is preparation for entry into higher education. As a result, the school focuses on career advice, the [[UCAS]] application process, personal statements, finance and other things related to university entry, which are often covered in [[PSHE]] lessons (known internally as Personal Development time or PDT) which take place in tutor groups once a week, as with lower years. The school also encourages that students partake in a wide range of extra curricular actives both outside of and during school time, such as the recommended 40 hours of volunteering.

==Founder's Day fÃªte==
The Founder's Day [[fÃªte]], and the preceding service of celebration at St John the Baptist's Church, Barnet, is the largest cultural event in the school calendar. It is held every year, regardless of weather, on the third Saturday in June, and celebrates the founding of the school in 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/about-us/friends-of-queen-elizabeths/ |title=The Friends of Queen Elizabeth's |date=2019 |website=Queen Elizabeth's School |language=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506003735/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/about-us/friends-of-queen-elizabeths/ |archive-date=6 May 2019 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Year 7 students must attend the service in full uniform. The [[School governor|governors]] also attend, as do most teachers, in academic dress with gowns. Teachers wearing gowns with white fur went to Cambridge University. The [[Head girl and head boy|head boys]], past and present, are readers at the service,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and the school choir sings. The hymns sung are: &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot;, &quot;For all the saints&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Now thank we all our God&quot;. &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; is always sung at the end of the service. The boys then walk back to the school along Wood Street and prepare for the roll call on Staplyton Field. This is again compulsory for all of Year 7, with five boys from each house attending from all other senior years. In the past, this was compulsory for the whole school. The boys troop in from the two wings of the main building and form three lines stretching across the School Field. The boys of each house sit together, although traditionally they had to stand. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The School Chronicle is read out each year at Founder's Day by the head teacher during the Roll Call, with minor additions as necessary. It was originally prepared in 1930 by Ernest H. Jenkins, the headmaster, Cecil Tripp, Secretary of the Old Elizabethan Association and a Governor of the school for twenty-four years. The most up to date school chronicle is listed on the school website and was read out during the Roll Call at Founder's Day 2017.

In 2020, most boys were not in school due to the coronavirus pandemic, so the Roll Call was recorded with [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]] and only year 7 boys attended. The fÃªte was published as a 45-minute video on [[YouTube]].

==Kerala partnership==
QE Boys has formed a long-term partnership with a school in [[Kerala]] called the Sri Sathya Sai School, funded by the '[https://web.archive.org/web/20120330163335/http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/beyond_the_classroom/clubs___extra_curricular/charities_-_the_sai_school_appeal Sathya Sai Appeal']. In addition, the school has strong links with charities through the house system, and three events are held each academic year (two houses join forces for each event) to generate funds for a charity elected by students and staff. These range from guessing teachersâ€™ childhood pictures to general knowledge quizzes.

==Traditions==
* The name of every [[head boy]] of the school is written on two boards in the school's main hall. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!-- see talk--&gt;
* Each house has its own colour, represented by coloured stripes for the corresponding house on ties. The colours used to be on the boys' caps, but these are no longer worn. Red denotes Broughton, brown for Harrisons', yellow for Leicester, purple for Pearce, blue for Stapylton and green for Underne.
* In the Lower School, subjects which aren't divided into ability based sets are set either in tutor groups (see above), or in two halves of the year â€“ Broughton, Harrisons' and Leicester (BHL), and Pearce, Stapylton and Underne (PSU).
* Different 'colours' ties are used to denote achievement or position, e.g. school [[Prefect#Academic|prefects]] can be identified with their ties which are patterned with thick light-blue stripes.

==House system==
The foundation and naming of the six houses is listed below: 
*Broughton â€” Named in memory of [[William Broughton (bishop)|William Grant Broughton]], an Old Elizabethan, who was appointed Archdeacon of New South Wales in 1828 and subsequently became the first Bishop of Australia.
*Harrisons' â€” The only House to honour two people, Harrisons' was established in 1954. It was named after a senior master, G. W. N. Harrison, who had taught at the school for 41 years until 1929, and E. W. Harrison (no relation), another long-serving and dedicated schoolmaster who retired in 1950.
*Leicester â€” A continuing reminder of the School's beginnings: [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], Earl of Leicester made the request to Queen Elizabeth for a charter for the School in 1573.
*Pearce â€” John Pearce began his teaching career at the School in 1932, aged 23. In 1950 he became Senior Master, a post he held until he retired in 1971. The sixth House was named after him on its creation in 1971 when the School became comprehensive and expanded.
*Stapylton â€” Named after former Chairman of Governors H. E. Chetwynd-Stapylton, who in 1885 bought the Stapylton field for the school, which is still very much in use today.
*Underne â€” Once Queen Elizabeth had granted the Charter for the school, funds were needed to finance it. Edward Underne, Rector of Chipping Barnet Church, was responsible for raising the money for the original building of the School in the 1570s.

==Academic excellence==
In 2007, QE came first in the [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] league table for state schools, and twelfth in the [[GCSE]] league table for state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1560500/Two-grammars-lead-the-field.html |title=Two grammars lead the field |last=Lightfoot |first=Liz |date=2007-08-16 |website=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506182400/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1560500/Two-grammars-lead-the-field.html |archive-date=6 May 2018 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 QE again topped the league table in A-level results and a record number of 37 pupils gained a place in [[Oxbridge|Oxbridge Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/new_and_noteworthy?newsID=178 |title=QE is top state school |access-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165047/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/new_and_noteworthy?newsID=178 |archive-date=11 January 2018 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2559622/A-levels-Queen-Elizabeths-Grammar-tops-table-for-third-year-in-a-row.html |title=A-levels: Queen Elizabeth's Grammar tops table for third year in a row |last=Paton |first=Graeme |last2=Bingham |first2=John |date=2008-08-14 |website=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505225131/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2559622/A-levels-Queen-Elizabeths-Grammar-tops-table-for-third-year-in-a-row.html |archive-date=5 May 2018 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 QE topped the league table in A-level results for the third consecutive year. Students are only allowed to progress to the Sixth Form if subject teachers feel they will be capable of obtaining the highest grades, regardless of performance in other subjects or participation in the extracurricular life of the school. This has led to the accusation that the school has been putting their position in league tables above the interests of pupils. This led to QE Boys becoming national news, with this practice dubbed 'Eamonn's Hit List', referring to the head teacher, Eamonn Harris. Most notably, the ''Times Education Supplement'' ran a front page with a sizeable cartoon of Mr Harris.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In January 2014, it was announced that Barrie Martin, Chairman of the QE Governing Body and the Friends of Queen Elizabeth's was awarded an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for 'Services to Education'.  Headmaster Neil Enright described Martin as: 'an asset to QE in so many ways, combining a tireless work ethic with tremendous focus and an utterly reliable good nature'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/queen-elizabeths-school-chairman-of-governors-awarded-mbe-2/ |title=Queen Elizabeth's School Chairman of Governors awarded MBE |date=2014-01-01 |website=Queen Elizabeth's School |language=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924215327/https://www.qebarnet.co.uk/queen-elizabeths-school-chairman-of-governors-awarded-mbe-2/ |archive-date=24 September 2019 |access-date=2019-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, QE came first in the A-Level league tables for selective state (grammar) schools for the 5th year in a row, also coming sixth in the [[GCSE]] league tables for grammar schools. 2016 would make the eighth year, in the past decade, that the school have achieved the top spot in the A Level league tables, solidifying their position at the forefront of the modern British educational scene.

==Head Boys==
There have been many head boys throughout the history of the school, all of which have their names engraved on a board on the main school hall. The head boy stays in office for a full year, previously being from September - July, but recently{{when|date=January 2018}} changed to January - December, meaning that the Head Boy will be in office in part of his Year 12 and 13.

==Other Information==
===Admissions procedure===
Admission to the school is strictly by academic selection, and boys may apply to join the school for Year 7. Most years, roughly 3,600 applicants compete in a series of examinations to be awarded one of the 180 places offered annually, making places at the grammar school some of the most sought after and oversubscribed in the country.

Parents of boys not admitted to the school have protested and appealed against the school's selective admissions policy. Sometimes this has been because the prospective boy's parents have moved to the area assuming a place will be guaranteed,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} when this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/images/cms_files/Prospectus%202008.pdf |title=Admissions Policy |access-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010031818/http://www.qebarnet.co.uk/images/cms_files/Prospectus%202008.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was also on a list of schools breaching admissions laws in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;standard.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Balls names schools that broke rules|url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/balls-names-schools-that-broke-rules-6685733.html|website = Evening Standard|accessdate = 2016-01-07|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barnet education authority asked for an investigation by Her Majesty's Inspectorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;standard.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

=== Contribution requests ===
In 2014 it was reported that the school, despite not being of independent school status, was making regular forcible requests to parents for 'voluntary donations' in order to provide the facilities pupils needed, with parents contributing monthly, usually around Â£60. The school justified these requests by saying that state funding was not sufficient to provide a sound education and &quot;the polish for boys to go on to the best universities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/lucy-tobin-today-s-school-lesson-how-to-beg-off-parents-9136230.html|title=Today's school lesson â€“ how to beg off parents|last=Tobin|first=Lucy|date=18 February 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=15|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''monarchy of the United Kingdom&lt;!--Please do not add &quot;of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;; it was &quot;Great Britain&quot; only from 1707 and &quot;Great Britain and Ireland&quot; from 1801--&gt;''', commonly referred to as the '''British monarchy''', is the [[constitutional monarchy]] of the [[United Kingdom]], its [[Crown dependencies|dependencies]] (the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]]) and its [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]]. The current monarch and [[head of state]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who ascended the throne in 1952.

The monarch and [[British royal family|their immediate family]] undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] and [[kissing hands|appointing]] the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is also [[Head of the British Armed Forces]]. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the monarch's [[royal prerogative]], these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and [[precedent]]. The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is known as Her (His) Majesty's Government.

The British monarchy traces its origins from the [[petty kingdom]]s of [[early medieval Scotland]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], which consolidated into the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by the 10th century. England was [[Norman conquest of England|conquered by the Normans]] in 1066, after which [[Wales]] too gradually came under control of [[Anglo-Normans]]. The process was completed in the 13th century when the [[Principality of Wales]] became a [[client state]] of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' began a process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a [[Union of the crowns|single sovereign]]. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican [[Commonwealth of England]], which followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] excluded [[Roman Catholics]] and their spouses from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and in 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] joined to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The British monarch was the nominal head of the vast [[British Empire]], which covered a quarter of the world's land area at its greatest extent in 1921.

In the early 1920s the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] recognised the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s of the Empire into separate, self-governing countries within a [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In the years after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the Empire to an end. [[George VI]] and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The United Kingdom and fifteen other independent sovereign states that share the same person as their monarch are called [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Although the monarch is shared, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the monarch has a different, specific, and official national [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|title and style]] for each realm.

==Constitutional role==
In the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], the monarch (otherwise referred to as the [[sovereign]] or &quot;His/Her [[Majesty]]&quot;, abbreviated H.M.) is the [[head of state]].  The Queen's image is used to signify British [[sovereignty]] and government authorityâ€”her profile, for instance, appearing on [[Pound sterling|currency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coinageandbanknotes.aspx|title=Symbols of the Monarchy: Coinage and bank notes|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her portrait in government buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Aslet |first1=Clive |title=Our picture of Her Majesty will never fade |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10844075/Our-picture-of-Her-Majesty-will-never-fade.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=30 October 2018 |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sovereign is further both mentioned in and the subject of songs, loyal toasts, and salutes. &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;God Save the King&quot;) is the British [[national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx |title=Symbols of the Monarchy: National Anthem |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902162152/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oath of allegiance|Oaths of allegiance]] are made to the Queen and her lawful successors.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{citation|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/ceremony/|title=Citizenship ceremonies|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=Home Office: UK Border Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch takes little direct part in government. The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the monarch, either by [[statute]] or by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], to [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]] or officers of [[the Crown]], or other [[public body|public bodies]], exclusive of the monarch personally. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments,&lt;ref&gt;Crown Appointments Act 1661 c.6&lt;/ref&gt; even if personally performed by the monarch, such as the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]], depend upon decisions made elsewhere:
* Legislative power is exercised by the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], by and with the advice and consent of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].
* Executive power is exercised by [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]], which comprises [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]], primarily the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], which is technically a committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. They have the direction of the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Crown]], [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|the Civil Service]] and other Crown Servants such as the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Services]] (the Queen receives certain foreign intelligence reports before the prime minister does&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In London, the revelations from [1989 Soviet defector Vladimir] Pasechnik were summarized&lt;!--As spelled in the original text--&gt; into a quick note for the Joint Intelligence Committee. The first recipient of such reports is always Her Majesty, The Queen. The second is the prime minister, who at the time was [[Margaret Thatcher|[Margaret] Thatcher]].&quot; Hoffman, David E. (Emanuel), ''The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy'' (N.Y.: Doubleday, 1st ed. [1st printing?] ({{ISBN|978-0-385-52437-7}}) 2009), p. 336 (author contributing editor &amp; formerly U.S. White House, diplomatic, &amp; Jerusalem correspondent, Moscow bureau chief, &amp; foreign news asst. managing editor for [[Washington Post|''The Wash. Post'']]).&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Judicial power is vested in the various [[judiciaries of the United Kingdom]], who by constitution and statute&lt;ref&gt;s3. Constitutional Reform Act 2005&lt;/ref&gt; have [[judicial independence]] of the Government.
* The [[Church of England]], of which the monarch is the head, has its own legislative, judicial and executive structures.
* Powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or [[Statutory Instrument]] such as an [[Order in Council]], [[Royal Commission]] or otherwise.

The sovereign's role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non-partisan functions, such as granting [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]]. This role has been recognised since the 19th century. The constitutional writer [[Walter Bagehot]] identified the monarchy in 1867 as the &quot;dignified part&quot; rather than the &quot;efficient part&quot; of government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagehot, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:English Bill of Rights of 1689.jpg|left|thumb|The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] curtailed the monarch's governmental power.]]

===Appointment of the prime minister===
Whenever necessary, the monarch is responsible for appointing a new prime minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other [[Minister of the Crown]], and thereby constitutes and controls the government). In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The prime minister takes office by attending the monarch in private audience, and after &quot;[[kissing hands]]&quot; that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Brazier, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[hung parliament]] where no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support, though it would usually be the leader of the largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, pp.59â€“60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|title=Queen and Prime Minister|accessdate=18 June 2010|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx|archive-date=14 April 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1945, there have only been three hung parliaments. The first followed the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] when [[Harold Wilson]] was appointed Prime Minister after [[Edward Heath]] resigned following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 general election]], in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] (the largest party) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] (the third largest party) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. The third occurred shortly thereafter, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]], when the Conservative Party lost its majority in a snap election, though the party remained in power as a minority government.

===Dissolution of Parliament===
In 1950 the King's [[Private Secretary]] [[Sir Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan &quot;Tommy&quot; Lascelles]], writing pseudonymously to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, asserted a constitutional convention: according to the [[Lascelles Principles]], if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|resulting general election]] gave Wilson a small majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/results.htm|title=Results and analysis: General election, 10 October 1974|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=11 March 2008|publisher=Political Science Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss the prime minister, but in practice the prime minister's term nowadays comes to an end only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation. The last monarch to remove the prime minister was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who dismissed [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Michael (September 2004; online edition, January 2008). &quot;William IV (1765â€“1837)&quot;. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 10 October 2008 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] removed the monarch's authority to dissolve Parliament; however the Act specifically retained the monarch's power of ''prorogation'', which is a regular [[Legislative session#United Kingdom|feature of the parliamentary calendar]].

===Royal prerogative===
{{Main|Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom}}
Some of the government's executive authority is theoretically and nominally vested in the sovereign and is known as the [[royal prerogative]]. The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, exercising prerogative only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the prime minister or [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].&lt;ref name=parl&gt;{{citation|author1=Durkin, Mary |author2=Gay, Oonagh |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf|title=The Royal Prerogative|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=21 December 2005|publisher=House of Commons Library |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625170825/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, prerogative powers are exercised only on the prime minister's advice â€“ the prime minister, and not the sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the prime minister; no records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx | title=The Queen's working day &gt; Evening | accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of prime minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot's words: &quot;the sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy&amp;nbsp;... three rights â€“ the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bagehot, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the royal prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, &quot;The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers&quot;, and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.&lt;ref name=PASC&gt;{{citation|title=PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |year=2002 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104135404/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces|Head of the Armed Forces]] (the [[Royal Navy]], the [[British Army]], and the [[Royal Air Force]]), and accredits British [[High Commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s, and receives [[Head of mission|heads of missions]] from foreign states.&lt;ref name=PASC/&gt;

It is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which the sovereign reads the [[Speech from the throne]] in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |title=About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament |accessdate=27 April 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119091636/http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm |url-status=dead |archivedate=19 November 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm|title=A Guide to Prorogation|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=7 November 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], but can be held sooner if the prime minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election.

Before a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, the [[royal assent]] (the monarch's approval) is required.&lt;ref&gt;Crabbe, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82104.stm|title=Royal Assent|accessdate=27 April 2008|date=24 January 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch has a similar relationship with the [[devolution|devolved]] governments of Scotland, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sovereign appoints the [[First Minister of Scotland]] on the nomination of the [[Scottish Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/345189.stm|title=UK Politics: Dewar appointed First Minister|accessdate=10 October 2008|date=17 May 1999|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[First Minister of Wales]] on the nomination of the [[Senedd Cymru â€“ Welsh Parliament|Senedd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/legislation/govwalesact2006/briefoverview?lang=en|title=Brief overview â€“ Government of Wales Act 2006|accessdate=30 August 2011|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026023357/http://new.wales.gov.uk/legislation/govwalesact2006/briefoverview?lang=en|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scottish matters, the sovereign acts on the advice of the [[Scottish Government]]. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the sovereign acts on the advice of the prime minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The sovereign can veto any law passed by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], if it is deemed unconstitutional by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_2 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sovereign is deemed the &quot;fount of justice&quot;; although the sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the sovereign &quot;can do no wrong&quot;; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The sovereign exercises the &quot;prerogative of mercy&quot;, which is used to [[pardon]] convicted offenders or reduce sentences.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;&lt;ref name=PASC/&gt;

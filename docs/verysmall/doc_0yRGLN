There are few differences between all 3 generations of the 7s. The second and third generations have lead free solder, different software assigned for each generation that can be swapped if you wish, and on the 3rd generation, changed wi-fi. Although there are a few differences, it still is a great idea and is recommended to have all 3 generations of the 7s in your AIBO pack or toy/robot collection as they are a marvelous piece of history, and also because other people like collecting the different generations of things that usually leads to the development, or final model.

=== Fifth generation models ===

==== ERS-1000 ====
January 2018

The first model to be released since the AIBO project was discontinued in 2006. Requires an always-on internet connection to function fully and comes with an LTE SIM card and monthly subscription service to support interaction and learning in the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aibo.sony.jp/feature/basic.html?s_pid=jp_aibo_/store/_basic_detail|title=aiboベーシックプラン {{!}} aibo|website=aibo.sony.jp|language=ja|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of aibo has a much cuter appearance than most of the other models. The ERS-1000 can recognize up to 100 faces, and can memorize a customize-able trick, and responds to over 50 voice commands.
It costs around $3,000.

===QRIO===
[[File:QRIO watch AIBOs at Robocup.jpg|thumb|QRIOs watch AIBOs at a Robocup event]]

The humanoid [[QRIO]] robot was designed as the successor to AIBO and runs the same base R-CODE and Aperios operating system. Its development was halted before it saw a commercial release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2006-01-26|title=Sony reports strong earnings but unplugs Aibo|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1049118/sony.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Macworld|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
The initial ERS-110 AIBO's hardware includes a 64-bit RISC processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, sensors (touch, camera, range-finder, microphone, acceleration, angular velocity), a speaker and actuators (legs, neck, mouth, tail).&lt;ref name=&quot;sony.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199905/99-046/index.html |title=Sony Global - Press Release - Sony Launches Four-Legged Entertainment Robot &quot;AIBO&quot; Creates a New Market for Robot-Based Entertainment |publisher=Sony.net |date=1999-05-11 |access-date=2013-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028033310/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199905/99-046/index.html |archive-date=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series developed, more sensors and actuators were added. Wi-Fi was available as an add on for some second-generation AIBOs. The third and final family of AIBOs, the ERS-7s, have multiple head and body sensors, clicking ear actuators, a chest-mounted proximity sensor, expressive &quot;Illume-Face&quot; and Wi-Fi connectivity. 

All AIBOs were bundled with accessories including a charging station and pink ball toy. Late-model ERS7's were bundled with a pink AIBone bone-shaped toy, playing cards and a charging station with pole and marker mat for autonomous docking.

==Software==
All AIBOs are bundled with AIBOLife software giving the robot a personality, the ability to walk, &quot;see&quot; its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands (English and Spanish, or Japanese). AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/100935792.html?dids=100935792:100935792&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+20%2C+2002&amp;author=Joshua+Klein&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Nobukazu+Takemura%2C+Synthesizing+Things+Up&amp;pqatl=google Nobukazu Takemura, Synthesizing Things Up] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The sounds in ERS-7 Mind and custom data were composed by [[Masaya Matsuura]], a Japanese musician and game designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonydigital-link.com/AIBO/2_0_interview.asp |title=Sony AIBO Europe - Official Website - AIBO News |publisher=Sonydigital-link.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aperios and Open-R===
Aperios is Sony's Proprietary Real-Time Operating system, used in all AIBOs, QRIO and some other consumer devices. Aperios OS was intended to be widely deployed using revolutionary real-time capabilities to handle multiple audio and visual data streams concurrently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.11/sony_pr.html |title=Wired 7.11: Sony's Plan for World Recreation |website=Wired.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was not widely adopted, and by 2003 Sony had stopped active development with COO Kunitake Ando commenting &quot;Aperios was an operating system of a pre-Internet age and we decided that it isn't adequate for the future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4137118/Linux-and-TV-called-key-to-broadband-tsunami |title=Linux and TV called key to broadband tsunami |publisher=Eetimes.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPEN-R architecture is specific to entertainment robots. The architecture involves the use of modular hardware components, such as appendages that can be easily removed and replaced to change the shape and function of the robots, and modular software components that can be interchanged to change their behavior and movement patterns. AIBO's creator, Doi, called OPEN-R the ''masterpiece'' of the AIBO development project, arguing it would minimize the need for programming individual movements or responses, and its &quot;open&quot; nature would encourage a global community of robot specialists and programmers to add capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;This Cute Little Pet Is a Robot&quot;/&gt;

===AIBOware===
First and second generation models of AIBO can load different software packages sold by Sony. AIBOware (a trademark of Sony corporation) is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]]. The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the [[robot]] to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without AIBOware, AIBOs run in &quot;clinic mode&quot; and can only perform basic actions.

Third generation ERS-7 models have a sole &quot;Mind&quot; software that includes capabilities of AIBOLife and other AIBOware packages. Mind software also includes a docking process, allowing ERS-7's to recharge autonomously. Upgrades in Mind2 included the AIBO Entertainment Player, a Wi-Fi based connection to a PC. Upgrades in Mind3 included speech, blogging and autonomous room mapping.

AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station. The vision system is an implementation of [[Evolution Robotics]] ERVision.

===AIBO Software Development Environment===

Initially, access to programming capabilities was limited to Sony and organizations participating in Robocup. By reverse-engineering AIBO, users developed their own software that operated together with AIBOware such as &quot;DiscoAibo&quot; which made the robotic canine dance to music.

In a significant copyright milestone, Sony invoked the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in October 2001, and sent a cease-and-desist notice demanding that &quot;Aibopet&quot; stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the [[copy protection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=24 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014133659/http://www.chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=24 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-10-14 |title=No New Tricks for Robot Dog - Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |access-date=2013-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmon |first=Amy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/05/technology/05AIBO.html |title=Sony Tightens Leash on Its Robotic Dog |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=2001-11-05 |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca |title=Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2010-03-03 |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the face of complaints by many outraged AIBO owners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Farhad Manjoo |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/11/48088 |title=Aibo Owners Biting Mad at Sony |website=Wired.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony backed down and subsequently released a programmer's kit for &quot;non-commercial&quot; use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sony Corporation|title=OPEN-R Architecture Specifications To Be Made Public|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/200205/02-017E/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kit was eventually expanded into three distinct tools: R-CODE, the OPEN-R SDK and the AIBO Remote Framework (ERS-7 only). These three tools are combined under the name AIBO Software Development Environment. All of these tools were free to download and could be used for commercial or non-commercial use (Except for the OPEN-R SDK, which is specifically for non-commercial use).

====OPEN-R SDK====
The OPEN-R SDK is a C++ based programming SDK, based on open-source tools (like gcc and newlib), that allows you to make software that executes on your AIBO. This SDK is considered low-level and allows you to control everything from the gain values of AIBO's actuators to retrieving AIBO's camera data and doing computer vision computations. No pre-built &quot;standard&quot; AIBO functionality is provided, such as it is with R-Code and AIBO Remote Framework. It is an excellent choice for researchers doing low-level robotic research.

====R-CODE and R-CODE plus====
R-Code is a high-level scripting language for AIBO. R-Code allows you to very easily create simple programs for AIBO to execute. While it does not allow the low-level control that the OPEN-R SDK has, what it lacks in power it makes up for in simplicity. Remoting is possible via a simple terminal socket connection via WiFi. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.

R-CodePlus is a derivative of R-Code by AiboPet with several added functionalities. R-CodePlus is a superset of R-Code in terms of language, so everything written in standard R-Code will work on an R-CodePlus MemoryStick (for the same Model AIBO). R-CodePlus exposes some new &quot;basic&quot; AIBO functions such as simple face recognition, name registration, and camera adjustment settings. In addition to the standard R-Code terminal socket for remoting, R-CodePlus supplies a &quot;Telemetry&quot; socket for several binary data transfers such as AIBO's camera image and sending/receiving sound. R-CODE has been extended to R-CODE plus by Aibopet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aibohack.com/rcode/rcp_overview.htm |title=[AiboHack&amp;#93; AiboPet R-code Extensions |publisher=Aibohack.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aibnet offers a development environment for R-Code programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DogsBody |url=http://www.dogsbodynet.com/aibnet.html |title=Aibnet Telnet Console |publisher=Dogsbodynet.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplified drag-and-drop customizing of behavior is available via the user-created YART (&quot;Yet Another RCode Tool &quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aibohack.com/rcode/yart.htm |title=[AiboHack&amp;#93; YART = Yet Another R-Code Tool |publisher=Aibohack.com |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AIBO Remote Framework ====

Remotely access capabilities of AIBO MIND including behaviors and pattern recognition from a Windows PC. Same functionality used in the Aibo Entertainment Player. The AIBO Remote Framework is a Windows PC API based on Visual C++. The Framework can be used to write code that can remotely control an AIBO running MIND2 or MIND3 Aiboware via a wireless LAN. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.

===Other Development Environments===
Several robot software development frameworks have been developed that support AIBOs, including [[URBI]], Tekkotsu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tekkotsu.org/about.html|title=About Tekkotsu|date=2010|website=www.tekkotsu.org|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Python Robotics|Pyro]].

===Current Projects===

AiBO+ is a replacement personality for Sony ERS-7. The project provides an AEP-like application (AiBO+ Client) to connect to the robot under Ubuntu Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. The owner can control the dog, play a game and see the robot state.&lt;ref name=&quot;aiboplus.sourceforge.net&quot;/&gt;

AIBO Control allows Android users to control AIBO ERS-7's running URBI.&lt;ref name=&quot;play.google.com&quot;/&gt;

The Open-R and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] based [[toolchain]] has been updated by the community to use GCC 5.4, [[GNU Binutils|Binutils]] 2.24 and [[Newlib]] 1.15. This improvement brings the latest C++11/C++14 features and modern software to program the robot. The packaged version of the old and updated AIBO toolchain is available for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] in a [[Personal Package Archive|PPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://launchpad.net/~csaba-kertesz/+archive/aiboplus |title=Ubuntu PPA with Aibo toolchain |publisher=Launchpad.net |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AIBOs in Education and Academia==
[[File:Robocup 2005 Aibos.jpg|thumb|Penalty shootout]]
AIBO's were used extensively in education. For example, Carnegie Mellon offered an AIBO-centred robotics course covering models of perception, cognition, and action for solving problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-491/ |title=15-491 Fall 2008 |date=2010-07-25 |access-date=2013-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725050329/http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-491/ |archive-date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robotbenchmark&lt;ref name=&quot;robotbenchmark&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://robotbenchmark.net | title=robotbenchmark | access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; also features an online simulation challenge based on an Aibo ERS-7 model called &quot;Visual Tracking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/visual_tracking/ | title=robotbenchmark visual tracking | access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RoboCup Four-Legged League===
[[File:Aibos playing football at Robocup 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|AIBO robots playing in the 9th RoboCup in Osaka (2005)]]
The AIBO has seen much use as an inexpensive platform for [[artificial intelligence]] education and research because it integrates a computer, [[Computer vision|vision system]], and articulators in a package vastly cheaper than conventional research robots. One focal point for that development has been the Robocup Leagues.

The Four-Legged League was the initial name for the [[RoboCup Standard Platform League]], a robot soccer league in which all teams compete with identical robots. The robots operate fully autonomously, with no external control by humans nor computers. The specific AIBO version changed over time: ERS-110s (1999,2000), ERS-210 (2001-2002), ERS-210A SuperCore (2003), ERS-7 (2004-2008). The replacement and current standard platform is the humanoid [[Nao (robot)|NAO]] by Aldebaran Robotics.

Sony provided AIBOs' support and sponsorship to universities around the world to participate in the [[RoboCup]] autonomous [[soccer]] [[:Category: Robotics competitions|competition]]  Four-Legged Robot Soccer League. Competing teams would [[Computer program|program]] a team of AIBO robots to play games of autonomous robot soccer against other competing teams. The Four-Legged League ran from 1999 to 2008, although in the final year, many big-name universities did not compete as they had moved to the new [[Nao (robot)|NAO]] platform. The University of New South Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robocup/2010site/ |title=rUNSWift 2010 |publisher=Cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the most successful team in the League, making the final six times and winning three times.

==International AIBO Convention==
The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads and &quot;AIBO Shows&quot;.

==Sedimentation rates==
The rate at which sediment is deposited differs depending on the location. A channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in one day, while on the deep ocean floor each year only a few millimetres of sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal sedimentation and sedimentation caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like [[Mass wasting|mass movements]], [[rock slide]]s or [[flood]]ing. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of a large amount of sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though the environment is usually a quiet place. Other sedimentary environments are dominated by normal, ongoing sedimentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reading17&quot;&gt;[[#Reading|Reading (1996)]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, sedimentation occurs slowly. In a [[desert]], for example, the wind deposits siliciclastic material (sand or silt) in some spots, or catastrophic flooding of a [[wadi]] may cause sudden deposits of large quantities of detrital material, but in most places eolian erosion dominates. The amount of sedimentary rock that forms is not only dependent on the amount of supplied material, but also on how well the material consolidates. Erosion removes most deposited sediment shortly after deposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reading17&quot;/&gt;

==Stratigraphy==
{{see main|Stratigraphy}}
That new rock layers are above older rock layers is stated in the [[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]]. There are usually some gaps in the sequence called [[unconformity|unconformities]]. These represent periods where no new sediments were laid down, or when earlier sedimentary layers were raised above sea level and eroded away.

Sedimentary rocks contain important information about the [[history of the Earth]]. They contain [[fossil]]s, the preserved remains of ancient [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Coal is considered a type of sedimentary rock. The composition of sediments provides us with clues as to the original rock. Differences between successive layers indicate changes to the environment over time. Sedimentary rocks can contain fossils because, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, they form at temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remains.

== Provenance ==

[[File:Distribution of detritus.png|thumbnail|left|Distribution of detritus]]

{{main|Provenance (geology)}}

[[Provenance (geology)|Provenance]] is the reconstruction of the origin of sediments. All rock exposed at the Earth's surface is subjected to physical or chemical [[weathering]] and broken down into finer grained sediment. All three types of rocks ([[igneous rock|igneous]], sedimentary and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks) can be the source of sedimentary detritus.  The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and interpret the history of sediment from the initial parent rocks at a source area to final detritus at a burial place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weltje &amp; von Eynatten 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weltje, G.J. and von Eynatten, H.|title=Quantitative provenance analysis of sediments: review and outlook|journal=Sedimentary Geology |date=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2004.05.007 |volume=171 |issue=1–4|pages=1–11 |bibcode=2004SedG..171....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''senate''' is a [[deliberative assembly]], often the [[upper house]] or [[Debating chamber|chamber]] of a [[bicameral]] [[legislature]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Rome|ancient]] [[Roman Senate]] (Latin: ''Senatus''), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: ''senex'' meaning &quot;the elder&quot; or &quot;old man&quot;) and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the [[society]] or [[ruling class]].

Many countries have an assembly named a ''senate'', composed of ''senators'' who may be [[election|elected]], appointed, have [[inheritance|inherited]] the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of &quot;sober second thought&quot; to consider [[legislation]] passed by a [[lower house]], whose members are usually elected. Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Bicameral Legislatures: An international Comparison. Betty Drexhage. The Hague. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
&lt;!---DO NOT insert prequel memes here. Not only is such a thing frowned upon here (see Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not), it's neither a funny joke nor a clever one. You have been warned.---&gt;
The modern word ''Senate'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''senātus'' (senate), which comes from ''senex'', 'old man'.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged Based on the Random House Dictionary: ''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/senate senate]''&lt;/ref&gt; The members or legislators of a senate are called '''senators'''.  The Latin word ''senator'' was adopted into English with no change in spelling.  Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of social organization, in which advisory or decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men.  For the same reason, the word ''senate'' is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate.  This form adaptation was used to show the power of those in body and for the decision-making process to be thorough, which could take a long period of time. The original senate was the [[Roman Senate]], which lasted until at least AD 603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1047|author=Levillain, Philippe|title=The Papacy: Gaius-Proxies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VDcmDeLuV4C&amp;pg=PA1047|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-92230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome. In the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Senate]] continued until the [[Fourth Crusade]], circa 1202–1204.

Modern democratic states with [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliamentary system]]s are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel [[lower house]], known variously as the &quot;[[House of Representatives]]&quot;, &quot;[[House of Commons]]&quot;, &quot;[[Chamber of Deputies]]&quot;, &quot;[[National Assembly]]&quot;, &quot;[[Legislative Assembly]]&quot;, or &quot;[[House of Assembly]]&quot;, by electoral rules.  This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or [[Majoritarianism|majoritarian]] or [[Plurality voting system|plurality system]], and an electoral basis or ''collegium''.  Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house.  In some [[federal state]]s senates also exist at the subnational level. In the [[United States]], every state has a senate, with the exception of [[Nebraska]] (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the &quot;Legislature&quot; but whose members refer to themselves as &quot;senators&quot;). There is also the [[US Senate]] at the federal level. Similarly in [[Argentina]], in addition to the [[Senate of Argentina|Senate]] at federal level, eight of the country's [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Corrientes]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] (since 1987) and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], have bicameral legislatures with a Senate. [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] changed to [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.

In [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], only the upper house of the federal parliament is known as the Senate. All [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] other than [[Queensland]] have an upper house known as a [[Legislative council]]. Several Canadian provinces also once had a Legislative Council, but these have all been abolished, the last being [[Quebec]]'s [[Legislative Council of Quebec|Legislative council]] in 1968.

In [[Germany]], the last Senate of a [[States of Germany|State]] parliament, the [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]] of [[Bavaria]], was abolished in 1999.

Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.  For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the [[Senate of the Philippines]], the term of a senator being six years.  In contrast, members of the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] upon the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.

The terms ''senate'' and ''senator'', however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:
* The [[Senate of Finland]] was, until 1918, the executive branch and the supreme court.
* The [[Senate of Latvia]] ([[:lv:Latvijas Senāts|lv]]) fulfilled a similar judicial function during the interbellum (1918-1940).
* In German politics:

In the ''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'' (Federated States) of Germany which form a [[City State]] (in German: ''Stadtstaat''), i.e. [[Berlin]] ([[Senate of Berlin]]), [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] ([[Senate of Bremen]]) and [[Hamburg]] ([[Senate of Hamburg]]), the senates (''[[:wikt:Senat|Senat]]'' in [[German language|German]]) are the executive branch, with senators (''Senator'') being the holders of ministerial portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Senate of Berlin]], [[Senate of Bremen]] and [[Senate of Hamburg]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of cities which were former members of the ''[[Hanse]]'' (a medieval confederacy of port cities mainly at the shores of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea), such as [[Greifswald]], [[Lübeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Stralsund]], or [[Wismar]], the city government is also called a Senate.

However, in [[Bavaria]], the Senate was a second legislative chamber until its abolition in 1999.

* In German jurisdiction:

The term Senat (senate) in higher [[court of appeal|courts of appeal]] refers to the &quot;[[Bench (metonymy)|bench]]&quot; in its broader [[metonymy]] meaning, describing members of the [[judiciary]] collectively (usually five [[judge]]s), often occupied with a particular [[subject-matter jurisdiction]]. However, the judges are not called &quot;senators&quot;. The German term ''Strafsenat'' (literally &quot;Penal Senate&quot;) in a German court translates to ''Bench of [[Criminal jurisdiction|penal-law jurisdiction]]'' and ''Zivilsenat'' (literally &quot;Civil Senate&quot;) to ''Bench of [[Private law|private-law jurisdiction]]''. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] consists of two senates of eight judges each. In its case the division is mostly of an organizational nature, as a matter of dividing the work load; both senates handle the same kind of constitutional cases. At some points in the past, one senate was considered more conservative and the other more liberal, but that is not the case as of 2011.
* In [[Scotland]], judges of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] are called [[Senators of the College of Justice]].
* In some, mostly federal countries with a unicameral legislature, some of the legislators are elected differently from the others and are called senators. In federal countries, such senators represent the territories, while the other members represent the people at large (this device is used to allow a federal representation without having to establish a bicameral legislature); this is the case with [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Comoros]] and [[Micronesia]]. In other, non-federal countries, the use of the term ''senator'' marks some other difference between such members and the rest of the legislators (such as the method of selection); this is the case with the [[States of Jersey]], [[Dominica]]'s [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] and the [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] [[House of Assembly of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|House of Assembly]].
* In [[Wales]], the [[Welsh Parliament]] debating chamber is called the [[Senedd building|Senedd]], pronounced 'Seneth', there being no other word in the Welsh language for &quot;Parliament&quot; 
* An [[academic senate]] is the governing body of some universities.
* In [[Greece]] during the early stages of the [[Greek War of Independence]], various local legislative and executive bodies were established by the Greek rebels. Two of them were styled &quot;senate&quot;: the [[Peloponnesian Senate]] and the [[Senate of Western Continental Greece]].

{{One source|date=December 2019|text=This article '''reports largely the perspective of a single [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|source]]'''.}}

A '''deliberative assembly''' is a gathering of members (of any kind of [[collective]]) who use [[parliamentary procedure]] to [[Decision-making|make decisions]].

==Etymology==
In a speech to the electorate at Bristol in 1774, [[Edmund Burke]] described the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] as a &quot;deliberative assembly,&quot; and the expression became the basic term for a body of persons meeting to discuss and determine common action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Burke|1854|p = 447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' describes the following characteristics of a deliberative assembly:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A group of people meets to discuss and make decisions on behalf of the entire membership.
* They meet in a single room or area or under equivalent conditions of simultaneous oral communication.
* Each member is free to act according to their own judgement.
* Each member has an equal vote.
* The members at the meeting act for the entire group, even if there are members absent.

==Rights of members==
A member of a deliberative assembly has the right to attend meetings, and make motions, speak in debate, and vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations may have different classes of members (such as regular members, active members, associate members, and honorary members), but the rights of each class of membership must be defined (such as whether a &quot;member&quot; in a class has the right to vote).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 571-572}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be ex-officio members, or persons who are members by virtue of some other office or position they hold.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-04|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-officio members have the same rights as other members.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Types==
''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' identifies several types of deliberative assemblies.

===Mass meeting===
{{Main|Mass meeting}}
A ''mass meeting'', which is an unorganized group meeting open to all individuals in a sector of the population who are interested in deliberating about a subject proposed by the meeting's sponsors. Examples include meetings to discuss common political concerns or community interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local assembly of an organized society===
{{Main article|Voluntary association}}
A ''local assembly of an organized society'', which is a membership meeting of a local chapter or branch of a [[membership organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include local chapter meetings of organizations like the [[Sierra Club]].

===Convention===
{{Main article|Convention (meeting)}}
A ''convention'', which is a meeting of delegates who represent constituent units of a population. Conventions are not permanently established bodies, and delegates are normally elected for only one term. A convention may be held by an organized society, where each local assembly is represented by a delegate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative body===
{{Main|Legislature}}
A ''legislative body'', which is a legally established public lawmaking body. It consists of representatives chosen by the electorate. Examples include national legislatures such as [[parliament]]s, and local government councils such as [[state legislature]]s, [[Regional assemblies (disambiguation)|regional assemblies]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; and [[city council]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board===
{{Main|Board of directors}}
A ''board'', which is an administrative, managerial, or quasi-judicial body. A board derives its power from an outside authority that defines the scope of its operations. Examples include an organized society's or company's board of directors and government agency boards like a [[board of education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committees==
{{Main article|Committee}}A ''committee'' is a body of one or more persons subordinate to a deliberative assembly. A committee is not itself considered to be a form of assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

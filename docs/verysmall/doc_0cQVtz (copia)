Chávez's response was to moderate his approach,{{Disputed inline|date=April 2020}} implementing a new economic team that appeared to be more centrist and reinstated the old board of directors and managers of the state oil company [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]] (PDVSA), whose replacement had been one of the reasons for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugo Chávez#Mar07|Marcano and Tyszka 2007]]. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugo Chávez#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Bolivarian government began to increase the country's military capacity, purchasing 100,000 [[AK-47]] assault rifles and several helicopters from Russia, as well as a number of [[Super Tucano]] light attack and training planes from Brazil. Troop numbers were also increased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugo Chávez#Koz08|Kozloff 2008]]. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 constitution had introduced the concept of a recall referendum into Venezuelan politics, so the opposition called for such a referendum to take place. A [[2004 Venezuelan recall referendum|2004 referendum to recall Chávez]] was defeated. 70% of the eligible Venezuelan population turned out to vote, with 59% of voters deciding to keep the president in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramírez 2005. p. 79&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64&quot;&gt;[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his original 1998 election victory, this time Chávez's electoral support came almost entirely from the poorer working classes rather than the middle classes, who &quot;had practically abandoned Chávez&quot; after he &quot;had consistently moved towards the left in those five and a half years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Socialism of the 21st century&quot;====
The various attempts at overthrowing the Bolivarian government from power had only served to further radicalize Chávez.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In January 2005, he began openly proclaiming the ideology of &quot;[[socialism of the 21st century]]&quot;, something that was distinct from his earlier forms of [[Bolivarianism]], which had been [[Social democracy|social democratic]] in nature, merging elements of capitalism and socialism. He used this new term to contrast the [[democratic socialism]], which he wanted to promote in Latin America, from the Marxist–Leninist socialism that had been spread by socialist states like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the 20th century, arguing that the latter had not been truly democratic, suffering from a lack of participatory democracy and an excessively authoritarian governmental structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 58&quot;/&gt;

In May 2006, Chávez visited Europe in a private capacity, where he announced plans to supply cheap Venezuelan oil to poor working class communities in the continent. The Mayor of London [[Ken Livingstone]] welcomed him, describing him as &quot;the best news out of Latin America in many years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obs06|''The Observer'' 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2006, Chávez publicly announced that those leftist political parties who had continually supported him in the Patriotic Pole would unite into one single, much larger party, the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (''Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela'', PSUV).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 59&quot;/&gt; In the speech which he gave announcing the PSUV's creation, Chávez declared that the old parties must &quot;forget their own structures, party colours and slogans, because they are not the most important thing for the fatherland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 59&quot;/&gt; According to political analyst Barry Cannon, the purpose of creating the PSUV was to &quot;forge unity amongst the disparate elements [of the Bolivarian movement], providing grassroots input into policy and leadership formation, [and] uniting the grassroots and leadership into one single body&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 60&quot;&gt;[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped that by doing so, it would decrease the problems of clientelism and corruption and also leave the movement less dependent on its leadership:&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 60&quot;/&gt; as Chávez himself declared, &quot;In this new party, the bases will elect the leaders.

In 2007, the Bolivarian government set up a constitutional commission in order to review the 1999 constitution and suggest potential amendments to be made to it. Led by the prominent pro-Chávez intellectual [[Luis Britto García]], the commission came to the conclusion that the constitution could include more socially progressive clauses, such as the shortening of the working week, a constitutional recognition of [[Afro Venezuelans]] and the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64&quot; /&gt; It also suggested measures that would have increased many of the president's powers, for instance increasing the presidential term limit to seven years, allowing the president to run for election indefinitely and centralizing powers in the executive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64&quot; /&gt; The government put the suggested changes to a [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum|public referendum in December 2007]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters20070816&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1526395420070816|title=Venezuela's Chávez calls for end to term limits|accessdate=16 August 2007|work=Reuters|date=16 August 2007|last=Ellsworth |first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstention rate was high however, with 44% of registered voters not turning out, and in the end the proposed changes were rejected by 51% of votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/world/americas/04venezuela.html |title= Venezuela Vote Sets Roadblocks on Chávez Path |work= The New York Times|date = 4 December 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2010 |last=Romero |first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would prove to the first electoral loss that Chávez had faced in the thirteen electoral contests held since he took power,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64&quot; /&gt; something analysts argued was due to the top-down nature of the changes, as well as general public dissatisfaction with &quot;the absence of internal debate on its content, as well as dissatisfaction with the running of the social programmes, increasing street crime, and with corruption within the government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon2009 64-65&quot;&gt;[[#Can09|Cannon 2009]]. pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth presidential term: 10 January 2013 – 5 March 2013===
On 7 October 2012, Chávez won election as president for a fourth time, his third six-year term. He defeated [[Henrique Capriles]] with 54% of the votes versus 45% for Capriles, which was a lower victory margin than in his previous presidential wins, in the [[2012 Venezuelan presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APFox2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/07/venezuelan-president-hugo-chavez-wins-another-6-year-term-electoral-council/|title=Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez wins another 6-year term, electoral council says|date=8 October 2012|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnout in the election was 80%, with a hotly contested election between the two candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/americas/venezuela-presidential-election.html?hp |title= Chávez Wins a Third Term in Venezuela Amid Historically High Turnout |publisher= NYT |date= 7 October 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012 |first=William |last=Neuman}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was significant support for Chávez amongst the Venezuelan lower class.

[[File:Hugo Chávez 2012.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Chávez in June 2012]]

The inauguration of Chávez's new term was scheduled for 10 January 2013, but as he was undergoing medical treatment at the time in Cuba, he was not able to return to Venezuela for that date. The National Assembly president [[Diosdado Cabello]] proposed to postpone the inauguration and the Supreme Court decided that, being just another term of the sitting president and not the inauguration of a new one, the formality could be bypassed. The [[Roman Catholicism in Venezuela|Venezuelan Bishops Conference]] opposed the verdict, stating that the constitution must be respected and the Venezuelan government had not been transparent regarding details about Chávez's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Church warns Venezuela govt on constitution |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |newspaper=France 24 |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082713/http://www.france24.com/en/20130107-church-warns-venezuela-govt-constitution |archivedate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting executive officials produced orders of government signed by Chávez, which were suspected of forgery by some opposition politicians, who claimed that Chávez was too sick to be in control of his faculties.

Due to the [[Death and state funeral of Hugo Chávez|death of Chávez]], Vice President [[Nicolás Maduro]] took over the presidential powers and duties for the remainder of Chávez's abbreviated term until presidential elections were held.

==Political ideology==
[[File:Portrait of Simón Bolívar by Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|upright|19th century general and politician [[Simón Bolívar]] provided a basis for Chávez's political ideas]]
{{Quote box
| width = 246px
| align = right
| quote = Democracy is impossible in a capitalist system. Capitalism is the realm of injustice and a tyranny of the richest against the poorest. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] said, 'Between the powerful and the weak all freedom is oppressed. Only the rule of law sets you free.' That's why the only way to save the world is through socialism, a democratic socialism... [Democracy is not just turning up to vote every four or five years], it's much more than that, it's a way of life, it's giving power to the people... it is not the government of the rich over the people, which is what's happening in almost all the so-called democratic Western capitalist countries.

Chávez propagated what he called &quot;socialism for the 21st century&quot;, but according to the pro-Chavez academic [[Gregory Wilpert]], &quot;Chávez has not clearly defined twenty-first century socialism, other than to say that it is about establishing [[liberty]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[social justice]], and [[solidarity]]. He has also indicated that it is distinctly different from [[state socialism]]&quot;, as implemented by the governments of the [[Soviet Union]] and the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of his socialist ideas, he emphasised the role of &quot;[[participatory democracy]]&quot;, which he said increased democratic participation, and was implemented through the foundation of the [[Venezuelan Communal Councils]] and [[Bolivarian Circles]] which he cited as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sojo, Cleto A. (Venezuelanalysis.com, 31 January 2005). [http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news.php?newsno=1486 &quot;Venezuela's Chávez Closes World Social Forum with Call to Transcend Capitalism&quot;]. Retrieved 20 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivarianism===
{{Main|Bolivarianism|Bolivarian Circles}}
Hugo Chávez defined his political position as [[Bolivarianism]], an ideology he developed from that of [[Simón Bolívar]] (1783–1830) and others. Bolívar was a 19th-century general who led the fight against the [[colonialism|colonialist]] Spanish authorities and who is widely revered across Latin America today. Along with Bolívar, the other two primary influences upon Bolivarianism are [[Simón Rodríguez]] (1769–1854), a philosopher who was Bolívar's tutor and mentor, and [[Ezequiel Zamora]], (1817–1860), the Venezuelan Federalist general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Maxwell|year=2001|title=Venezuela's Hugo Chávez: Savior or Threat to Democracy?|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=36|issue=3|page=263}}. Online at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130219083230/http://www.injerencia.org/documentos/Venezuela/Articulos_Ingles/Chavez_Savior%20or%20Threat.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Political analyst and Chávez supporter Gregory Wilpert, in his study of Chávez's politics, noted that &quot;The key ingredients for Chávez's revolutionary Bolivarianism can be summarized as: an emphasis on the importance of education, the creation of civilian-military unity, Latin American integration, social justice, and national sovereignty. In many ways this is not a particularly different set of principles and ideas to those of any other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] or national liberation thinker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil07|Wilpert 2007]] p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Chávez's ideology originated from Bolívar has also received some criticism because Chávez had occasionally described himself as being influenced by [[Karl Marx]], a critic of Bolívar.&lt;ref name=&quot;marx&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Marxism===
Chávez's connection to [[Marxism]] was a complex one, though he had described himself as a Marxist on some occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.ria.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20100116/157569985.html|title=Hugo Chavez admits to being Marxist, just like Christ &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; RIA Novosti|date=16 January 2010|publisher=En.ria.ru|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCmarx/&gt;&lt;ref name=N24marx/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCmarx/&gt;&lt;ref name=CLARINmarx/&gt; In May 1996, he gave an interview with Agustín Blanco Muñoz in which he remarked, &quot;I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist. I am not communist, but I am not anti-communist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Jon07|Jones 2007]]. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 speech to the national assembly, he said: &quot;I am a Marxist to the same degree as the followers of the ideas of Jesus Christ and the liberator of America, Simon Bolivar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;en.ria.ru&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|BSwUO-4oXjY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well versed in many Marxist texts, having read the works of many Marxist theoreticians, and often publicly quoted them. Various international Marxists supported his government, believing it to be a sign of proletariat revolution as predicted in [[Marxist theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [[#Woo06|Woods 2006]] and [[#Ali06|Ali 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Hugo Chávez proclaimed support for the [[Trotskyism|ideas]] of Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], saying &quot;When I called him (former Minister of Labour, [[José Ramón Rivero]])&quot; Chávez explained, &quot;he said to me: 'President I want to tell you something before someone else tells you ... I am a Trotskyist', and I said, 'well, what is the problem? I am also a Trotskyist! I follow Trotsky's line, that of permanent revolution&quot;, and then cited [[Marx]] and [[Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6246219.stm | title=Chávez accelerates on path to socialism | date=10 January 2007 |work=BBC News | first=Nathalie | last=Malinarich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jorge |last=Martin |date=12 January 2007 |title=&quot;What is the problem?

===Other influences===
Chávez's early heroes were nationalist military dictators that included former Peruvian president [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2007. p. 40-47&quot;/&gt; and former Panamanian &quot;Maximum Leader&quot; [[Omar Torrijos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 2007. p. 52-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECONmarch2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela after Chávez Now for the reckoning|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21573095-after-14-years-oil-fuelled-autocracy-hugo-chávezs-successors-will-struggle-keep|accessdate=23 December 2014|agency=The Economist|date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One dictator Chávez admired was [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], a former president of Venezuela that he praised for the public works he performed.&lt;ref name=Carroll193/&gt; Chávez praised Pérez Jiménez in order to vilify preceding democratic governments, stating that &quot;General Pérez Jiménez was the best president Venezuela had in a long time ...

After his election in 1998, more than 100,000 state-owned cooperatives—which claimed to represent some 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people—were formed with the assistance of government start-up credit and technical training;&lt;ref name=&quot;vene-coop-rev&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Betsy |last2=Stone |first2=Bob |title=Venezuela's Cooperative Revolution |journal=Dollars and Sense |volume=15 |issue=266 |date=July–August 2006 |url=http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2006/0706bowmanstone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation and maintenance, as of September 2010, of over [[Venezuelan communal councils|30,000 communal councils]], examples of localised participatory democracy; which he intended to be integrated into regional umbrella organizations known as ''&quot;Communes in Construction&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;venezuelanalysis.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=Edward |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5629 |title=Venezuelan President Visits Communes and Workers, Criticizes Bureaucracy |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Chávez supported the construction of 184 [[communes]], housing thousands of families, with $23&amp;nbsp;million in government funding. The communes produced some of their own food, and were able to make decisions by popular assembly of what to do with government funds.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Tamara [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5123 184 Communes Currently in Formation in Venezuela], ''Venezuela Analysis''&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Chávez announced the location of 876&amp;nbsp;million bolivars ($203&amp;nbsp;million) for community projects around the country, specifically communal councils and the newly formed communes. Chávez also criticised the bureaucracy still common in Venezuela saying, when in discussion with his Communes Minister Isis Ochoa, that &quot;All of the projects must be carried out by the commune, not the bureaucracy.&quot; The Ministry for Communes, which oversees and funds all communal projects, was initiated in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;venezuelanalysis.com&quot;/&gt;

Despite such promises, the Venezuelan government often failed to construct the number of homes they had proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUhome&quot;&gt;[http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/07/31/en_eco_art_31A756381.shtml Chávez' Government has built 24 percent of scheduled houses.] ''El Universal'' (31 July 2006). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411130530/http://english.eluniversal.com/2006/07/31/en_eco_art_31A756381.shtml |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Misión Vivienda incumplió 70% de su objetivo de 2014 |url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/12/30/mision-vivienda-incumplio-70-de-su-objetivo-de-2014/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 |agency=La Patilla |date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Venezuela's ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', one of the Chávez administration's outstanding weaknesses is the failure to meet its goals of construction of housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUhome&quot; /&gt;

In the first few years of Chavez's office, his newly created social programs required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On 5 February 2003, the government created [[CADIVI]], a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control [[capital flight]] by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.&lt;ref&gt;CADIVI, [http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html CADIVI, una medidia necesaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143924/http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html |date=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency [[black market]] economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanke |first=Steve |title=The World's Troubled Currencies |url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article41552.html |publisher=The Market Oracle |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Chávez's presidency, there were reports of prisoners having easy access to firearms, drugs, and alcohol. Carlos Nieto—head of Window to Freedom—alleges that heads of gangs acquire military weapons from the state, saying: &quot;They have the types of weapons that can only be obtained by the country's armed forces. ... No one else has these.&quot; Use of internet and mobile phones are also a commonplace where criminals can take part in street crime while in prison.

Given the protests and strikes, some of which were quite big, like in 10 December 2001, then the largest in the history of Venezuela,&lt;ref name=&quot;p4041NELSON&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Brian A. |title=The silence and the scorpion: the coup against Chávez and the making of modern Venezuela |url=https://archive.org/details/silencescorpionc00nels |url-access=limited |date=2009 |publisher=Nation Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1568584188 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/silencescorpionc00nels/page/n56 40]–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; some confidential cables published on [[WikiLeaks]] tried to explain the discrepancy between Chávez's relatively low popularity and his overwhelming electoral victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;whywon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2671_a.html|title=Venezuela: Why Chavez &quot;won&quot;|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the cables, Hugo Chávez used &quot;practically unlimited state resources&quot; for propaganda activities, and high oil prices facilitated his success. The opposition, on the contrary, was divided into different parties, which ran for the same office, and the limited financial resources were badly invested. During his re-election campaigns, Chávez, through food, health, and literacy programs for the poor, handed money to prospective voters.&lt;ref name=whywon /&gt; He reportedly mobilized the lower class Venezuelan voters who had historically abstained from elections for years,&lt;ref name=whywon/&gt; providing both undocumented Venezuelans and foreigners with identity cards; 200,000 foreigners were naturalized before August 2004 and around 3,000–4,000 foreigners per year that might have been naturalized thereafter. Most of them purportedly voted for him.&lt;ref name=whywon /&gt;

According to the same cable, Chávez had control over the CNE (National Electoral Council) &quot;and, by extension, the international observer missions&quot;.&lt;ref name=whywon/&gt; Moreover, &quot;The CNE's decision to use fingerprinting machines 'cazahuellas' to verify a voter's identity led to the widespread belief that a person's vote would not be secret&quot;.&lt;ref name=whywon /&gt;

Finally, Chávez allegedly used the judiciary in order to detain or intimidate opposition politicians or NGOs accused of receiving money from the [[United States]] (through the National Endowment for Democracy – NED) purportedly in order to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name=sumatedirec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06CARACAS339_a.html|title=Sumate Directors Harassed, Facing Possible Detention|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=genpetroleo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2033_a.html|title=The Next Round of Arrests?|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same source, the received money amounts to $30,000.&lt;ref name=sumatedirec /&gt; He reportedly also put pressure in the attorney general's office in order to replace three key employees and have any case that might damage the government or Chávez himself undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS620_a.html|title=Advancing the Revlution: Bringing the Attorney General's Office T Heel|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/04CARACAS2702_a.html|title=Venezuelan Mayor Carpriles (still) Held for Trial|accessdate=3 August 2017|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

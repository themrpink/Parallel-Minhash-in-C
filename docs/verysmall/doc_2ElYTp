After praising Dreiser as &quot;pioneering,&quot; that he &quot;more than any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and boldness and passion of life&quot; in his Nobel Lecture in December 1930,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; in March 1931 Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing a book by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife, which led to a well-publicized fight, wherein Dreiser repeatedly slapped Lewis. Thompson initially made the accusation in 1928 regarding her work &quot;The New Russia&quot; and Dreiser's &quot;Dreiser Goes to Russia&quot;, though the ''New York Times'' also linked the dispute to competition between Dreiser and Lewis over the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/03/21/98325372.html?smid=tw-nytbooks&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;pageNumber=11|title=Lewis Is Slapped by Dreiser in Club; Principals in 'He Who Gets Slapped'|date=March 21, 1931|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 21, 2018|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/literaryfeudscen00arth/page/66|title=Literary feuds : a century of celebrated quarrels from Mark Twain to Tom Wolfe|last=Arthur|first=Anthony|date=2002|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312272098|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/literaryfeudscen00arth/page/66 66–72]|oclc=49698991|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreiser fired back that Sinclair's 1928 novel ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'' (adapted later that year as a [[Arrowsmith (film)|feature film]]) was unoriginal and that Dreiser himself was first approached to write it, which was disputed by the wife of ''Arrowsmith''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s subject, microbiologist Dr. [[Paul de Kruif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/03/25/archives/lewis-calls-witness-to-challenge-dreiser-gets-mrs-de-kruifs-denial.html|title=Lewis Calls Witness to Challenge Dreiser; Gets Mrs. de Kruif's Denial That Rival Author Was Asked First to Write 'Arrowsmith'.|date=March 25, 1931|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The feud carried on for some months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/07/23/archives/boast-of-publicity-defied-by-dreiser-novelist-rebuked-by-court-as.html|title=Boast of Publicity Defied by Dreiser; Novelist Rebuked by Court as He Passes Lie in Connection With Slapping of Lewis|date=July 23, 1931|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, however, Lewis campaigned to have Dreiser recognized by the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

After an alcoholic binge in 1937, Lewis checked in for treatment to the [[Austen Riggs Center]], a psychiatric hospital in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].  His doctors gave him a blunt assessment that he needed to decide &quot;whether he was going to live without alcohol or die by it, one or the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lingeman, 420-422&quot;&gt;Lingeman, 420–422&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewis checked out after ten days, lacking any &quot;fundamental understanding of his problem,&quot; as one of his physicians wrote to a colleague.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lingeman, 420-422&quot;/&gt;

In the autumn of 1940, Lewis visited his old acquaintance, [[William Ellery Leonard]], in Madison, Wisconsin. Leonard arranged a meeting with the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a tour of the campus. Lewis immediately became enthralled with the university and the city and offered to remain and teach a course in creative writing in the upcoming semester. For a month he was quite enamored of his professorial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reflections.mndigital.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15160coll1/id/1399/rec/8|title=Letter from Sinclair Lewis to Marcella Powers, October 7, 1940 :: St. Cloud State University – Sinclair Lewis Letters to Marcella Powers|website=reflections.mndigital.org|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly, on November 7, after giving only five classes to his select group of 24 students, he announced that he had taught them all that he knew.

In the 1940s, Lewis and rabbi-turned-popular author [[Lewis Browne]] frequently appeared on the lecture platform together,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, John (October 7, 1943) &quot;Books of the Times&quot;. Review of ''See What I Mean?'' by Lewis Browne. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; touring the United States and debating before audiences of as many as 3,000 people, addressing such questions as &quot;Has the Modern Woman Made Good?&quot;, &quot;The Country Versus the City&quot;, &quot;Is the Machine Age Wrecking Civilization?&quot;, and &quot;Can Fascism Happen Here?&quot;. The pair were described as &quot;the [[Gallagher and Shean]] of the lecture circuit&quot; by Lewis biographer Richard Lingeman.&lt;ref&gt;Lingeman, 455&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s, Lewis lived in Duluth, Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;duluthbudgeteer.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duluthbudgeteer.com/content/column-while-living-duluth-mansion-famous-author-penned-book-about-race |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701122157/http://www.duluthbudgeteer.com/content/column-while-living-duluth-mansion-famous-author-penned-book-about-race |archive-date=July 1, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote the novel ''Kingsblood Royal'' (1947), set in the fictional city of Grand Republic, Minnesota, an enlarged and updated version of Zenith.&lt;ref name=&quot;duluthbudgeteer.com&quot;/&gt; It is based on the [[Ossian Sweet|Sweet Trials]] in [[Detroit]] in which an [[African-American]] doctor was denied the chance to purchase a house in a &quot;white&quot; section of the city. ''Kingsblood Royal'' was a powerful and very early contribution to the [[civil rights movement]].

In 1943, Lewis went to Hollywood to work on a script with [[Dore Schary]], who had just resigned as executive head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's low-budget film department to concentrate on writing and producing his own films. The resulting screenplay was ''Storm In the West'', &quot;a traditional American western&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Storm In the West|last = Lewis|first = Sinclair|publisher = Stein and Day|year = 1963|location = New York|last2 = Schary|first2 = Dore}}&lt;/ref&gt; — except for the fact that it was also an allegory of World War II, with primary villain Hygatt (Hitler) and his henchmen Gribbles (Goebbels) and Gerrett (Goering) plotting to take over the Franson Ranch, the Poling Ranch, and so on. The screenplay was deemed too political by MGM studio executives and was shelved, and the film was never made. ''Storm In the West'' was finally published in 1963, with a foreword by Schary detailing the work's origins, the authors' creative process, and the screenplay's ultimate fate.

Sinclair Lewis had been a frequent visitor to Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 1946, he rented Thorvale Farm on Oblong Road. While working on his novel ''Kingsblood Royal'', he purchased this summer estate and upgraded the Georgian mansion along with a farmhouse and many outbuildings. By 1948, Lewis had created a gentleman's farm consisting of 720 acres of agricultural and forest land. His intended residence in Williamstown was short-lived because of his medical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Before Carmel Came to the Berkshires|last = Gagnon, Order of the Carmelites|first = Pius M.|location = Courtesy of the Williamstown Historical Museum, 1095 Main Street, Williamstown, MA 01267.|pages = 19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Lewis died in Rome from advanced alcoholism on January 10, 1951, aged 65. His body was cremated and his remains were buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. His final novel ''[[World So Wide]]'' (1951) was published posthumously.

[[William Shirer]], a friend and admirer of Lewis, disputes accounts that Lewis died of alcoholism. He reported that Lewis had a heart attack and that his doctors advised him to stop drinking if he wanted to live. Lewis did not stop, and perhaps could not; he died when his heart stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1904&quot;&gt;William L. Shirer, ''20th Century Journey: A Memoir of a Life and the Times'' vol. 1: ''The Start: 1904–1930'' (NY: Bantam Books, 1980) 458-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In summarizing Lewis's career, Shirer concludes:&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1904&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|It has become rather commonplace for so-called literary critics to write off Sinclair Lewis as a novelist. Compared to...[[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], [[John Dos Passos|Dos Passos]], and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]...Lewis lacked style. Yet his impact on modern American life...was greater than all of the other four writers together.}}

===Legacy===
Compared to his contemporaries, Lewis' reputation suffered a precipitous decline among literary scholars throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/02/sheer-data/302419/|title=Sheer Data|first=Benjamin|last=Schwarz|date=February 1, 2002|website=The Atlantic|access-date=July 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his enormous popularity during the 1920s, by the 21st century most of his works had been eclipsed in prominence by other writers with less commercial success during the same time period, such as [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-mar-31-bk-taylor31-story.html|title=Our Damaged Nobel Laureate|date=March 31, 2002|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2010s there has been renewed interest in Lewis' work, in particular his 1935 dystopian satire ''It Can't Happen Here''. In the aftermath of the [[2016 United States Presidential Election]], ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' surged to the top of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s list of best-selling books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/28/media/it-cant-happen-here-1984-best-sellers/index.html|title=Amazon's best-seller list takes a dystopian turn in Trump era|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=January 28, 2017|website=CNNMoney|access-date=July 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been honored by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] with a [[postage stamp]] in the [[Great Americans series]].

'''Piracy''' is an act of [[robbery]] or [[crime|criminal]] [[violence]] by [[ship]] or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called '''pirates''', while dedicated ships that are used by them are called '''pirate ships'''. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the [[Sea Peoples]], a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Pennell|first1= C.

Historic examples include the waters of [[Gibraltar]], the [[Piracy in the Strait of Malacca|Strait of Malacca]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Gulf of Aden]], and the [[English Channel]], whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Heebøll-Holm|first1= Thomas|author-link1= Thomas Heebøll-Holm|title= Ports, Piracy and Maritime War: Piracy in the English Channel and the Atlantic, c. 1280–c. 1330|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jw7OWyAN--QC|series= Medieval Law and Its Practice|location= Leiden|publisher= Brill|date= 2013|page= 67|isbn= 978-9004248168|quote= [...] through their extensive piracies the Portsmen [of the Cinque Ports] were experts in predatory actions at sea.

While the term can include acts committed in the [[Air hijacking|air]], on land (especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a [[Carjacking|car]] or [[Train robbery|train]]), or in other major bodies of water or on a [[shore]], in [[cyberspace]], as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy, it generally refers to maritime piracy. It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under [[customary international law]] and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. [[Piracy in the 21st century|In the early 21st century]], seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16&amp;nbsp;billion per year in 2004),&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20041101faessay83606/gal-luft-anne-korin/terrorism-goes-to-sea.html |journal=Foreign Affairs | title=Terrorism Goes to Sea |access-date=December 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214040613/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20041101faessay83606/gal-luft-anne-korin/terrorism-goes-to-sea.html |archive-date=December 14, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the waters between the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]], off the [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali coast]], and also in the [[Strait of Malacca]] and [[Singapore]].

Today, pirates armed with automatic weapons, such as [[assault rifle]]s, and [[machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s and [[rocket propelled grenade]]s use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships. They also use larger vessels, known as &quot;mother ships&quot;, to supply the smaller motorboats. The [[international community]] is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to [[justice]], as these attacks often occur in [[international waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=M.Chiarugi |last=D.Archibugi |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/piracy-challenges-global-governance |title=Piracy challenges global governance |date=April 9, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2009 |publisher=[[openDemocracy]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412063756/http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/piracy-challenges-global-governance |archive-date=April 12, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations have used their naval forces to protect private ships from pirate attacks and to pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure [[water cannon]]s, or [[sound cannon]]s to repel boarders, and use [[radar]] to avoid potential threats.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;pirate&quot; is derived from the [[Latin]] ''pirata'' (&quot;pirate, corsair, sea robber&quot;), and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πειρατής (''peiratēs''), &quot;brigand&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2380356 Peirates, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, at Perseus].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πειράομαι (peiráomai), &quot;I attempt&quot;, from πεῖρα (''peîra''), &quot;attempt, experience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2380341 Peira, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, at Perseus].&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the Greek word ''peiratēs'' literally is &quot;one who attacks (ships)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pirate&amp;searchmode=none |title= Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= Etymonline.com |access-date= December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also [[cognate]] to ''peril''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;/&gt; The term first appeared in English {{circa}} 1300.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;/&gt; Spelling did not become standardised until the eighteenth century, and spellings such as &quot;pirrot&quot;, &quot;pyrate&quot; and &quot;pyrat&quot; occurred until this period.&lt;ref&gt;

====Antiquity====

{{further|Ancient Mediterranean piracy}}
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|right|Mosaic of a [[Trireme|Roman trireme]] in Tunisia]]
The earliest documented instances of piracy are the exploits of the [[Sea People]]s who threatened the ships sailing in the Aegean and Mediterranean waters in the 14th century BC. In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Illyrians]] and [[Tyrrhenians]] were known as pirates. In the pre-classical era, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] condoned piracy as a viable profession; it apparently was widespread and &quot;regarded as an entirely honourable way of making a living&quot;.&lt;ref name=mol&gt;Møller, Bjørn. &quot;Piracy, Maritime Terrorism and Naval Strategy.&quot; Copenhagen: Danish Institute for International Studies, November 16, 2008. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; References are made to its perfectly normal occurrence in many texts including in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and abduction of women and children to be sold into slavery was common. By the era of [[Classical Greece]], piracy was looked upon as a &quot;disgrace&quot; to have as a profession.&lt;ref name=mol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] wrote: &quot;For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to turn pirate…indeed, this came to be the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, pirate attacks on [[Olympus (Lycia)|Olympus]] in [[Lycia]] brought impoverishment. Among some of the most famous ancient pirateering peoples were the Illyrians, a people populating the western Balkan peninsula. Constantly raiding the [[Adriatic Sea]], the Illyrians caused many conflicts with the [[Roman Republic]]. It was not until 229 BC when the Romans finally decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;WardHeichelheim2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen M. Ward|author2=Fritz M. Heichelheim|author3=Cedric A. Yeo|title=History of the Roman People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q83DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|date= 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-51120-7|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1st century BC, there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the [[Roman Empire]] in the eastern Mediterranean. On one voyage across the [[Aegean Sea]] in 75&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 |date=May 30, 2012 }}). Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1.8 1.8–2]) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41.3 2:41.3-42] says merely that it happened when he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] was kidnapped and briefly held by [[Cilician]] pirates and held prisoner in the [[Dodecanese]] islet of [[Farmakos|Pharmacusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate finally invested the general [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] with powers to deal with piracy in 67&amp;nbsp;BC (the ''[[Lex Gabinia]]''), and Pompey, after three months of naval warfare, [[Pompey#Campaign against the pirates|managed]] to suppress the threat.

As early as 258&amp;nbsp;AD, the [[Goths|Gothic]]-[[Heruli]]c fleet ravaged towns on the coasts of the [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Aegean coast suffered similar attacks a few years later. In 264, the Goths reached [[Galatia]] and [[Cappadocia]], and Gothic pirates landed on Cyprus and [[Crete]]. In the process, the Goths seized enormous booty and took thousands into captivity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 286&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Carausius]], a Roman military commander of Gaulish origins, was appointed to command the ''[[Classis Britannica]]'', and given the responsibility of eliminating [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] pirates who had been raiding the coasts of [[Armorica]] and Belgic [[Gaul]]. In the Roman province of Britannia, [[Saint Patrick]] was captured and enslaved by Irish pirates.

====Middle Ages====

[[File:Wikinger.jpg|thumb|right|A fleet of [[Vikings]], painted mid-12th century]]
The most widely known and far-reaching pirates in medieval Europe were the [[Vikings]], seaborne warriors from [[Scandinavia]] who raided and looted mainly between the 8th and 12th centuries, during the [[Viking Age]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. They raided the coasts, rivers and inland cities of all Western Europe as far as [[Seville]], which was attacked by the Norse in 844. Vikings also attacked the coasts of North Africa and Italy and plundered all the coasts of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Some Vikings ascending the rivers of Eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and Persia. The lack of centralized powers all over Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] enabled pirates to attack ships and coastal areas all over the continent.{{Vague|date=February 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the Late Middle Ages, the [[Frisians|Frisian]] pirates known as [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop]] led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijerd Jelckama]], fought against the troops of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with some success.

Toward the end of the 9th century, Moorish pirate havens were established along the coast of southern France and northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010622192246/http://www.geocities.com/athens/troy/4040/pirates.htm The Pirates of St. Tropez].&lt;/ref&gt; In 846 Moor raiders [[Arab raid against Rome|sacked]] the ''extra muros'' Basilicas of [[Old saint peter's basilica|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul]] in Rome. In 911, the bishop of [[Narbonne]] was unable to return to France from Rome because the Moors from [[Fraxinet]] controlled all the passes in the [[Alps]]. Moor pirates operated out of the [[Balearic Islands]] in the 10th century. From 824 to 961 [[Arab]] pirates in the [[Emirate of Crete]] raided the entire Mediterranean. In the 14th century, raids by Moor pirates forced the Venetian Duke of Crete to ask [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to keep its fleet on constant guard.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

After the [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions of the former [[Roman province of Dalmatia]] in the 5th and 6th centuries, a tribe called the [[Narentines]] revived the old Illyrian piratical habits and often raided the Adriatic Sea starting in the 7th century. Their raids in the Adriatic increased rapidly, until the whole Sea was no longer safe for travel.

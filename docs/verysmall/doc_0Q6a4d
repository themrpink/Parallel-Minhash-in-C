==== Marine archaeology ====

[[Maritime archaeology]] or marine archaeology is the study of material remains of ancient peoples. A specialized branch, [[Archaeology of shipwrecks]] studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stone anchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive submerged for centuries for archaeologists to discover, study, and place their salvaged findings into the time line of history. coral reefs, tsunamis, cyclones, mangrove swamps, battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/2264/30/3/Man_Environ_29_28.pdf Marine Archaeology in India] URL accessed 22 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic importance ===
{{see also | Countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal }}

One of the first trading ventures along the Bay of Bengal was The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies more commonly referred to as the [[British East India Company]]. [[Gopalpur-on-Sea]] was one of their main trading centers. Other trading companies along the Bay of Bengal shorelines were the [[English East India Company]] and the [[French East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabataea.net/bengal.html Nabataea: Trade on the Bay of Bengal] URL accessed 21 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BIMSTEC]] Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) supports free trade internationally around the Bay of Bengal between [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and [[Thailand]].

The [[Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project]] is a new venture proposed which would create a channel for a shipping route to link the Gulf of Mannar with the Bay of Bengal. This would connect India from east to west without the necessity of going around Sri Lanka.

Thoni and catamaran fishing boats of fishing villages thrive along the Bay of Bengal shorelines. Fishermen can catch between 26 and 44 species of marine fish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150226082556/http://dspace.jdvu.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/20383/1/Acc.%20No.%20DC%20129.pdf Environmental assessment of coastal water at Bakkhali]&lt;/ref&gt; In one year, the average catch is two million tons of fish from the Bay of Bengal alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/lme/text/lme34.htm |title=LME 34 Bay of Bengal |website=NOAA |access-date=21 January 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20030418122740/http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/lme/text/lme34.htm |archive-date=18 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 31% of the world's coastal fishermen live and work on the bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Bay of Bengal: New bay dawning |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21576721-harbours-eastern-lobe-indian-ocean-could-transform-economic-geography-asia-new |magazine=The Economist |date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geostrategic importance ===

The Bay of Bengal is centrally located in [[South Asia|South]] and Southeast Asia. It lies at the center of two huge economic blocks, the [[SAARC]] and [[ASEAN]]. It influences China's southern landlocked region in the north and major sea ports of India and Bangladesh. China, India, and Bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seas.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Berlin |first=Donald L. |date=25 January 2005 |title=The emerging Bay of Bengal |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GA25Df05.html |newspaper=Asia Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large deposits of natural gas in the areas within Bangladesh's sea zone incited a serious urgency by India and Myanmar into a territorial dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot; /&gt; Disputes over rights of some oil and gas blocks have caused brief diplomatic spats between Myanmar and India with Bangladesh.

The disputed [[maritime boundary]] between Bangladesh and Myanmar resulted in military tensions in 2008 and 2009. Bangladesh is pursuing a settlement with Myanmar and India to the boundary dispute through the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Maritime Boundary Dispute Between Bangladesh and her neighbors: Motivations, Potential Solutions, and Implications&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=449|title=The Maritime Boundary Dispute Between Bangladesh and Myanmar: Motivations, Potential Solutions, and Implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious importance ===
The Bay of Bengal in the stretch of [[Pancha Tirtha, Puri|Swargadwar]], the gateway to heaven in [[Sanskrit]], in the Indian town of [[Puri]] is considered holy by [[Hindus]]. [[File:Samudra arati.jpg|thumb|Samudra arati or worship of the sea by disciples of the Govardhan Matha at Puri]]
The Samudra [[arati]] is a daily tradition started by the present [[Shankaracharya]] of Puri 9 years ago to honour the sacred sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sahu |first=Monideepa |date=6 March 2016 |title=The great fire |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532849/fire.html |newspaper=Deccan Herald |accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily practise includes prayer and fire offering to the sea at Swargadwar in Puri by disciples of the [[Govardhana matha]] of the Shankaracharya. On Paush Purnima of every year the Shankaracharya himself comes out to offer prayers to the sea.

=== Islands ===
The islands in the bay are numerous, including the [[Andaman Islands]], [[Nicobar Islands]] and [[Mergui Archipelago]] of India and Myanmar. The Cheduba group of islands, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Great Andaman]] is the main archipelago or island group of the Andaman Islands, whereas [[Ritchie's Archipelago]] consists of smaller islands. Only 37, or 6.5%, of the 572 islands and islets of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024520/http://www.and.nic.in/port-blair.htm The long stretch of sand glistening like silver dust] URL accessed 10 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivers ===
Many major [[Rivers of India]] and Bangladesh flow west to east before draining into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Ganges|Ganga]] is the northernmost of these rivers. Its main channel enters and flows through Bangladesh, where it is known as the [[Padma River]], before joining the [[Meghna River]]. However, the [[Brahmaputra River]] flows from east to west in [[Assam]] before turning south and entering Bangladesh where it is called the [[Jamuna River]]. This joins the Padma where upon the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]] that finally drains into Bay of Bengal. The [[Sundarbans]] is a mangrove forest in the southern part of the [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]] which lies in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and in [[Bangladesh]]. The Brahmaputra at {{convert|2948|km|mi|abbr=on}} is the 28th [[List of rivers by length|longest River]] in the world. It originates in [[Tibet]]. The [[Hooghly River]], another channel of the [[Ganga]] that flows through [[Kolkata]] drains into Bay of Bengal at [[Sagar Island|Sagar]] in West Bengal, India.

The Ganga–Brahmaputra-Barak rivers deposit nearly 1000&amp;nbsp;million tons of [[sediment]] every year. The sediment from these three rivers form the Bengal Delta and the [[submarine fan]], a vast structure that extends from [[Bengal]] to south of the Equator, is up to {{convert|16.5|km}} thick, and contains at least 1,130&amp;nbsp;trillion tonnes of sediment, which has accumulated over the last 17&amp;nbsp;million years at an average rate of 665&amp;nbsp;million tons per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/apr252003/1041.pdf |title=  A sediment budget for the Padma-Meghna-Jamuna catchment|first=Robert|last=Wasson|year=2003|journal=Current Science|volume=84|issue=8|pages=1041–1047}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1&amp;nbsp;trillion mol/yr (13.2&amp;nbsp;million t/yr) since the early [[Miocene]] period. The three rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) deposited in the world's oceans. Due to high TOC accumulation in the deep sea bed of the Bay of Bengal, the area is rich in oil and natural gas and [[gas hydrate]] reserves. Bangladesh can [[Land reclamation|reclaim land]] substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea [[Levee|dikes]], bunds, [[causeways]] and by trapping the sediment from its rivers.

Further southwest of [[Bengal]], the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Kaveri River]]s also flow from west to east across [[Deccan Plateau]] in Peninsular India and drain into the Bay of Bengal forming [[River delta|delta]]s. Many small rivers also drain directly into the Bay of Bengal forming [[Estuary|estuaries]]; the shortest of them is the [[Cooum River]] at {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwady) River]] in Myanmar flows into the [[Andaman Sea]] of the Bay of Bengal and once had thick [[Myanmar Coast mangroves|mangrove]] forests of its own.

=== Seaports ===
[[File:VizagPort.jpg|thumb|250px|The city of [[Visakhapatnam]] in India is a major port of the Bay of Bengal.]]

Indian ports on the bay include [[Paradip Port]] , [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata Port]], [[Haldia Port]], [[Chennai]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Kakinada Port|Kakinada]], [[Pondicherry]], [[Dhamra]], [[Gopalpur-on-Sea|Gopalpur]] and Bangladeshi ports on the Bay are [[Port of Chittagong|Chittagong]], [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]], [[Payra Port]].

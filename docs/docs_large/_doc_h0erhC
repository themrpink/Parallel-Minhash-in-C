==Legacy==
After Rollo's death, his male-line descendants continued to rule Normandy until 1204, when it was lost by [[John Lackland]] to the French [[King Philip Augustus]].{{sfn|Van Houts|2000|p=15}} Rollo's dynasty was able to survive through a combination of ruthless military actions and [[Intragroup conflict|infighting]] among the Frankish aristocracy, which left them severely weakened and unable to combat the Rouen Vikings' growing determination to stay put.{{sfn|Van Houts|2000|p=15}}

Rollo is the subject of the 17th-century play ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy]]'', written by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], [[Philip Massinger]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[George Chapman]].

A character, broadly inspired by the historical Rollo but including many events from before the real Rollo was born, played by [[Clive Standen]], is [[Ragnar Lothbrok]]'s brother in the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] television series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbow|first=Tina|title=Reflections of a Viking by Clive Standen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tina-turnbow/vikings-history-channel_b_2892766.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=[[HuffPost]]|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year '''255''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCLV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Valerianus and Gallienus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1008 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 255 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Hans Richter''' (6 April 1888 – 1 February 1976) was a German painter, graphic artist, avant-gardist, film-experimenter and producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/features/oisteanu/oisteanu10-27-04.asp |title=Magazine Features – Hans Richter, Dada Pioneer |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Berlin]] into a well-to-do family and died in [[Minusio]], near [[Locarno]], [[Switzerland]].

==Germany==
Richter's first contacts with [[modern art]] were in 1912 through the &quot;[[Der Blaue Reiter|Blaue Reiter]]&quot; and in 1913 through the &quot;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon|de}}&quot; gallery &quot;[[Der Sturm]]&quot;, in Berlin. In 1914 he was influenced by [[cubism]]. He contributed to the periodical ''Die Aktion'' in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Haftmann, Werner | title=Postscript to ''Dada: Art and Anti-Art'' | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | year=1978 | isbn=0-500-20039-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/dadaartantiart00rich }}, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibition was in [[Munich]] in 1916, and ''Die Aktion'' published as a special edition about him. In the same year he was wounded and discharged from the army and went to [[Zürich]] and joined the [[Dada]] movement.

Richter believed that the artist's duty was to be actively political, opposing war and supporting the revolution. His first abstract works were made in 1917. In 1918, he befriended [[Viking Eggeling]], and the two experimented together with film. Richter was co-founder, in 1919, of the [[Association of Revolutionary Artists]] (&quot;Artistes Radicaux&quot;) at Zürich. In the same year he created his first ''Prélude'' (an orchestration of a theme developed in eleven drawings). In 1920 he was a member of the November group in Berlin and contributed to the Dutch periodical ''[[De Stijl]]''.

Throughout his career, he claimed that his 1921 film, ''Rhythmus 21'', was the first [[abstract film]] ever created. This claim is not true: he was preceded by the Italian [[Futurism (art)|Futurists]] [[Bruno Corra]] and [[Arnaldo Ginna]] between 1911 and 1912&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurism.org.uk/cinema/cinema.htm Article on Futurist Cinema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021007063855/http://www.futurism.org.uk/cinema/cinema.htm |date=7 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as they report in the ''Futurist Manifesto of Cinema''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/cinema.html |title='The Futurist Cinema' Manifesto, 1916 |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by fellow German artist [[Walter Ruttmann]] who produced ''Lichtspiel Opus 1'' in 1920. Nevertheless, Richter's film ''Rhythmus 21'' is considered an important early abstract film.

About Richter's woodcuts and drawings [[Michel Seuphor]] wrote: &quot;Richter's black-and-whites together with those of Arp and Janco, are the most typical works of the Zürich period of Dada.&quot; From 1923 to 1926, Richter edited, together with [[Werner Gräff]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]], the periodical ''G. Material zur elementaren Gestaltung.'' Richter wrote of his own attitude toward film:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I conceive of the film as a modern art form particularly interesting to the sense of sight. Painting has its own peculiar problems and specific sensations, and so has the film. But there are also problems in which the dividing line is obliterated, or where the two infringe upon each other. More especially, the cinema can fulfill certain promises made by the ancient arts, in the realization of which painting and film become close neighbors and work together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United States==
Richter moved from Switzerland to the United States in 1940 and became an American citizen. He taught in the Institute of Film Techniques at the [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haftmann, p222&quot;&gt;Haftmann, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[New York City]], Richter directed two feature films, ''[[Dreams That Money Can Buy]]'' (1947) and ''[[8 x 8: A Chess Sonata in 8 Movements]]'' (1957) in collaboration with [[Max Ernst]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Bowles]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and others, which was partially filmed on the lawn of his summer house in [[Southbury, Connecticut]].

In 1957, he finished a film entitled ''Dadascope'' with original poems and prose spoken by their creators: [[Hans Arp]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].

After 1958, Richter spent parts of the year in [[Ascona]] and [[Connecticut]] and returned to painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haftmann, p222&quot;/&gt;

In 1963, he directed the short film &quot;From the Circus to the Moon&quot; on the American artist [[Alexander Calder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calder.org/life/historic-films |title=Historic Films – Calder Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter was also the author of a first-hand account of the Dada movement titled ''Dada: Art and Anti-Art''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Richter, Hans | title=Dada: Art and Anti-Art | publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | year=1965 | isbn=0-500-20039-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/dadaartantiart00rich }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included his reflections on the emerging [[Neo-Dada]] artworks.

__NOTOC__
Year '''355''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Arbitio and Maesius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1108 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 355 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

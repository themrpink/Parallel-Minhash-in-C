This is a '''list of mail server software''': [[Message transfer agent|mail transfer agents]], [[mail delivery agent]]s, and other [[computer software]] which provide [[e-mail]].

&lt;!-- When editing this list bear in mind that the same notability criteria apply here as elsewhere in Wikipedia: entries with no independent sources listed either here or in other Wikipedia articles may not be notable, and are likely to be removed. --&gt;
==Product statistics==
All such figures are necessarily estimates because data about mail server share is difficult to obtain; there are few reliable primary sources—and no agreed methodologies for its collection.

Surveys probing Internet-exposed systems typically attempt to identify systems via their banner, or other identifying features;&lt;ref name=mx/&gt; and report [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]] and [[exim]] as overwhelming leaders, with greater than 80% share between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201403/mxsurvey.html Security Space Mail (MX) Server Survey], April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mx&gt;{{cite web |title=Mail (MX) Server Survey |url=http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201811/mxsurvey.html#x4 |accessdate=17 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

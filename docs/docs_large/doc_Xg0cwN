:::I agree with [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] on this one.  When I did the first draft of MOS, I assumed there would be separate pages on layout and on scientific articles and suggested separate pages on hairy subjects like tables.  There's a list of other pages at the bottom (the only thing left of the &quot;old&quot; MOS).  I think we should keep the MOS simple and unimposing and put the philosophy and special cases on links.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]

:: Hmmmmm. One of the problems I have with this is that, as so often happens, the two articles start to live separate lives. However, at the least, these style guidelines should be ''mentioned'', a link will explain the specifics and the ideas behind it. [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]

:: I agree with Ortolan88. This should be like [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions]] in that regard. &amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 09:03 Sep 27, 2002 (UTC)

: Yes, that's probably the best. We should take care however that both pages state the same, and link to each other. [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]

:They seem to be keeping things together with the naming conventions page, but it probably helps that the subsidiary pages' names have the format &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (...)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Should we do similarly here? That is, if we adopt a previously existing style page as a subsidiary page to the MoS, then should we rename it &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (...)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? &amp;mdash; [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby]] 01:43 Sep 29, 2002 (UTC)

::Sounds reasonable to me.  We could do the same thing with the talk page and stash all that maundering about hectares and poods and versts and furlongs out of the way.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 01:49 Sep 29, 2002 (UTC)

: I was planning on moving dates, numbers and units onto a separate page once the [[orders of magnitude]] links are all ready; the relevant talk would be shunted across too -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 08:45 Sep 29, 2002 (UTC)

Is it always wrong to begin an article with a brief quotation?  I have included a number of them, always italic'd and set off, before the main intro text, as an attempt to provide an immediate cultural reference and context.  A number of other respected Wikipedians say that it is wrong, wrong, wrong to include them, and cite this guideline as justification.

Admittedly, the articles I begun or added them to are probably not the most solemn articles.  Many of them come from the [[stock character]] pages, which have been a minor project of mine.  Here cultural references are particularly important and the subjects deal with popular entertainments.  I see the quotations myself as establishing immediate context by providing a point of reference; look at the history of [[mad scientist]] to see what I mean.

There are other articles, like [[Lizzie Borden]] and [[Old King Cole]], where the article's only real subject is a quotation (again, look at the histories); to begin the article with biographical boilerplate, or anything other than the popular rhymes which are the only reason these articles exist, strikes me as to begin with weak and mostly irrelevant material.  

If the sense of the community is that these introductory quotes are always wrong, I will move or remove them.   I'd just as soon hear from people other than those who have been taking them off, though, as to whether these things are really wrong or not.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 15:40, 21 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I like those introductory quotes. It makes the articles lively. Good work! -- [[User:Viajero|Viajero]] 20:21, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I've no objection to them. Lots of books have chapters beginning this way; while it's not a very encyclopedia-like practice, as long as they're pertinent to the subject or are explicitly about the subject (as is the one on [[Lizzie Borden]]), they're fine with me. Actually, it seems weirder to have them out in the middle of the text without any explanation (like the one on [[Mad scientist]]). -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 23:42, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== Stating the basics ==
''Move to [[Wikipedia talk:Establish context]]''

This is mentioned elsewhere, but I think it's worth reminding the collectivity of it: ''remember to state the obvious'' -- or rather, remember that that is obvious to ''you'' is not so to the average reader. I had to add this to the start of the new article on the [[Ford Thunderbird]]: ''The Ford Thunderbird is a car manufactured in the USA by the Ford Motor Company. '' -- the authors did not stop to suppose that the reader does not necessarily know it's a car. This ties in with [[news style]] and the 5Ws. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 17:23, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Ah, that one was mine.  One forgets, also, that a reader might not have arrived from a related page and therefore have context.  The word 'car' DID appear a sentence or two later, though, so it's not that it was never mentioned, just not probably as soon as it might have.  What I did utterly forget to mention was this was a vehicle by Ford USA; as a transplanted Brit myself, you'd think I would know better than being so americentric, but clearly not!   That's why second pairs of eyes help, to catch the first author's assumptions. -- [[User:Morven|Morven]] 06:26, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Agreed. Pretend an alien anthropologist from Alpha Centauri somehow understands English, and is reading Wikipedia to learn about humans. You can't assume anything. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 19:37, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::I agree with Tarquin, I am not sure whether you do, it may be irony. - [[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 20:43, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:::Irony? I think the word you want is sarcasm. And no, it's not :-) -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 00:19, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::::Okay, we agree then that stating the basics is good (some people disagree and object against sentences like &quot;A female child is called a girl, a male a boy.&quot; and &quot;Sleeping is typically done lying in a bed&quot;). - [[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 06:56, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:::::There is a difference between including the necessary basic information as suggested by [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] and treating your reader like a '''moron'''. Everyone knows that one sleeps in a bed; not everyone knows what a Thunderbird is. -- [[User:Viajero|Viajero]] 09:36, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::::::The alien anthropologist from Alpha Centauri does not. - [[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 09:41, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:::::::Of course he does! He understands English. He couldn't have learned it without acquiring a certain amount of basic information, like what a bed is for. -- [[User:Viajero|Viajero]] 10:03, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::::::::He may know what it is (seen it, felt the soft surface), but not what it is used for. - [[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 10:16, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

I think a better rule of thumb than imagining your audience is from Alpha Centauri may be to imagine that our civilization is destroyed utterly, and our descendants are fortunate enough to uncover an operational Wikipedia while digging through the ruins.  We have so much trouble learning about the basic details of ancient civilizations because their writers generally failed to state the obvious... let us not make the same mistake.  --[[User:Skyfaller|Nelson]] 13:28, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:This scenario is just as ludicruous as the previous. How do we know, for example, what the ancient Greeks ''really''wrote about since virtually all their manuscripts were filtered by medieval monks? And a lone server running Wikipedia under the ruins of our civilization??? Get real! How about writing for an audience of people with high-school educations? That would imply an assumption of basic knowledge of common things, such as what a bed is for and why people go the beach, and behoove us to write about matters of depth and complexity, ie the arts and sciences, and current affairs. -- [[User:Viajero|Viajero]] 17:50, 24 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::You can't assume that people know &quot;''why people go the beach''&quot;. I agree the bed thing is stupid though. [[User:Angela|Angela]]

:::We can still write about matters of depth and complexity, while still defining obvious things. Viajero, I think the operational Wikipedia server buried under the ruins (and the anthropologist from Alpha Centauri) are merely thought experiments. They should not be taken seriously :-) But consider what we are writing here: a record of human knowledge. If these are things that &quot;everyone knows&quot;, then it makes sense (to me) that they be included in such a record. I've created [[Wikipedia:State the obvious]] in order to expand this idea a bit. Feel free to [[Wikipedia talk:State the obvious|comment]]. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 19:22, 24 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::::[[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]], basically I agree with your ideas. In the course of editing articles I've added quite a bit of informtion particularly to the opening paragraphs, defining the context, which, I agree, is vital. It is amazing how US-centric some of the pieces are! As such, I am all for stating the basics, defining the context, and so on, but always with a distinction between basic information and '''mundane''' details. I don't quite know how to define this distinction, only I know it when I see it. A certain user here has a propensity for filling articles with mountains of trivial information which make articles read like ''easy-readers''. What is important? Historial/biographical/technical/statistical information of course, but also some sense of ''why'' something is important. For me, this doesn't include explaining, for example, that a towel is used to dry oneself. That's what you learn at home or at school as a kid; that's not what you turn as an adult (young or old) to an enclyclopedia to learn about. The idea that ''all'' knowledge belongs in an encyclopedia is a mistaken one; a good editor makes reasoned choices, I think, between basic, vital, and trivial information. -- [[User:Viajero|Viajero]] 18:59, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I have used wikipedia to learn a lot about maths, programming concepts and internet memes. I add my support for the following statement completely
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Agreed. Pretend an alien anthropologist from Alpha Centauri somehow understands English, and is reading Wikipedia to learn about humans. You can't assume anything. -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]] 19:37, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some of the mathematical articles went &quot;straight in&quot;, and lost me in the flavour paragraph.

I have noticed that wikipedia has an unofficial style: the first paragraph and userbox are where you learn wat is going on, and below this we have the main article. This makes the article accessible to everyone without &quot;dumbing down&quot; on the article. --[[User:Gigitrix|Gigitrix]] ([[User talk:Gigitrix|talk]]) 18:29, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

==For/against ordering==
''From Village Pump 10th September 2003''
I'd like to propose a new addition to the Wikipedia style, and I'm not sure where else to suggest it. What I would like to see is a guideline that in any article, if there is more than one point of view, descriptions of the article subject come first, and arguments against it come later. So when I went to an article on Global Warming, say, I got a description of Global Warming first and objections to it later. Likewise when I go to ''Creationism'' I should find out what creationists believe first, and only then any reasons why people might think they are wrong. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 20:49, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Sounds reasonable to me.  Apart from the fairness issues, it makes the article more comprehensible, as it's rather difficult to contextualize arguments against a position without first having explained the position.  In fact, this is my major complaint with the reverse ordering some articles currently have -- they seem to present the arguments as if they're talking to someone who already is familiar with the subject, and I have to read further to find out what it was they were actually talking about.  On the other hand, if it's a controversial topic, the intro should mention this; it's just the specific objections that should be left for later in the article, not the fact that there are objections in the first place. --[[User:Delirium|Delirium]] 20:58, Aug 27, 2003 (UTC)

==Proposal to consolidate advice on writing better articles==

At present there are many articles in the Wikipedia namespace that seek to give guidance on how to write better articles. I propose consolidating these into a much smaller number. On [[User:Jongarrettuk/Better writing guide]] I propose how these could be consolidated. The proposal is not to change advice, just to consolidate it. If I have inadvertently moved what you consider to be good advice that is currently in the Wikipedia namespace, please re-add it. I'm hope that the proposal to merge all these articles, in principle, will be welcomed. Of course, it may be preferred to have 2, 3 or 4 inter-connected articles than just one and would welcome advice on how this could be done. (In particular, perhaps all the guidance on layout should be spun off into one consolidated article on layout.) I'm also aware that putting lots of different bits of advice together may throw up anomalies or bits that people now disagree with (including bits that I myself disagree with:) ). I ask for support for the consolidation. Once the consolidation has happened, the advice can be changed in the normal way. Please feel free to improve on the current draft consolidation, but don't remove or add advice that is not currently on the Wikipedia namespace. If all goes well, I'll add a new [[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles]] page on the 19th, though maybe some bits of the new article will need to be phased in over a longer period. I'll also take care to preserve all the archived discussion in one place. [[User:Jongarrettuk|jguk]] 19:44, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Why is this a talk page for a project page which does not exist? [[User:Hyacinth|Hyacinth]] 21:47, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

'''Susan Mary Cooper''' (born 23 May 1935) is an [[English people|English]] author of children's books. She is best known for ''[[The Dark Is Rising Sequence|The Dark Is Rising]]'', a [[contemporary fantasy]] series set in England and Wales, which incorporates British mythology, such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends, and Welsh folk heroes.&lt;ref name=hand/&gt; 
For that work, in 2012 she won the lifetime [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], recognizing her contribution to writing for teens.&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; In the 1970s two of the five novels were named the year's best English-language book with an &quot;authentic Welsh background&quot; by the [[Welsh Books Council]].&lt;ref name=tirnanog/&gt;

== Biography ==

Cooper was born in 1935 in [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire]], to Ethel May (''née'' Field) and her husband John Richard Cooper.&lt;ref name=chaston/&gt; Her father had worked in the reading room of the Natural History Museum until going off to fight in the Second World War, from which he returned with a wounded leg. He then pursued a career in the offices of the [[Great Western Railway]]. Her mother was a teacher of ten-year-olds and eventually became deputy head of a large school. Her younger brother Roderick also grew up to become a writer.&lt;ref name=chaston/&gt;

Cooper lived in Buckinghamshire until she was 21, when her parents moved to her grandmother's village of [[Aberdyfi]] in Wales. She attended [[Slough High School]] and then earned a degree in [[English studies|English]] at [[Somerville College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where she was the first woman to edit the undergraduate newspaper [[Cherwell (newspaper)|''Cherwell'']].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Butler, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fxNyH4uE100C&amp;pg=PA14 ''Four British Fantasists: Place and Culture in the Children's Fantasies of Penelope Lively, Alan Garner, Diana Wynne Jones, and Susan Cooper''] (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, she worked as a [[reporter]] for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (London) under [[Ian Fleming]] and wrote in her spare time. During that period she began work on the series ''The Dark Is Rising'' and finished her [[debut novel]], the [[science fiction]] ''Mandrake'', published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

Cooper emigrated to the United States in 1963 to marry Nicholas J. Grant, a Professor of [[Metallurgy]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a widower with three teenage children.&lt;ref name=chaston/&gt; She had two children with him, Jonathan Roderick Howard Grant (b. 1965) and Katharine Mary Grant (b. 1966; later Katharine Glennon). She then became a full-time writer, focusing on ''The Dark Is Rising'' and on ''Dawn of Fear'' (1970), a novel based on her experiences of the Second World War. Eventually she wrote fiction for both children and adults, a series of picture books, film screenplays, and works for the stage.

Around the time of writing ''Seaward'' (1983), both of her parents died, and her marriage to Grant was dissolved.&lt;ref name=chaston/&gt;

In July 1996, she married the Canadian-American actor and her sometime co-author [[Hume Cronyn]], the widower of [[Jessica Tandy]]. (Cronyn and Tandy had starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] of ''[[Foxfire (play)|Foxfire]]'', written by Cooper and Cronyn and staged in 1982.)&lt;ref name=ibdb/&gt; 
Cooper and Cronyn remained married until his death in June 2003.

It disappointed Cooper, who requested that some changes from her narrative be reverted, to no avail.&lt;ref name=adler/&gt;
 
Cooper was on the Board of the [[National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance]] (NCBLA), a US [[nonprofit organization]] that advocates for literacy, literature, and libraries {{nowrap|(2006&lt;ref name=ncbla-bod06&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCBLA Board of Directors|url=http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|website=NCBLA|access-date=2006-10-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004014752/http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|archive-date=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;–2012&lt;ref name=ncbla-bod12&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCBLA Board of Directors|url=http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|website=NCBLA|access-date=2012-03-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322093151/http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|archive-date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}.

Her latest work in 2013 was ''Ghost Hawk'', featuring the spirit of a [[Wampanoag]], people decimated by European disease, who witnesses the transformation of Massachusetts by the [[Plymouth Colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LCC2013&quot;&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/2012039892 ''Ghost Hawk'']. LCC record. Retrieved 2013-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Cooper gave the fifth annual [[Tolkien Lecture]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], speaking on the role of fantasy literature in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tolkienlecture.org/2017/04/30/susan-coopers-tolkien-lecture/ Photographs, podcast, and video for Susan Cooper's Tolkien Lecture], ''The J.R.R.

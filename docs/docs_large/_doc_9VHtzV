An [[annual publication|annual]] was published each year in the UK by [[Grandreams]]. These books consisted of a mix of text stories and cartoon strips, as well as photos and articles on the show's stars and KITT. There were five annuals produced in total, each reflecting the season of the show that was airing at the time, with the final two releases covering the final season. (The last annual was printed in a quite small quantity, due to the fading popularity of the show, and is thus considerably rarer.)

'''''Abalone''''' is a two-player [[Abstract strategy game|abstract strategy]] [[board game]] designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent Lévi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles&lt;ref name=&quot;ludotheque&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ludotheque.com/article.php3?id_article=75 |title=Ludothèque de Boulogne-Billancourt: Primés en 1988 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323081458/http://www.ludotheque.com/article.php3?id_article=75 |archivedate=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.

''Abalone'' was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4.5&amp;nbsp;million units. The year it was published it received one of the first [[Mensa Select]] awards. It is currently sold in more than thirty countries.

== Gameplay ==

=== Rules ===
The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take turns with the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either ''broadside / arrow-like'' (parallel to the line of marbles) or ''in-line / in a line'' (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.&lt;ref name=&quot;aichholzer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ist.tugraz.at/aichholzer/research/rp/abalone/tele1-02_aich-abalone.pdf |title=Algorithmic Fun – Abalone|author =Oswin Aichholzer|author2 =Franz Aurenhammer|author2-link= Franz Aurenhammer |author3 =Tino Werner|publisher=[[Graz University of Technology]] |work=Special Issue on Foundations of Information Processing of TELEMATIK, 1:4–6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
A player can push their opponent's marbles (a &quot;sumito&quot;) that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board. The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off of the edge of the board.&lt;ref name=&quot;aichholzer&quot; /&gt;

=== Move notation ===
The notation for recording moves gives the letters A-I to the horizontal lines, and the numbers 1–9 to northwest-southeast diagonals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One popular notation:
an inline move can be denoted by the movement of the trailing marble (the &quot;caboose&quot;);
broadside moves can be denoted by the initial positions of the two extremities of the ''lance'' followed by the final position of the first marble (with this notation, each broadside move has two notations possible, which could be avoided).

=== Avoiding draws ===
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
The dynamics of the basic game may have one serious flaw: it seems that a good but conservative player can set up his or her marbles in a defensive wedge and ward off all attacks indefinitely. An attacker may try to outflank this wedge or lure it into traps, but such advances are often more dangerous to the attacker than the defender. Thus, from the starting position, it takes little skill and no imagination to avoid losing, and nothing in the rules prevents games from being interminable.

Because it is boring for games to be drawn out indefinitely, serious ''Abalone'' players tacitly agree to play aggressively. A player who forms a defensive wedge and makes no attempt to attack is likely to be a novice who might lose anyway. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility of any competent player bringing the game to a standstill and successfully avoiding losing, even to a championship-level player.

There are several possible &quot;solutions&quot;. First, in tournaments, a judge may penalize a player for playing defensively. This solution is somewhat unsatisfactory, given that a judge may not always be present, and that &quot;defensive play&quot; is subjective.

Second, several variations of the rules have been developed for the same board and marbles.  None of the variations has the same appealing simplicity of the original.

The third, and perhaps best, alternative starting positions have been designed to make the formation of stalemate wedges less likely.  Experiments are still underway to find an opening position which neither devolves to a draw nor gives too great an advantage to the first player. One popular attempt are the ''Marguerite'' or Daisy positions, two versions of which are displayed in the center and to the right.

Another option is to create a &quot;turn limit&quot; where if no marble has been knocked off the board by turn 15, whoever has made the most progress towards the center line wins. This encourages an aggressive strategy of moving forward and often the rule will not come into play.

|}

=== Rule variations and more players ===
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}

''Abalone'' can be played by three or more people using the same board with fewer marbles for each player and each player has a different colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abaloneonline.wordpress.com/game-rules/for-3-players/|title=3-player rule|website=Abalone Online|access-date=2016-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012124804/https://abaloneonline.wordpress.com/game-rules/for-3-players/|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abaloneonline.wordpress.com/game-rules/for-4-players/|title=4-player rule|website=Abalone Online|access-date=2016-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012124822/https://abaloneonline.wordpress.com/game-rules/for-4-players/|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of two-player variations use a third colour for passive pieces. For example, the variation called ''The Pillar'' (with a fixed marble in the centre of the board), which has been examined to some depth by Alex Borello and Nicolas Le Gal, uses a third colour. Another possible variation involves either player winning the game by ejecting the central marble.

A few variations use a second layer of marbles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

* Keep the marbles close to the centre of the board and force the opponent to move to the edges.
* Keep the marbles close together for increased defense and attack, especially in a hexagon shape to be able to push or defend in any direction.
* Pushing the opponent off the board is not usually a good idea if it leads to weaknesses in the player's geometry.

In 1999, a number of top players from the Mind Sports Olympiad signed an agreement to use a different starting position (the Belgian daisy) to revitalize the game. This has been used for top tournaments since then, including the AbaCup.

==Reception==
In the February-March 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'' (Issue 13), Mike Siggins called the components &quot;of good quality&quot;, and the rules &quot;extremely concise.&quot; He found the game very replayable, and commented that &quot;it has the potential to become a classic.&quot; His only complaint was that &quot;as players become more proficient the game can slow up and stalemates often result.&quot; Despite this, Siggins gave the game an above-average rating of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;''Abalone'' is one of the best abstract games to appear in a long while.&quot;&lt;ref name=ad&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Siggins|first=Mike| date=February-March 1990|title=Abalone|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=13|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grace O'Malley''' (c. 1530 – c. 1603) - in her native [[Irish language]] '''Gráinne Ní Mháille''', also known as '''Gráinne O'Malley''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=O'Dowd|first=Mary|year=2008|title=O'Malley, Gráinne (''fl''. 1577–1597)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/20753}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the head of the [[Kings of Umhaill|Ó Máille]] dynasty in the west of [[Ireland]], and the daughter of Eoghan Dubhdara Ó Máille. 

In [[Irish folklore]] she is commonly known as '''Gráinne Mhaol''' (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') and is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]]. Her name was also rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gráinne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ní Mháille is not mentioned in the Irish annals, so documentary evidence for her life comes mostly from English sources, especially the eighteen &quot;Articles of Interrogatory&quot;, questions put to her in writing on behalf of [[Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind.&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, Dónal an Phíopa Ó Mháille. Marriage to Dónal an Chogaidh (Dónal &quot;the warlike&quot;) Ó Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiobóid a Búrc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh Ó Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother Dónal an Phíopa (&quot;Dónal of the Pipes&quot;), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], Ní Mháille sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen Elizabeth I at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].

==Early life==
Ní Mháille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of Ní Mháille's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.

Eoghan Dubhdara Ó Máille, her father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chambers 2003 20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|Ó Máille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The Uí Mháille were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Chambers 2003 20&quot;/&gt; in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William Íochtar]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by Ní Mháille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a Ní Mháille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, Ní Mháille had a paternal half-brother called Dónal na Píopa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although typically during this period sons would inherit, Ní Mháille &quot;was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]&lt;/ref&gt;

With shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the Uí Mháille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family was [[Chief of the Name|known simply by his surname]] as Ó Máille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that Ní Mháille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname &quot;Gráinne Mhaol&quot; ({{IPA-ga|ˈɡˠɾˠɑːnʲə wɨːlˠ}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|r|ɔː|nj|ə|ˈ|w|eɪ|l}}).&lt;ref&gt;as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname may also come from &quot;Gráinne Umhaill&quot; (&quot;Gráinne of Umhall&quot;, Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the Uí Mháille).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers39&quot;/&gt; but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chambers, Anne 2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Ó Flaithbheartaigh ==
[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gráinne Ní Mháille]]
Ní Mháille was married in 1546 to [[Ó Flaithbertaigh|Dónal an Chogaidh Ó Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[tánaiste]]'' or heir to the Ó Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the Ó Máille chieftain. As Ó Flaithbheartaigh ''tánaiste'', Dónal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She bore three children during her marriage to Dónal an Chogaidh:
* Eoghan (Owen):&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.
* Méadhbh (Maeve):&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers44&quot;/&gt; Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorráin a Búrc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. Ní Mháille and a Búrc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.
* Murchadh (Murrough):&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers44&quot;/&gt; Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her sex. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When Ní Mháille heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After Dónal an Chogaidh's death, Ní Mháille left Iar Connacht and returned to Ó Máille territory, taking with her many Ó Flaithbheartaigh followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1565, Dónal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of Dónal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gráinne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gráinne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&amp;searchClicked=clicked&amp;quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Burke==

By 1566, Ní Mháille had married a second time, this time to [[Risdeárd an Iarainn Bourke|Risdeárd an Iarainn (&quot;Iron Richard&quot;) Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage.

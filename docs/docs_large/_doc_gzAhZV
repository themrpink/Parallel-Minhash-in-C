'''Imereti''' ([[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]]: იმერეთი) is a [[Mkhare|region]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] situated along the middle and upper reaches of the [[Rioni River]].

==Subdivisions==
It consists of the following [[Districts of Georgia (country)|Georgian administrative-territorial units]]:

#[[Kutaisi]] (city)
#[[Baghdati Municipality]] 
#[[Vani Municipality]] 
#[[Zestafoni Municipality]] 
#[[Terjola Municipality]] 
#[[Samtredia Municipality]] 
#[[Sachkhere Municipality]] 
#[[Tqibuli Municipality]] 
#[[Chiatura Municipality]] 
#[[Tsqaltubo Municipality]] 
#[[Kharagauli Municipality]] 
#[[Khoni Municipality]]

==Economy==
Significant towns and regional centres include [[Samtredia]], [[Chiatura]] (manganese production centre), [[Tkibuli]] ([[coal]] mining centre),  [[Zestafoni]] (known for metals production), [[Vani]], [[Khoni]], and [[Sachkhere]]. Traditionally, Imereti is an agricultural region, known for its [[mulberry|mulberries]] and [[grape]]s.

==Demographics==
The 800,000 Imeretians speak a [[Georgian language|Georgian]] [[Georgian dialects|dialect]]; they are one of the local culture-groups of the ethnically subdivided [[Georgian people]].

==History==
In late [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and early [[Middle Ages]] the ancient western Georgian kingdom of [[Egrisi]] existed on the territory of Imereti. Its king declared [[Christianity]] as an official religion of Egrisi in 523 AD. In 975-1466 Imereti was part of the [[Kingdom of Georgia|united Georgian Kingdom]]. Since its disintegration in the 15th century, Imereti was an [[Kingdom of Imereti|independent kingdom]].

In the 17th-18th centuries the kingdom of Imereti experienced frequent invasions by the [[Turkey|Turks]] and paid patronage to the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1810, when it was invaded and annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. The last King of Imereti was [[Solomon II of Imereti|Solomon II]] (1789-1810).

From 1918–1921, Imereti was part of the independent [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. Within the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], the region was part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] from 1922–1936, and part of the [[Georgian SSR]] from 1936–1991. Since Georgian independence in 1991, Imereti has been a region of Georgia with Kutaisi as the regional capital.

'''Allen Granberry Thurman''' (November 13, 1813 &amp;ndash; December 12, 1895) was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]], [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]] justice, and [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Ohio]]. He was the Democratic Party's nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888]]. He ended up losing the election.

Born in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], he and his family moved to [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], when Thurman was young. Thurman established a legal practice in Chillicothe with his uncle, [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]], who later represented Ohio in the U.S. Senate. Thurman won election to the House of Representatives in 1844, becoming the youngest member of that body. He supported the [[James K. Polk]] administration during the [[Mexican–American War]] and voted for the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have banned [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] from any territory gained from [[Mexico]]. He served a single term in the House before joining the Supreme Court of Ohio. He won election to the Senate in 1869, becoming an opponent to the Republican [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy. During the disputed [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], Thurman helped establish the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]]. Thurman lost re-election in 1881 as the Republicans had won control of the Ohio legislature.

Thurman was a favorite son candidate for president in 1880 and 1884. The [[1888 Democratic National Convention]] selected him as President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s running mate, as Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] had died in office. The aging Thurman did not actively campaign and the Democratic ticket was defeated.

==Early years==
He was born in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], to Pleasant Thurman and Mary Granberry Allen Thurman. Both of his parents were [[education|teachers]]; his father also a [[Methodist]] minister. In 1815, his parents [[manumission|emancipated]] their slaves and moved to [[Chillicothe, Ohio]]. He attended Chillicothe Academy, an academy run by his mother, and then studied law as an apprentice to his uncle, [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]] (who later became a Senator from Ohio). At the age of eighteen, Thurman worked on a land survey, and at twenty-one became private secretary to the [[Governor of Ohio]], [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]]. In 1835 he was admitted to the Ohio bar and became his uncle's law partner. In 1837 his uncle entered the Senate. On November 14, 1844, Thurman married Mary Dun Thomplins (or Tompkins), and they were the parents of three children.

==Career in government==

===Congressman===
The same year he was elected to the House of Representatives as its youngest member. He generally supported the majority of the Democrats on all issues except [[internal improvements]], on which he tended to vote with the [[United States Whig Party|Whigs]]. He supported the [[James Knox Polk|Polk]] Administration's conduct of the [[Mexican–American War]], spoke in favor of the 54°40' northern limit to the [[Oregon]] territory, and voted for the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have banned [[slavery]] from the territory gained from [[Mexico]]. His support for the latter was due to anti-African-American prejudice, as he wanted to reserve this territory for white settlement.  After a single two-year term, he left the House voluntarily to resume private law practice.

===State Supreme Court Justice===
In 1851 he was elected to a four-year term (February 1852 – February 1856) on the [[Ohio Supreme Court]],&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/SCO/formerjustices/bios/thurman.asp |publisher=The Supreme Court of Ohio &amp; The Ohio Judicial System |title=Allen Granberry Thurman |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last year as the chief justice. He then returned to private law practice in Columbus. Thurman spoke out against the repeal of the [[Missouri Compromise]] and opposed the pro-slavery [[Lecompton constitution]] for [[Kansas]]. In 1860 he was a supporter of [[Stephen A. Douglas]] for [[President of the United States|President]]. He never accepted the right of a state to secede but felt it was unwise to fight a state that had already left the Union, and during the [[American Civil War]] he was opposed to [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] policies, especially on [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]]. While he supported the war effort, he encouraged compromise and a political settlement.

===Candidate for Governor===
[[File:Cleveland-Thurman.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Cleveland/Thurman campaign poster]]
In 1867, he ran for Governor of Ohio, on a platform opposed to extending [[suffrage]] to blacks, but lost to [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in a close election.

===U.S. Senator===
The Ohio voters chose a Democratic [[Ohio General Assembly|state legislature]], however, which selected Thurman as senator for the term beginning in 1869. He there became a strong opponent of the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans']] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] measures. In 1873 Thurman crafted a strategy that led to Ohio choosing once more a Democratic legislature, and electing Thurman's uncle William Allen as governor. The legislature elected Thurman to another term in the Senate. During the twelve years he served in the Senate, he became the leader of the Democrats in that body.  He was known for constant hard work, good preparation, and courteous treatment of his opponents, and other members ranked him among the top three senators of his time, in terms of ability.   He came nearest, a Washington correspondent concluded, to &quot;the beau ideal of a Senator of any man on his side of the House.  He has fine passing power of cutting up his political opponents, saying a word of encouragement to some Republican when he is down, and scattering the caucuses of the opposite side with a pistol shot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati Gazette, April 10, 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; His prepared speeches were clear and cogent, but it was in debate that he showed himself at his most picturesque.  &quot;He would wave his red bandana pocket handkerchief like a guidon, give his nose a trumpet-blast, take a fresh pinch of snuff, and dash into the debate, dealing rough blows, and scattering the carefully prepared arguments of his adversaries like chaff,&quot; a Washington long-time reporter remembered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Perley Poore]], &quot;Reminiscences,&quot; 2:359-60.&lt;/ref&gt; He kept up a close friendship with his chief sparring partner on the opposite side, George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Journalists told how at a given signal—a long blow of his nose—he would get ready to exit the Senate so that the two could meet in the Judiciary Committee room to share a liberal amount of Kentucky Bourbon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Perley Poore]], &quot;Reminiscences,&quot; 2:360; New York Times, January 31, 1881; Frank Carpenter scrapbook (September 26, 1885, clipping), Frank Carpenter Papers, Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;When I speak of the law,&quot; Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] of New York once said, &quot;I turn to the Senator as the Mussulman turns towards Mecca.  I look to him only as I would look to the common law of England, the world's most copious volume of human jurisprudence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel S. Cox]], &quot;Why We Laugh,&quot; p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he made himself the critic of giveaways to the large railroad corporations and of Republicans' Reconstruction policies. &quot;A fine juicy roast of land grants is what sends Thurman's tongue a-wagging,&quot; wrote one reporter.&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati Commercial, June 21, 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1876&amp;ndash;1877 [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|electoral college crisis]], he helped to arrive at the solution of creating the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy, and ultimately served as one of the members of the commission, as one of the five Senators (one of the two Senate Democrats, and one of the seven Democrats altogether). As a Democrat, he voted with the seven-member minority, in favor of the [[Samuel J. Tilden]] electors in all cases, but the Republican majority prevailed in all the votes, and Thurman's 1867 gubernatorial opponent, Rutherford B. Hayes (who had returned to the governorship by defeating Thurman's uncle), became president. (One of the House of Representatives' members of the Commission, fellow Ohioan [[James Garfield]], was to become the president [[U.S. presidential election, 1880|four years later]], after being chosen by the now-Republican Ohio legislature to succeed Thurman. Both men were lifelong friends.)

&quot;To look at Thurman one would suppose that his favorite reading was &quot;Foxe's Book of the Martyrs' and &quot;Baxter's Saints' Rest,'&quot; a reporter wrote, &quot;for Thurman's face certainly carries a heavier pressure of solemnity to the square inch than any face I ever saw.&quot;  In fact, he was a wide reader, fond of Voltaire, Chateaubriand, Renan, and the lighter French novels, and colleagues admitted him the best French scholar in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati Enquirer, December 18, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; He had picked up French from one Monsieur Gregoire, a tutor in his childhood, and in retirement continued reading French novels in the original language.

In the Senate, Thurman served on the Judiciary Committee, becoming its chairman when the Democrats won control of the Senate in the 46th Congress. He also became [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] briefly, serving as president of the Senate because of the illness of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[William A. Wheeler]], before Ohio chose a Republican legislature, which would not reelect Thurman. They first chose Garfield, but on his election to the Presidency, selected [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] to succeed Thurman beginning in 1881. Garfield did appoint Thurman as American representative to the international monetary conference in Paris, a selection that Republican senators welcomed: they regretted his departure from among them. It was noted that in twelve years in the chamber, he had never had an angry word with any colleague, and noted, too, that he left the Senate as poor as he had come to it.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, April 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate for Vice President===
Thurman spent his retirement reading French novels in the original language, playing whist, and amusing himself with mathematical problems; he had a reputation as one of the best mathematicians in Ohio. He was put forth as a [[favorite son]] candidate in the Democratic presidential nominating conventions in 1880 and 1884. In 1888, he was selected as President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s [[running mate]], because Vice President [[Thomas Hendricks]] had died in office in November 1885. Democrats turned his red bandana handkerchief into an emblem of the campaign, tying red bandanas to the top of canes in political parades, and manufacturing bandanas with the candidates' faces on them.  Thurman's appeal came from his popularity among old-line Democrats, distrustful of Grover Cleveland's liberalism, and his known hostility to railroad monopolists.  All the same, Thurman, who had retired from active politics, could not put on an active campaign, and added little to the ticket's chances.

When Cleveland was renominated for his successful re-election to the presidency in 1892, Thurman was not again Cleveland's running mate as Adlai E. Stevenson was instead selected. Vice President [[Levi P. Morton]] was also dropped by President [[Benjamin Harrison]] on the Republican ticket. Thus, neither Thurman nor Morton were on their party's respective tickets for the Harrison-Cleveland rematch.

Thurman died at home in Columbus and is buried at [[Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio|Green Lawn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=v9MBIctdjjkC&amp;pg=PA2045&amp;lpg=PA2045&amp;dq=allan+thurman+green+lawn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5aVuR0c96G&amp;sig=ACfU3U2guPLjHVhOJtKEpUHqVo5mVvoNQw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjs09GhkprlAhUUP30KHQITDI4Q6AEwD3oECAgQAQ ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress'']&lt;/ref&gt;

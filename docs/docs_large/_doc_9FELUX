In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! (Beyond Good and Evil, §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
{{Also|Moral emotions}}

Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions &quot;The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], faith, [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

In the [[Taoism|Taoist]] traditions, emotions have been used as the excessive or deficient branch of its root virtue, through the study of the [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Wuxing]] (five elements). It has been said, Correct Actions lead to virtues intention, as Virtuous intentions lead to Correct Actions.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is &quot;that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it.&quot; The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is &quot;the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' &quot;[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]&quot;, pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of &quot;[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having &quot;a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36–39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' – in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more &quot;modern&quot; virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues – but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

Within the Chinese [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Wuxing]] philosophy and [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine]] vice and virture are expressed as excess or deficiency.

'''Pope Leo XII''' (2 August 1760&amp;nbsp;– 10 February 1829), born '''Annibale Francesco Clemente Melchiorre Girolamo Nicola della Genga'''{{efn|English: '''Hannibal Francis Clement Melchior Jerome Nicholas della Genga'''}} ({{pronunciation|Pope_Leo_XII_Name_Pronounciation.ogg}}), was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 28 September 1823 to his death in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;For the correct biographical information, date and place of birth and surname, see Ph. Boutry, ''Souverain et Pontife. Recherche prosographiques sur la Curie romaine à l'age de la Restauration (1814-1846)'', Roma, Ecole francaise, 2002. pp. 359-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XII was in ill health from the time of his election to the papacy to his death less than 6 years later, although he was noted for enduring pain well. He was a deeply conservative ruler, who enforced many controversial laws, including one forbidding Jews to own property. Papal finances were also poor, even though he reduced taxes. As a result, Leo XII's reign was unpopular and provoked widespread discontent within the Papal States.

As a young prelate he was suspected of having had a liaison with the wife of a soldier of Swiss Guard, and as [[nuncio]] in Germany he allegedly fathered three illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from Rome'' in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=LUU5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=Della+Genga+mistress&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-W3BVLucGaLXyQPIhYDoAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Della%20Genga%20children&amp;f=false The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal, Tom 11], pp. 468–471.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family===
Della Genga was born in 1760, at the Castello della Genga in the territory of [[Fabriano]],&lt;ref name=Toke&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09167a.htm Toke, Leslie. &quot;Pope Leo XII.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; to a noble family from [[Genga, Italy|Genga]],&lt;ref&gt;The town is now simply [[Genga, Italy|Genga]].&lt;/ref&gt; a small town in what is now [[Province of Ancona|the province of Ancona]], then part of the [[Papal States]] as the sixth of ten children to Ilario della Genga and Maria Luisa Periberti di Fabriano. He was the uncle of [[Gabriele della Genga Sermattei]], who in the 19th century was the only [[cardinal-nephew|nephew]] of a pope to be elevated to cardinal.

===Education and ordination===
Della Genga studied theology at the Collegio Campana in [[Osimo]] from 1773 to 1778 and later at the Collegio Piceno in Rome until 1783 when he commenced studies at the [[Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles]]. He later received the [[subdiaconate]] in 1782 and then the [[diaconate]] and was ordained to the [[priesthood]] on 14 June 1783;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omiworld.org/lemma/leo-xii-pope-1823-1829/ Yvon Beaudoin, o.m.i., Yvon. &quot;Leo XII, Pope from 1823 to 1829&quot;, ''OMI World'']&lt;/ref&gt; he received the latter two from Cardinal [[Marcantonio Colonna (18th-century cardinal)|Marcantonio Colonna]].

===Papal nuncio and episcopate===
He served as nuncio to [[Switzerland]]. In 1790 the attractive and articulate della Genga attracted favourable attention by a tactful oration commemorative of the late Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1794 [[Pope Pius VI]] made him a canon of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]],&lt;ref name=Toke/&gt; and in 1793 created him Titular [[Archbishop of Tyre]]. He was consecrated in Rome in 1794 after the appointment and was despatched to [[Lucerne]] as the [[Apostolic Nuncio]]. In 1794 he was transferred to the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne|nunciature at Cologne]], but owing to the [[War of the First Coalition|war]] had to make his residence in [[Augsburg]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; At this time, he believed it would be his last post and organized the construction of tombs for his mother and for himself.

During the dozen or more years he spent in Germany he was entrusted with several honourable and difficult missions, which brought him into contact with the courts of [[Dresden]], Vienna, [[Munich]] and [[Württemberg]], as well as with [[Napoleon I of France]]. It is charged, however, that during this period his finances were disordered, and his private life was not above suspicion.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He was suspected of having allegedly fathered three illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from Rome'' in: [https://books.google.com/books?id=LUU5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=Della+Genga+mistress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-W3BVLucGaLXyQPIhYDoAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Della%20Genga%20children&amp;f=false The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal, Tom 11], pp. 468–471.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Napoleonic abolition of the [[Papal States|States of the Church]] (1798), he lived for some years at Monticelli Abbey, solacing himself with music and with bird-shooting, pastimes which he continued even after his election as Pope.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Cardinal===
[[File:Grand Gala Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|380px|&quot;The Grand Gala Berlin&quot; is luxury carriage constructed in Rome during the first half of the nineteenth century, is an order of the States of the Church during the reign of two pontiffs: Leo XII, in the years 1824–1826, and [[Gregory XVI]], who requested some important modifications. The carriage was used for five solemn festive occasions in the year.]]
In 1814 della Genga was chosen to carry [[Pope Pius VII]]'s congratulations to [[Louis XVIII of France]] upon his restoration.

On 8 March 1816 he was created [[Santa Maria in Trastevere|Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and he received his red zucchetto on 11 March and his titular church on 29 April 1816. Later he was appointed as the Archpriest of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], and appointed to the [[episcopal see of Sinigaglia]], which he resigned in 1818&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; due to health reasons. He resigned without ever having entered his diocese.&lt;ref name=Toke/&gt;

On 9 May 1820, [[Pope Pius VII]] gave him the distinguished post of [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar-General of His Holiness for the Diocese of Rome]].&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1816.htm#Genga Miranda, Salvador. &quot;Della Genga, Annibale&quot;, ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal election===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 1823}}
Pope Pius VII died in 1823 after yet another long pontificate that spanned over two decades. In the [[Papal conclave, 1823|conclave of 1823]], della Genga was the candidate of the [[zelanti]] faction and in spite of the active opposition of France, he was elected as the new pope by the cardinals on 28 September 1823, taking the name of Leo XII.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

His election had been facilitated because he was thought to be close to death, but he unexpectedly rallied.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He had even remarked about his own health to the cardinals, saying that they would be electing &quot;a dead man&quot;.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; It was said in the conclave that he lifted his robes to show the cardinals a pair of swollen and ulcerated legs to deter them, but that made them even more eager to elect him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pickle Publishing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/triple-crown-leo-xii.htm|title=Pope Leo XII: Proceedings of the Conclave that led to his election.|publisher=Pickle Publishing|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo XII was 63 at the time of his election and frequently fell victim to infirmities. He was tall and thin with an ascetic look and a melancholic countenance. He fell ill after his coronation but after his recovery, he showed surprising endurance in carrying out his work. Leo XII devoted himself to his work and was simple in his mode of life. He had a passion for shooting birds and was rumored to have killed a peasant with whom he argued about sporting rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pickle Publishing&quot;/&gt;

The cardinal protodeacon [[Fabrizio Ruffo]] crowned him as pontiff on 5 October 1823.

===Foreign policy===
Pius VII's Secretary of State, [[Ercole Consalvi]], who had been Della Genga's rival in the conclave, was immediately dismissed, and Pius'  policies rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Francis A. Burkle-Young, ''Papal Elections in the Age of Transition, 1878–1922'', 2000:22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Leo XII's foreign policy, entrusted at first to the octogenarian [[Giulio Maria della Somaglia]] and then to the more able [[Tommaso Bernetti]], negotiated certain [[concordat]]s very advantageous to the papacy. Personally most frugal, Leo XII reduced taxes, made justice less costly, and was able to find money for certain public improvements, yet he left the Church's finances more confused than he had found them, and even the elaborate [[jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] of 1825 did not really mend financial matters.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Image:Schedrin NewRome.jpg|thumb|left|The Tiber with [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]] e St. Peter in the time of Leo XII, by [[Sylvester Shchedrin|Silvestr Feodosievich Shchedrin]]]]

===Domestic policy===
Leo XII's domestic policy was one of extreme conservatism: &quot;He was determined to change the condition of society, bringing it back to the utmost of his power to the old usages and ordinances, which he deemed to be admirable; and he pursued that object with never flagging zeal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Luigi Carlo Farini]], ''Lo stato Romano, dell'anno 1815 a 1850'', (Turin, 1850) vol. I, p. 17, quoted by Thomas Adolphus Trollope, ''The Story of the Life of Pius the Ninth'' vol. I (1877:39f)&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the Bible societies, and under [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence reorganised the educational system,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; placing it entirely under priestly control through his bull ''[[Quod divina sapientia]]'' and requiring that all secondary instruction be carried out in Latin, as he required of all court proceedings, also now entirely in ecclesiastical hands. All charitable institutions in the Papal States were put under direct supervision.

Laws such as that forbidding Jews to own property and allowing them only the shortest possible time in which to sell what they owned, and that requiring all Roman residents to listen to Catholic catechism commentary, led many of Rome's Jews to emigrate, to [[Trieste]], Lombardy and [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Farini, ''eo. loc.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/triple-crown-leo-xii.htm |title=Valérie Pirie, ''The Triple Crown: An Account of the Papal Conclaves'' |publisher=Pickle-publishing.com |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The results of his method of governing his states soon showed themselves in insurrections, conspiracies, assassinations and rebellion, especially in Umbria, the Marches and Romagna; the violent repression of which, by a system of espionage, secret denunciation, and wholesale application of the gibbet and the galleys, left behind it to those who were to come afterwards a very terrible, rankling and long-enduring debt of party hatreds, of political and social demoralisation, and— worst of all— a contempt for and enmity to the law, as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trollope, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In a regime that saw the division of the population into [[Carbonari]] and [[Sanfedisti]], he hunted down the Carbonari and the [[freemasonry|Freemasons]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Leo (popes)/Leo XII|volume=16|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their liberal sympathisers.

===Vaccination controversy===
According to some contemporary authors such as G. S. Godkin, Leo XII was also said to have prohibited [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;Godkin, G. S. (1880). Life of Victor Emmanuel II. Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship has been unable to find any ban or any suggestion of a ban by Leo XII and his administration. Donald J. Keefe in his paper &quot;Tracking the footnote&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Keefe, &quot;Tracking the footnote&quot;, [http://www.catholicscholars.org/PDFFiles/v9n4sep1986.pdf Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Newsletter, Volume 9, Number 4, September 1986] p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; traced a quote by Leo XII which strongly condemned vaccination to &quot;an unverified citation&quot; by Dr. Pierre Simon in Le Contredes Naissances. The response of the Papacy to the arrival of vaccination in Italy has been documented in ''Pratique de la vaccination antivariolique dans les provinces de l’État pontifical au 19ème siècle'', an article written by [[Yves-Marie Bercé]] and Jean-Claude Otteni for Revue d’Histoire Ecclésiastique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhe.eu.com/material/Pagesdeberce.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203052417/http://www.rhe.eu.com/material/Pagesdeberce.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yves-Marie Bercé|Bercé]] and Otteni, the biographers and contemporaries of Leo XII do not mention any interdict. The authors credit the origin of the mythical vaccination ban of Leo XII to the personality of Cardinal Della Genga when he became pope in 1823. His intransigence and piety alienated liberal opinion very quickly. His austere spirituality made him the target of criticisms and mocking remarks. English travelers visiting the peninsula and many of the diplomats established in Rome remarked on the severity of the pontiff.

The absence of a prohibition is evidenced by the fact that in 1828 the Medical-Surgical Society of Bologna was able to implement a vaccination campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://badigit.comune.bologna.it/books/sol/103243_INV.pdf|title=Risultamenti ottenuti dalla Società medico-chirurgica di Bologna per la inoculazione del vaccino praticata nell'anno 1828|last=Argelati|first=Giacomo|publisher=|year=1829|isbn=|location=Bologna|pages=|trans-title=Results obtained by the Medical-Surgical Society of Bologna on the inoculation of the vaccine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

, [[Alonso Rodriguez]] and James Grissinger. He beatified [[Imelda Lambertini]] (20 December 1826) and also confirmed the cultus of [[Jordan of Saxony]] in 1826. He also beatified Helen of Poland and [[Maddalena Panattieri]] on 26 September 1827 as well as Giovanna Soderini (1827) and Helen Duglioli and [[Juana de Aza]] (the mother of [[Saint Dominic]]) in 1828. Leo XII also created [[Peter Damian]] a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1828 in addition to the formal canonization he presided over.

He collaborated with [[Vincent Strambi]] – future saint – who served as his advisor. When he was on the brink of death in 1825, Strambi offered himself to God for the survival of the pope. The pope rallied from his ailment, but Strambi died.

The pope also approved the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] on 17 February 1826 when he gave it official recognition.

He held 8 [[Papal consistory|consistories]] in which he elevated 25 new cardinals into the cardinalate. This included Cardinal Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari – the future Pope Gregory XVI – on 13 March 1826.

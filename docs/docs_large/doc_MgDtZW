[[File:Men sowing   seed (3465701854).jpg|thumb|Men sowing seed by hand in the 1940s]]
'''Sowing''' is the process of planting. An area or object that has had seeds planted in it will be described as a  '''sowed''' area.

[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|Traditional Sowing Methods]]

==Plants which are usually sown==
Among the major field crops, [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], and [[rye]] are sown, grasses and legumes are seeded and [[maize]] and [[soybean]]s are planted.  In planting, wider rows (generally 75&amp;nbsp; cm (30&amp;nbsp; in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have precise; even spacing between individual seeds in the row, various mechanisms have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.

===Depth of sowing ===
[[Image:Between corn rows.png|thumb|Regular rows of [[maize|corn]] in a field in Indiana]]

In sowing, little if any soil is placed over the seeds, as seeds can be generally sown into the soil by maintaining a planting depth of about 2-3 times the size of the seed.

===Sowing types and patterns===
For hand sowing, several sowing types exist; these include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4549495|title=Beds or flat-planting for southern wheat crops|first=Farhad|last=Nabin|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flat sowing
* Ridge sowing
* Wide bed sowing

Several patterns for sowing may be used together with these types; these include:
* Regular rows
* Rows that are indented at the even rows (so that the seeds are
* Symmetrical grid pattern – using the pattern described in [[The Garden of Cyrus]] placed in a crossed pattern). This method is much better, as more light may fall on the seedlings as they come out.

==Types of sowing==

===Hand sowing===
'''Hand sowing''' or (planting) is the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground, or broadcasting (from which the [[broadcasting|technological term]] is derived{{fact|date=April 2016}}). Usually, a drag or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though [[Labor intensity|labor-intensive]] for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[Fabaceae|legumes]].

[[Image:Horticulture Tray3.jpg|thumb|A tray used in [[horticulture]] (for sowing and taking plant cuttings)]]
Hand sowing may be combined with pre-sowing in [[seed tray]]s. This allows the plants to come to strength indoors during cold periods (e.g. spring in temperate countries).

In [[agriculture]], most seed is now sown using a [[seed drill]], which offers greater precision; seed is sown evenly and at the desired rate. The drill also places the seed at a measured distance below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system, which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm apart, depending on the [[crop]] species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on [[soil type]] and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by [[tractor]]s, but can also be pulled by [[horse]]s. [[Pickup truck]]s are sometimes used, since little draft is required.

A seed rate of about 100&amp;nbsp;kg of seed per hectare (2 bushels per acre) is typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil conditions, and farmer's preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to lodge, while too thin a rate will result in poor utilisation of the land, competition with [[weed]]s and a reduction in the [[Crop yield|yield]].

===Open field===
{{Main|Open field system}}
'''Open-field planting''' refers to the form of sowing used historically in the agricultural context whereby [[field (agriculture)|fields]] are prepared generically and left open, as the name suggests, before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently left uncovered at the surface of the soil before germinating and therefore exposed to the prevailing [[climate]] and conditions like storms etc. This is in contrast to the [[seedbed]] method used more commonly in domestic [[gardening]] or more specific (modern) agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the soil surface and monitored and manually tended frequently to ensure more successful growth rates and better yields.

===Pre-treatment of seed and soil before sowing===
[[Image:GrowingAvocadoFromSeed.JPG|thumb|Tropical fruit such as [[avocado]] also benefit from special seed treatments (specifically invented for that particular tropical fruit)]]

Before sowing, certain seeds first require a treatment prior to the sowing process.
This treatment may be seed scarification, [[stratification (botany)|stratification]], seed soaking or seed cleaning with cold (or medium hot) water.

Seed soaking is generally done by placing seeds in medium hot water for at least 24 to up to 48 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ernestina|last=Parziale |url=http://earthnotes.tripod.com/seeds.htm |title=Pre-sowing treatments of seed |publisher=Earthnotes.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seed cleaning is done especially with fruit, as the flesh of the fruit around the seed can quickly become prone to attack from insects or plagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprashu.html Sprout safety: how to combat contamination of seed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114753/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprashu.html |date=2008-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed washing is generally done by submerging cleansed seeds 20 minutes in 50 [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] water.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Exotische vruchten kweken by Dr Gabriele Lehari&lt;/ref&gt; This (rather hot than moderately hot) water kills any organisms that may have survived on the skin of a seed. Especially with easily infected [[tropical fruit]] such as [[lychee]]s and [[rambutan]]s, seed washing with high-temperature water is vital.

In addition to the mentioned seed pretreatments, [[seed germination]] is also assisted when a disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil (along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. [[potting soil]], prepared soil or other [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]s) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are [[pasteurisation]] and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]]. Depending on the necessity, pasteurisation is to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To pasteurise the soil, the soil is heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

{{short description|Historically popular and economical gauge of film}}
'''16&amp;nbsp;mm film''' is a historically popular and economical [[film gauge|gauge]] of [[Photographic film|film]]. 16&amp;nbsp;mm refers to the width of the film; other common film gauges include [[8 mm film|8]] and [[35mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]]. It is generally used for non-theatrical (e.g., industrial, educational) film-making, or for low-budget motion pictures. It also existed as a popular amateur or home movie-making format for several decades, alongside 8&amp;nbsp;mm film and later [[Super 8 film]]. [[Kodak|Eastman Kodak]] released the first 16&amp;nbsp;mm &quot;outfit&quot; in 1923, consisting of a camera, projector, tripod, screen and splicer, for [[United States dollar|$]]335.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kattelle |first1=Alan |title=Home Movies: A History of the American Industry, 1897–1979 |date=2000 |publisher=Transition Publishing |isbn=0-9654497-8-5 |page=334 |ref=Kattelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RCA Records|RCA-Victor]] introduced a 16&amp;nbsp;mm sound movie projector in 1932, and developed an optical [[sound-on-film]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm camera, released in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kattelle |first1=Alan |title=Home Movies: A History of the American Industry, 1897–1979 |date=2000 |publisher=Transition Publishing |isbn=0-9654497-8-5 |page=231 |ref=Kattelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USN16mmSoundtrack.jpg|right|thumb|16&amp;nbsp;mm sound movie showing a variable width sound track on single perforation film stock]]

== History ==
Eastman Kodak introduced 16&amp;nbsp;mm film in 1923, as a less expensive alternative to [[35mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[film formats|film]] for amateurs. During the 1920s, the format was often referred to as sub-standard by the professional industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivesfilmworks.com/uploads/1/2/5/3/12531554/16mm_format_history_v2.pdf|title=16mm Format History|last=Eisloeffel|first=Paul|date=2013|website=Archives Filmworks|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodak hired Willard Beech Cook from his [[28 mm film|28 mm]] Pathescope of America company to create the new 16&amp;nbsp;mm 'Kodascope Library'. In addition to making [[home movies]], people could buy or rent films from the library, a key selling aspect of the format.

Intended for amateur use, 16&amp;nbsp;mm film was one of the first formats to use [[acetate]] [[safety film]] as a [[film base]]. Kodak never used [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] for the format, owing to the high flammability of the nitrate base. 35&amp;nbsp;mm nitrate was discontinued in 1952.

[[File:Paris_1939.jpg|thumb|16 mm Eastman Kodak color movie from Paris dated 1939.]]

=== Production evolution ===
The silent 16&amp;nbsp;mm format was initially aimed at the home enthusiast, but by the 1930s it had begun to make inroads into the educational market. The addition of [[Sound-on-film|optical sound]] tracks and, most notably, Kodachrome in 1935, gave an enormous boost to its popularity. The format was used extensively during [[World War II]], and there was a huge expansion of 16&amp;nbsp;mm professional filmmaking in the post-war years. Films for government, business, medical and industrial clients created a large network of 16&amp;nbsp;mm professional filmmakers and related service industries in the 1950s and 1960s. The advent of [[television production]] also enhanced the use of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film, initially for its advantage of cost and portability over 35&amp;nbsp;mm. At first used as a news-gathering format, the 16&amp;nbsp;mm format was also used to create [[television program]]ming shot outside the confines of the more rigid [[television studio]] production sets. The home movie market gradually switched to the even less expensive [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[Super 8&amp;nbsp;mm film|Super 8 mm]] film formats.

16&amp;nbsp;mm, using light cameras, was extensively used for [[television production]] in many countries before portable video cameras appeared. In Britain, the BBC's Ealing-based film department made significant use of 16mm film and, during its peak, employed over 50 film crews. Throughout much of the 1960s-1990s period, these crews made use of cameras such as the Arriflex SP and Eclair NPR in combination with quarter-inch sound recorders, such as the Nagra III. Using these tools, film department crews would work on some of the most significant programmes produced by the BBC, including ''[[Man Alive (UK TV series)|Man Alive]]'', ''[[Panorama (TV programme)|Panorama]]'' and ''[[Chronicle (UK TV programme)|Chronicle]]''. Usually made up of five people, these small crews were able to work incredibly efficiently and, even in hostile environments, were able to shoot an entire programme with a filming ratio of less than 5:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=John |first=Ellis |last2=Nick |first2=Hall |date=2017-11-09 |title=ADAPT |journal=Figshare |language=en-US |doi=10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing [[analog video]] devices, [[digital video]] has made significant inroads in television production use. Nevertheless, 16&amp;nbsp;mm is still in use in its Super 16 ratio (see below) for low-cost productions.

== Format standards ==
=== Perforations ===
Two [[Film perforations|perforation]] pitches are available for 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. One specification, known as &quot;long pitch&quot;, has a spacing of {{convert|7.62|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is used primarily for print and reversal film stocks. Negative and intermediate film stocks have perforations spaced {{convert|7.605|mm|in|abbr=on}}, known as &quot;short pitch&quot;. These differences allow for the sharpest and smoothest possible image when making prints using a [[contact printer]].

Film stocks are available in either 'single-perf' or 'double-perf', meaning the film is perforated on either one or both edges. A perforation for 16&amp;nbsp;mm film is {{convert|1.829|x|1.27|mm|in|abbr=on}} with a radius curve on all four corners of {{convert|0.25|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Tolerances are ±{{convert|0.001|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;kodak-spec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/KodakGCG/uploadedfiles/motion/US_plugins_acrobat_en_motion_newsletters_filmEss_11_Film_Specs.pdf|title=Film specifications|publisher=[[Kodak]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326135944/http://www.kodak.com/KodakGCG/uploadedfiles/motion/US_plugins_acrobat_en_motion_newsletters_filmEss_11_Film_Specs.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-26|access-date=2019-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kodak-h20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kodak.com/KodakGCG/uploadedfiles/motion/H20_2pgs.pdf|title=How to Read a Kodak Film Can Label|year=2014|publisher=[[Kodak]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323195922/http://www.kodak.com/KodakGCG/uploadedfiles/motion/H20_2pgs.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-23|access-date=2019-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard 16 mm ===
The picture-taking area of standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm is {{convert|10.26|x|7.49|mm|in|abbr=on}}, an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.37:1, the standard pre-widescreen [[Academy ratio]] for 35&amp;nbsp;mm. The &quot;nominal&quot; picture projection area (per SMPTE RP 20-2003) is 0.380 in by 0.284 in,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.5594/SMPTE.RP20.2003|isbn = 978-1-61482-073-4|title = Specifications for 16-mm Registration Test Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the maximum picture projection area (per SMPTE ST 233-2003) is 0.384 in by 0.286 in,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.5594/SMPTE.ST233.2003|isbn = 978-1-61482-382-7|title = For Motion-Picture Film (16-mm) — Projectable Image Area and Projector Usage}}&lt;/ref&gt; each implying an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.34:1. [[Film perforations|Double-perf]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm film, the original format, has a perforation at both sides of every [[frame line]]. Single-perf is perforated at one side only, making room for an optical or magnetic [[soundtrack]] along the other side.

=== Super 16 mm ===
[[File:16mm and super16.png|thumb|Super 16 and 16&amp;nbsp;mm film.]]
The variant called '''Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm''', '''Super 16''', or '''16&amp;nbsp;mm Type W''' is an adaptation of the 1.66 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the &quot;Paramount format&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20130807235528919 |title=Beyond HD |last=Jones |first=Andy |year=2014 |publisher=[[BBC Academy]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219183402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20130807235528919 |archive-date=2014-12-19 |url-status=dead |access-date=2019-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. It was developed by Swedish cinematographer [[Rune Ericson]] in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdtimes.com/2009/08/20/the-early-years-of-super-16-and-how-it-all-started/|title=The Early Years of Super 16 and How it All Started – Film and Digital Times|date=August 20, 2009|website=Film and Digital Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; using single-sprocket film and taking advantage of the extra room for an expanded picture area of {{convert|12.52|x|7.41|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

Super 16 cameras are usually 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras that have had the film gate and ground glass in the [[viewfinder]] modified for the wider frame, and, since this process widens the frame by affecting only one side of the film, the various cameras' front mounting plate or turret areas must also be re-machined to shift and re-center the mounts for any lenses used. Because the resulting, new, Super 16 aspect-ratio takes up the space originally reserved for the 16mm soundtrack, films shot in this format must be enlarged by [[optical printing]] to [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] for sound-projection, and, in order to preserve the proper 1.66:1, or (slightly cropped) 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratios which this format was designed to provide. And, with the recent development of [[digital intermediate]] workflows, it is now possible to digitally enlarge to a 35&amp;nbsp;mm sound print with virtually no quality loss (given a high quality digital scan), or alternatively to use high-quality video equipment for the original image capture.

In 2009, German lens manufacturer Vantage introduced a series of [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic lenses]] under its HAWK brand. These provided a 1.3× squeeze factor (as opposed to the standard 2×) specifically for the Super 16 format. These lenses let camera operators use the entire Super 16 frame for 2.39:1 widescreen photography.

=== Ultra 16 mm ===
The [[DIY]]-crafted '''Ultra 16''' is a variation of Super 16. Cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco is credited with inventing Ultra 16 in 1996 while shooting tests for [[Pi (film)|Darren Aronofsky's ''Pi'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/frank-demarco-interview/|title=Frank G. DeMarco On Capturing Punk Rock Grit in &quot;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&quot;|last=Gullickson|first=Brad|date=2018-05-29|website=Film School Rejects|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra 16 is created by widening the left and right sides of the gate of a standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm camera by 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm to expose part of the horizontal area between the perforations. Perforation placement on standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm film (on the one side [or, both sides, when using double-perf film] of the divisions between frames) accommodates use of these normally unexposed areas.

The Ultra 16 format, with frame dimensions of {{convert|11.66|x|6.15|mm|in|abbr=on}}, provides a frame size between standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm and Super 16—while avoiding the expense of converting a 16&amp;nbsp;mm camera to Super 16, the larger lens-element requirements for proper aperture field coverage on Super 16 camera conversions, and, the potential image [[vignetting]] caused by trying to use some &quot;conventional&quot; 16&amp;nbsp;mm lenses on those Super 16 converted cameras. Thus, almost all standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm optics can now achieve the wider image in Ultra 16, but without the above pitfalls and optical &quot;shortcomings&quot; encountered when attempting their use for Super 16.

The image readily converts to NTSC/PAL (1.33 ratio), HDTV (1.78 ratio) and to 35&amp;nbsp;mm film (1.66 [European] and 1.85 wide screen ratios), using either the full vertical frame, or the full width (intersprocket) frame, and at times, portions of both, depending upon the required application.

== Modern usage ==

The two major suppliers of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film today{{when|date=August 2016}} are [[Kodak]] and [[Agfa]] ([[Fujifilm|Fuji]] closed its film manufacturing facility on 31 December 2012). 16&amp;nbsp;mm film is used in television, such as for the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' anthology  (it has since been produced in 16:9 [[High-definition video|high definition]]) and ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' and ''[[The O.C.]]'' as well as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' in the US. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the format is exceedingly popular for television series such as ''[[Doc Martin]]'', dramas and commercials. The [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) played a large part in the development of the format. It worked extensively with Kodak during the 1950s and 1960s to bring 16&amp;nbsp;mm to a professional level, since the BBC needed cheaper, more portable production solutions while maintaining a higher quality than was offered at the time, when the format was mostly for home display of theatrical shorts, newsreels, and cartoons, documentary capture and display for various purposes (including education), and limited &quot;high end&quot; amateur use.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiefilmhustle.com/super-16mm-film-tutorial/|title=How to Shoot Super 16mm Film Tutorials |last=Ferrari|first=Alex|date=2016-10-17|website=Indie Film Hustle|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today{{when|date=August 2016}} the format also is frequently used for student films, while usage in documentary has almost disappeared. With the advent of [[HDTV]], Super 16 film is still used for some productions destined for [[High-definition video|HD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Some low-budget theatrical features are shot on 16&amp;nbsp;mm and super 16&amp;nbsp;mm such as [[Kevin Smith]]'s 16&amp;nbsp;mm 1994 independent hit ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]],'' or ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]'', and ''[[Mid90s]]''.

Thanks to advances in film stock and digital technology—specifically [[digital intermediate]] (DI)—the format has dramatically improved in picture quality since the 1970s, and is now a revitalized option. ''[[Vera Drake]]'', for example, was shot on Super 16&amp;nbsp;mm film, digitally scanned at a high resolution, edited and color graded, and then printed out onto 35&amp;nbsp;mm film via a laser [[film recorder]]. Because of the digital process, the final 35&amp;nbsp;mm print quality is good enough to fool some professionals into thinking it was shot on 35&amp;nbsp;mm.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In Britain most exterior television footage was shot on 16&amp;nbsp;mm from the 1960s until the 1990s, when the development of more portable television cameras and videotape machines led to video replacing 16&amp;nbsp;mm in many instances. Many drama shows and documentaries were made entirely on 16&amp;nbsp;mm, notably ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'', ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' and ''[[Life on Earth (documentary)|Life on Earth]]''. More recently, the advent of widescreen television has led to the use of ''Super'' 16. For example, the 2008/09 [[BBC]] fantasy drama series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' was shot in Super 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mill TV Taps Baselight to Work Magic for BBC's 'Merlin'|url=http://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/case_studies/our_customers/03_broadcast/201008_merlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718080146/http://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/case_studies/our_customers/03_broadcast/201008_merlin|archive-date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as 2010, ''[[Scrubs (TV series)#Cinematography and delivery format|Scrubs]]'' was shot on Super16 and aired either as 4:3 SD (first 7 seasons) or as 16:9 HD (seasons 8 and 9). John Inwood, the cinematographer of the series, believed that footage from his [[Aaton]] XTR Prod camera was not only sufficient to air in high definition, it &quot;looked terrific&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd_for_scrubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highdef.com/magazine/archive/HighDef_2008_6NovDec.pdf|title=A new HD frontier for Scrubs|access-date=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three seasons of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (bar the season 3 finale and the effects shots) were shot in 16&amp;nbsp;mm, before switching to 35&amp;nbsp;mm for later seasons.
